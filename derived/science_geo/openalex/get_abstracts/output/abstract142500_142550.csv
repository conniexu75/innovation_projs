https://openalex.org/W2033761616,"Poly(ADP-ribosylation) is a post-translational modification of nuclear proteins in response to DNA damage that activates the base excision repair machinery. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase which we will now call PARP-1, has been the only known enzyme of this type for over 30 years. Here, we describe a cDNA encoding a 62-kDa protein that shares considerable homology with the catalytic domain of PARP-1 and also contains a basic DNA-binding domain. We propose to call this enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP-2). The PARP-2 gene maps to chromosome 14C1 and 14q11.2 in mouse and human, respectively. Purified recombinant mouse PARP-2 is a damaged DNA-binding protein in vitro and catalyzes the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers in a DNA-dependent manner. PARP-2 displays automodification properties similar to PARP-1. The protein is localized in the nucleusin vivo and may account for the residual poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis observed in PARP-1-deficient cells, treated with alkylating agents or hydrogen peroxide.

In response to DNA-strand breaks introduced either directly by ionizing radiation or indirectly following enzymatic incision at a DNA lesion, the immediate poly(ADP-ribosylation) of nuclear proteins converts the DNA ends into intracellular signals that modulate DNA repair and cell survival programs. At the sites of DNA breakage, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MMS, methylmethanesulfonate; EST, expressed sequence tags; FISH, fluorescence in situhybridization; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; wt, wild type; aa, amino acid(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. (EC 2.4.2.30) catalyzes the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety from its substrate NAD+, to a limited number of proteins involved in chromatin architecture, DNA repair, or in DNA metabolism including PARP itself (1Althaus F.R.

An substantial delay in DNA strand-break repair was observed following treatment of PARP-deficient cells with monofunctional alkylating agents (10Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This severe DNA repair defect appears to be the primary cause for the observed cytotoxicity ofN-methyl-N-nitrosourea, methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), or γ-rays leading to cell death occurring after a G2/M block (10Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It was assumed for many years that PARP activity was associated with a single protein displaying unique DNA damage detection and signaling properties. This assumption was challenged by the recent discovery inArabidopsis thaliana of a gene coding for a PARP-related polypeptide of a calculated molecular mass of 72 kDa (11Lepiniec L. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Van Montagu M. Inze D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It then became evident that two structurally different PARP proteins, both possessing DNA-dependent poly(ADP-ribose) activities, were present in both A. thaliana as well as in maize (12Babiychuk E. Cottrill P.B. Storozhenko S. Fuangthong M. Chen Y. O'Farrell M.K. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Kushnir S. Plant J. 1998; 15: 635-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Farrell M.

Kazmaier, personal communication. Furthermore, it has been reported recently that mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from PARP knockout are capable of synthesizing ADP-ribose polymers in response to DNA damage (15Shieh W.M. Amé J.-C. Wilson M.V. Wang Z.-Q. Koh D.W. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), suggesting that in mammals, like in plants, at least one additional member of the PARP family may exist in addition to the classical zinc finger containing PARP. This work describes the cloning of a human and a murine cDNA coding for a new member of the PARP family, based on its similarity with theA. thaliana 72-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (12Babiychuk E. Cottrill P.B. Storozhenko S. Fuangthong M. Chen Y. O'Farrell M.K. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Kushnir S. Plant J. 1998; 15: 635-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which those authors named APP. We denote this new protein PARP-2, to differentiate from the classical PARP protein renamed PARP-1. We demonstrate that PARP-2 is a nuclear DNA-dependent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase catalyzing the formation of ADP-ribose polymers in the presence of damaged DNA, thus suggesting a biological role in the cellular response to DNA damage. To determine poly(ADP-ribose) synthesizing activity in cells extracts, equal amounts of protein from various cell extracts were incubated in standard conditions with 200 μm[α-32P]NAD+ (30.0 nCi/nmol), 2 μg/ml histones, and 10 μg/ml DNA activated by DNase I at 25 °C for 10 min. Activity is expressed as the ratio between the radioactivity of the acid insoluble material produced by PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1−/− cell extracts. Sequence analyses were performed using the GCG sequence analysis package (Wisconsin package version 8.1, Genetic Computer Group, Madison, WI). The primary sequence of the A. thalianaPARP homologue (APP, GenBank 228 accession number Z48243) was used to search the complete EST data base (release 107/55 of GenBank 228 data base) using TBLASTN of the BLAST program (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Two murine and one human EST (GenBank 228 accession numbers AA608364, AA529426, and AA595596, respectively) encoding APP homologues but distinct from the classical PARP-1 of 113 kDa were chosen and purchased from the IMAGE consortium (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). EST clone number AA529426contained the cDNA (1.2 kilobase) encoding the catalytic domain of mouse PARP-2 (aa 199–559) in the pCMV SPORT vector (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). In order to express the catalytic domain of PARP-2, aSmaI site and an ATG surrounded by the translation initiation sequence (17Kozac M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) of PARP-1 (18Jung S. Miranda E.A. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Delarue M. Schulz G.E. de Murcia G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were created by PCR, using the sense primer AGGCCCCGGGGGGAGGATGGCGACTTTGAAGCCTGAGTCTCAG and the reverse primer CCAGCAAGGTCATAGTATAGTCC. The PCR fragment (550 bp) was restricted with SmaI-AccI, and used to replace the wild type sequence in clone AA529426. The entire catalytic fragment (homologous to domain F in Fig. 3) was thereafter excised withSmaI-NotI and cloned in the baculovirus recombination vector pVL 1393, giving pVL-mPARP-2-F. In order to generate a full-length mPARP-2 cDNA, aSalI-NotI fragment of AA529426 was used to screen a random-primed λ ZAP II cDNA library (kindly provided by J. M. Garnier, IGBMC, Illkirch, France) established from 10-day-old mouse embryos. One of the positive clones selected contained part of the murine PARP-2 cDNA, starting 45 bp upstream of the ATG and encoded aa 1 to 527 of the protein. In order to obtain good expression in the baculovirus expression system, the region around the ATG was replaced. A SmaI site and an ATG surrounded by the translation initiation sequence of PARP-1 were introduced by PCR. The primers used were, sense primer: AGGCCCCGGGGGGAGGATGGCGCCGCGGCGGCAGAGATCAGGCTCTGG, reverse primer: ATCATCATTTCTTCCATGG. After purification, the PCR product (712 bp) was restricted by SmaI-NcoI and cloned in pVL-mPARP-2-F, to generate the full-length mPARP-2 baculovirus recombination vector pVL-mPARP-2 vector. The amplified fragments were sequenced to ensure that no mutation has been introduced by the PCR. A human PARP-2 EST clone was identified in the LifeSeqTMdata base of Incyte Pharmaceuticals using the human PARP-1 sequence for a data base search. The clone (2286233) was ordered and analyzed. It started 608 bp downstream of the start codon and ended 130 bp downstream of the stop codon. A digoxigenin-labeled probe (digoxigenin labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) derived from this clone was used to screen a human total brain cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Several overlapping positive clones were isolated and sequenced. One of them had an insert length of 857 bp starting 2 nucleotides upstream of the start codon and covering 855 bp of the human PARP-2 open reading frame. These clones were used to construct a full-length human PARP-2 cDNA. Human chromosomes were prepared from human peripheral blood lymphocytes immediately after incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Mouse chromosomes were prepared from normal mouse fibroblast cultures. The mousePARP-1 gene was identified with a 5-kilobase clone (of the mouse PARP-1 gene), which was labeled by nick-translation with biotin-11-dUTP (Sigma, France). The PARP-2 gene was identified in the mouse by a probe biotinylated by PCR consisting of the full-length gene; and in the human by a 1.3-kilobase clone of human PARP-2 cDNA, namely, EST AA595596, which was labeled by nick-translation with biotin-11-dUTP (Sigma, France). A standard hybridization procedure was used as described previously (19Apiou F. Flagiello D. Cillo C. Malfoy B. Poupon M.F. Dutrillaux B. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 73: 114-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The mouse PARP-1 probe was used at a concentration of 15 ng/ml in the presence of a 100-fold excess of mouse Cot-1 DNA; the human PARP-2 probe was used at a concentration of 20 ng/ml and the PCR probe of mouse PARP-2 at a concentration of 1 ng/ml in presence of 600-fold excess of mouse Cot-1 DNA, in 15 ml of hybridization buffer for each slide. Direct banding of bromodeoxyuridine-substituted human chromosomes was obtained by incubation in an alkaline solution ofp-phenylenediamine (PPD11) (20Lemieux N. Dutrillaux B. Viegas-Pequignot E. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 59: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and staining with propidium iodide. Mouse chromosomes were stained with DAPI and identified by computer-generated reverse DAPI banding. Immunochemical detection of hybridization was performed using goat anti-biotin antibodies (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and rabbit FITC-conjugated anti-goat antibodies (Biosys, Compiègne, France). Metaphases were observed under a fluorescent microscope (DMRB, Leica, Germany). Images were captured using a cooled photometrics CCD camera and Quips-smart capture software (Vysis). Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified from PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1−/− 3T3 cells using the messenger RNA isolation kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Total mouse tissues RNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Two micrograms of poly(A)+ mRNA and 10 μg of total RNA were fractionated on 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham). The murine PARP-2 probe corresponded to the 800-bp internal EcoRI fragment. The blot was hybridized for 16 h with probe labeled by the random priming method (1 × 106 cpm/ml) (21Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar) in ExpressHyb mixture (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), washed, and autoradiographed at −80 °C for 48 h. Two rabbits were immunized by intramuscular injections of 200 μg of purified mPARP-2 catalytic domain (aa 204–559) in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant for the first inoculation (day 0) and incomplete Freund's adjuvant for subsequent inoculations on days 15, 30, 45, and 60. The rabbits were bled every fortnight until week 14, beginning a week after the second injection. This antibody named YUC, raised against the PARP-2 catalytic domain, recognizes both human and murine PARP-2, but not PARP-1. Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (3T3 cells) derived from PARP-1−/− and PARP-1+/+ mice (5Ménissier-de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) and HeLa cells were grown on coverslips. For PARP activity experiments, cells were exposed either to 1 mm hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) for 10 min or 1 mmMMS (Aldrich) for 30 min and fixed with methanol/acetone (1/1, v/v) for 10 min at 4 °C and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Tween 0.1% (v/v). Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antibody (H10) (1:200 dilution) or with the anti-PARP-2 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution). After washing, the cells were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with a 1:400 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse or Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum. Immunofluorescence was evaluated using a Zeiss Axioplan equipped with a C5985 chilled CCD camera (Hamamatsu). A 180-bp EcoRI-EcoRI fragment corresponding to aa 1–69 of mouse PARP-2, and named mouse Nter-PARP-2, was generated by PCR from pVL-mPARP-2-F with the 5′-oligonucleotide GGATCCCGGGAATTCGGATGGCGCCGCGGCGGC and the 3′-oligonucleotide GGCTTTGCCCGAATTCTTTAACAGCAAGGTCT and cloned either into pGEX-2T expression vector or into pEGFP-C3 in-frame with the GST or GFP reading frame, respectively. The GST fusion protein was overexpressed and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. The pEGFP-Nter-PARP-2 construction was used to transfect HeLa cells, and transient expression of the GFP-Nter-PARP-2 fusion was monitored by fluorescence microscopy, 24–48 h after transfection. pVL PARP-2 and the Baculogold 228 linearized baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) were co-transfected into Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell propagation and protein production was performed as described previously (22Miranda E.A. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1997; 30: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by Western blot with the polyclonal antibody against PARP-2 (1:2000 dilution). Purification of PARP-2 was performed as described previously (23Giner H. Simonin F. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for the purification of chicken PARP-1 catalytic domain with some modifications. Briefly, the cell pellet (1.5 × 109 cells) was homogenized in 75 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mNaCl and an anti-protease mixture (complete 228, Mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After sonication, (1 min at 30% of the maximum output using a Branson SONIFIER large probe), the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 90 min. After precipitation with protamine sulfate (1 mg/ml), and clarification by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 25 min, the proteins precipitating at 35% ammonium sulfate saturation were eliminated by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min). Further ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 70% saturation and the pellet was collected after a 20-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g. The proteins were resuspended in 150 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing the antiprotease mixture. This sample was subjected to a 3-aminobenzamide Affi-Gel 10 column chromatography. The elution was performed with 3-methoxybenzamide and fractions containing the polypeptide were concentrated on an ultrafiltration membrane Diaflo YM30 (Amicon, Inc.). A sample of each step of the purification was stored for further analysis on SDS-PAGE and quantification of proteins by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Immunoblots and Southwestern blot were carried out as described previously (25Mazen A. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Molinete M. Simonin F. Gradwohl G. Poirier G. de Murcia G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4689-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The number of PARP-2 molecules per cell was estimated in a Western blot experiment by comparing the intensity of the immunoreaction of anti-PARP-2 antibody on PARP-2 (YUC) from 400,000 HeLa cells with increasing amounts of purified PARP-2. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in assay buffer (100 μl) consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, with or without 200 ng of calf thymus DNA previously treated with DNase I and 400 μm[α-32P]NAD+ (100 nCi/nmol). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 1% (w/v) inorganic phosphate, and the acid-insoluble radioactivity was washed 3 times in the same solution and once in 95% EtOH and the radioactivity was measured. The stimulation of PARP activity by DNA treated with DNase I was expressed as the ratio of the activity of PARP with activated DNA to the activity of PARP without DNA. 800 ng of purified PARP-2 was incubated with 200 ng of calf thymus DNA previously treated with DNase I or without DNA, in 100 μl containing 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 800 nm[α-32P]NAD+ (100 nCi/nmol) (26Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the indicated time of incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped with ice-cold acetone (80% v/v) and incubated for 30 min at −20 °C. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C, washed once with 100% acetone, once with water-saturated ether, and dried. The pellet was resolubilized in 50 μl of 1 × Laemmli buffer and analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and autoradiographed on Kodak Bio-Max MS film. To analyze the polymer synthesized by either PARP-1 or PARP-2, samples were incubated in a standard enzymatic assay with 400 μm[α-32P]NAD+. Radioactive proteins were treated with 100 mm NaOH, 20 mm EDTA for 1 h at 60 °C (27Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Jacobson M.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3218-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The solution was then neutralized with 100 mm HCl. One volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) was added and remaining traces of phenol/chloroform were extracted from the aqueous layer three times with diethyl ether. The polymer was then precipitated twice with ethanol and the pellets were dissolved in water. The polymer was either analyzed on a sequencing gel or treated with snake venom phosphodiesterase and analyzed by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography according to Keith et al. (28Keith G. Desgres J. de Murcia G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The radioactive spots on the TLC were scraped from the thin layer and32P label was determined by scintillation counting. The average polymer size and the branching frequency were calculated according to Miwa and Sugimura (29Miwa M. Sugimura T. Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1982; 12: 205-212PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in assay buffer (100 μl) consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dithiothreitol, 200 ng of calf thymus DNA previously treated with DNase I and various concentrations of [α-32P]NAD+ (100 nCi/nmol). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, containing 1% inorganic phosphate, and the acid-insoluble radioactivity was washed 3 times in the same solution and once in 95% EtOH and the radioactivity measured. In a previous paper (5Ménissier-de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) we described the inactivation of the PARP-1 gene, in mouse by homologous recombination. Gene disruption was assessed by Southern blotting and by Western blotting using a panel of specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that failed to detect the full-length PARP-1 or any of its functional NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal domains. Using low doses of damaging agents (H2O2 or MMS) that are known to trigger PARP-1 activity in wild-type (wt) cells, no ADP-ribose polymers were detected in PARP-1−/− cells (data not shown). However, high doses of damaging agents were able to trigger poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in PARP-1+/+ cells (Fig.1, G) as well as in PARP-1-deficient cells (Fig. 1, C and E), as shown by immunofluorescence. This result suggests that there is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity distinct from PARP-1, that is activated by DNA damage. To confirm that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity was present in PARP-1−/− cells and evaluate its contribution, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the reaction products was performed. Whole cell extracts were prepared from spleen, testis, primary or 3T3 embryonic fibroblasts of PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1−/− mice, and tested for PARP activity. The results displayed in Fig. 2 A show that all PARP-1−/− cells tested display 5 to 10% of total PARP activity stimulated by DNA strand breaks, compared with wt cells. This residual activity is inhibited by 2 mm3-aminobenzamide supporting the idea of a new PARP enzyme activity. The reaction products synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]NAD+ were characterized by removing the radiolabeled material from the acceptor proteins and fractionating by electrophoresis on long 20% denaturating polyacrylamide gels. The distribution of ADP-ribose polymers synthesized in wt and PARP-1−/− cells are similar (Fig. 2 B). The reaction products were further characterized by two-dimensional TLC after polymer hydrolysis by snake venom phosphodiesterase (28Keith G. Desgres J. de Murcia G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). No significant differences were observed in the products, PRAMP, (PR)2AMP, and AMP synthesized by each cell genotype (data not shown). These results demonstrate that PARP-1−/−cells exhibit a bona fide poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity presumably associated with novel PARP protein(s), confirming a previous report by Shieh et al. (15Shieh W.M. Amé J.-C. Wilson M.V. Wang Z.-Q. Koh D.W. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In plant cell nuclei, PARP activity has been reported to be associated with a protein of approximately 113 kDa (30Chen Y.M. Shall S. O'Farrell M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, in A. thaliana, the cloning of a PARP homologue (11Lepiniec L. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Van Montagu M. Inze D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) revealed a protein, called APP, with a theoretical M r of 72,000. This protein showed a high similarity (60%) to the catalytic domain of vertebrate PARP, but was completely divergent in its NH2-terminal extremity where it harbored a helix-loop-helix domain. The existence of two distinct PARP genes in plants was definitely confirmed by the cloning of two different maize genes coding for a classical PARP with zinc fingers of 110 kDa (ZAP) and a structurally non-classical PARP (NAP, homologous to APP) of 72 kDa, respectively (12Babiychuk E.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, we undertook a search for the mammalian equivalent of APP and NAP. Expressed sequence tags (EST) of the GenBank/EMBL data bases (dbEST) were screened with the APP primary sequence. Several EST from mouse and human were identified which shared homology with the catalytic domain of APP, while distinct from PARP-1. These sequences were candidates for a new mammalian PARP homologue, possibly responsible for the poly(ADP-ribosylation) activity detected in PARP-1−/− cells. The murine EST were used to screen a mouse ES cell cDNA library. We thus were able to construct the complete cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AJ007780). Simultaneously, the cloning of the homologous human cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AJ236912) was undertaken following a similar strategy. We propose to name this new gene poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (PARP-2). The chromosomal localization of the human PARP-2 gene was identified by FISH on human chromosomes using a human PARP-2 probe. Consistent signals on chromosome 14, band 14q11.2 were identified (Fig.3 A); 100% of 25 metaphases showed at least one signal on chromosome 14 at 14q11.2; 24% of the metaphases showed signals on both chromosomes 14 on the same position. Similarly, the murine PARP-2 gene was mapped using a murine PARP-2 probe. FISH on mouse chromosomes exhibited consistent signals on chromosome 14, band 14C1 (Fig. 3 B); 70% of 25 metaphases showed signals on 14C1; 10% had double signals on chromosome 14 band 14C1, and 20% showed signals on the two homologues at the same position. As a control, chromosomal localization of the murinePARP-1 gene was performed. FISH on mouse chromosomes exhibited consistent signals on chromosomes 1, band 1 H5 (Fig.3 C); 30 metaphases were observed, of which 74% showed signals in this position; 41% showed one signal on both chromosomes 1, 26% showed double signals on one of the two homologues. Altogether, these results confirm the existence of two distinct and unique genes coding for two different PARP molecules. A strict synteny was observed between man and mouse in the two chromosome regions containing thePARP-1 gene as well as those containing thePARP-2 gene. Northern blot analysis performed on poly(A)+ mRNAs of 3T3 cells derived from PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1−/− mice and on total RNAs from mouse tissues (Fig. 4) revealed a PARP-2 transcript at an apparent molecular size of 2.0 kilobase. The same amount of transcript was detectable in both PARP-1+/+and PARP-1−/− cell lines, indicating that there is no compensation for the PARP-1 deficiency in PARP-1−/− cells by up-regulation of PARP-2 gene expression. The tissue distribution of PARP-2 showed at least a basal expression in all tissues and higher expression in germline. Moreover, Northern blot analysis on total mRNA from HeLa cells treated or untreated with genotoxic agents such as UV-B (500 J/m2), UV-C (20 J/m2),N-methyl-N′nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (50 μm), and H2O2 (0.5 mm) revealed that the level of PARP-2 mRNA is not increased following genotoxic stress (data not sh"

Here we show using gel filtration that full-length Apaf-1 exists as a monomer that can be transformed to an oligomeric complex made of at least eight subunits after binding to cytochrome c and dATP. Apaf-1 binds to cytochromec in the absence of dATP but does not form the oligomeric complex. However, when dATP is added to the cytochromec-bound Apaf-1 complex, complete oligomerization occurs, suggesting that oligomerization is driven by hydrolysis of dATP. This was supported by the observation that ATP, but not the nonhydrolyzable adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate), can induce oligomerization of the Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex. Like the spontaneously oligomerizing Apaf-530, which lacks its WD-40 domain, the oligomeric full-length Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex can bind and process procaspase-9 in the absence of additional dATP or cytochrome c. However, unlike the truncated Apaf-530 complex, the full-length Apaf-1 complex can release the mature caspase-9 after processing. Once released, mature caspase-9 can process procaspase-3, setting into motion the caspase cascade. These observations indicate that cytochrome c and dATP are required for oligomerization of Apaf-1 and suggest that the WD-40 domain plays an important role in oligomerization of full-length Apaf-1 and the release of mature caspase-9 from the Apaf-1 oligomeric complex.

Caspases, a highly conserved family of cysteine proteases that cleave their substrates after an aspartate residue, play fundamental roles in the initiation and execution of apoptosis (reviewed in Refs.1Cohen G.M.

Caspases are constitutively expressed in cells as single chain proenzymes that can be activated by proteolytic cleavage at specific internal aspartate residues within the procaspase polypeptide chain. Mature caspases can cleave their own proenzyme and other procaspases, suggesting that they operate in a protease cascade. Caspases have been divided into initiators and effectors, based on their place in the caspase cascade (1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4145) Google Scholar, 2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar, 3Thornberry N.A.

The effectors (caspase-3, -6, and -7) are activated via the action of other caspases (i.e. initiators) and are responsible for the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis. The initiators (caspase-8, -9, and -10) are activated by their own intrinsic autocatalytic activity with the help of other proteins with which they form complexes known as “apoptosomes” (5Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Two apoptosomes that function to activate the initiator procaspases have been identified. The death receptor apoptosome is an oligomer that is formed upon ligation of death receptors such as Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 by their ligands (6Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). This oligomer recruits procaspase-8 or -10 via the adaptor molecule FADD through homotypic protein-protein interactions, resulting in activation of these caspases by aggregation (7Muzio M.

Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Another unrelated apoptosome is formed by Apaf-1 upon binding to cytochrome c, which is released from the mitochondria by various forms of apoptosis triggers (5Green D.R.

Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar). A recent study from our laboratory demonstrated that a truncated Apaf-1 variant lacking the WD-40 repeat domain (Apaf-530) can activate procaspase-9 independent of cytochrome c and dATP through spontaneous oligomerization (10Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the truncated Apaf-1 was unable to release the mature caspase-9 from the complex, raising the possibility that the WD-40 repeats play a role in the release of mature caspase-9 from the Apaf-1 apoptosome (10Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). To determine the role of cytochrome c and dATP and the function of the WD-40 repeats in the process of activation and release of caspase-9, we reconstituted an in vitro Apaf-1-caspase-9 activation system with purified recombinant full-length Apaf-1. We provide evidence that cytochrome c and dATP are required to promote oligomerization of Apaf-1 and that mature caspase-9 is released from the full-length Apaf-1 apoptosome but not from the truncated Apaf-530 complex. All the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Apaf-1L was expressed in Sf-9 cells by infecting the cells with recombinant Apaf-1 baculovirus. An S-100 extract was prepared from a 1-liter suspension culture of the infected cells in 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmDTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. 280 mg of total proteins were loaded onto a 2-ml bed volume column of Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid agarose (Novagen) at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min in the presence of 10 mmimidazole. After washing the column with 2 × 20 ml of HEPES buffer containing 25 mm and 50 mm imidazole, respectively, bound proteins were eluted with a 30-ml gradient of 50–350 mm imidazole in HEPES buffer at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min. The fractions containing Apaf-1L (∼90 mm-150 mm imidazole) were pooled and concentrated (Centricon-30; Amicon), and the final concentration of NaCl was adjusted to 20 mm in a final volume of 2.0 ml. Subsequently, the concentrated Apaf-1L sample (600 μg) was applied to an FPLC Mono Q column (1.0 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. After washing the column with 10 ml of the HEPES buffer containing 20 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 20–300 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The peak fractions containing Apaf-1L were pooled and concentrated, and the concentration of NaCl was adjusted to 50 mm in a final volume of 0.5 ml (110 μg). Finally, 2 × 250 μl of the Mono Q purified Apaf-1L was loaded separately onto a Superose 12 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. 20-μl aliquots from each 250-μl fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Apaf-1 antibody. The peak fractions of Apaf-1L protein were pooled and concentrated (1 ml; 60 μg of protein), and the purity of the protein was verified by SDS gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. By comparison with gel filtration protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the peak fraction of Apaf-1L from the Superose 12 column corresponded to apparent molecular size of 125 kDa (this value was calculated by linear extrapolation from the calibration protein standards; data not shown). All oligomerization reactions of Apaf-1L were carried out by incubating Apaf-1 (3 μg) with or without cytochrome c (7 μg) or dATP (1 mm) or both at 4 °C for 70 min in a final volume of 100 μl of 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm DTT (oligomerization buffer). In some experiments dATP was substituted with ATP (1 mm), or γ-S-ATP (1 mm). After oligomerization an additional 150 μl of the oligomerization buffer was added to each sample, and the reaction mixture was directly applied to a Superose 6 FPLC column at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. 45-μl aliquots of the 500-μl fractions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and assayed for the presence of Apaf-1L protein by immunoblotting with anti-Apaf-1 antibody. Approximate molecular masses of the different forms of Apaf-1L protein were obtained by linear extrapolation from the calibration protein standards. Initially, 100 μl of in vitro translated35S-labeled pro-caspase-9 was fractionated on a 15-ml open column of Sephacryl S-400 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. 15-μl aliquots of 200-μl fractions were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the elution peak of procaspase-9 was determined by autoradiography. 1 × 105 trichloroacetic acid counts of the partially purified procaspase-9 were incubated with 3.0 μg of pure Apaf-1L and 7.0 μg of cytochrome c in a final volume of 100 μl of the oligomerization buffer containing 1.0 mm dATP. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 45 min to allow processing of procaspase-9 followed by loading onto the Sephacryl S-400 column. The elution of caspase-9 forms and Apaf-1L protein were assessed by autoradiography and Western blotting with anti-Apaf-1 antibody, respectively. Similarly, 25 μg of affinity purified Apaf-530 protein (10Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) were incubated with the partially purified procaspase-9 and fractionated on the same gel filtration column. These were performed as described previously (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar,11Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Ottilie S. Bullrich F. Banks S. Wang Y. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Croce C.M.

To obtain sufficient quantities of human Apaf-1 for functional and biochemical characterization, we engineered baculoviruses encoding two C-terminally His6-tagged Apaf-1 isoforms. One isoform (Apaf-1S) is identical in sequence to the published Apaf-1 (12Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2745) Google Scholar) and GenBankTM accession numberAF013263). The second isoform (Apaf-1L) has an additional WD-40 repeat at amino acid 812 relative to the initiator Met and was cloned from a Jurkat cDNA library (Fig.1 A). The human Apaf-1L is similar in structure to the recently cloned mouse Apaf-1, which also has an additional WD-40 repeat (13Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The two Apaf-1 isoforms were expressed in Sf-9 cells by infecting the cells with their respective baculoviruses and then partially purified on Ni2+ affinity resin. Comparable amounts of the two proteins as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B) were incubated with35S-labeled procaspase-9. As shown in Fig. 1 C, Apaf-1L, but not Apaf-1S, was capable of processing procaspase-9 in a cytochrome c and dATP-dependent fashion, suggesting that the additional WD-40 repeat might be critical for Apaf-1 stability and its overall tertiary structure. We observed that Apaf-1S is less soluble than Apaf-1L and that the majority of the expressed protein accumulates as insoluble occlusion bodies in Sf-9 cells. However, we did not see any precipitation of the soluble Apaf-1S during the incubation period with procaspase-9 (data not shown). Based on these data and on the published sequence of mouse Apaf-1, we believe that the human Apaf-1L isoform is the functional form of Apaf-1 in human cells. Cytochrome c and dATP are necessary for Apaf-1-mediated activation of procaspase-9 (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar). However, their exact role in this process remains to be determined. Our recent studies demonstrated that deletion of the entire WD-40 domain of Apaf-1 produced a constitutively active Apaf-1 variant (Apaf-530) that can spontaneously oligomerize and induce activation of procaspase-9 independent of cytochrome c and dATP (10Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Because the process of oligomerization appears to be critical for activation of procaspase-9, we hypothesize that cytochrome c and dATP regulate oligomerization of full-length Apaf-1, possibly by changing the conformation of the WD-40 domain, making it favorable for oligomerization. To test this possibility we purified recombinant Apaf-1L to complete homogeneity (Fig. 1 D), incubated it with or without cytochrome c or dATP or both, and then analyzed its elution profile by gel filtration on an FPLC Superose-6 column. We reasoned that if cytochrome c or dATP or both induce oligomerization of Apaf-1, we should be able to separate the oligomeric form of Apaf-1 from its monomeric form on the basis of molecular size differences. Preincubation of Apaf-1L with dATP alone did not change its elution profile from that of the buffer control (Fig.2, A–C). Both the buffer control and dATP-Apaf-1L eluted as single peaks around fraction 33 (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). The approximate size of Apaf-1L in the peak fraction was ∼125 kDa, suggesting that it is a monomer and that dATP alone is not sufficient to induce its oligomerization. Preincubation of Apaf-1L with cytochrome c alone resulted in a small shift in the Apaf-1L elution profile (Fig. 2, A andD). The majority of Apaf-1L eluted in a large peak around fraction 30, which corresponds to a size of ∼170 kDa. In this fraction, cytochrome c co-eluted with Apaf-1L, indicating that this fraction contains a complex of cytochrome c-bound monomeric Apaf-1L. In addition to this peak, a smaller peak of free monomeric Apaf-1L eluted around fraction 33. Unbound cytochromec eluted around fraction 40 (not shown). These results suggest that cytochrome c alone does not induce oligomerization of Apaf-1. Interestingly, preincubation of Apaf-1L with cytochrome cand dATP resulted in a dramatic shift in the Apaf-1L elution profile (Fig. 2, A and E). The majority of Apaf-1L eluted around fraction 20. The remaining Apaf-1L eluted in two minor peaks around fractions 30 and 34, which correspond to cytochromec-bound Apaf-1L and free monomeric Apaf-1L, respectively. The size of Apaf-1 in the major peak fraction is ∼1.4 MDa. This and the presence of cytochrome c in this fraction suggest that the major peak contains a large oligomeric complex of Apaf-1L and cytochrome c. Based on the observed sizes of this oligomer (peak IV, ∼1.4 MDa) and the cytochrome c-bound Apaf-1L monomer (peak III, ∼170 kDa) and assuming that the oligomer is globular, we calculated that this oligomer contains at least eight molecules of Apaf-1L. These data demonstrate that Apaf-1 exists as a monomer and that binding of cytochrome c and dATP to Apaf-1 induces formation of an octamer of cytochrome c-bound Apaf-1. To confirm the gel filtration results, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG- and T7-tagged Apaf-1L. S100 extracts from 293 cells transfected with FLAG- or T7-tagged Apaf-1L were mixed and incubated with or without cytochrome c, dATP, or both and immunoprecipitated with a FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then fractionated by SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with a T7 antibody. As expected, only in the presence of both cytochromec and dATP was there a significant association of the two tagged Apaf-1L proteins with each other (Fig. 2 F). A small amount of association that was observed with cytochrome calone could be because of the presence of residual amounts of ATP or dATP in the S100 extract. No association was observed in the buffer or dATP controls. To determine the activity of Apaf-1L in the major peak fractions of the four gel filtration experiments (Fig. 2, B–E), we incubated samples of the peak fractions with procaspase-9 in the presence or absence of cytochrome c or dATP or both. As shown in Fig.3 A, the oligomeric Apaf-1L (peak IV) was capable of processing procaspase-9 without additional cytochrome c and dATP. The cytochrome c-Apaf-1L complex (peak III), on the other hand, was capable of processing procaspase-9 only when dATP was added. Monomeric Apaf-1L from the buffer and dATP-runs (peaks I and II, respectively) was capable of processing procaspase-9 only when both dATP and cytochrome cwere added. Based on these data and the gel filtration data, we suggest that cytochrome c can bind to Apaf-1 in the absence of dATP but cannot induce its oligomerization. However, in the presence of dATP, the cytochrome c-Apaf-1 complex will form an oligomer that is capable of activating procaspase-9. This was further confirmed by incubating the pooled peak III (Fig. 2 D) with dATP and then fractionating it on Superose 6 column. As shown in Fig.3 B, dATP induced a complete shift in the elution profile of the cytochrome c-bound Apaf-1L. All Apaf-1L in peak III eluted in a single peak around fraction 20, which corresponds to the oligomeric Apaf-1L. This observation demonstrates that dATP is required for oligomerization of the cytochrome c-bound Apaf-1 monomer. This may have certain physiological implications. For example, cytochrome c release from the mitochondria of injured cells may not be sufficient to induce oligomerization and activation of procaspase-9. Only under conditions where sufficient dATP or ATP are available can cytochrome c release from the mitochondria induce apoptosis. Studies with purified Apaf-1 demonstrated that ATP in the presence of cytochrome c could also induce activation of procaspase-9, although at a higher concentration than dATP (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar). However, substitution of ATP or dATP by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue γ-S-ATP prevented activation, suggesting that hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate group is necessary for Apaf-1 function (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar). Because dATP is required to induce oligomerization of the cytochrome c-bound Apaf-1L (Fig. 3,A and B), we reasoned that ATP, but not γ-S-ATP, should be able to induce the same effect. To test this hypothesis we incubated purified Apaf-1L with cytochrome cand dATP, ATP, or γ-S-ATP and then analyzed its elution profile by gel filtration on an FPLC Superose-6 column. As expected, dATP and ATP, but not γ-S-ATP, were able to induce the formation of the Apaf-1L oligomeric complex, which eluted around fraction 20 (Fig.3 C). However, the amount of the oligomeric Apaf-1L induced by ATP was less than that induced by dATP. This is consistent with earlier observations that dATP is more effective than ATP in inducing procaspase-9 activation in S100 lysates and by purified Apaf-1 (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar, 14Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4481) Google Scholar). This also indicates that the effectiveness of the dATP analogues in inducing activation of procaspase-9 by Apaf-1 depends on their ability to induce oligomerization of Apaf-1. Our finding that γ-S-ATP cannot induce oligomerization of Apaf-1 explains its inability to induce activation of procaspase-9 by purified Apaf-1 (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6255) Google Scholar) and suggests that hydrolysis of ATP or dATP might be critical in the oligomerization process. To determine whether purified Apaf-1L has an ATPase activity, we incubated increasing amounts of Apaf-1L with [γ-32P]ATP, and the released 32P was counted by liquid scintillation. As shown in Fig. 3 D, Apaf-1L was capable of hydrolyzing ATP in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that Apaf-1 indeed possesses an ATPase activity. To determine the fate of procaspase-9 after processing by the oligomeric Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex, we incubated 35S-labeled procaspase-9 with Apaf-1L for 45 min at 30 °C in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP and then fractionated the complex by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-400 column. As shown in Fig.4 A, procaspase-9 co-eluted with the Apaf-1 complex (fractions 16–30), whereas the mature caspase-9 eluted later as a separate peak (fractions 32–48). There was no Apaf-1 protein in the mature caspase-9 peak fractions, suggesting that the mature caspase-9 was released from the Apaf-1 complex after processing. The approximate size of the Apaf-1-procaspase-9 oligomeric complex was above 1.6 MDa, whereas the approximate size of the released caspase-9 was ∼100 kDa. The size of the released caspase-9 suggests that it is a heterotetramer of two p35 and two p12 subunits. The size of a bacterially produced caspase-9 was also similar to the observed size of the released caspase-9 (data not shown). To measure the activity of caspase-9 in the two peaks of the Sephacryl S-400 column (Fig. 4 A), we incubated peak fractions 22 and 38 or the corresponding pooled peaks with 35S-labeled procaspase-3. Peak fraction 38 or the corresponding pooled peak (fraction 34–42) was capable of processing procaspase-3 to the p20 and p12 fragments of active caspase-3 (Fig. 4 C, sixthand eighth lanes). This indicates that the released caspase-9 is active. Interestingly, peak fraction 22 or the corresponding pooled peak (fraction 18–28), which contain the oligomeric Apaf-1-procaspase-9 complex, were also capable of processing procaspase-3 (thirdand seventh lanes) after incubation with procaspase-3 for 1 h. Incubation of peak fraction 22 for 1 h at 30 °C resulted in processing of the Apaf-1-associated procaspase-9 to the p35 fragment (second lane), which could explain its ability to process procaspase-3. This suggests that Apaf-1-mediated processing of procaspase-9 is important for its activity. To further examine the activity of the released caspase-9 toward the effector caspases that cleave the peptide substrate DEVD-AMC, we incubated it with an S100 extract from Apaf-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts in the presence of DEVD-AMC. This particular extract was used to role out any contribution of endogenous Apaf-1 to this process. DEVD-AMC was used to measure the activity of the DEVD-AMC-cleaving caspases in the S100 extract that are activated by the released caspase-9. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the released caspase-9 at 1 nm concentration was capable of inducing significant increase in DEVD-AMC cleaving activity in the S100 extract compared with the buffer control. A 1000-fold excess of bacterially expressed caspase-9 was not able to induce any DEVD-AMC cleaving activity in the S100 extract. However, increasing the concentration of the bacterial caspase-9 to 10,000-fold produced a similar DEVD-AMC cleaving activity to that observed with released caspase-9. These data are consistent with a recent report (15Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) demonstrating that bacterially produced and processed caspase-9 cannot induce DEVD-AFC cleaving activity in caspase-9-depleted cytosolic extracts without activation of the cytosolic extracts with cytochrome c and dATP, suggesting that Apaf-1 is required for activation of the bacterial caspase-9. Because our extract does not contain Apaf-1, does not respond to cytochrome c and dATP, and does not respond to submicromolar concentrations of bacterially processed caspase-9, the activation of the DEVD-AMC cleaving activity by the released caspase-9 indicates that the released caspase-9 is properly processed and enzymatically active. Recently we provided indirect evidence suggesting that the truncated Apaf-530 induces processing of procaspase-9 but could not release it from the oligomeric complex (10Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). To examine this directly we incubated procaspase-9 with Apaf-530 and then fractionated the complex by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-400 column (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, both the mature caspase-9 and procaspase-9 co-eluted in the same fractions that contain Apaf-530, suggesting that these proteins are still associated with each other in the same complex. The size of this oligomeric complex was around 700–800 kDa, which is much larger than the mature caspase-9. These results provide clear evidence that deletion of the WD-40 domain destroys the ability of Apaf-1 to release the mature caspase-9 from the oligomeric complex. Because the full-length Apaf-1 complex can release mature caspase-9, whereas the Apaf-530 complex cannot, it is expected that procaspase-3 can be processed when incubated with the former but not with the latter. To test this possibility we incubated 35S-labeled procaspase-3 with full-length Apaf-1L or Apaf-530 in the presence of nonradiolabeled procaspase-9 and cytochrome c and dATP. As expected, although both Apaf-1L and Apaf-530 were capable of processing procaspase-9 to the same extent (Fig.5 A, lanes 7 and8), procaspase-3 was only processed in the full-length Apaf-1L sample but not in the Apaf-530 sample (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4 and 6). Furthermore, when purified Apaf-530 was added to S100 extracts, it induced processing of procaspase-9 but inhibited processing of procaspase-3 (Fig.5 B, lanes 5 and 6). This indicates that Apaf-530 did bind all mature caspase-9, preventing it from processing procaspase-3. These data provide more supporting evidence that mature caspase-9 is released after processing from the full-length Apaf-1 complex but not from the Apaf-530 complex. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Apaf-1 undergoes oligomerization upon binding to cytochrome c in a dATP-dependent manner. This oligomeric complex can recruit procaspase-9 directly and activate it and then release the mature caspase-9 from the complex to initiate the caspase cascade. Thus Apaf-1 functions as a cytosolic death receptor that is activated upon binding to its ligand, cytochrome c, in the presence of dATP. We thank Dr. X. Wang for the anti-Apaf-1 antibody and Dr. T.

Two separate genes (rgpA and rgpB) and a single gene (kgp) have been found to encode RGP and KGP, respectively. We constructed rgpA rgpB kgp triple mutants by homologous recombination with cloned rgp and kgp DNA interrupted by drug resistance gene markers. The triple mutants showed no RGP or KGP activity in either cell extracts or culture supernatants. The culture supernatants of the triple mutants grown in a rich medium had no proteolytic activity toward bovine serum albumin or gelatin derived from human type I collagen. Moreover, the mutants did not grow in a defined medium containing bovine serum albumin as the sole carbon/energy source. These results indicate that the proteolytic activity of P. gingivalis toward bovine serum albumin and gelatin derived from human type I collagen appears to be attributable to RGP and KGP. The hemagglutinin gene hagA of P. gingivalis possesses the adhesin domain regions responsible for hemagglutination and hemoglobin binding that are also located in the C-terminal regions of rgpA and kgp. ArgpA kgp hagA triple mutant constructed in this study exhibited no hemagglutination using sheep erythrocytes or hemoglobin binding activity, as determined by a solid-phase binding assay with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated human hemoglobin, indicating that the adhesin domains seem to be particularly important for P. gingivalis cells to agglutinate erythrocytes and bind hemoglobin, leading to heme acquisition.

Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that is implicated as an important etiological agent of adult periodontal disease (1Haffajee A.D. Socransky S.S. Periodontol. 2000. 1994; 5: 78-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). P. gingivalis is asaccharolytic and highly proteolytic. Proteinases with trypsin-like activity, which are major extracellular and cell-associated proteinases of P. gingivalis, are now found to consist of arginine-specific cysteine proteinase (Arg-gingipain, RGP) 1The abbreviations used are: RGP, Arg-gingipain; KGP, Lys-gingipain; HbR, hemoglobin receptor; BHI, brain heart infusion; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Cm, chloramphenicol; Cmr, chloramphenicol-resistant; Em, erythromycin; Emr, erythromycin-resistant; Tc, tetracycline; Tcr, tetracycline-resistant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; mAb, monoclonal antibody. and lysine-specific cysteine proteinase (Lys-gingipain, KGP) (2Potempa J.

In addition to rgp andkgp, several proteinase-encoding genes have been cloned and characterized (12Kato T. Takahashi N. Kuramitsu H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3889-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Park Y. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4139-4146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Madden T.E. Clark V.L. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of asaccharolysis, P. gingivalis is totally dependent on amino acids and peptides for its growth. However, it has not yet been determined what proteinase(s) is actually responsible for the degradation of environmental proteins and the generation of amino acids and peptides as carbon/energy sources. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that rgpA consists of three DNA regions: (i) an N-terminal propeptide, (ii) a proteinase domain, and (iii) a C-terminal adhesin domain region (15Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). rgpBshares a high similarity in the N-terminal propeptide and proteinase domain with rgpA, and, importantly, the proteinase domains of the two genes are almost identical (4Nakayama K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Most of the C-terminal adhesin domain region is absent in rgpB (4Nakayama K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other hand, kgp has the same gene structure (an N-terminal propeptide, a proteinase domain, and a C-terminal adhesin region) asrgpA (7Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the proteinase domains of kgpand rgpA are divergent, their C-terminal adhesin domain regions are very similar to each other (7Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition torgpA and kgp, part of the C-terminal adhesin domain region is also encoded by hagA and tla ofP. gingivalis (16Han N. Whitlock J. Progulske-Fox A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4000-4007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Aduse-Opoku J. Muir J. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Curtis M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4778-4788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal adhesin domain region of rgpA consists of four domains (HGP44, HGP15, HGP17, and HGP27) (15Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One of the domain proteins, HGP15, was found to have the ability to bind hemoglobin by surface plasmon resonance detection using a recombinant HGP15 protein, and we proposed to designate this protein “hemoglobin receptor (HbR) domain protein” (18Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The three other non-HbR domains (HGP44, HGP17, and HGP27) have a 49-amino acid-long sequence in common (15Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). At least two of the non-HbR domain proteins (HGP44 and HGP17) seem to be involved in hemagglutination of P. gingivalis, as suggested by the finding that monoclonal antibodies inhibiting hemagglutination recognize a particular amino acid sequence within the domain proteins (19Curtis M.A. Aduse-Opoku J.

Construction and analysis of a rgpA rgpB double mutant and akgp mutant revealed that rgpA and rgpBare responsible for hemagglutination, the disruption of the bactericidal function of leukocytes, and the maturation of severalP. gingivalis surface proteins such as fimbrilin (3Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Nakayama K. Yoshimura F. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. J.

Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Abe N. Ratnayake D.B. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although rgp and kgp seem to play different roles in cell metabolism, functional complementation betweenrgp and kgp may occur, judging from the structural similarity. To further elucidate the roles of these genes, we constructed rgpA rgpB kgp and rgpA kgp hagAtriple mutants and examined them for proteolysis, hemoglobin binding, and hemagglutination. P. gingivalis cells were grown anaerobically (10% CO2, 10% H2, and 80% N2) in enriched brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (3Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and on enriched tryptic soy agar (3Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For blood agar plates, defibrinated laked sheep blood was added to enriched tryptic soy agar at 5%. As a defined minimal medium, we used α-ketoglutarate/bovine serum albumin (α-KG/BSA) medium for the growth of P. gingivalis (25Milner P. Batten J.E. Curtis M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 125-130PubMed Google Scholar). To make trypsin-pretreated α-KG/BSA medium, trypsin was added to α-KG/BSA medium at a concentration of 50 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. For selection and maintenance of the antibiotic-resistant strains, antibiotics were added to the medium at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol (Cm), 20 μg/ml; erythromycin (Em), 10 μg/ml; and tetracycline (Tc), 0.7 μg/ml. A promoterless cat DNA block (end-filled HindIII fragment; 0.75 kilobase pairs) of pCM7 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was inserted into the end-filled EcoRI site within thekgp gene of pNKD (11Okamoto K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), resulting in pKD362, which contained two tandem inserts of the cat block at the same orientation as kgp. A PstI fragment of pKD362 containing thekgp::cat operon fusion was introduced into P. gingivalis ATCC33277 and KDP112 (rgpA1::Tcr rgpB1::Emr) by electroporation to produce the Cm-resistant (Cmr) transformants KDP129 (kgp-2::Cmr) and KDP128 (rgpA1::Tcr rgpB1::Emr kgp-2::Cmr), respectively. An ermF ermAM DNA block (end-filled EcoRI-BamHI fragment) of pVA2198 (26Fletcher H.M. Schenkein H.A. Morgan R.M. Bailey K.A. Berry C.R. Macrina F.L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into the EcoRV site within the rgpA gene of P. g./pUC118 plasmid (27Okamoto K. Misumi Y. Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Yamamoto K. Ikehara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), resulting in pKD373. An EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pKD373 containingrgpA2::Emr was used for electrotransformation of ATCC33277 and KDP129 to yield KDP131 (rgpA2::Emr) and KDP134 (rgpA2::Emr kgp-2::Cmr), respectively. AnEcoRI-SphI fragment of pKD314 (4Nakayama K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was ligated to the EcoRI-SphI fragment of pKD296 (4Nakayama K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to give rise to pKD317 containing the whole rgpB gene. A uniqueSmaI site within rgpB of pKD317 was converted to a BglII site using a BglII linker DNA to yield pKD376. A tetQ DNA block (2.7-kilobase pairBamHI-BglII fragment) of pKD375 that was derived from pMJF-3 (28Feldhaus M.J. Hwa V. Cheng Q. Saylers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4540-4543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into the BglII site of pKD376, resulting in pKD377. A PstI fragment of pKD377 containingrgpB2::Tcr was introduced into ATCC33277, KDP129, and KDP134 to produce the Tcrtransformants KDP132 (rgpB2::Tcr), KDP135 (rgpB2::Tcr kgp-2::Cmr), and KDP136 (rgpA2::Emr rgpB2::Tcr kgp-2::Cmr), respectively. A DNA region (936 base pairs) in the vicinity of the 5′ end of the hagA gene was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the chromosomal DNA ofP. gingivalis ATCC33277 with two primers (5′-CGCTGCAGAAAGGTATTCGAACATC-3′ and 5′-TCGGATCCGAGGGTTTCTTCCAGTA-3′) and inserted into pMOSBlue plasmid by using a T-vector system (pMOSBlue T-vector kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A PstI-BamHI fragment of the resulting plasmid that contained the internal region of the hagA gene was then inserted into the PstI-BamHI region of pMJF-3, giving rise to pKD363. ATCC33277 and KDP134 were transformed to Tcr by electroporation with pKD363 circular plasmid DNA to yield KDP130 (hagA1::Tcr) and KDP137 (rgpA2::Emr kgp-2::Cmr hagA1::Tcr), respectively. Proper DNA replacement and integration in KDP136 and KDP137 were confirmed by Southern hybridization. Lys-X and Arg-Xspecific cysteine proteinase activities were determined by use of the synthetic substratesN-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide andN-α-benzoyl-dl-Arg-p-nitroanilide, respectively. In brief, various volumes of the cell lysates and supernatants of the culture were added to a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 0.25 mm N-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide, 5 mml-cysteine, and 20 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for KGP and a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 0.5 mm N-α-benzoyl-dl-Arg-p-nitroanilide, 10 mml-cysteine, 10 mmCaCl2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for RGP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 40 °C for KGP and at 30 °C for RGP. After the samples were added, absorbance was continuously measured at 405 nm on a spectrophotometer. Proteinase activities in cell extracts and culture supernatants were determined by the increase in absorbance per minute per milligram of protein and the increase in absorbance per minute per milliliter, respectively. Forty-eight-h cultures of P. gingivalis strains in enriched BHI broth were centrifuged, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS. The bacterial suspensions were then diluted in a twofold series with PBS. A 100-μl aliquot of each of the dilutions was mixed with an equal volume of sheep erythrocyte suspension (2.5% in PBS) and incubated in a round-bottomed microtiter plate at room temperature for 3 h. Forty-eight-h cultures ofP. gingivalis strains in enriched BHI broth were diluted in a twofold series with PBS, and a 10-μl aliquot of each of the dilutions was applied to nitrocellulose membranes and allowed to dry. The membranes were immersed in PBS containing 1% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific protein binding. For hemoglobin binding activity, the membranes were then probed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated hemoglobin in PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. HRP-conjugated hemoglobin was made according to the method of Kishore et al. (29Kishore A.R. Kalfas J.E.S. Forsgren A. Naidu A.S. J. Med. Microbiol. 1992; 37: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After three 10-min washes with PBS, peroxidase activity was detected (29Kishore A.R. Kalfas J.E.S. Forsgren A. Naidu A.S. J. Med. Microbiol. 1992; 37: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For antibody binding, rabbit anti-HbR antiserum (18Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 61BG1.3 for the detection of the non-HbR domain proteins (30Gmur R. Werner-Felmayer G. Guggenheim B. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 3: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were used as the primary antibody, and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were used as the secondary antibody, respectively. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed essentially according to the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Before being solubilized in a sample buffer, P. gingivalis cells were treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to inactivate endogenous proteinases. For immunoblotting, proteins on SDS gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blotted membranes were immunostained with anti-HbR antiserum or mAb 61BG1.3, and signals were detected using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). N-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide,N-α-benzoyl-dl-Arg-p-nitroanilide, human hemoglobin, α-KG, BSA (type IV), and trypsin were purchased from Sigma. Gelatin derived from human type I collagen was obtained from Seikagaku Co. (Japan). HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Electrotransformation and Southern blotting were done as described previously (3Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We used the promoterless Cm acetyltransferase-encoding gene for the construction of a kgp insertional mutation because we had used the Emr gene (ermF) and the Tcr gene (tetQ) for the construction ofrgpA and rgpB mutations. Thekgp-2::Cmr mutant (KDP129) and thergpA1::Tcr rgpB1::Emr kgp-2::Cmr mutant (KDP128) were obtained by the selection of Cmr transformants after the introduction of the kgp-2::Cmr DNA fragment to the wild type parent (ATCC33277) and thergpA1::Tcr rgpB1::Emr mutant (KDP112), respectively, by electroporation. Southern analysis indicated the replacement ofkgp with kgp-2::Cmr in KDP129 and KDP128 (Fig. 1). KDP129 showed no KGP activity, and KDP128 showed neither KGP nor RGP activity (TableI). In addition, KDP129 exhibited reduced colonial pigmentation on blood agar plates (Fig.2), which was one of the characteristic features of a kgp mutant (11Okamoto K. Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Abe N. Ratnayake D.B. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Colonies of KDP128 showed less color on the blood agar plates than those of KDP129 (Fig. 2). KDP128 has integration-type mutations at the rgpA andrgpB loci. Because of the potential problem of instability in integration-type mutations, another rgpA rgpB kgp triple mutant (KDP136) was constructed from KDP129 by sequential replacement with linear DNA fragments containingrgpA2::Emr andrgpB2::Tcr mutations. ThergpA2::Emr kgp-2::Cmr hagA1::Tcr mutant (KDP137) was obtained by the introduction of pKD363 circular plasmid DNA containing the internal region of hagA into KDP134 (rgpA2::Emr kgp-2::Cmr). Determination of the proteolytic activities of the various mutants supported the fact that RGP is encoded by two separate genes, rgpA andrgpB, whereas KGP is encoded by a single gene,kgp (Table I).Table IRGP and KGP activities of various P. gingivalis mutantsStrainCell extractCulture supernatantRGPKGPRGPKGP(ΔA405/min/mg protein)(ΔA405/min/ml)ATCC3327712.6 ± 4.57.0 ± 1.824.0 ± 5.67.4 ± 2.5KDP129 (kgp)15.4 ± 9.5017.6 ± 9.20KDP112 (rgpA rgpB)02.1 ± 0.77013.2 ± 8.0KDP133 (rgpA rgpB)010.2 ± 4.9010.8 ± 4.1KDP134 (rgpA kgp)11.7 ± 8.3014.8 ± 6.90KDP128 (rgpA rgpB kgp)0000KDP136 (rgpA rgpB kgp)0000KDP137 (rgpA kgp hagA)13.3 ± 8.3018.8 ± 8.10Forty-eight-h cultures of P. gingivalis strains in enriched BHI broth were centrifuged.

P. gingivalis ATCC33277 (wild type), KDP112 (rgpA rgpB), KDP128 (rgpA rgpB kgp), and KDP129 (kgp) were anaerobically grown on blood agar plates at 37 °C for 7 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Forty-eight-h cultures of P. gingivalis strains in enriched BHI broth were centrifuged. The cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and disrupted by a supersonic vibrator. The cell extracts and culture supernatants were used for the determination of RGP and KGP activities. Data are the means ± standard errors of four independent experiments. KDP112 (rgpA rgpB) and KDP128 (rgpA rgpB kgp) grew faster than ATCC33277 (wild type) and KDP129 (kgp) in enriched BHI broth (Fig. 3). Moreover, ATCC33277 and KDP129 showed a decrease in absorbance after 100 h of incubation, indicating cell lysis. Although the absorbance was also decreased in KDP128 and KDP112, the absorbance decreases of KDP128 and KDP112 were low and intermediate, respectively, compared with those of ATCC33277 and KDP129. These results indicate that the cell lysis seen after prolonged incubation appeared to be caused mainly by RGP and KGP. The rgp- andkgp-related mutants were grown in enriched BHI broth. Supernatants of the cultures of a 3-day incubation were mixed with gelatin derived from human type I collagen or BSA. ATCC33277, KDP129, and KDP112 showed a complete degradation of gelatin, whereas KDP128 showed no degradation (Fig.4 a). KDP128 also showed no degradation of BSA (Fig. 4 b). These results indicate that the extracellular proteolytic activity of P. gingivalis is totally attributable to RGP and KGP. The α-KG/BSA defined medium contains BSA as the sole carbon/energy source, and this medium supports the growth of wild type P. gingivalis cells (25Milner P. Batten J.E. Curtis M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 125-130PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether P. gingivalis cells require RGP and KGP activities to grow in this medium, rgp- andkgp-related mutants were incubated in the medium. ATCC33277, KDP112, and KDP129 grew in this medium, whereas KDP128 did not grow (Fig. 5). KDP128 grew in the trypsin-predigested α-KG/BSA medium as well as ATCC33277. These results strongly indicate that RGP and KGP contribute to protein degradation, leading to the production of peptides utilizable as carbon/energy sources. KDP136 (rgpA rgpB kgp) and KDP133 (rgpA rgpB) showed the same results as KDP128 and KDP112, respectively, in cell growth in enriched BHI broth, degradation of gelatin and BSA by culture supernatants, and cell growth in the α-KG/BSA defined medium. P. gingivalis has the ability to bind hemoglobin (32Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Hirai K. Nakamura T. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1995; 10: 109-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Amano A. Kuboniwa M.

Immun. 1996; 64: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the HbR protein of P. gingivalis was intragenically encoded by the rgpA,kgp, and hagA genes (18Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, another gene (tla) that was found to encode the HbR domain protein in the C-terminal region has recently been cloned (17Aduse-Opoku J. Muir J. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Curtis M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4778-4788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which gene(s) is actually responsible for the production of the HbR protein, immunoblot analyses with anti-HbR antiserum were performed using cell lysates and intact cells of various mutants (Fig.6, a and b). The wild type parent (ATCC33277), the rgpA rgpB mutants (KDP112 and KDP133), the kgp mutant (KDP129), and the rgpA kgp mutant (KDP134) exhibited the 19-kDa HbR protein in the lysates of cells grown in blood agar plates for 7 days, whereas thergpA rgpB kgp mutants (KDP128 and KDP136) and the rgpA kgp hagA mutant (KDP137) produced no HbR protein in cell lysates. The intact cells of ATCC33277, KDP133, KDP129, and KDP134 reacted to the anti-HbR antiserum, whereas those of KDP136 and KDP137 showed no reaction with the antiserum. These results suggest that all three of the genes (rgpA, kgp, and hagA) contribute to the HbR expression of P. gingivalis. Then we determined the hemoglobin binding ability of the mutants (Fig.7). The rgpA rgpB kgp mutants (KDP128 and KDP136) and the rgpA kgp hagA mutant (KDP137) showed no hemoglobin binding ability, whereas the cells of other strains (ATCC33277, KDP112, KDP129, KDP133, and KDP134) had the ability to bind hemoglobin, although the binding ability varied among the different strains. In addition, the fimA mutant KDP98 that is deficient in fimbriation (35Watanabe-Kato T. Hayashi J. Terazawa Y. Hoover C.I. Nakayama K. Hibi E. Kawakami N. Ikeda T. Nakamura H. Noguchi T. Yoshimura F. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 24: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) exhibited hemoglobin binding activity. These results indicate that hemoglobin binding activity appeared to be correlated to HbR expression. Because the HbR protein had hemoglobin binding activity in a cell-free system (18Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it is plausible to consider that the hemoglobin binding ability of P. gingivalis is attributable to the HbR protein.Figure 7Solid-phase hemoglobin binding assay. P. gingivalis cells grown in enriched BHI broth for 48 h were washed with PBS, resuspended in the original volume of PBS, and diluted in a 2-fold series with PBS. A 10-μl aliquot of each of the dilutions was applied to a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to dry. The membrane was then subjected to the solid-phase binding assay using HRP-conjugated hemoglobin. Columns are as follows: 1, ATCC33277; 2, KDP112; 3, KDP133; 4, KDP129; 5, KDP134; 6, KDP128; 7, KDP136; 8, KDP137; and 9, KDP98.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) P. gingivalis has the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes, which is one of the significant features of this organism. Pike et al. (36Pike R. McGraw W. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the RGP/adhesin and KGP/adhesin complexes have hemagglutinating activity. A monoclonal antibody (mAb 61BG1.3) that inhibits the hemagglutination of P. gingivalis was found to recognize a peptide within the adhesin domain (HGP44 of rgpA) encoded by rgpA, kgp, andhagA (20Booth V. Lehner T. J. Periodontal. Res. 1997; 32: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Kelly C.G. Booth V. Kendal H. Slaney J.M. Curtis M.A. Lehner T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether the rgp- andkgp-related mutants produce mAb 61BG1.3-reactive proteins, immunoblot analyses were performed using cell lysates and intact cells (Fig. 8, a and b). The wild type strain (ATCC33277), the rgpA rgpB mutant (KDP133), the kgp mutant (KDP129), and the rgpA kgp mutant (KDP134) produced immunoreactive proteins on the cell surfaces and in the cell lysates, whereas the rgpA rgpB kgpmutant (KDP136) and the rgpA kgp hagA mutant (KDP137) produced no reactive proteins on their cell surfaces. Interestingly, the rgpA kgp hagA mutant showed no reactive proteins in the cell lysate, whereas the rgpA rgpB kgp mutant produced immunoreactive proteins with molecular masses of more than 100 kDa that were probably derived from hagA. The rgpA rgpB kgp and rgpA kgp hagA mutants showed no hemagglutinating activity using sheep erythrocytes (Fig.9). These results indicate that hemagglutination of P. gingivalis is caused by thergpA-, kgp-, and hagA-encoding adhesin domains and that the expression of these adhesin domains on the cell surface is particularly important for hemagglutination.Figure 9Hemagglutinating activity of thergp- and kgp-related mutants. P. gingivalis cells were grown in enriched BHI broth, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS at an optical density at 540 nm of 0.4. The suspension and its dilutions in a 2-fold series were applied to the wells of a microtiter plate from left to right and mixed with sheep erythrocyte suspension. 1, ATCC33277; 2, KDP129; 3, KDP133; 4, KDP134; 5, KDP136; 6, KDP137.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) P. gingivalis cannot utilize carbohydrates as carbon/energy sources (37Shah H.N. Williams R.A.D. Curr. Microbiol. 1987; 15: 241-246Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, the microorganism has developed utilization of environmental amino acids and peptides by production of extracellular proteinases. In the gingiva, macromolecules such as serum albumin, immunoglobulins, hemoglobin, and various proteins of host tissues and secretions are target molecules for degradation to amino acids and peptides by the extracellular proteinases secreted from the organism. Although a number of extracellular and cell-associated proteinases have been found in P. gingivalis, it is still unclear which proteinase(s) is actually responsible for the production of utilizable amino acids and peptides. In this study, we found that the culture supernatants of the rgpA rgpB kgp triple mutants had no proteolytic activity to gelatin or BSA, indicating that the extracellular proteinase activity of P. gingivalis may be totally attributable to the three genes. The inability of thergpA rgpB kgp mutants to grow in the α-KG/BSA defined medium supported this idea. Several proteinases other than RGP and KGP have been cloned and characterized (12Kato T. Takahashi N. Kuramitsu H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3889-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Park Y. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4139-4146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Madden T.E. Clark V.L. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results obtained here, however, suggest that these proteinases may not be located on the surface or secreted outside or may not be expressed under the culture conditions used in this study. We also found that the autolysis ofP. gingivalis cells observed in prolonged cultures might be due mainly to extracellular and cell-associated RGP and KGP. In our previous study (18Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we found that the HbR domain protein that was intragenically encoded by rgpA, kgp, and hagAhad the ability to bind hemoglobin. Immunoblot analysis using anti-HbR antiserum revealed that the rgpA kgp double mutant produced the 19-kDa HbR protein, whereas the rgpA kgp hagA triple mutant produced no HbR protein. The result indicates thathagA is responsible for HbR production as well asrgpA and kgp. Aduse-Opoku et al. (17Aduse-Opoku J. Muir J. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Curtis M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4778-4788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that the HbR domain region was also located within the tla gene cloned from the P. gingivalis W50 chromosome. However, they mentioned in the study that Northern analyses of mRNA had thus far failed to reveal the presence of atla transcript in cells grown under any growth condition, indicating that there might be very little HbR production from thetla gene. A restriction map around the tla gene in ATCC33277 is different from that of W50 (17Aduse-Opoku J. Muir J. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Curtis M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4778-4788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide probe recognizing the HbR region hybridized to three different restriction fragments of ATCC33277 chromosomal DNA, which were probably derived from the rgpA, kgp, and hagAloci. 2Y. Shi, D. B. Ratnayake, and K. Nakayama, unpublished observations. These results suggest another possibility: that the ATCC33277 chromosome may not possess the HbR domain region in the tla gene. Further investigation including the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of tla from ATCC33277 will be necessary for clarification of this issue. In the previous study (18Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we also found that the rgpA rgpB mutant produced as much HbR as the wild type parent; however, the N terminus of the HbR from the rgpA rgpB mutant was Arg1155(the residue number of the kgp primary gene product according to Okamoto et al.; Ref. 7Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) instead of Ala1156, indicating that cleavage at the N terminus might be done by KGP in the mutant. In this study, we found that thergpA rgpB kgp triple mutant produced no 19-kDa HbR protein. Because the triple mutant produced mAb 61BG1.3-reactive proteins with high molecular masses, the hagA gene appears to be expressed in the triple mutant. Therefore, it is most likely that the processing and maturation of the HbR domain protein of hagA depend on the presence of both RGP and KGP activities. The finding that the hemoglobin binding activities of the various mutants were consistent with the presence or absence of HbR in the mutants indicates that the hemoglobin binding ability of P. gingivalis is caused mainly by HbR; however, Kuboniwa et al. (38Kuboniwa M. Amano A. Shizukuishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) recently reported that the KGP proteinase domain itself has the ability to bind hemoglobin. Hemagglutination is a distinctive characteristic of P. gingivalis that discriminates the microorganism from other asaccharolytic black-pigmented anaerobic organisms. This feature has been recognized to have taxonomic value, together with other important features such as the RGP and KGP activities, in distinguishing P. gingivalis from other Porphyromonas spp. BecauseP. gingivalis requires heme for growth, hemagglutination serves as the first step in heme acquisition from erythrocytes. We have previously found that the rgpA rgpB double (RGP-null) mutant showed decreased ability to agglutinate erythrocytes (3Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Pike et al. (36Pike R. McGraw W. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also reported that the high molecular mass RGP has hemagglutinin activity. These results suggest that the rgpgenes are involved in hemagglutination. The hemagglutinin genehagA of P. gingivalis that confers hemagglutination on Escherichia coli cells was found to possess the DNA region homologous to those of the C-terminal adhesin domains of rgpA and kgp (16Han N. Whitlock J. Progulske-Fox A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4000-4007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mAb 61BG1.3, which reacts with an epitope within the adhesin domains, inhibits the hemagglutination of P. gingivalis (20Booth V. Lehner T. J. Periodontal. Res. 1997; 32: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Kelly C.G. Booth V. Kendal H. Slaney J.M. Curtis M.A. Lehner T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). No hemagglutination of the rgpA kgp hagA triple mutant observed in this study suggests that all three genes are responsible for hemagglutination. In addition to the adhesin domain proteins, RGP proteinase derived from rgpB is thought to be involved in the hemagglutinating activity because the rgpA rgpB kgptriple mutants showed less than 1.6% of the activity of the wild type parent, whereas the rgpA kgp double mutant showed 6.3% of the activity of the wild type parent. There are at least two possible explanations for the involvement of RGP in hemagglutination. One is that because maturation of the adhesin domains requires RGP activity, a complete defect of RGP would decrease hemagglutination if maturation of the adhesin domains from hagA is required for the agglutination. The other is that RGP-mediated modification of putative erythrocyte surface molecule(s) for binding to P. gingivaliscells would be necessary for hemagglutination. Several other candidates such as fimbriae, HagB, and HagC have been proposed as a hemagglutinin of P. gingivalis (39Okuda K. Slots J. Genco R.J. Curr. Microbiol. 1981; 6: 7-12Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Slots J. Gibbons R.J. Infect. Immun. 1978; 19: 254-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Progulske-Fox A. Tumwasorn S. Lepine G. Whitlock J. Savett D. Ferretti J.J. Banas J.A. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 10: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, neither fimbriae nor anti-fimbria antibody inhibits hemagglutination (42Isogai H. Isogai E. Yoshimura F. Suzuki T. Kagota W. Takano K. Arch. Oral Biol. 1988; 33: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Purified fimbriae have also been shown to exhibit no hemagglutinating activity (43Yoshimura F. Takahashi K. Nadasaka Y. Suzuki T. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 949-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the rgpA kgp hagA mutant having no hemagglutinating activity expressed the fimA gene, resulting in fimbriation. 3Y. Shi, D. B. Ratnayake, A. Umeda, and K. Nakayama, unpublished observations. Taken together, it is unlikely that fimbriae are responsible for hemagglutination ofP. gingivalis, even if synthetic peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of fimbrilin possess hemagglutinating activity (44Ogawa T. Hamada S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3305-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of hagB and hagC depends on the phase of bacterial growth and on the levels of hemin (45Lepine G. Progulske-Fox A. Oral Microbiol. Immun. 1996; 11: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that these genes contribute to the hemagglutination of P. gingivalis under conditions that differ from those used in this study. Although several problems concerning hemagglutination of P. gingivalis remain to be solved, it can be said that the non-HbR adhesin domain proteins encoded by rgpA, kgp, and hagA are the most important agglutinins for hemagglutination.

Cycling of CRE-dependent transcription was not observed in other brain regions, including the supraoptic nucleus and piriform cortex. Levels of the phospho-active form of the transcription factor CREB (P-CREB) varied as a function of circadian time. Peak P-CREB levels occurred during the mid- to late-subjective night. Furthermore, photic stimulation during the subjective night, but not during the subjective day, triggered a marked increase in CRE-mediated gene expression in the SCN. Reporter gene experiments showed that activation of the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade is required for Ca2+-dependent stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription in the SCN. These findings reveal the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway to be circadian-regulated within the SCN, and raise the possibility that this pathway provides signaling information essential for normal clock function.

The biorhythm generated by the SCN allows an organism to predict and coordinate its daily physiological processes to an approximate 24-h period.

Physiol. 1976; 106: 253-266Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Light-induced phase-shifting results from the synaptic release of glutamate from the RHT onto the SCN (8Colwell C.S. Foster R.G.

Entrainment of the clock by light is thought to involve changes in gene expression. In support of this, several studies have shown that immediate early gene induction is triggered by light (11Kornhauser J.M. Nelson D.E. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S.

Science. 1990; 248: 1237-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar).Recent work has revealed important information about specific proteins and transcriptional events essential for circadian rhythmicity. For example, CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins heterodimerize to form a transcription factor that binds the E-box enhancer element, resulting in mper1 gene expression (14Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, PER/TIM dimers negatively regulate CLOCKdependent transcription (15Darlington T.K. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani M.F. Staknis D. Gekakis N. Steeves T.D.L. Weitz C.J. Takahashi J.S. Kay S.A.

Given these results, it is likely that the E-box enhancer element regulates the rhythmic expression of other genes within the SCN. However, the transcriptional activation of several circadian-regulated genes (vasopressin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Fos; Refs.22Kalsbeek A. Buijs R. Engelmann M. Wotjak C. Landgraf R.

The elucidation of these pathways will provide valuable insight into the series of coordinated transcriptional events underlying circadian rhythmicity.Ostensibly, transcriptional pathways that contribute to SCN rhythmicity should have the capacity to integrate signaling information from a variety of stimuli, as well as possess properties that allow for its stringent regulation. One candidate is the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway. This pathway has been shown to be activated by multiple kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (28Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 29Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway also has the capacity to integrate the activation of multiple signaling pathways and the strength of signal into striking variations in downstream gene transcription (32Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 33Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7546-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CRE-mediated transcription can be rapidly repressed through a myriad of mechanisms, including inducible early cAMP repressor induction, phosphatase activation, or as a result of CREB heterodimerization with inhibitory transcription factors (32Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 36Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F101-F121PubMed Google Scholar). These unique functional properties led us to explore whether this transcriptional pathway plays a role in circadian rhythmicity. Toward this end, we used a mouse CRE-β-galactosidase transgenic reporter strain to monitor CRE-mediated transcription in vivo.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here show that the SCN exhibit a prominent circadian oscillation in CRE-mediated gene expression in dark-adapted animals. Furthermore, photic stimulation during the subjective night triggered CRE-dependent transcription, whereas light treatment during the subjective day was not effective. Transient transfection experiment revealed that the ERK/MAPK pathway activity is essential for Ca2+-dependent stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription in SCN cells. Together, these results provide the first evidence linking the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway to endogenous timing mechanisms.Photic Stimulation of CRE-mediated TranscriptionThere is a large body of evidence suggesting that the phase-shifting effects of light result from new protein synthesis. However, the enhancer elements mediating transcriptional activation have not been thoroughly characterized. Our data suggest that the CRE may play a central role in the ability of light to activate gene expression and, in turn, phase-shift the clock. In support of this, we show that light induces CRE-mediated gene expression. Additionally, the finding that a brief 5-min light treatment triggers a highly localized induction of CRE-mediated gene expression correlates with a duration of light shown to phase-shift overt activity rhythms (11Kornhauser J.M. Nelson D.E. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Neuron. 1990; 5: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The general pattern of CRE-mediated gene expression, both temporally and anatomically, parallels the induction of several immediate early genes thought to be involved in phase-shifting the clock (11Kornhauser J.M. Nelson D.E. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Neuron. 1990; 5: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 12Kornhauser J.M. Nelson D.E. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S.

Given that the promoters for these immediate early genes (including c-fos,junB, and NGFI-B) contain at least one CRE (48Amato S.F. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 146-155PubMed Google Scholar, 49Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 50Sassone-Corsi P. Visvader J. Ferland L. Mellon P.L. Verm I.M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to hypothesize that the CRE may play a central role in mediating the ability of light to trigger immediate early gene induction. Our results showing that light-induces CRE-regulated gene expression in a phase-restricted manner are consistent with work showing that light-induced CREB phosphorylation is restricted to the subjective night (40Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). These results suggest that stringent regulation of the CREB/CRE-transcriptional pathway during the day may be a critical element that confers the phase-restricted phase-shifting effects of light.Signaling PathwaysA role for Ca2+ in photic entrainment of the clock has been suggested by the finding that light-induced phase-shifts require NMDA receptor activation (8Colwell C.S. Foster R.G. Menaker M. Brain Res. 1991; 554: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Given the evidence identifying a transcriptional component to light-induced phase shifts, we assessed the signaling mechanisms that couple Ca2+ to gene expression in the SCN. In primary cultures of SCN neurons, we found that increasing cytosolic Ca2+, either through high K+ or NMDA administration, resulted in enhanced CRE-dependent transcription. In addition, the co-activation of Ca2+ and cAMP pathways resulted in a robust synergistic activation of CRE-dependent transcription. Interestingly, besides glutamate, RHT nerve terminals also express PACAP (51Hannibal J. Ding J.M. Chen D. Fahrenkrug J. Larsen P.J. Gillette M.U. Mikkelsen J.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a peptide capable of stimulating cAMP production. Light-induced release of transmitters capable of stimulating Ca2+ and cAMP pathways may be important for robust activation of the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway in the SCN. Along these lines, we have observed that modest stimulation of cAMP signaling pathways that, alone, was unable to increase CRE-mediated transcription, potently augmented Ca2+-dependent CRE-mediated transcription in the SCN. 2K. Obrietan and D. R. Storm, unpublished observation. CRE-mediated gene expression is regulated by a variety of cellular stimuli acting through a number of different kinase cascades (28Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 29Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Our work shows that Ca2+ stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription was dependent upon activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Cotransfection with a dominant-negative interfering form of MEK or treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 blocked Ca2+-stimulated gene expression. Coupling of Ca2+ to activation of the MAPK cascade has been shown to be dependent upon an enhancement of Ras-GTPase catalytic activity (52Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent Ras activation is triggered by a variety of signaling intermediates, including calmodulin kinases (42Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,53Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B.

Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and the epidermal growth factor receptor (56Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The MAPK pathway gains access to the nucleus via the activation-dependent nuclear translocation of ERK. ERK has been shown to triggered CREB phosphorylation through activation of RSK 1, 2, and 3, all of which are CREB kinases (57Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A requirement for MAPK activity was also revealed by the observation that Ca2+-induced CREB phosphorylation was attenuated by the MEK inhibitor PD 98059. In addition, forskolin-stimulated CREB phosphorylation was reduced by PD 98059, indicating that the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway acts, in part, via activation of the MAPK cascade. Along these lines, cAMP has been shown to activate the MAPK cascade in hippocampal and cortical neurons (31Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G. Deloulme J.C. Chan G. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar).Within the SCN, elevated cytosolic Ca2+ has been shown to trigger CREB phosphorylation through a mechanism requiring the production of nitric oxide (58Ding J.M. Faiman L.E. Hurst W.J. Kuriashkina L.R. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 667-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Ca2+-dependent nitric oxide activation was shown to elicit ERK phosphorylation in neuronal cultures (59Yun H.Y. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), thus providing a pathway by which light-induced nitric oxide production could trigger sequential MAPK activation. Although other transcription factors may be activated by increased cytosolic Ca2+, it is intriguing to note that nitric oxide synthetase antagonism blocks both glutamate-induced CREB-phosphorylation and glutamate-induced phase-shifts (58Ding J.M. Faiman L.E. Hurst W.J. Kuriashkina L.R. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 667-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Ding J.M. Chen D. Weber E.T. Faiman L.E. Rea M.A. Gillette M.U. Science. 1994; 266: 1713-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This suggests a strong correlation between clock phase-shifting and the activation of a transcriptional pathway involved in triggering CRE-mediated gene expression. Taken together, the results presented here provide a mechanism by which glutamate receptor stimulation leads to CRE-dependent transcription.Endogenous RhythmicityRhythmic transcription appears to be central to maintaining circadian timekeeping. For example, a mutated form of the putative transcription factor CLOCK abolishes circadian activity rhythms under D/D conditions (16Vitaterna M.H. King D.P. Chang A.M. Kornhauser J.M. Lowrey P.L. McDonald J.D. Dove W.F. Pinto L.H. Turek F.W. Takahashi J.S. Science. 1994; 264: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Our data show that CRE-mediated gene expression is regulated in a circadian manner under free-running conditions. Levels of reporter protein began to rise during the late subjective night and peaked during mid-subjective day. Given the approximately 6 h between transcription and maximal reporter expression, one may deduce that induction of CRE-mediated gene expression is restricted to the subjective night, and possibly the early subjective morning. This result indicates that the phase-dependent regulation of endogenous CRE-mediated gene rhythmicity overlaps with the phase dependence of light inducible CRE-mediated gene expression, suggesting that a similar signaling mechanism may govern both processes.It is unclear why the light-evoked stimulation of CRE-mediated gene expression was greater than the peak in reporter expression resulting from endogenous pacemaker activity. Possible explanations may include more robust activation of signaling pathways by light or synergism between signaling pathways that are activated by light and the endogenous clock. Interestingly, we recently reported that light triggers MAPK activation in the SCN, and that MAPK activity is regulated in a circadian manner in the SCN under D/D conditions (61Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).Recent work performed in Drosophila has revealed a robust circadian oscillation in CRE-mediated gene expression and an interdependence between rhythmic CRE-dependent transcription and period oscillations, indicating that the CRE transcriptional pathway is a component of the circadian clock (74Belvin M.P. Zhou H. Yin J.C.P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Further work in mammalian systems may reveal a similar interaction between the CRE transcriptional pathway and period homolog rhythmicity.Circadian variations in the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor CREB at Ser-133 were also observed. The peak in the P-CREB rhythm preceded the reporter gene peak by approximately 6 h, an expected time lag for transcriptional activation and maximal protein expression. The circadian P-CREB rhythm does not result from CREB oscillations, since levels of CREB in the SCN were stable at subjective day versus night time points. This result suggests that circadian oscillations in P-CREB result from circadian fluctuations in the activation state of CREB kinases or phosphatases.It is unclear how rhythmic CRE-mediated gene expression is maintained under free-running conditions. However there are several plausible explanations. Given that extracellular membrane receptor-mediated signaling events regulate CRE-mediated gene expression, one may expect to observe circadian changes in the level of extracellular transmitters capable of eliciting CRE-mediated gene expression. In support of this idea, circadian variations in the concentrations of excitatory amino acids have been observed within the region of the SCN under free-running conditions, and in slice preparations (62Glass J.D. Hauser U.E. Blank J.L. Selim M. Rea M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R504-R511PubMed Google Scholar, 63Honma S. Katsuno Y. Shinohara K. Abe H. Honma K. Am. J.

Circadian oscillations in CRE-dependent transcription also may be a result of an inherent rhythmic transcriptional program of SCN pacemaker cells. Another possibility is that the amount or ratio of CREB heterodimerization partners within the SCN varies over the circadian cycle. In support of this idea, CREM-deficient mice do not express circadian locomotor activity. 3P. Sassone Corsi, personal communication. The circadian expression of a variety of genes within the SCN may result from circadian CRE-dependent transcription. For example, the promoters for several peptides that show circadian oscillations at the mRNA or protein level in the SCN, including vasopressin, somatostatin, and, during development, vasoactive intestinal peptide (22Kalsbeek A. Buijs R. Engelmann M. Wotjak C. Landgraf R. Brain Res. 1995; 682: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 65Ban Y. Shigeyoshi Y. Okamura H. J.

Interestingly, these peptides have the capacity to both modulate CRE-dependent transcription, either positively or negatively (70Deutsch P.J. Sun Y. Kroog G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10274-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 71Tentler J.J. Hadcock J.R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol.

Conceivably, the circadian expression of these proteins could be generated by temporally overlapping feedback loops that either activate or inhibit CRE-mediated transcription. Based on the results presented here, we propose that the CRE transcriptional pathway plays an important role in orchestrating the series of transcriptional events essential for both endogenous clock rhythmicity and the ability of light to phase-shift the clock.

The biorhythm generated by the SCN allows an organism to predict and coordinate its daily physiological processes to an approximate 24-h period. If the SCN are lesioned, there is a loss of physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms (4Moore R.Y. Eichler V.B.

The most effective regulator of the endogenous clock is light; endogenous clock rhythmicity is entrained to the environmental light cycle by photic cues conveyed from the eyes to the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) (6Moore R.Y.

For example, if an animal receives a light flash during the dark phase of the day/night light cycle, the circadian rhythm is reset, or phase-shifted (7Daan S. Pittendrigh C.S. J. Comp.

Overexpression of EGF receptors in these tumors is correlated with poor prognosis for responsiveness to radiation and chemotherapy (1Voldborg B.R. Damstrup L. Spang-Thomsen M. Poulsen H.S. Ann.

Clinically, there is interest in developing strategies to test if a given tumor will respond to a given treatment of radiation and combinations of chemotherapy. This testing could allow the optimization of drug combinations and treatment modifiers to enhance tumor cell growth. In the past several years, it has been realized that many chemotherapeutic drugs induce apoptosis of tumor cells (8Lee J.M. Bernstein A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Studies with human tumor cells of diverse tissue origin indicate that apoptosis is the common end point for drug-induced cell death. This is true for the spectrum of DNA-damaging agents, anti-metabolites, and microtubule toxins (8Lee J.M. Bernstein A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Gruber J. Greil R. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl.

Cumulatively, these findings have led to the realization that cells don't actually die from overwhelming DNA damage or injury per se, but rather, specific regulatory pathways are activated that induce apoptosis. Thus, a key in successful anti-tumor therapy is to enhance the susceptibility of the tumor cell to undergo apoptosis. An emerging theme from studies defining the mechanisms of action of chemotherapeutic drugs is the involvement of death receptors, particularly Fas and its ligand, FasL, in drug-induced apoptosis. Fas activation by FasL activates a caspase cascade leading to apoptosis (11Hodge S. Novembre F.J. Whetter L. Gelbard H.A. Dewhurst S.

Treatment of different tumor cell types with DNA-damaging drugs has been shown to induce the expression of Fas and/or FasL (12Walker P.R. Saas P. Dietrich P.Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Blocking Fas activation in these cells inhibits drug-induced apoptosis of the tumor cells (12Walker P.R. Saas P. Dietrich P.Y.

These findings have demonstrated a signal transduction response from DNA damage to the transcriptional regulation of death receptors and their ligands. In this report we show that activation of EGF receptors in tumor cells of epithelial origin protects against Fas-induced apoptosis. Cells were maintained in a humidified 7.0% CO2 environment in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Media for T47D, MCF7, and HEK293 cells was supplemented with 20% bovine calf serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10% bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively. MCF7 cells expressing vector Akt K-M and Akt-myr protein were under selection with 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each cell line was tested for the presence of EGF receptors and the Fas receptor. Cells (1–2 × 106) were suspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified medium medium-containing serum to minimize incubation volumes. The cells were incubated with or without 1 μg/ml EGF (Biochemical Technology) for 1 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, 1 μg/ml activating anti-Fas antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was added, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Two ml of Dulbecco's modified medium-containing serum was added to the cells, and the mixture was placed in tissue culture plates. Adherent cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 7.0% CO2 incubator for 24 or 48 h where indicated. Wortmannin (100 nm, Sigma) and PD098059 (50 μm, Parke-Davis) was added at the same time as EGF where indicated. Similar results were obtained when EGF and activating anti-Fas antibody were added directly to adherent cells. Cells were lysed in Akt lysis buffer (10 mm K3PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 μm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 ng/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, and 40 μg/ml leupeptin). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Four hundred μg of cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg/ml of an anti-Akt1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. This was followed by the addition of 15 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed twice in 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice in Akt wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml protein kinase A inhibitor peptide). Thirty-five μl of the last wash was left in the tube and mixed with 25 μl of Akt reaction mix (Akt wash buffer, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 μg/ml cross-tide peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG), 0.2 μCi/μl [γ32P]ATP) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and spotted on P81 Whatman paper. The samples were washed three times for 5 min each in 75 mm phosphoric acid and air-dried. The samples were placed in scintillation vials and radioactivity quantitated. Cells were lysed in TX-100 lysis buffer (70 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysate were treated as described in Akt kinase assay. ERK2 was incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h as described for the Akt kinase assay. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Thirty-five μl of the last wash was left in the tube and mixed with 20 μl of ERK reaction mix (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μmATP, 0.5 μCi/μl [γ32P]ATP, 400 μmepidermal growth factor receptor peptide 662–681, 100 μg/μl IP-20, 2 mm EGTA) incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 500 mm EDTA and spotted on to P81 Whatman paper. The samples were washed four times with 75 mm phosphoric acid, air-dried, and counted in a β counter. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.25, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl2, 50 μm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 5 min, and protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay. Two hundred to 400 μg of cell lysate protein was subject to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 5% milk. Blots were performed as described in Widmann et al. (19Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 100 μg/ml digitonin. Sixty mg of lysate protein was incubated with 5 μm DEVD-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem) in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was then monitored using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm as per manufacture instructions. The caspase activity was measured as arbitrary fluorescence units and converted to fold increases over basal caspase activity in untreated cells. Fluorescence of substrate alone was subtracted in each case. To validate that we were measuring caspase activity, multiple inhibitors of caspase activity such as CrmA were used that reduced DEVD cleavage as measured by fluorescence to background levels. Cells (1–2 × 106) were resuspended in 100 μl of media by gentle vortexing and 2 μl of acridine orange (100 μg/ml), and 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide in phosphate-buffered saline was added. Ten μl was removed and placed on a microscope slide, and a coverslip was applied over the 10 μl. The slide was viewed on a fluorescence microscope using a fluorescein filter set for the detection of condensed DNA in apoptotic cells. The condensed DNA was determined by intense local staining of DNA in the nucleus compared with the diffuse staining of the DNA in normal cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined from cells containing normal DNA staining compared with cells with condensed DNA. Apoptosis was verified by propidium iodide staining for DNA fragmentation and morphological changes consistent with apoptotic cells. EGF stimulation of T47D breast adenocarcinoma and human embryonic kidney epithelial (HEK293) cells significantly diminished the percentage of apoptotic cells in response to activation of Fas relative to control cells not exposed to EGF (Fig.1 A). Stimulation of Fas in T47D cells resulted in 57 and 74% of the cells to be apoptotic at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Forty-eight h after activation of Fas in HEK293 cells, 66% of the cell population was apoptotic. EGF stimulation before Fas ligation reduced the apoptotic response 48 h later to 38% and 32% in T47D and HEK293 cells, respectively. Similar results were observed with activation of Fas by an activating anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 1 A) or soluble FasL (not shown). Quantitation of apoptosis by acridine orange or propidium iodide staining gave similar results. The findings show that in two different epithelial cell types, EGF stimulation reduces the ability of Fas activation to induce cell death by apoptosis. Caspases are the cysteine proteases that when activated cleave proteins at defined aspartic acid-containing recognition sequence motifs (16Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6181) Google Scholar, 17Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L.

Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Measurement of caspase activity using a fluorescent DEVD peptide substrate for caspase 3-like proteases demonstrated Fas stimulates caspase activity 3- and 2-fold, respectively, in T47D and HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 B). Prior treatment of T47D and HEK293 cells with EGF effectively inhibits caspase activation in response to Fas ligation in both cell types. This result indicates that EGF stimulates signal pathways that inhibit Fas activation of caspases. The decreased caspase activation would effectively inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis. We recently demonstrated that Fas stimulated caspase-dependent cleavage of several proteins involved in EGF signaling including Akt and Cbl (19Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Consistent with the inhibition of caspase activation by EGF (Fig. 1 B), EGF stimulation of T47D and HEK293 cells inhibited the proteolysis of Akt and Cbl in response to Fas ligation (Fig. 1 C). Protection of Cbl and Akt from caspase-catalyzed cleavage was maintained even after 48 h of Fas activation in the continued presence of EGF (not shown). The expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), which is not a caspase substrate (19Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), is not changed during Fas activation in cells. Thus, the cleavage by caspases of specific signaling proteins, but not every signaling protein, is orchestrated during the apoptotic response initiated by Fas ligation. EGF stimulation of T47D and HEK293 cells inhibits the caspase-dependent cleavage of proteins in response to ligation of the death receptor, Fas. Akt is activated by EGF stimulation in several cell types (20Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 21Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Indeed, EGF stimulation of T47D cells activates Akt (Fig. 2 A). Akt activation also has been shown to protect cells from stress-induced apoptosis (22Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 23Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 24Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). The caspase-dependent cleavage of Akt would be expected to prevent this anti-apoptotic response. Therefore, we examined if EGF stimulation of T47D cells sustains Akt activation in Fas-activated cells. The activation of Akt was determined with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated serine 473 of Akt. Serine 473 is located in the kinase domain of Akt, and its phosphorylation is required to indicate Akt activation (23Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 24Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation of Akt was detected within 5 min after EGF stimulation (Fig. 2 B). Twenty-four h after Fas ligation, Akt was still activated in EGF-treated cells (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, a second challenge with EGF increased the phosphorylated activated form of Akt in cells exposed to Fas. In contrast, Fas activation in cells that were not prestimulated with EGF resulted in no measurable Akt protein (Fig. 2 B). These results show that EGF stimulation of T47D cells not only activates Akt but also protects it from degradation by caspases in Fas-stimulated cells. The ability of specific signal transduction pathways to have anti-apoptotic regulatory properties is variable in different cell types (25O'Connor R. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 62: 137-166PubMed Google Scholar). For example, both Akt and the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway have been shown to be anti-apoptotic in different cell types and in response to different stress stimuli (23Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor R. Adv. Biochem. Eng.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 3381-3390PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that EGF stimulation of T47D cells activates both Akt and ERK activities. The time course in response to EGF stimulation of ERK activation (Fig. 3 A) is similar to that for Akt (Fig.2 A), although ERK activation peaked at 10 min, whereas Akt activation peaked at 30 min. Activation of ERK in response to EGF stimulation is effectively inhibited by incubation of T47D cells with the Parke-Davis compound, PD098059 (Fig. 3 B). This compound stimulates the degradation of MEK1 and -2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase in the ERK pathway (29Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). The activation of Akt is regulated by phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols that are formed as products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-catalyzed reactions. The pleckstrin homology domain of Akt binds to the plasma membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol (3Chrysogelos S.A. Dickson R.B. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 29: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 5Rusch V. Mendelsohn J.

Treat. 1994; 29: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) bisphosphate, resulting in the translocation of Akt from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Membrane-associated Akt is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase, leading to its activation (20Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 22Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). As predicted, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by wortmannin inhibits EGF-stimulated Akt activity in T47D cells (20Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 30Hausler P. Papoff G. Eramo A. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Ruberti G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Egert S. Nguyen N. Brosius III, F.C. Schwaiger M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 35: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). Fig. 4 shows that wortmannin but not PD098059 inhibits the ability of EGF to protect T47D cells from Fas-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic function of EGF is completely abrogated by pretreatment with wortmannin (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, inhibition of ERK activation has no effect on the ability of EGF to protect against Fas-induced apoptosis. The ability of wortmannin to inhibit the anti-apoptotic function of EGF is mirrored in the regulation of caspase activity (Fig. 4 B). The suppression of Fas-induced caspase activity by EGF stimulation of T47D cells is completely inhibited by wortmannin treatment (Fig. 4 B). The effect of wortmannin on caspase activation is also demonstrated by wortmannin blocking the ability of EGF to protect Cbl and Akt from caspase-mediated degradation (Fig. 4 C). The ability of Akt to protect epithelial cells from Fas-induced apoptosis is also observed in MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (Fig.5). As shown in T47D cells, EGF stimulation suppresses Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). Stable expression of a constitutively activated Akt in MCF-7 cells lowers the basal apoptotic cell index relative to control MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, a kinase-inactive form of Akt (Akt K-M) has no effect on the basal apoptotic index of MCF-7 cells. Stimulation of Fas results in a significant apoptotic response in both Akt K-M and control MCF-7 cells. In contrast, expression of the myristoylated constitutively active form of Akt (Akt-myr) strongly protected MCF-7 cells from Fas-induced apoptosis. Thus, activation of Akt seems sufficient to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis. We have shown that EGF stimulation of three different cell lines protects epithelial cells from Fas-induced apoptosis. The activation of Akt appears to be both required and sufficient for the anti-apoptotic function of EGF (Fig. 6). EGF also has been shown to protect rat prostatic epithelial cells and cultured fetal hepatocytes from tumor necrosis factor β-induced apoptosis (32Fabregat I. Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Nakamura T. Benito M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Ilio K.Y. Sensibar J.A. Lee C. J. Androl. 1995; 16: 482-490PubMed Google Scholar). In other cell types the potential anti-apoptotic function of EGF is less apparent. In fibroblasts, EGF is not able to significantly protect against UV-B-induced apoptosis unless highly overexpressed (21Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 34Antonyak M.A. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, insulin-like growth factor 1 was able to block UV-B-induced apoptosis (21Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Similarly, EGF was not able to block tumor necrosis factor α-induced apoptosis in adipocytes (35Porras A. Alvarez A.M. Valladares A. Benito M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The differential ability of EGF to regulate Akt activity in these cell types may explain these differences. Thus, it appears that epithelial cells and fibroblasts have different abilities for EGF to signal anti-apoptotic responses. It is not clear whether this is because of receptor concentration or which EGF receptor family members are present. It should be noted that even though the ERK pathway did not have an anti-apoptotic function in the three epithelial cell lines we tested, ERK has been shown to have significant survival functions in other cell types. For example, in L929 fibrosarcoma cells and human neutrophils, the ERK pathway prevents tumor necrosis factor α and UV-induced apoptosis, respectively (36Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, different cell types may use either Akt or ERK signaling pathways for survival in response to different pro-apoptotic stimuli. Recently, it was shown that Akt phosphorylates both Bad and caspase 9, inhibiting their pro-apoptotic activity. The phosphorylation of these proteins appears to be a mechanism for the anti-apoptotic function for Akt (18Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S.

Our finding that in human breast epithelial tumor cells, EGF protects against apoptosis is particularly relevant to understanding the function of EGF receptors in breast cancer. Human breast tumor cells express EGF receptors that contribute to their growth and survival (1Voldborg B.R. Damstrup L. Spang-Thomsen M. Poulsen H.S. Ann. Oncol. 1997; 8: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar,3Chrysogelos S.A. Dickson R.B. Breast Cancer Res.

Symp. 1998; 63: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). Many breast cancer cells express multiple members of the ErbB family including ErbB1 (EGF receptor) and ErbB2 (Neu) (1Voldborg B.R. Damstrup L. Spang-Thomsen M. Poulsen H.S. Ann. Oncol. 1997; 8: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 6Cohen B.D. Siegall C.B. Bacus S. Foy L. Green J.M. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Fell H.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 63: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, many breast cancers also express either EGF or transforming growth factor α and are thus able to activate EGF receptors in the tumor cells via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (41Sterle M. Kreft M.E. Batista U. Biol. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of the Akt-signaling pathway in breast tumors would also be predicted to provide a survival function during the transformation process. Overexpression of ErbB2 receptor by transfection of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells resulted in protection of these cells from taxol-induced apoptosis, indicating that EGF receptor stimulation can also confer drug resistance (42Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that EGF stimulation of breast cancer cells protects them from Fas-induced apoptosis by a mechanism involving the activation of Akt. It is important to note that EGF treatment of epithelial cells significantly reduced but did not eliminate Fas-induced apoptosis. The incomplete protection could be because of the fact that we were activating endogenous EGF receptor family members and endogenous Akt. In HEK293, MCF7, and T47D cells, ErbB family members and Akt are expressed at modest levels. Overexpression of an activated form of Akt or overexpression of EGF receptors effectively blocks apoptosis (42Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study is the first report showing that EGF can significantly protect cells against Fas-induced apoptosis without increasing the expression of EGF-signaling components by transfection. The finding that EGF protects breast cancer cells from apoptosis is consistent with the recent observations using the anti-Neu (ErbB2) antibody, Herceptin (4Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Herceptin blocks EGF signaling and induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells and is now in use clinically in the treatment of breast cancer. It is possible that inhibition of the Akt stimulatory pathway will further sensitize cells to Herceptin-induced apoptosis (4Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Combined with chemotherapy, multimodal treatment would effectively induce apoptosis in part by making the tumor cells more sensitive to Fas activation. The ability to define the anti-apoptotic potential of signaling pathways like that for Akt in different tumor types should allow enhanced efficiency of treatments involving drugs like Herceptin, DNA damaging drugs, and microtubule toxins that induce the apoptosis of human tumors. Future studies will evaluate the ability of EGF to protect cells against chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and in xenograft tumor models in nude mice."

G-proteins are composed of an α-, β-, and γ-subunit and are characterized by the identity of the α-subunit that binds and hydrolyzes GTP. On the basis of sequence and functional homologies, G-protein α-subunits can be classified into four families: (a) Gαs, (b) Gαi/o, (c) Gαq, and (d) Gα12 (5Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). The Gα12 subfamily consists of the ubiquitously expressed members Gα12 and Gα13, whose functions are still incompletely understood. They share a 67% sequence identity and are less than 45% homologous to other G-protein α-subunits (6Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). G12 and G13 are activated through various receptors, including receptors for thrombin, thromboxane A2, and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (7Laugwitz K.L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K.

Because no receptors selectively coupling to Gα12 or Gα13 have been found thus far, G12/G13-mediated signaling pathways have been studied using constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13. Both Gα12 and Gα13 can regulate the Na+/H+ antiporter (10Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol.

Whereas there are clear similarities in the effects induced by constitutively active forms of Gα12 and Gα13, differences in the involved signal transduction mechanisms have been reported (9Gohla A.

Functional differences between Gα12 and Gα13 are also suggested from studies on Gα13-deficient mice that die at midgestation due to an angiogenetic defect. Fibroblasts derived from Gα13-deficient mice express Gα12 but show severely impaired chemokinetic responses to thrombin (16Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Effectors directly regulated by Gα12 and Gα13 remain to be discovered. Recently, it was shown that a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho, p115 RhoGEF, can be directly regulated by Gα13 (17Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G.

Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Whereas Gα13 activates the p115 RhoGEF-catalyzed nucleotide exchange on Rho, Gα12 counteracts the Gα13-mediated stimulation. In addition, p115 RhoGEF functions as a GTPase-activating protein for both Gα12 and Gα13. Studies conducted in plasma membrane preparations have shown that G12 and G13 are activated by receptors that also couple to Gq/G11 (7Laugwitz K.L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Van Sande J.

The Gq family is constituted by four members (Gq, G11, G14, and G15/16) that couple receptors to β-isoforms of phospholipase C (PLC) in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive manner, resulting in the generation of inositol phosphates and the mobilization of intracellular calcium (19Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sternweis P.C. Smrcka A.V. Trends Biochem.

A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Whereas Gαq and Gα11 are widely expressed and are primarily responsible for PTX-insensitive PLC-β activation, the expression of Gα14 and Gα15/16 is restricted to a few tissues (22Wilkie T. Scherle P. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23Amatruda T.T. Stelle D. Slepak V. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Studies on Gαq/Gα11-double deficient mice and cells have confirmed that Gαq and Gα11 are the primary mediators of PTX-insensitive PLC-β activation and that their cellular functions are highly redundant (24Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.-H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 25Offermanns S. Zhao L.-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 15: 4304-4312Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of Gαq/Gα11, Gα12, and Gα13 in receptor-mediated rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, we studied the signaling processes induced through endogenous and heterologously expressed receptors in wild-type, Gαq/Gα11-deficient and Gα13-deficient cells. Our data show that most, but not all, receptors tested mediate stress fiber formation in the absence of Gαq and Gα11. Unexpectedly, we found that Gαq/Gα11-independent stress fiber formation involved either Gα12 or Gα13. Moreover, the EGF receptor represents an essential intermediate in the Gα13-induced stress fiber formation but not the Gα12-induced stress fiber formation in fibroblasts. Angiotensin II, bradykinin, carbachol, endothelin-1, isoproterenol, lysophosphatidic acid, thrombin, and [Arg8]vasopressin were from Sigma. Endothelin-1(8-21),N-Suc-[Glu9,Ala11,15](IRL-1620), (±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) hydrochloride,trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, BQ-123, and BQ-788 were purchased from RBI. Wild-type fibroblasts and fibroblasts lacking both Gαq and Gα11 were derived from embryonic day 10.5 mouse embryos originating from intercrosses of Gαq(−/+) and Gα11(−/+) mice. The generation of Gαq and Gα11 mutant mice has been described previously (25Offermanns S. Zhao L.-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 15: 4304-4312Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts lacking Gαq/Gα11 or Gα13 were prepared and cultured as described previously (16Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vectors carrying cDNAs of the human muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors, the murine serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, the human vasopressin V1A receptor, the human β2 adrenergic receptor, and β-galactosidase have been described previously (27Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Gα12G228A and Gα13G225A were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pCIS (28Lee C.H. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16044-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations were verified by sequencing. The rat metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1α (mGluR1α) cDNA was inserted in pcDNA-Amp (29Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), and the human angiotensin AT1A receptor cDNA was inserted in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Human endothelin ETA and ETBreceptor cDNAs were cloned in pMEsf− (30Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa M. Sawamura T. Enoki T. Ohtani T. Sakurai T. Nakao K. Toyo-oka T. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8547-8553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the human bradykinin B2 receptor was carried by pcDNA1 (Invitrogen). RhoA G14V was in pcEXV (31Olson M. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The dominant negative EGF receptor mutant EGFR-CD533 was carried by the pRK5 vector (32Redemann N. Holzmann B. von Ruden T. Wagner E.F. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For microinjection studies, cells were seeded at a density of approximately 103cells/mm2 on glass coverslips imprinted with squares to facilitate the localization of injected cells and grown overnight. To obtain quiescent and serum-starved fibroblasts, cultures were rinsed in serum-free DMEM and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 25% Ham′s F-12 medium, 0.2% NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.1% fetal bovine serum (modified DMEM) for 24 h, followed by a 48-h incubation in modified DMEM devoid of fetal bovine serum. Plasmids were injected into the nucleus together with Texas Red dextran (5 mg/ml; Molecular Probes) to visualize injected cells. Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which was kindly provided by K. Aktories (Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg, Germany), was co-microinjected with the cDNAs at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. To test the effects of dominant negative mutants of Gα12(Gα12G228A; Gα12GA) and Gα13(Gα13G225A; Gα13GA), plasmids encoding for receptors (0.1 μg/μl) were co-microinjected with Gα12GA or Gα13GA (0.5 μg/μl). As a control, receptor plasmids (0.1 μg/μl) supplemented with a vector encoding β-galactosidase (0.5 μg/μl) to maintain the total amount of injected DNA constant were microinjected in an adjacent field on the same coverslip. The dominant negative EGF receptor mutant EGFR-CD533 (0.5 μg/μl) was co-expressed with various receptors (0.1 μg/μl) by nuclear microinjection. To test the specificity of dominant negative mutants of Gα12 and Gα13, RhoA G14V (0.1 μg/μl) was co-microinjected with Gα12GA or Gα13GA (0.5 μg/μl). About 150 cells/field were injected in each case, using a manual injection system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). To inhibit the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity pharmacologically, cells were incubated with the EGF receptor-selective tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μm) for 120 min before fixation. A 25-min treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate (100 μm) was performed before fixation. For dye loading, cells were incubated with 2 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester at 37 °C for 30 min in DMEM. Cells were then washed in 138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mmCaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Determinations of [Ca2+]i in single microinjected cells were performed in the same buffer, applying a digital imaging system and FUCAL 5.12 software (T.I.L.L. Photonics, München, Germany). Maximum and minimum fluorescence values were determined after the addition of 10 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) and 10 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Microinjected cells were stimulated with various agonists for 15 min at 37 °C, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. To visualize the cytoskeleton, cells were stained for polymerized actin by incubation with 0.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Sigma) for 40 min. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides and examined using an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100). For studies on endogenous receptors, the percentage of stress fiber-positive cells relates to the total number of investigated cells in randomly chosen visual fields. In the case of heterologously expressed receptors, microinjected cells were first identified by their Texas Red fluorescence, and then the fraction of stress fiber-positive cells among these cells was counted. Typically, the average receptor-dependent induction of actin stress fiber formation resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in fluorescence intensity compared with control cells when the average fluorescence intensity values of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled polymerized actin/cell were calculated using a digital imaging system and FUCAL 5.12 software. A minimum of 100 cells was investigated in each case. Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. In most cases, quantifications were performed by two independent observers in a blind manner, i.e. observers were not informed of the conditions used in the indicated experiment. For the determination of cAMP levels, HEK 293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and grown overnight. Cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the β2 adrenergic receptor and the M2 muscarinic receptor and either dominant negative Gα12 or Gα13 or the β-galactosidase control, as described previously (27Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The cells were subsequently labeled with [3H]adenine, and [3H]cAMP was isolated by double chromatography over Dowex and Alumina columns as described previously (33Wong Y.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Stress fiber formation can be specifically induced by constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 in a Rho-dependent manner (14Buhl A.M. Johnson M.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The G12- and G13-coupling receptors identified to date appear to activate Gq family members as well (7Laugwitz K.L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 8Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Stress fiber formation induced through these receptors is accordingly accompanied by a PTX-insensitive stimulation of PLC-β and a subsequent elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+]. To investigate whether Gq/G11-coupled receptors can, in general, activate G12/G13-mediated stress fiber formation and to test whether these cytoskeletal rearrangements are dependent on Gq/G11 signaling, we studied the agonist-induced stress fiber assembly through various Gq/11-coupled endogenous or heterologously expressed receptors in Gαq/Gα11-deficient fibroblasts. To assure a functional expression of the investigated receptors, we first measured the receptor-dependent calcium mobilization in wild-type fibroblasts. Fig.1 A (left part) shows that thrombin and LPA, acting through endogenous receptors, initiate a calcium mobilization in wild-type cells. The receptors for thrombin and LPA have been shown to couple to Gq/11, G12, G13, and Gi (8Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 9Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To test a possible involvement of Gi-type G-proteins in calcium mobilization induced through these receptors, Gi family members were inactivated by pretreating cells with PTX. The abrogation of Gi-mediated PLC activation slightly reduced the thrombin- and LPA-induced calcium mobilization (Fig. 1 A,left part). Similarly, the agonist-dependent activation of ETA, ETB, AT1A, and B2 receptors that were heterologously expressed by intranuclear microinjection of respective cDNAs induced partially PTX-sensitive calcium responses. In contrast, elevation of [Ca2+]i mediated by the activation of heterologously expressed V1A, 5-HT2C, M1, and mGluR1α receptors was not affected by pretreatment of cells with PTX (Fig. 1 A, right part). These data demonstrate that the tested receptors were functionally expressed at densities comparable to each other and to those of endogenous thrombin and LPA receptors. To selectively study the agonist-dependent calcium mobilization induced by activation of the tested receptors in the absence of Gq- and G11-proteins, we used Gαq/Gα11-double deficient embryonic fibroblasts. Activation of the heterologously expressed V1A, 5-HT2C, M1, and mGluR1α receptors did not elevate basal intracellular calcium levels, whereas stimulation of the endogenous receptors for thrombin and LPA and of the heterologous ETA, ETB, AT1A, and B2 receptors in Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells induced a slight increase in the intracellular calcium concentration that was completely PTX-sensitive (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the Gαq/Gα11-deficient, PTX-treated fibroblasts did not respond to various receptor agonists with measurable, PLC-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i. The receptors for thrombin and LPA have previously been shown to mediate Rho-dependent stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 cells (34Ridley A. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the fibroblast cell lines derived from wild-type or Gαq/Gα11-deficient mice provide a suitable assay system to study receptor-induced, Rho-dependent stress fiber formation, we first assessed the ability of thrombin and LPA to trigger stress fiber assembly in serum-starved, wild-type fibroblasts. Fig.2 A shows that both agonists clearly stimulated stress fiber formation in about 90% of the cells. Stress fiber assembly was insensitive to pretreatment with PTX but was completely blocked by C3 transferase, which specifically inactivates Rho by ADP-ribosylation (35Aktories K. Braun S. Rosener S. Just I. Hall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Similarly, agonist-dependent activation of the heterologously expressed ETA, V1A, B2, 5-HT2C, M1, and mGluR1α receptors resulted in a pronounced PTX-insensitive and C3 exoenzyme-sensitive stress fiber formation. We could not detect any actin polymerization in fibroblasts activated through the AT1A or ETB receptors, which clearly mediated calcium responses (Fig. 1 A). We then investigated whether stress fiber formation can be triggered in the absence of PLC-mediated calcium mobilization. Stress fiber assembly in response to the activation of M1 or mGluR1α receptors in Gαq/Gα11-deficient fibroblasts was drastically reduced by 90–95% compared with wild-type cells, indicating that it largely depended on the presence of Gq/11-proteins (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, stress fiber assembly triggered through the activation of the endogenous receptors for thrombin and LPA and heterologously expressed ETA, V1A, B2, and 5-HT2C receptors was induced as efficiently in Gαq(−/−);Gα11(−/−) cells as in wild-type fibroblasts. In all cases, Gαq/Gα11-independent stress fiber assembly was insensitive to PTX but was sensitive to C3 exoenzyme. We conclude that Gq/11- and Gi-proteins are dispensable for Rho-mediated actin reorganization induced through many, but not all, Gq/11-coupled receptors. Because activated forms of Gα12 and Gα13 are able to induce stress fiber assembly (14Buhl A.M. Johnson M.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), these data suggest that Gαq/Gα11- and Gi-independent, Rho-mediated stress fiber formation involves exclusively G12 family proteins. By labeling activated G-proteins with [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide in plasma membrane preparations, we have previously demonstrated that LPA receptors activate Gα12 and Gα13, whereas LPA-induced stress fiber formation is selectively mediated via Gα13 and does not involve Gα12 (9Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To test specific roles for Gα12and Gα13 in the same cell, we have used dominant negative forms of Gα12 and Gα13 and Gα13-deficient fibroblasts. Receptors that were shown to mediate stress fiber formation in a Gαq/Gα11-independent way (see Fig.2 B) were co-expressed with point mutants of Gα12 (Gα12GA) and Gα13(Gα13GA). The analogous substitution of glycine for alanine in the nucleotide binding pocket of Gαs has been shown to block Gαs activation induced by receptor-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange. Therefore, this mutation is believed to create a dominant negative-acting protein (36Miller R.T. Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Beiderman B. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 37Lee R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Gα12GA and Gα13GA did not interfere with stress fiber formation induced by the constitutively active RhoA mutant RhoA G14V or by the incubation of the cells with orthovanadate (9Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), indicating that dominant negative forms of Gα12 or Gα13 did not unspecifically inhibit stress fiber formation (data not shown). In addition, the expression of dominant negative Gα12 or Gα13 did not interfere with the Gq/11-dependent calcium release (TableI), nor did dominant negative Gα12 or Gα13 interfere with signal transduction pathways dependent on Gi-type G-proteins. The latter is evident from the fact that Gα12GA and Gα13GA did not influence the carbachol-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation compared with control cells expressing β-galactosidase (Table I). These data clearly demonstrate that dominant negative mutants of Gα12 and Gα13do not interfere with Gq/11- and Gi-dependent signal transduction pathways.Table IEffect of dominant negative Gα12 and dominant negative Gα13 on calcium mobilization and inhibition of cAMP accumulationIncrease in [Ca2+]i[3H]cAMP accumulationInhibitionThrombinLPA−CCh+CChnmcpmlacZ496 ± 30472 ± 5213769 ± 5827847 ± 57743%Gα12GA501 ± 41440 ± 3211509 ± 2766792 ± 34241%Gα13GA487 ± 26497 ± 4917955 ± 95010936 ± 75939%Gα12GA and Gα13GA or the β-galactosidase control (lacZ) were expressed in wild-type fibroblasts (left part) by microinjection of the corresponding cDNAs.

The mean values of triplicates ± S.D. are shown, as well as the inhibition of the isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation by carbachol (percentage). Interestingly, Gα12GA blocked thrombin-induced stress fiber formation by about 80% in Gαq(−/−);Gα11(−/−) cells compared with the control vector, whereas Gα13GA had no inhibitory effect. In contrast, LPA-dependent actin reorganization was not affected by Gα12GA, whereas Gα13GA reduced the LPA-stimulated stress fiber assembly by about 70% (Fig.3 A). To further explore a specific role for Gα12 and Gα13 in stress fiber assembly, we co-expressed Gα12GA and Gα13GA with receptors shown to mediate stress fiber formation in a Gq/G11-independent way (see Fig.2 B). In Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells, stress fiber formation induced through the stimulation of ETA and V1A receptors was strongly reduced by Gα12GA, whereas Gα13GA had no effect. Using the same experimental design, Gα13GA but not Gα12GA blocked stress fiber assembly induced through the B2 and 5-HT2C receptors. Thus, Gα12 and Gα13 appear to differentially couple receptors to Rho-dependent stress fiber formation. Stress fiber assembly induced by the activation of the M1and mGluR1α receptors was dependent on Gq/11-mediated PLC-β stimulation and calcium mobilization (see Fig. 2 B). However, stress fiber formation induced through the M1 and mGluR1α receptors in wild-type fibroblasts was inhibited by 60–90% after expression of Gα13GA, whereas the expression of Gα12GA was without effect (data not shown). To further prove a selective involvement of either Gα12or Gα13 in receptor-mediated stress fiber formation, we used Gα13(−/−) fibroblasts. Fig.4 A demonstrates that the activation of the LPA, B2, and 5-HT2Creceptors, which mediate stress fiber formation in a Gα13GA-sensitive manner, failed to induce stress fibers in Gα13(−/−) cells. In contrast, stimulation of the thrombin, ETA, and V1A receptors, which trigger stress fiber assembly in a Gα12GA-sensitive manner, occurred in almost all of the Gα13-deficient cells. This clearly confirms that both Gα12 and Gα13are capable of mediating receptor-induced stress fiber accumulation. However, different receptors selectively utilize Gα12 or Gα13 for the stimulation of Rho activation and the subsequent formation of actin stress fibers. We have previously demonstrated that the EGF receptor is an essential signaling intermediate in LPA-induced, G13-mediated stress fiber formation but not in the G12-induced stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (9Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To investigate a general involvement of the EGF receptor in G13-dependent rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, we first determined the effects of the EGF receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 on the receptor-induced stimulation of stress fiber formation in wild-type fibroblasts. Fig. 5 A shows that tyrphostin AG1478 blocked the G13-mediated stress fiber formation induced through activation of the LPA, B2, and 5-HT2C receptors. In contrast, the G12-mediated stress fiber formation triggered by stimulation of the thrombin, ETA, or V1Areceptors was not reduced by inactivation of the EGF receptor with tyrphostin AG1478. Furthermore, a cytosolically truncated EGF receptor (EGFR-CD533) was expressed in fibroblasts. This EGF receptor mutant exerts a dominant negative function on EGF receptor signaling due to the formation of signaling-incompetent heterodimers with endogenous EGF receptors (32Redemann N. Holzmann B. von Ruden T. Wagner E.F. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In agreement with the effects observed after inhibition of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity with tyrphostin AG1478, expression of EGFR-CD533 abolished the G13-mediated stress fiber formation induced through LPA, B2, and 5-HT2C receptors, whereas the G12-dependent stress fiber formation was not sensitive to an inhibition of EGF receptor function (Fig.5 B). The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of Gq/G11- and G12/G13-proteins in receptor-dependent stress fiber formation. Whereas constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 are known to induce stress fiber assembly (14Buhl A.M. Johnson M.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether physiological activation of G12/G13 through receptors is alone sufficient to mediate actin reorganization. Our data demonstrate that activation of LPA, thrombin, ETA, V1A, B2, and 5-HT2C receptors efficiently triggers PTX-insensitive stress fiber formation in the absence of Gq/11-dependent calcium mobilization. We conclude that Gq/11- and Gi-proteins are dispensable for stress fiber formation evoked through many Gq/11-coupled receptors. Stress fiber assembly induced by activation of M1 and mGluR1α receptors was dependent on Gq/11-mediated PLC-β stimulation and calcium mobilization. However, using dominant negative mutants of Gα12 and Gα13, we could show that stress fiber formation induced through M1 and mGluR1α receptors in wild-type fibroblasts was inhibited in 60–90% of the cells after the expression of Gα13GA, whereas the expression of Gα12GA was without effect. In addition, the activation of M1 and mGluR1αreceptors in Gα13-deficient fibroblasts failed to promote stress fiber assembly (data not shown). These results suggest that Gq/G11-dependent signaling can critically contribute to G13-mediated stress fiber formation induced through some receptors, although the expression of constitutively active Gq-proteins alone is not sufficient to form stress fibers (9Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 14Buhl A.M. Johnson M.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Experiments in cardiomyocytes have indicated an involvement of Gαq in receptor-induced and Rho-mediated actin reorganization (38Sah V. Hoshijima M. Chien K. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 49: 31185-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It has been reported that stimulation of a voltage-dependent calcium channel in rat portal vein myocytes through AT1A receptors involves G13(39Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Morel J.-L. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10095-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, we could not detect any G12/G13-dependent actin polymerization in fibroblasts activated through AT1Areceptors. This may suggest that G13 is indirectly involved in calcium-current regulation via AT1A receptors. Stimulation of ETA receptors effectively triggered Gα12-dependent stress fiber formation. In contrast, the activation of ETB receptors failed to induce stress fiber assembly. These results suggest that ETAreceptors activate G12, whereas ETB receptors do not couple to G12 family members, which evoke actin reorganization. We have previously demonstrated that the LPA receptor induces stress fiber formation selectively via Gα13. By labeling activated G-proteins with [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide in plasma membrane preparations, it was shown that LPA activates both G12 and G13, but that this activation of G12 was apparently not linked to stress fiber assembly (9Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To test a possible selective involvement of Gα12 and Gα13 in stress fiber formation through other receptors, we have used dominant negative forms of Gα12 and Gα13 and Gα13-deficient cells. Our data show that stress fiber formation induced through the thrombin, ETA, and V1A receptors was mediated by Gα12 and occurred in the absence of Gα13. In contrast, stress fiber accumulation induced through the LPA, B2, and 5-HT2C receptors was completely dependent on the presence of Gα13 and was not reduced by a dominant negative form of Gα12. This clearly shows that both Gα12 and Gα13 are capable of mediating receptor-induced stress fiber formation, although different receptors selectively recruit Gα12 or Gα13 for the regulation of actin stress fiber accumulation. The EGF receptor has been identified as a critical component in LPA/G13-mediated stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (9Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Using the EGF receptor-selective tyrphostin AG1478 and the dominant negative EGF receptor mutant EGFR-CD533, we now show that receptors utilizing either G12 or G13 for stress fiber formation can be further distinguished by the involvement of EGF receptors in the process of actin polymerization. Whereas EGF receptors contributed to the LPA, B2, and 5-HT2C receptor-mediated, Gα13-dependent stress fiber formation in wild-type fibroblasts, the Gα12-dependent stress fiber assembly induced through thrombin, ETA, and V1A receptors occurred via a different, EGF receptor-independent pathway. These results implicate the EGF receptor as a signaling intermediate of general importance in Gα13-dependent stress fiber formation in fibroblasts. Whereas no difference in the coupling of e.g. thrombin or LPA receptors to G12 and G13 has been observed in plasma membrane fractions, it is conceivable that receptors preferentially activate G12 or G13 under physiological conditions in intact cells. This could be caused by different affinities of receptors for G12 and G13 or by the subcellular localization of the involved downstream signaling components like EGF receptors. It is also possible that in the intact cell, G12 and G13 are specifically preassembled with individual receptors. Finally, regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins may selectively influence the Gα12- or Gα13-mediated signaling in a receptor-specific way. The recently described GEF for Rho, p115 RhoGEF, functions as an RGS protein for Gα12and Gα13 in vitro, but its GEF-activity is only regulated by Gα13 (17Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 18Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how p115 RhoGEF behaves in intact cells. In addition, other RGS proteins specific for Gα12 or Gα13 may exist. In summary, we have taken advantage of a Gαq/Gα11-deficient cell line and dominant negative mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 and Gα13-deficient cells to demonstrate that many Gq/G11-coupled receptors induce stress fiber formation in the absence of Gαq and Gα11and that this involves either a Gα12 or a Gα13/EGF receptor-dependent pathway.

WT-GSK, but not KM-GSK, reduced basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity without affecting the -fold stimulation of the enzyme by insulin. S9A-GSK similarly decreased cellular glycogen synthase activity, but also partially blocked insulin stimulation of the enzyme. S9A-GSK expression also markedly inhibited insulin stimulation of IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, but only weakly inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt/PKB phosphorylation and glucose uptake, with no effect on GLUT4 translocation. To further evaluate the role of GSK3β in insulin signaling, the GSK3β inhibitor lithium was used to mimic the consequences of insulin-stimulated GSK3β inactivation. Although lithium stimulated the incorporation of glucose into glycogen and glycogen synthase enzyme activity, the inhibitor was without effect on GLUT4 translocation and pp70 S6 kinase. Lithium stimulation of glycogen synthesis was insensitive to wortmannin, which is consistent with its acting directly on GSK3β downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These data support the hypothesis that GSK3β contributes to insulin regulation of glycogen synthesis, but is not responsible for the increase in glucose transport.

These data support the hypothesis that GSK3β contributes to insulin regulation of glycogen synthesis, but is not responsible for the increase in glucose transport. The peptide hormone insulin elicits a broad array of metabolic responses. In muscle and adipose tissue, insulin promotes the storage of sugar by coordinately accelerating both the rate of glucose entry into the cell and glycogen synthase activity. The former is mediated by the insulin-dependent redistribution of glucose transport proteins (GLUT4) from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane (1Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 239-297Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the latter by multisite dephosphorylation of the enzyme coupled with activation by the soluble metabolite glucose 6-phosphate (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although much progress has been made characterizing the molecular signaling events emanating from the insulin receptor and progressing to these targets, the complete pathway has not yet been elucidated. The general purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative contribution of the serine/threonine kinase GSK3β 1The abbreviations used are: GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. to insulin regulation of these molecular events. GSK3β was originally identified based on its kinase activity toward an in vitro substrate, glycogen synthase (3Parker P.J. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have described roles for the enzyme in many different cellular processes. For example, the potent GSK3β inhibitor lithium was used to identify roles for the enzyme in spore and stalk development inDictyostelium (4Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A critical role for GSK3β in pattern formation has been confirmed through investigation of theDrosophila ortholog shaggy/zeste-white 3 (6Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of GSK3β in cultured cells led to the proposal of a role for the enzyme in the initiation of apoptosis (7Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Two types of studies support the view that GSK3β could contribute to insulin-stimulated anabolic metabolism. First, insulin inhibits GSK3β kinase activity in multiple insulin-responsive tissues (8Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Second, GSK3β inhibits basal glycogen synthase activity when transfected into transformed cells (14Eldar-Finkelman H. Argast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since the effects of GSK3β on glycogen metabolism have only been evaluated in vitro or in non-insulin-responsive tissues, the relative contribution of GSK3β to regulation of these metabolic events by insulin remains unclear. Moreover, since Akt/PKB and PI3K have been implicated in insulin regulation of numerous other metabolic processes (15Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Biochem. Soc.

These cells are a well recognized system for investigating insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, as they respond to physiological doses of insulin with increases in glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation, glycogen synthesis, and lipogenesis. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GSK3β mutants in these cells, as well as treatment with the GSK3β inhibitor lithium, was used to disrupt coupling of insulin regulation of the enzyme. Data support a model whereby GSK3β inhibition contributes to insulin regulation of glycogen synthesis, but not GLUT4 translocation. These results further indicate that GSK3β can inhibit insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI3K activity, but has little effect on downstream signaling events. Crystalline porcine insulin was a gift of Lilly. Polyclonal anti-IRS-1 antibodies were a gift from Bayer (West Haven, CT). Polyclonal anti-pp70 S6 kinase antibodies were generously provided by Dr. Margaret Chou (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Rabbit phospho-specific anti-S6 antibodies were raised against a peptide resembling the major phosphorylation site in ribosomal subunit protein S6 (CRRLSpSpLRASpTSKSpEESpQK) by Rockland Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-hemagglutinin antibodies were from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Berkeley, CA). Antibodies against GSK3β were purchased from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY) or Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkintown, MA). An antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated serine 9 regulatory site on human GSK3β and less well the mouse enzyme was also from Quality Controlled Biochemicals. cDNAs encoding human wild-type GSK3β (WT-GSK) and catalytically inactive GSK3β (KM-GSK) were generously provided by Peter Klein (University of Pennsylvania). Additionally, the serine 9 regulatory site on WT-GSK was mutated to alanine (S9A-GSK) by polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of the latter was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The relative activities of all three constructs are described elsewhere (14Eldar-Finkelman H. Argast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These constructs were subcloned into the vector pACCMV.pLpA and transferred to recombinant adenovirus by homologous recombination (19Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T.

A multiplicity of infection of 100 was used to infect 3T3-L1 adipocytes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% calf serum, with the virus being left on the cells for at least 16 h prior to its removal. Experiments were conducted 48 h after the initial addition of the virus. This method results in infection of >90% of the cells on the dish as assessed by expression of β-galactosidase. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes 1 day post-confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H-21 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1 μg/ml dexamethasone, and 112 μg/ml isobutylmethylxanthine. After 3 days, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H-21 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated in 6-well culture dishes were serum-deprived for 2 h in Leibovitz L-15 buffer supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated for 15 min with insulin and washed in glycogen synthase extraction buffer (100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)). Adipocytes were disrupted using a Teflon/glass homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged briefly at 2000 × g. The supernatant without the fat cake was assayed for enzyme activity as described previously (20Guinovart J.J. Salavert A. Massague J. Ciudad C. Salsas E. Itarte E. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and glycogen synthase activity is the activity measured in the presence of low (0.1 mm) glucose 6-phosphate divided by the activity in the presence of high (10 mm) glucose 6-phosphate. The incorporation of glucose into a glycogen pellet was determined as described previously (21Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Cells were serum-starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Two hours prior to solubilization, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C in Leibovitz L-15 buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed again in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in KRP buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.4), 0.9 mmMgSO4, and 0.9 mm CaCl2) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. For experiments using lithium, the indicated concentration of LiCl replaced an equal concentration of NaCl. Cells were solubilized in 66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 2% SDS additionally containing 1 mm vanadate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. DNA was sheared by sonication, and insoluble material was pelleted for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Methods for measuring glucose uptake rates and plasma membrane GLUT4 levels (using the plasma membrane “sheet” assay) have been described (16Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

For experiments involving lithium, cells were stepped down in KRP buffer with the indicated concentration of lithium replacing an equal concentration of NaCl. PI3K assays were performed using methods previously described (22Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F.

Recent studies further indicate that Akt/PKB is required for insulin inactivation of GSK3β in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing insulin receptors (12van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. Th. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and in vitroexperiments suggest that this is the result of Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of serine 9 (13Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). To investigate whether insulin and Akt/PKB stimulate phosphorylation of this regulatory residue in intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes, GSK3β was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a monoclonal anti-GSK3β antibody. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, GSK3β phosphorylation was detected using a phospho-specific antibody against the serine 9 portion of GSK3β. Insulin rapidly stimulated GSK3β phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with an empty vector (Fig.1 A). Moreover, stable expression of a constitutively active form of Akt/PKB (Myr-akt, described in Ref. 16Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) stimulated GSK3β phosphorylation in the absence of insulin (Fig. 1 A). Immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-GSK3β antibody confirmed that equal amounts of GSK3β were precipitated under all conditions (Fig. 1 B). Mock lanes denote immunoprecipitations done in the absence of cell lysates to visualize the IgG bands. To ascertain the role of GSK3β in insulin action, the effects of various overexpressed GSK3β constructs on glucose uptake and glycogen synthase enzyme activity were investigated. Using recombinant adenovirus, the wild-type (WT-GSK) and kinase-dead (KM-GSK) forms of GSK3β were expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, a GSK3β construct with the regulatory serine residue changed to alanine (S9A-GSK) was also expressed. A previous study characterized the relative activity of all three constructs, including their effects on basal glycogen synthase activity, in non-insulin-responsive 293T cells. To evaluate the levels of expression, whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting. All three constructs were overexpressed roughly 3–5-fold (Fig. 2 A) 48 h after infection with adenovirus. Moreover, immunofluorescent detection using an antibody against the hemagglutinin epitope revealed that 80–90% of the cells expressed S9A-GSK (Fig. 2 B) 48 h after infection. This is comparable to the percentage of cells that expressed a β-galactosidase gene when a similar infection protocol was used with a control virus. As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of WT-GSK, but not KM-GSK, decreased glycogen synthase enzyme activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with reductions apparent under both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Nonetheless, insulin still stimulated glycogen synthase activity ∼2–2.5-fold over the new, lowered basal value, which was comparable to the stimulation induced in uninfected or KM-GSK-infected cells. Overexpression of the uninhibitable S9A-GSK construct similarly reduced basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity. More important, however, S9A-GSK also reduced the -fold stimulation of glycogen synthase activity by insulin (Fig. 3). This finding suggests a role for GSK3β phosphorylation in insulin regulation of glycogen synthase. Akt/PKB has been implicated as a mediator of other metabolic responses to insulin, including glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation (15Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Biochem. Soc.

Since GSK3β is one of only a few identified substrates for Akt, we also sought evidence of the role of GSK3β in these insulin-regulated events. Insulin stimulated the uptake of non-metabolizable 2-deoxyglucose significantly in uninfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overexpression of S9A-GSK slightly inhibited rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in both the presence and absence of insulin (Fig.4). However, the dose-response curves for both infected and uninfected cells were nearly identical. The major effect of insulin on glucose uptake is due to the translocation of the GLUT4 isoform from intracellular storage sites to the plasma membrane (1Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 239-297Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The commonly utilized GLUT4 sheet assay was used to measure plasma membrane levels of GLUT4 (16Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated on coverslips were sonified, liberating cellular structures from the coverslip, but leaving an intact sheet containing the plasma membrane with its cytosolic face exposed. Probing the sheet with antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 reflects the total amount of GLUT4 on the membrane. Expression of KM-GSK, WT-GSK, and S9A-GSK had no effect on plasma membrane GLUT4 levels (Fig.5), demonstrating that GSK3β does not contribute to insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation. Collectively, these data indicate that GSK3β is unlikely to mediate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.Figure 5Effect of GSK3β overexpression on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with WT-GSK, KM-GSK, or S9A-GSK adenoviruses 48 h prior to stimulation with insulin (Ins; 100 nm) for the times indicated. Following stimulation, plasma membrane sheets were prepared by sonication. GLUT4 levels on fixed sheets were determined by immunofluorescence using anti-GLUT4 antibodies. Data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further investigate the consequences of GSK3β phosphorylation, experiments were conducted with the GSK3β inhibitor lithium. Lithium specifically inhibits GSK3β in the millimolar range, but has no effect on numerous other protein kinases, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and casein kinase II (4Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Lithium thus mimics the effects of physiological GSK3β inhibition, indicating which of insulin's metabolic actions can be mediated solely by its effects on GSK3β. A 2-h treatment with 50 mm lithium stimulated glycogen synthesis 60–70% as well as insulin in control 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 6). Lithium-stimulated glycogen synthesis was not sensitive to wortmannin, which inhibited insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis completely. Interestingly, lithium and insulin added simultaneously stimulated glycogen synthesis greater than either agent alone. Lithium also stimulated glycogen synthase enzyme activity (Fig. 7) and, once again, was partially additive with insulin. Under conditions in which lithium stimulated glycogen synthesis (Fig.8 A), it weakly stimulated glucose uptake (Fig. 8 B). To determine whether lithium could mimic the effects of insulin on GLUT4 translocation, plasma membrane GLUT4 levels from lithium-treated cells were also determined using the aforementioned sheet assay. Lithium did not stimulate GLUT4 translocation in the absence of insulin (Fig. 8 C), nor did it augment insulin-stimulated glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation (data not shown).Figure 7Effect of lithium on glycogen synthase activity. Glycogen synthase experiments were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were serum-deprived for 2 h prior to homogenization. Lithium (50 mm) and insulin (100 nm) were present for the last 60 and 15 min prior to homogenization, respectively. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” LiCl replaced an equal concentration of NaCl in the buffer to prevent osmolarity changes. Glycogen synthase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the data presented are mean -fold stimulations ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8Effect of lithium on glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake, and GLUT4 translocation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-deprived for 2 h prior to assay of glycogen synthesis (A), glucose uptake (B), or GLUT4 translocation (C).

All results are normalized to the response achieved with a 10-min stimulation by 100 nm insulin. The data presented are means ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although GSK3β had no effect on glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation, a prior report indicated that GSK3β is a negative regulator of IRS-1-mediated activation of PI3K in transformed cells (23Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consequently, GSK3β was proposed as a possible contributor to insulin resistance. To evaluate whether GSK3β also inhibited signaling in insulin-responsive 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was assayed in S9A-GSK-expressing cells (Fig.9). S9A-GSK expression markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated activation of PI3K in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. However, S9A-GSK did not reduce insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and ribosomal S6 protein (Fig.10). No effect was seen at submaximal doses of insulin either (data not shown). S9A-GSK expression did not affect the insulin-stimulated mobility shift for IRS-1 separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 10). Thus, if GSK3 is inhibiting PI3K by direct phosphorylation of IRS-1, the kinases must be utilizing a subset of those sites phosphorylated in response to insulin or a distinct set of sites. Lithium, under conditions in which glycogen synthase was activated (Fig. 8), did not affect insulin stimulation of PI3K, Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and ribosomal S6 protein (Fig.11). These latter studies also indicate that GSK3β is unlikely to mediate insulin and Akt stimulation of pp70 S6 kinase.Figure 10Effect of GSK3β on phosphorylation of IRS-1, Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and ribosomal S6 protein. 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with S9A-GSK or empty vector were treated with or without insulin (100 nm) for 15 min as indicated.

Definitive assignment of particular metabolic functions to specific signaling cascades has been a recent challenge in insulin action research. Although insulin activates the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, which contributes to its regulation of DNA synthesis, studies from multiple laboratories have excluded these signaling molecules from insulin regulation of glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation, or glycogen synthesis (21Wiese R.J.

The studies described herein demonstrate further divergence in insulin signaling downstream of PI3K and Akt. Although GSK3β is likely to contribute to insulin and Akt regulation of glycogen synthase, it apparently does not contribute to their activation of glucose transport, GLUT4 translocation, and pp70 S6 kinase. Evidence supporting a role for GSK3β inactivation in insulin regulation of glycogen synthase includes the following. 1) Insulin and constitutively active forms of Akt/PKB stimulated phosphorylation of an inhibitory residue on GSK3β (Fig. 1). 2) Insulin and constitutively active forms of Akt/PKB inhibit the activity of GSK3β in intact cells (9Hurel S.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). 3) Expression of wild-type (but not catalytically inactive) GSK3β inhibited basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity without affecting the -fold stimulation of the enzyme by insulin (Fig. 3). 4) Expression of a GSK3β mutant incapable of being phosphorylated on this inhibitory residue similarly decreased basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity, but also partially blocked the -fold stimulation of the enzyme by insulin (Fig.3). 5) Treatment with lithium, which mimics insulin's inhibitory effects on GSK3β, stimulated glycogen synthesis and glycogen synthase enzyme activity in the absence of increased GLUT4 translocation (Figs.Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10). Since the phosphate groups on glycogen synthase turn over rapidly (33Smith R.L. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of GSK3β could serve as a physiologically relevant mechanism for regulating glycogen synthase activity. Previous studies suggest that GSK3β inhibition is not insulin's only mechanism for stimulating glycogen accumulation. In a prior study in a different line of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin was capable of stimulating glycogen synthase despite the fact that GSK3β was either not detectable or present in very low amounts (32Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Th. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Similarly, another group reported that GSK3β expression decreases during 3T3-L1 differentiation, thus switching insulin's primary mechanism for glycogen synthase activation from GSK3β inactivation to protein phosphatase activation (8Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast to these reports, GSK3β was clearly present in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes used in this study, and its expression was unaltered by adipogenesis (data not shown). Subtle differences in cell lines or differentiation conditions could account for discrepancies between these studies. Although the data presented above strongly support a role for GSK3β inhibition in glycogen synthesis, these studies also indicate the existence of an alternative pathway. First, insulin still stimulated glycogen synthase partially in cells infected with S9A-GSK, although its stimulation was significantly compromised. Second, lithium was partially additive with insulin in activating glycogen synthesis and glycogen synthase. The latter observation is particularly suggestive since lithium is likely to be a more effective inhibitor of GSK3β than insulin. Although these data could result from an effect of lithium independent of the inhibition of GSK3β, this is unlikely in view of the failure of other investigators to identify such a site of action (4Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). More probable is that the coupling of insulin stimulation of a protein phosphatase with its inhibition of GSK3β is the mechanism for its complete regulation of glycogen synthase. A second role suggested by the literature for GSK3β is as a regulator of glucose uptake.

Numerous sporadic reports over the last 30 years have attributed to lithium an “insulinomimetic” effect,i.e. the ability to stimulate both glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in various systems (39Clausen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 150: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40Cheng K. Creacy S. Larner J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 56: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cheng K. Creacy S.

Physiol. 1997; 36: E514-E520Google Scholar). In some of these studies, the effect of lithium on glucose uptake was smaller than that observed on glycogen synthesis, whereas in others it was not. Nonetheless, the results presented above do not support the existence of a role for GSK3β in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Although, in the experiments presented above, lithium did weakly stimulate glucose uptake, it did not stimulate GLUT4 translocation. This conclusion was further strengthened by the finding that WT-GSK and S9A-GSK expression did not alter insulin stimulation of glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation. A third role postulated for GSK3β is as a negative regulator of IRS-1-associated PI3K and as a contributor to insulin resistance (23Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The results presented above confirm that GSK3β can inhibit insulin-stimulated PI3K activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but suggest that this has little effect on insulin stimulation of glucose metabolism: under conditions in which S9A-GSK inhibited PI3K, it had no effect on glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation; neither S9A-GSK nor lithium affected insulin stimulation of Akt/PKB or pp70 S6 kinase phosphorylation. Several mechanisms could account for the lack of correlation between IRS-1-associated PI3K activity and glucose uptake rates. First, only a small amount of PI3K activity might be required for full stimulation of glucose transport. Most studies evaluating the necessity of PI3K have utilized methods (such as potent PI3K inhibitors or dominant-negative antibodies) that completely eliminate PI3K activity. A partial inhibition of PI3K activity may not significantly affect insulin stimulation of downstream metabolic events. Alternatively, compensatory mechanisms could contribute to the requisite activation of PI3K. For example, in IRS-1 knockout mice, other members of the IRS family take over the responsibilities of IRS-1, stimulating PI3K to nearly normal levels (45Patti M.E. Sun X.J. Bruening J.C. Araki E. Lipes M.A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent work indicates that an IRS-independent, yet PI3K-dependent pathway contributes to insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation (46Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25139-25147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,47Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gustafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such alternative mechanisms for activating PI3K could account for the nearly normal stimulation of glucose transport and downstream signaling events. Although GSK3β was discovered over 15 years ago, its contribution to insulin signaling has not been fully addressed. The recent observation of molecular events linking activated insulin receptors to GSK3β rekindled interest in the enzyme. This identified signaling cascade, which includes PI3K and Akt/PKB, is postulated to regulate numerous metabolic responses to insulin (15Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Biochem. Soc.

In the studies above, we carefully evaluated both the effect of disrupting insulin inhibition of the enzyme and the consequences of inhibiting the enzyme in the absence of other signaling events. The studies confirm that GSK3β is likely to contribute to insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis, but not glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation.

Here, we show that Ded1p purified from Escherichia coli has an ATPase activity, which is stimulated by various RNA substrates. Using an RNA strand-displacement assay, we show that Ded1p has also an ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity. Hydrolysis of ATP is required for this activity: the replacement of ATP by a nonhydrolyzable analog or a mutation in the DEAD motif abolishing ATPase activity results in loss of RNA unwinding. We find that cells harboring a Ded1 protein with this mutated DEAD motif are nonviable, suggesting that the ATPase and RNA helicase activities of this protein are essential to the cell. Finally, RNA binding measurements indicate that the presence of ATP, but not ADP, increases the affinity of Ded1p for duplexversus single-stranded RNA; we discuss how this differential effect might drive the unwinding reaction.

DEAD-box proteins form a large family of putative RNA helicases that show sequence similarity to eIF4A, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor. All members of the DEAD-box family share eight conserved amino acid motifs, including the characteristic sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD in the single-letter code) that inspired their name (1Linder P. Lasko P.F. Ashburner M. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Schnier J. Slonimsky P.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons identified the closely related DEAH- and DExH-box families, which together with the DEAD-box proteins, form the helicase superfamily II (2Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The DEAH and DExH families notably include DNA helicases involved in DNA replication and recombination. The putative RNA helicases of superfamily II are found in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans. Although they are involved in very diverse cellular functions, such as pre-mRNA splicing, rRNA processing, and mRNA export, translation, and decay, they are all supposed to share in common an RNA helicase activity (3Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 4Fuller-Pace F.V. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 271-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This activity has been inferred from the ability of eIF4A to melt out mRNA structure (5Ray B.K. Lawson T.G. Kramer J.C. Cladaras M.H. Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Merrick W.C. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7651-7658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to dissociate an RNA duplex in vitro (6Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), in an ATP-dependent manner. However, although NTPase activity has been demonstrated for all purified DEAD-box and related proteins, RNA helicase activity has been characterized for only a few of them and remains conjectural in most cases. Nevertheless, numerous steps of gene expression are likely to require RNA helicase activity, either to unwind RNA secondary structures or to rearrange large RNA structures, or even to disrupt RNA-protein interactions. For example, transient base pairings between small nuclear RNAs and between small nuclear RNAs and pre-mRNA, which occur during pre-mRNA splicing, are often mutually exclusive and thus need to form and dissociate sequentially. At least eight DEAD-box and related proteins have thus far been shown to be required for splicing in yeast and may accomplish these structural rearrangements (7Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Similarly, 13 DEAD-box are assumed to be involved in extensive rearrangements between pre-rRNA and ribosomal proteins/small nucleolar RNAs during ribosome biogenesis (8de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Translation initiation in eukaryotes also presumably requires removal of secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNAs for the binding of the small ribosomal subunit and its migration toward the AUG codon (“scanning”) (9Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). Indeed, insertion of stable stem-loop structures in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNAs inhibits translation initiation in both higher eukaryotes (e.g. 10, 11) and yeast (e.g. 12, 13). In mammals, unwinding of these structures has been attributed to the cap-binding complex eIF4F, because it shows an RNA helicase activity in vitro (6Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and its overexpression in vivo facilitates translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5′-untranslated regions (14Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This complex consists of eIF4E, which binds to the cap structure at the 5′-end of mRNAs, eIF4G, and eIF4A, which is the active helicase component. Another factor, eIF4B, may also be involved in the unwinding process because it is required for the helicase activity of eIF4Ain vitro (6Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 15Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of conservation of translation in eukaryotes, the cap-binding complex in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not equivalent to mammalian eIF4F, because yeast eIF4A is not found in the complex (16Lanker S. Müller P.P. Altmann M. Goyer C. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21167-21171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, yeast eIF4A has been shown to be active in RNA unwinding in vitro with mammalian eIF4B (17Blum S. Schmid S.R. Pause A. Buser P. Linder P. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7664-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but not with its putative yeast counterpart, Tif3p (18Altmann M. Wittmer B. Méthot N. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3820-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional yeast factors are required to catalyze this reaction. We and others (19de la Cruz J. Iost I. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Chuang R.-Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.-H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) have recently described another DEAD-box protein, Ded1p, required for translation initiation inS. cerevisiae. We isolated the DED1 gene as a multicopy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in eIF4E. Analyses of its suppressor activity, of polysome profiles ofded1 mutant strains, and of synthetic lethal interactions with different translation initiation mutants indicated that Ded1p has a role in translation initiation (19de la Cruz J. Iost I. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Consistently, immunodepletion of Ded1p in an in vitro translation system abolished translation activity (20Chuang R.-Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.-H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Genetic data suggest that Ded1p and eIF4A play independent roles in translation initiation, but the nature of these roles is yet unknown. Here, we investigate the biochemical activities of Ded1p and show that it has RNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities, both activities depending on the integrity of the DEAD motif. RNA binding studies also show that the affinity of Ded1p for RNA can be modulated by ATP and ADP, suggesting how RNA unwinding may be driven by ATP hydrolysis. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derivatives of W303 (MATa/MATαura3-1/ura3-1 ade2-1/ade2-1 his3-11, 15/his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112/leu2-3, 112 trp1-1/trp1-1). The strain ID2 (MATa/MATαDED1/ded1::HIS3MX6) was obtained by disrupting one DED1 open reading frame copy with the HIS3MX6 marker module (21Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) in W303. ID2-2A (MATαded1::HIS3MX6) is a meiotic segregant of ID2 that requires a plasmid-borne copy of DED1 for viability. The inability of ID2-2A to lose the resident YCplac33-DED1plasmid (19de la Cruz J. Iost I. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) was tested by plasmid shuffling (22Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), using 5-fluoro-orotic acid plates. Standard yeast genetic techniques and media were as described (23Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). To express an N-terminal His6-tagged Ded1 fusion protein from its cognate promoter, a fusion polymerase chain reaction was performed (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Briefly, two fragments with sequence overlap were generated in a first polymerase chain reaction series with YCplac33-DED1 as a template and the oligonucleotide couples 5′-GCAGAGGCTAGCAGAATTAC-3′ (5′-DED1 homology region, external oligonucleotide)/5′-GTGATGGTGGTGATGGTGCATATG AATATGAAATGCTTTTCTTGTTG-3′ (the DED1 homology region is in boldface, and the overlapping part containing the 6-histidine tag is underlined; anNdeI site has also been introduced (italics)), and 5′-CATATGCACCATCACCACCATCAC GCTGAACTGAGCGAACAAG-3′ (same conventions as above; the DED1 sequence starts at the second codon)/5′-GGCAACGATAGGGACGGAG-3′ (3′-DED1 homology region, external oligonucleotide) as primers. The polymerase chain reaction products, together with the external primers, were used for the fusion polymerase chain reaction. The final product was cloned as aPstI-EagI fragment into thePstI-EagI-restricted YCplac111-DED1(19de la Cruz J. Iost I. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) to yield YCplac111-His6-DED1. This construct complemented the ded1 null allele to the wild-type extent. The NdeI-EcoRI fragment of YCplac111-His6-DED1 plasmid was cloned intoNdeI-EcoRI-restricted pET-22b. The resulting pET22b-His6-DED1 plasmid was transformed into MO20-1, a BL21(DE3) derivative of Escherichia coli that is deficient in RNaseE activity (25Iost I. Dreyfus M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3252-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Then, they were harvested, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (30 min at 40,000 ×g), the supernatant was loaded on a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). After two washes with 30 and 60 mm imidazole, the His6-Ded1p was eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were adjusted to 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. We usually obtained around 0.6 mg of Ded1p from 200 ml of culture. The protein has a tendency to precipitate; where necessary, precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. To change the glutamic acid residue of the DEAD motif into alanine, the pET22b-His6-DED1 plasmid was mutagenizedin vitro with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene. A 613-nt-long BamHI-BstBI fragment from candidates carrying the desired mutation was entirely sequenced and cloned into the BamHI-BstBI-restricted original pET22b-His6-DED1 plasmid to eliminate eventual mutations outside the fragment. The mutant protein was purified as for the wild-type. The NdeI-SalI fragment from the mutated pET22b-His6-DED1plasmid was cloned into the NdeI-SalI-restricted YCp111-His6-DED1 plasmid. ATPase activity was monitored continuously by a coupled spectrophotometric method (26Panuska J.R. Goldthwait D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5208-5214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method uses pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to link hydrolysis of ATP to oxidation of NADH, which results in a decrease in the absorbance at 338 nm. Assays were performed at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 0.4 ml, in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 300 μm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 3 units/ml of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. RNA and protein were added as indicated in Figs. 2 and 3. Absorbance data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph 3.0 (Synergy). The steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis equals that of NADH oxidation, which was quantified using 6300 m−1cm−1 for the extinction coefficient of NADH.Figure 3Stimulation of Ded1p ATPase activity by various substrates. The y axis represents the rate of ATP hydrolysis (in μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/μmol of protein). Each reaction contained 30 nm Ded1p and either 20 μg/ml RNA (total or poly(A)+ mRNA from yeast, 25 S and 18 S yeast rRNA), 50 μg/ml homopolymer RNA (poly(A), poly(U), poly(C), poly(G)), or 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA; the concentrations of each RNA species were previously determined to induce maximal ATPase activity. DNA (50 μg/ml) was either from S. cerevisiae or E. coli.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Total RNA from W303 yeast strain was extracted by the acid-phenol method (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Poly(A)+(polyadenylated) RNA was prepared from total RNA using an oligo(dT) column. The 18 and 25 S rRNAs were prepared from 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits that were separated by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient as described in Ref. 19de la Cruz J. Iost I. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. Their purity was checked by gel electropohoresis. Poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U) homopolymers and yeast tRNA were purchased from Sigma. RNA substrates used for helicase and RNA binding assays were prepared as described (28Méthot N. Pause A. Hershey J.W.B. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, two transcripts of 43 and 68 nucleotides were synthesized in vitro from pGEM-3Z and pGEM MO1/2 vectors, the shorter one being labeled with [α-32P]GTP (specific activity, 2.5 × 106 cpm/pmol). The nucleotide sequences of the two strands are as follows: 43-nt strand, 5′-GAAUACUCAAGCUUGCAUGCCUGCAGGUCGACUCUAGAGGAUC-3′; 68-nt strand, 5′-GGGAGACCGGAAUUCCCCAUGGCUGACUAAUUUUUUUUAUUUAUGCAGAGGGGGGAUCCUCUAGAGUC-3′ (duplex region is underlined). These transcripts were annealed and the resulting partial duplex, which consists of a 14-base pair region flanked by 5′ ss 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate; YCp, yeast centromeric plasmid. overhangs of 29 and 54 nucleotides (see Fig. 4 A), was purified by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its specific activity was calculated to be 2.5 × 106 cpm/pmol. We also constructed a 55-base pair “complete” duplex by annealing a 64-nt RNA synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase from EcoRI-restricted pGEM3 plasmid (labeled with [α-32P]GTP) and a 60-nt RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase from Hind III-restricted pGEM3 plasmid. Reaction mixtures (15 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 70 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 15 units RNasin, 45 fmol (3 nm) of partial duplex, and, where indicated, 2 mm ATP. Reactions were initiated by addition of Ded1p, as indicated in Fig. 4. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 μl of a solution containing 1.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, bromphenol blue, xylene cyanol, and 250 μg/ml proteinase K. For positive controls (cf. Fig. 4, lane 1), duplex RNA was separated into monomers by heating at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by rapid cooling in ice. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. Labeled RNAs were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a Fuji Bas 1000 phosphorimager. The percentage of unwinding was calculated using the formula ((monomer/total) − (monomerø/totalø)) × 100, where “total” is the amount of monomer plus duplex, and ø refers to the numbers observed in absence of ATP. RNA substrates for the binding reactions were either the duplex used in the helicase assay, or the labeled 43-nt transcript used to construct this duplex, or, in some experiments, the complete duplex. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 70 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 fmol (2 nm) of RNA, and varying concentrations of Ded1p. When present, nucleotides (ADP and AMP-PNP (Sigma)) were used at a final concentration of 2 mm. Samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature before filtering. A “double-filter” assay was performed following the method of Ref. 29Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, using a dot-blot apparatus. The RNA-protein complexes were retained on nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), whereas free RNA was retained on a charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) placed underneath. Membranes were washed before and after loading the samples with 1 ml of ice-cold reaction buffer. The amount of RNA present on each membrane was quantified using a Fuji Bas 1000 phosphorimager, and the fraction of RNA bound to the protein was determined. All assays were corrected for the small fraction of bound RNA in absence of protein (on average, 1.5%). Binding curves were obtained by plotting the fraction of bound RNA versus protein concentration. To facilitate the biochemical characterization of Ded1p, we overexpressed it in E. coli as a fusion protein with a 6-histidine tag inserted at its N terminus. To test the functionality of the modified Ded1 protein (hereafter called His6-Ded1p) in S. cerevisiae, the fusion gene under its own promoter was cloned into a yeast centromeric plasmid (YCp, low copy number). The resulting plasmid (YCplac111-His6-DED1) or a control plasmid harboring the untagged DED1 gene (YCplac111-DED1) was transformed into strain ID2-2A (YCplac33-DED1). Upon plasmid shuffling on 5-fluoro-orotic acid plates and subsequent restreaking on YPD plates, His6-DED1complemented the ded1 null allele to the wild-type extent at all temperatures tested (16, 30, and 37 °C), indicating that the modified Ded1p was functional in vivo (data not shown). The His6-DED1 gene was then placed under the T7 promoter, and the resulting plasmid (pET22b-His6-DED1) was introduced into a derivative of the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The His6-Ded1p was overexpressed after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (Fig.1). Although a small portion was insoluble, most of the His6-Ded1p was found in the soluble fraction of cell extracts. The recombinant protein was purified on a nickel-agarose column and was about 90% pure as judged on a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained acrylamide gel (Fig. 1). The apparent molecular mass of Ded1p (about 68 kDa) coincides with that estimated by sequence analysis. The identity of the protein was verified by Western blot analysis using anti-polyhistidine antibodies (data not shown). The polypeptides that co-eluted are most likely E. colicontaminating proteins rather than degradation products, because they also appeared in eluates of E. coli extracts that harbored pET22b without the DED1 gene. To analyze the importance of the DEAD motif on Ded1p properties, we constructed a mutated allele in which the highly conserved glutamic acid residue was substituted for an alanine. The DEAD and DExH motifs are variants of the Walker ATPase B motif and the corresponding aspartic and glutamic acid residues have been shown to participate in ATP hydrolysis (15Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The mutated DED1 allele was inserted into YCplac111, which was then transformed into the ID2-2A (DED1-URA3) strain. The transformants were unable to grow on 5-fluoro-orotic acid medium, showing that the mutated protein is not functional in vivo. This protein, hereafter called the DAAD mutant, was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as for the wild-type protein. The yield and purity were similar to those obtained with the wild-type; in particular, the same contaminating polypeptides were observed. The ATPase activity was measured continuously by a spectrophotometric method in which ATP hydrolysis is coupled to NADH oxidation, which is itself monitored by measurement of A 338 nm (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.2 represents typical raw data generated by the ATPase assay. In the absence of RNA, no change ofA 338 nm could be detected, indicating that Ded1p has no ATPase activity by itself. In the presence of total yeast RNA, the absorbance decreased linearly with time due to the oxidation of NADH until all NADH was exhausted. The slope of the decrease is proportional to the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Increasing Ded1p concentration 4-fold resulted in a 4-fold increase of this rate. Addition of RNase A during the reaction immediately abolished the activity, confirming that it was dependent on the added RNA (data not shown). Thus, Ded1p exhibits an RNA-dependent ATPase activity characteristic of members of the DEAD-box family. From kinetic analyses performed in the presence of saturating concentration of total yeast RNA, we determined the K m for ATP to be around 300 μm and the V max to be 5–10 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein, which corresponds to a turnover number of 340–680 μmol of ATP/min/μmol of protein. The DAAD mutant showed a 60-fold reduced rate of ATP hydrolysis, indicating that the DEAD motif is important for the ATPase activity. It also excluded the possibility that the activity observed with the wild-type protein was due to minor E. coli contaminants. To test for a possible specificity of the ATPase reaction toward the RNA substrate, we compared a variety of RNAs in the assay, using saturating RNA and ATP concentrations in each case. As shown on Fig.3, most RNAs tested activated the ATPase activity, but at different levels. The highest activity was observed with poly(A)+ mRNAs and rRNAs, whereas homopolymers and tRNA were far less efficient. Total RNA from E. coli also stimulated the ATPase activity; in contrast, DNA, whether ss or ds, was inactive in this assay. To test whether Ded1p has RNA helicase activity, we examined its ability to displace a partial duplex RNA (called “duplex”), as in Ref. 6Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar. To this end, we constructed a standard substrate consisting of a 68-nt RNA annealed over 14 nucleotides to a shorter radiolabeled 43-nt RNA (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig.4 B, the duplex migrated much slower than the 43-nt ssRNA (compare lanes 2 and 1). The reactions contained 45 fmol (3 nm) of the RNA duplex and were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with different amounts of Ded1p. The helicase activity was monitored by determining the amount of 43-nt ssRNA (called “monomer”) released from the duplex. In a reaction mixture containing a large excess of Ded1p, but no ATP, no duplex dissociation was detected (lane 2). In the presence of ATP, the amount of monomer increased with increasing concentrations of Ded1p (lanes 3–8), showing that Ded1p has an ATP-dependent helicase activity. Quantification of the duplex and monomer showed that 90% of the duplex was dissociated in presence of 50 nmprotein, but dissociation was weaker with lower concentrations (see the legend of Fig. 4). Thus, a 15-fold excess of protein was required for nearly complete dissociation. The reason for this requirement is discussed below. We also measured the unwinding activity as a function of time and found that in the presence of excess protein (80 nm), maximal dissociation was reached within 1–2 min (data not shown). The DAAD mutant, which is deficient for ATPase activity, was unable to dissociate the duplex (Fig. 4 B, lanes 9 and 10); moreover, the wild-type protein did not dissociate the duplex when ATP was replaced by AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP (data not shown). These results indicate that helicase activity requires ATP hydrolysis. To investigate further the unwinding activity of Ded1p and the role played by ATP hydrolysis, we examined whether ATP and ADP influence the binding of Ded1p to RNA. We used a filter binding assay in which RNA-protein complexes are retained by a nitrocellulose membrane and free RNA by a charged nylon membrane (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The substrates used were either a duplex of 55 base pairs containing ss 5′-ends of only 5 and 9 nucleotides (called complete duplex), the partial duplex substrate used in the helicase assay, or its 43-nt monomer. The ability of Ded1p to bind these species was determined by incubating a fixed amount of RNA (40 fmol, 2 nm) with increasing amounts of Ded1p and measuring the amount of protein-bound RNA in each case. Fig.5 A shows that whereas Ded1p had a marked affinity for the monomer (the majority of the RNA molecules were retained on the filter for Ded1p concentrations above 100 nm, with an average K d of 20 nm), it bound to the complete duplex extremely weakly, if at all (no more than 1% of the input RNA was retained even at the highest Ded1p concentration used). In contrast, Ded1p could bind to the partial duplex, suggesting that this binding can be partially or totally ascribed to the long 5′ ss extensions of this molecule. However, the percentage of input RNA bound was much lower than with the monomer, particularly at low Ded1p concentrations. Because, even at the highest concentrations used, no more than 35% could be bound, it is difficult to decide whether the majority of the partial duplex molecules bind Ded1p with an extremely weak affinity, or whether only a subpopulation is responsible for the weak binding. We also measured the RNA binding capacity of the DAAD mutant protein. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the mutant bound to RNA with nearly the same affinity as the wild-type. Thus, ATP hydrolysis is not required for Ded1p binding to RNA. Similar results have been reported for other RNA helicases (30Weng Y. Czaplinski K. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5477-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4727-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kim D.W. Kim J. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9400-9409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then analyzed the effects of nucleotides (ATP and ADP) on the RNA binding properties of the wild-type Ded1 protein (Fig.6). To avoid ATP hydrolysis and duplex unwinding during the measurements, we used a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, AMP-PNP. To check that the binding of AMP-PNP mimics that of ATP, we tested its ability to compete with ATP in the ATPase assay, using subsaturating ATP concentrations (half the determinedK m). Equimolar and 5- and 10-fold excesses of AMP-PNP with respect to ATP, resulted in 50, 75, and 80% inhibition of the ATPase activity, respectively (not shown). Therefore, AMP-PNP can compete with ATP in the ATPase reaction and thus presumably binds to Ded1p similarly. Now, whereas AMP-PNP had a modest effect on the binding of Ded1p to the monomer (the maximal percentage of bound RNA remained nearly the same, and the apparent K ddecreased slightly to 12 nm), it affected much more drastically the binding to the partial duplex. Even at low Ded1p concentrations, the percentage of RNA bound was now quite appreciable, exceeding half the value observed with the monomer, and at high Ded1p concentration, it reached a plateau that was consistently above that observed with"

The mechanisms by which orexin gene expression is highly restricted to the distinct populations of neurons in these regions is of interest. As the first step toward unveiling these mechanisms, we cloned fragments of the human prepro-orexin gene and its corresponding cDNA to determine their complete primary structures. One way to study the physiological roles of the orexin neuronal system would be to examine the consequences of expression of exogenous genes in orexin-producing neurons of transgenic mice, thereby manipulating the cellular environment in vivo. However, such studies require the use of an appropriate gene promoter to direct gene expression to orexin-producing neurons. Human prepro-orexin gene promoter is indeed a good candidate for targeting gene expression to orexin-producing neurons. From these points of view, we made a prepro-orexin-lacZfusion gene and tested it in transgenic mice to identify a DNA fragment containing all the necessary elements for appropriate orexin expression. This approach would also be useful to examine the mechanism by which orexin gene expression is highly restricted to the LHA and adjacent regions. Because we found that the full-length rat orexin cDNA, which contains CTG triplet repeats (encoding the oligo-leucine stretch in the signal sequence), tends to cross-hybridize with a number of unrelated genes, we used a 0.29-kb segment of rat cDNA encoding Gln33–Ser128of prepro-orexin as a probe (1Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S. Arch J.R. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C,. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.S.

Approximately one million clones from a human genomic library (CLONTECH) were screened by plaque hybridization with this cDNA probe. We isolated several clones, and one of the longest clones, λghLig72–7, was analyzed further. We subcloned the 4.9-kb BamHI fragment of λghLig72–7 insert into the pBluescript SKII(+) vector (Stratagene), which we termed pghLig72Bam, and subjected it to further characterization by standard procedures. DNA sequencing was performed with Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed with LI-COR 4000L or IR4200 DNA sequencer following the manufacturer's instructions. A membrane that contains human genomic DNA digested with designated restriction enzymes was purchased from CLONTECH (Human GENO-BLOT; catalog number 7700-1). The 544-bp PstI fragment of human prepro-orexin gene was labeled by the random priming method with [α32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 5 × 108 cpm/mg and used as a probe. The membrane was incubated at 65 °C in a solution containing 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS, 150 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 5 ng/ml probe. The membrane was finally washed in a solution containing 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C for 48 h. An infrared dye (IRD41)-labeled primer 5′-GTAGCCGGGAAAGGAGATGTCTGTGGTGG-3′, which is complementary to position 72 to 100 of human prepro-orexin gene, was hybridized to 1 μg of human whole brain poly(A+) RNA (purchased fromCLONTECH) in a solution containing 80% formamide, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 40 mmPIPES (pH 6.4) at 30 °C. The hybridized RNA/primer was precipitated with ethanol and then subjected to reverse transcription with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The same primer was also used for dideoxy sequencing reaction with Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using λghLig72–7 DNA as a template. The samples were analyzed by 4000L DNA sequencer (LI-COR). Human cDNA encoding prepro-orexin was cloned by the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method using human hypothalamus Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH; catalog number 7429-1) as a template following the manufacturer's instruction. We made an oligonucleotide, 5′-ACATCTCCTTTCCCGGCTACCCCAC-3′, which corresponds to nucleotides 81–105 of human prepro-orexin gene (5′-untranslated region of human prepro-orexin mRNA) and used it as a specific primer. We performed the polymerase chain reaction using this primer and adaptor primer (AP-1 primer; CLONTECH) under the following conditions: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 70 °C for 1 min. A discrete 0.6-kb product containing the correct cDNA sequence was obtained and subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA sequence was determined by sequencing the products obtained from three independent 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions with a DNA sequencer (LI-COR IR4200) using T7 primer and M13 reverse primer. We performed polymerase chain reaction reaction using cloned human prepro-orexin gene as a template with two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GCAGCGGCCATTCCTTGG-3′ and 5′-AAGTCGACGGTGTCTGGCGCTCAGGGTG-3′. The product corresponded to position −118 to 122 of human prepro-orexin gene shown in Fig. 2 and had an artificial SalI site at the 3′-end. We digested this fragment with PstI and SalI and ligated it to the 1.6-kb PstI fragment of the cloned prepro-orexin gene (from −1.7 kb to 72 bp shown in Fig. 2). This DNA fragment was then ligated to BamHI-PstI (−3.15 -−1.7 kb) fragment of the gene. The resulting DNA fragment, which has a 3.15-kb 5′-flanking region and the whole length of the 5′-noncoding region, was used as the promoter that directs expression of the cloned Escherichia coli lacZ gene with an inserted SV40 antigen nuclear localization signal (nlacZ), derived from pnlacF (8Mercer E.H.

The 3′-end of nlacZ was ligated to murine protamine-1 (mPrm1) gene fragment (from +95 relative to the transcription start site to +625), which includes part of exon 1 and all of intron 1 and exon 2, including the poly(A+) adenylation signal and site. The resulting gene fragment free of vector sequence was isolated and injected into fertilized mouse eggs to generate transgenic founder animals. The presence and copy numbers of the transgene was identified by tail blot (9Brinster R.L. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M. Senear A.W. Warren R. Palmiter R.D.

Animals from these lines were examined by β-galactosidase histochemical technique to assess transgene expression in the tissues. The mice were perfused via the heart with phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3). Tissue fragments were further fixed for 60 min at 4 °C in the same fixative buffer. They were then rinsed three times with a solution containing 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. The staining reaction was then performed by incubating the tissue fragments for 16–24 h at 37 °C in a solution containing 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, and 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6. Post fixation was performed for 24–48 h in 10% formalin. Tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. For immunohistochemical staining, coronal sections of brain (40μm) were incubated for 35 min in 0.6% hydrogen peroxide to eliminate endogenous peroxide activity. Sections were rinsed in phosphate buffer and incubated for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 3% normal goat serum and 0.25% Triton X-100. Thereafter, sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-orexin antibody (1Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P.

Bound peroxidase was visualized by incubating sections with 0.01 m imidazole acetate buffer containing 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.005% hydrogen peroxide. By screening a human genomic library (constructed in λEMBL3 SP6/T7 vector) with rat prepro-orexin cDNA probe, we cloned a recombinant λ phage clone λghLig72–7, which has an approximately 18-kb insert that contains the whole length of human prepro-orexin gene. We subcloned the 4.9-kb BamHI fragment of λghLig72–7 insert into the pBluescript SKII(+) vector (Stratagene), which we termed pghLig72Bam, and subjected it to further analyses. Structural organization of the human prepro-orexin gene and mRNA are shown in Fig. 1. We also cloned a cDNA for human prepro-orexin by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to determine the sequence of prepro-orexin mRNA. To locate the transcription initiation sites, we performed primer extension analysis using poly(A+) RNA from whole human brain or control yeast tRNA. Primer extension analysis with a 29-mer oligonucleotide primer complementary to the 5′-untranslated region (positions 23 to 51 upstream from the putative translation initiation site) revealed that the main transcription initiation site is at nucleotide 1 in Fig. 2. Although there is a TATAAA sequence in position 5–10, this result suggests that this TATA box-like sequence is nonfunctional. However, there is a minor signal at positions 33–35 (27–29 bases down stream of TATAAA sequence), implying the possible existence of an additional transcription initiation site. Human prepro-orexin gene lacks a typical CCAAT box. A potential site for the promoter region was predicted to start at position −291 by BCM Gene Finder web site. 2http://defrag.bcm.tmc.edu:9503/genefinder/gf.html. This program also ignores the TATAAA sequence in position 5–10. The restriction enzyme map and the structural organization of the human prepro-orexin gene are schematically shown in Fig. 1. The complete nucleotide sequence of the structural gene and the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions determined from the results of primer extension analysis and the cDNA sequence are shown in Fig. 2. The pghLig72Bam insert contains a 3149-bp 5′-flanking region, a 1432-bp structural gene, and a 364-bp 3′-flanking region. The structural gene consists of two exons (143 and 473 bp) and one intron (816 bp). Southern blots of human genomic DNA were probed with the 544-bp PstI fragment of λghLig72–7, which contains a part of intron 1 and exon 2. SingleEcoRI (>23 kb), HindIII (7.0 kb),BamHI (4.9 kb), and PstI (0.55 kb) fragments of the genomic DNA hybridized with the probe, indicating that the cloned DNA is an authentic copy of the genomic DNA (Fig.3). The intron 1 starts and ends with the consensus sequence for the 5′-end (KAG/GTRA) and 3′-end (YnNYAG/G, n = 10∼12) of U2-type GT-AG introns (10Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 875-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), respectively, and has a putative branch site (CTRAY) at nucleotides 549–553 (CTGAT) (Fig. 2). A BLAST (blastn) search of the GenBank™ data bases with the sequence presented in Fig. 3 failed to find a significantly similar sequence, except for several highly repetitive elements of the primateAlu family (nucleotides −2414 to −2143, −1916 to −1640, −1627 to −1343, −1292 to-1004, and −885 to −613) (searched with CENSOR Web Server 3http://charon.lpi.org/∼server/censor.html. ). These regions show 64–85% nucleotide identity with the consensus sequence of human Alu repeat. Comparison of the gene and cDNA sequences, together with the results form the primer extension analysis (Fig.4), suggest that human prepro-orexin mRNA, which is 616 nucleotides long excluding the poly(A+) tail, is encoded by two exons distributed over 1432 base pairs of the human genome (Figs. 1 and 2). The 5′-most ATG codon of the cDNA (nucleotides 123–125) was preceded by an in-frame stop codon (TGA; nucleotides 108–110), and the sequence around this initiation codon conformed well to Kozak's rules (11Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). The open reading frame starting with this ATG encodes a 131-residue polypeptide, human prepro-orexin (Fig. 2). The 5′-untranslated region and the first 7 residues of the secretory signal sequence correspond to the 143-bp first exon. The 473-bp second exon contains the remaining portion of the open reading frame and the 102-bp 3′-untranslated region. Thus, the remaining portion of the signal sequence (residues 8–33) and pro-orexin are encoded in exon 2 (Fig. 2). The first 33 amino acids of human prepro-orexin exhibited characteristics of a secretory signal sequence: a hydrophobic core followed by residues with small polar side chains (12von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar). The SignalP Server web site 4http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/. predicted that Ala33–Gln34 was the most likely site for signal sequence cleavage. The orexin-A sequence starts with Gln34, which is presumably cyclized enzymatically into the N-terminal pyroglutamyl residue by transamidation (13Bateman A. Solomon S. Bennett H.P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22130-22136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Busby Jr., W.H. Quackenbush G.E. Humm J. Youngblood W.W. Kizer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8532-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mature peptide directly follows the signal peptide cleavage site. The last residue of the mature peptide is followed by Gly67, which presumably serves as an NH2 donor for C-terminal amidation by the sequential actions of peptidylglycine monooxygenase and peptidylamidoglycolate lyase (15Bradbury A.F. Smyth D.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 112-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 16Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As expected, Gly67 is followed by a pair of basic amino acid residues, Lys68–Arg69, which constitutes a recognition site for prohormone convertases (17Rouille Y. Dugay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva Jr., A.A. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The last residue of the sequence of orexin-B, Met96 residue, is again followed by Gly-Arg-Arg. These observations suggest that human orexin-A and -B are also C-terminally amidated like their counterparts in the rodent. The predicted human orexin-A sequence was identical to rodent/bovine orexin-A. Human orexin-B had two amino acid substitutions compared with the rodent sequence. Overall, the human prepro-orexin sequences were 83% identical to the rat counterpart (1Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S. Arch J.R. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C,. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.S. Terrett J.A. Elshourbagy N.A. Bergsma D.J. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1998; 92: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). The majority of amino acid substitutions were found in the C-terminal part of the precursor, which appears unlikely to encode for another bioactive peptide. A fragment of human prepro-orexin gene, which contains a 3.15-kb 5′-flanking region and the whole length of the 5′-noncoding region of exon 1, was fused to the modified E. coli lacZgene, which has an SV40 T antigen nuclear localization signal (nlacZ) (8Mercer E.H. Hoyle G.W. Kapur R.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Neuron. 1991; 7: 703-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We generated transgenic mice using this construct as a transgene. A total of six lines bearing the transgene were examined, and lacZ expression could be detected in three of these (Table I).Table ICharacterization of six hOX-nlacZ-transgenic linesFounder lineAnimals examinedTransgene copiesSites of transgene expressionA3311Lateral hypothalamusJ217Lateral hypothalamusD538Lateral hypothalamusArcuate nucleusPeriventricular nucleusVentromedial preoptic nucleusMedial preoptic nucleusE319P227Q435 Open table in a new tab The lacZ staining showed that the transgene was highly specifically expressed in the LHA/subthalamic region in two lines (Table I), suggesting that this fragment contains all the necessary elements for appropriate expression in these regions (Fig.5). We observed that the neurons expressing the transgene were only a subset of the neurons expected to stain. Generally, only 30–50% of neurons containing immunoreactive orexin were stained by β-galactosidase histochemical technique. All of the lacZ-positive neurons in the LHA contained immunoreactive orexins (Fig. 5). Line D5 showed ectopic expression of lacZ in several regions that do not express orexins, including the arcuate nucleus, periventricular nucleus, and preoptic nuclei (Table I). This ectopic expression was only observed in line D5 and might be because of a positional effect. We could not observe any ectopic expression of transgene other than the eutropic expression in the LHA in line A3 and line J2 (Table I). We also examined whether MCH-containing neurons, which are also known to be exclusively located in the LHA and adjacent regions, express the transgene or not. As shown in Fig. 5, MCH-positive neurons did not showlacZ activity, suggesting that this promoter does not direct expression to the MCH neurons. We could not observe any positivelacZ staining in tissues outside the brain. Recent studies have identified several neuropeptide and receptor systems in the hypothalamus that are critical in the regulation of body weight (18Flier J.S. Maratosflier E. Cell. 1998; 92: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The LHA has long been considered essential in regulating food intake and body weight, because cell specific lesions of this region can result in decreased food intake and body weight (2Bernardis L.L. Bellinger L.L. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1996; 20: 189-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and this region contains glucose-sensing neurons (4Oomura Y. Handbook of the Hypothalamus. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1980: 557-620Google Scholar). We recently identified a family of neuropeptides, orexins, which are localized exclusively in neurons in the LHA. Orexins increase food intake when administered intracerebroventricularly. The neurons containing orexins (orexin neurons) diffusely innervate the entire brain, including monosynaptic projections to the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and brain stem (5Date Y. Ueta Y. Ymamashita H. Yamaguchi H. Matsukura S. Kangawa K. Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Nakazato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 6Peyron C.

Therefore, orexin neurons may be ideally positioned to regulate cognitive, motivational, emotional, and autonomic aspects of food intake and body weight regulation. Orexin neurons are shown to be highly specifically localized within and around the LHA in rodents and humans (1Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S. Arch J.R. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C,. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.S. Terrett J.A. Elshourbagy N.A. Bergsma D.J. Yanagisawa M.

Yanagisawa M. Elmquist J.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 402: 442-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the existence of molecular mechanisms by which orexin expression is highly restricted to distinct populations of neurons in these regions. To examine these mechanisms, we first determined the structure of the human prepro-orexin gene and its transcript. The human prepro-orexin mRNA was predicted to encode a 131-residue precursor peptide. The human prepro-orexin gene consists of two exons and one intron distributed over 1432 bp (Fig. 1, 2). The 143-bp exon 1 includes the 5′-untranslated region and the coding region that encodes the first 7 residues of the secretory signal sequence. Exon 2 contains the remaining portion of the open reading frame and the 3′-untranslated region. The predicted human orexin-A sequence was identical to rodent/bovine/porcine orexin-A. Human orexin-B had two amino acid substitutions compared with the rodent sequence, and one amino acid substitution as compared with the porcine sequence (Fig. 2). Considering the difference in species, the structures of both orexins are strikingly conserved. This suggests the important physiological roles of orexins. To evaluate the function of the cloned human prepro-orexin gene fragment, we generated transgenic mice using human orexin gene-nlacZ fusion gene. This construct utilizes the human prepro-orexin gene fragment, which contains the 3,149-bp 5′-flanking region and 122-bp 5′-noncoding region of exon 1 to drive the nlacZ gene as a reporter protein (Fig. 1). We found that this gene fragment is sufficient to direct the expression of human prepro-orexin mRNA in the LHA and adjacent regions (Table I, Fig.5). This finding suggests that this genomic fragment contains all the necessary elements for appropriate expression of the gene. However, we observed that the neurons expressing the transgene were only a subset of the orexin-containing neurons (Fig. 5). Generally, only 30–50% of neurons containing immunoreactive orexins were stained by β-galactosidase histochemistry. This phenomenon has also been described for hsp68-lacZ and dopamine β hydroxylase-lacZ transgene and is referred to as incomplete penetrance (8Mercer E.H. Hoyle G.W. Kapur R.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Neuron. 1991; 7: 703-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19MacGowen R. Campbell R. Peterson A. Sapienza C. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1669-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neurons containing MCH, which are also known to be localized exclusively in the LHA, did not express lacZ in the transgenic mice (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that this promoter specifically directs expression to orexin neurons, and orexin neurons and MCH neurons are distinct neuronal populations. Transgenic line D5 showed ectopic expression in several regions, which may be because of a positional effect (Table I). Alternatively, there may be other necessary elements to ensure the proper gene expression in other genomic regions. In this case, ectopic expression would be eliminated by the inclusion of additional DNA for the endogenous gene, leading to valuable insights into the regulatory mechanism of the endogenous gene. In any case, the 3.2-kb human prepro-orexin promoter we used in this study was sufficient to direct expression of the exogenous gene in orexin-producing neurons in transgenic mice. Therefore, this promoter might be useful to examine the consequences of the expression of exogenous molecules in orexin neurons of transgenic mice, thereby manipulating the cellular environment in vivo. This genomic fragment will also be useful for the targeted ablation of orexin neurons by using it as a promoter that drives toxin expression (20Palmiter R.D. Behringer R.R. Quaife C.J. Maxwell F. Maxwell I.H. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1987; 50: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Prepro-orexin mRNA was shown to be up-regulated under fasting conditions, indicating that these neurons somehow sense the nutritional status of the animal. We have found that orexin gene expression is influenced by plasma glucose and leptin levels. 5T. Sakurai, T. Moriguchi, and Yamanaka, A., unpublished observation. Human prepro-orexin nlacZ transgenic mice will also be useful to examine the molecular mechanisms by which orexin gene expression is regulated. We are grateful to Drs. N. A. Tritos and T. Maratos-Flier for providing us anti-MCH antiserum. We thank Dr. W. Gray for reading our manuscript."

The present study shows that in primary granulosa cells from prepubertal rat ovary, StAR transcript and protein are acutely induced by gonadotropin (FSH). To determine the sequence elements required for hormone inducibility of the StAR promoter, truncated regions of the −1002/+6 sequence of the mouse gene were ligated to pCAT-Basic plasmid and transfected by electroporation to freshly prepared cells. FSH inducibility determined over a 6-h incubation was 10–40-fold above basal levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. These functional studies, supported by electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that two sites were sufficient for transcription of the StAR promoter constructs: a non-consensus binding sequence (−81/−72) for CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and a consensus motif for GATA-4 binding (−61/−66). Western analyses showed that GATA-4 is constitutively expressed in the granulosa cells, while all isoforms of C/EBPβ were markedly inducible by FSH. Site-directed mutations of both binding sequences practically ablated both basal and hormone-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities to less than 5% of the parental −96/+6 construct. Unlike earlier notions, elimination of potential binding sites for steroidogenic factor-1, a well known tissue-specific transcription factor, did not impair StAR transcription. Consequently, we propose that C/EBPβ and GATA-4 represent a novel combination of transcription factors capable of conferring an acute response to hormones upon their concomitant binding to the StAR promoter.

Steroids. 1997; 62: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). More studies have established the fact that StAR is a vital protein essential for steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex and the gonads (13Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2231-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and placenta. 2Y. Arensburg and J. Orly, unpublished data. Interestingly, StAR is not expressed in human placenta, where its role is probably assumed by a less efficient StAR substitute called MLN64 (16Watari H. Arakane F. Moog L.C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C.

Perhaps the most compelling evidence for the critical role of StAR in steroidogenesis was the discovery that various mutations of the StAR gene encoding a functionally impaired protein (14Caron K.M. Soo S.C. Wetsel W.C. Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Parker K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Affected individuals die shortly after birth in the absence of adrenal steroids, unless treated with steroid hormone replacement therapy. Similar patterns were also observed in StAR null mice (14Caron K.M. Soo S.C. Wetsel W.C. Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Parker K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11540-11545Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Trophic hormones, such as gonadotropins and ACTH, trigger up-regulation of StAR expression by cAMP signaling (18Pon L.A.

Very little is known about the factors controlling StAR expression at the transcriptional level, downstream to the signal transduction pathways. Special attention has been devoted to examine the potential involvement of the steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, or Ad4BP), which is a pivotal tissue-specific orphan nuclear receptor essential for regulation of many steroid hydroxylases in steroid-producing tissues (23Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 24Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the fact that StAR promoter includes several putative recognition sites for SF-1 binding, several attempts have be made to determine if the latter factor is involved in StAR regulation. At present, the available results are somewhat inconsistent. Using the human, mouse, and rat promoters, an apparent up-regulation of StAR transcription by SF-1 could be demonstrated upon co-transfection of SF-1 cDNA and promoter-reporter plasmids in non-steroidogenic cells (25Sugawara T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30729-30735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, other studies analyzing the activity of StAR promoter in SF-1-expressing cells did not support a role for SF-1 in a cAMP-inducible fashion (30Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Soo S.C. Stocco D.M. Parker K.L. Clark B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These data suggested that SF-1 may not confer cAMP responsiveness in authentic steroidogenic cells and, therefore, cannot be an exclusive transcription factor controlling the acute regulation of StAR in such cells. In search for alternative regulatory elements that can mediate the acute response of StAR to hormones, we undertook to study the inducibility of the mouse promoter in ovarian granulosa cells from prepubertal rats. Earlier studies have unambiguously shown that endogenous SF-1 in these cells is critical for the induction of P450scc and P450aromatase by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (31Fitzpatrick S.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 341-354PubMed Google Scholar, 32Clemens J.W. Lala D.S. Parker K.L. Richards J.S.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the present study suggests that SF-1 is probably not involved in hormonal activation of StAR promoter. We also demonstrate that promoter regions capable of C/EBPβ and GATA-4 binding are required for activation of StAR transcription in FSH-treated cells. Thus, StAR provides the first example of a steroidogenesis-associated protein that is transcriptionally controlled by C/EBPβ and/or GATA-4. Ovine FSH (NIDDK-oFSH-20) was kindly provided by the National Institute of Health NIAMD (Bethesda, MD.). Acetyl-CoA, poly(dI-dC), RNase A, indomethacin, proteinase K, sodium orthovanadate, aprotinin, NaF, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat sera were obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium were from Grand Island Biological, New York. Polyclonal antisera to C/EBPβ (sc-150x), C/EBPα (sc-61x), Sp1 (sc-059x), GATA-4 (sc-1237x), GATA-6 (sc-7244x), c-Fos (sc-253x), and c-Jun/AP-1 (sc-44x) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). SF-1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Intact, immature female Sprague-Dawley rats (21 days old) were obtained from Harlan (Jerusalem, Israel) and maintained under 16:8 light:dark schedule with food and water ad libitum. Animals were treated in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All protocols had the approval of the Institutional Committee on Animal Care and Use, Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Naive granulosa cells for CAT assays were expressed form E2-primed rats (35Orly J. Clemens J.W. Singer O. Richards J.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Preovulatory PMSG-hCG-treated ovaries were prepared by administration of 15 IU of PMSG (PMSG 600, Intervet, Angers, France) to 25-day-old rats, which were further treated with 4 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Organon Special Chemicals, West Orange, NJ) administered (subcutaneously) 50 h later. The animals were sacrificed at 8 h after hCG, and ovaries were retrieved for protein extraction. Also, post-ovulatory ovaries enriched with corpora lutea were similarly harvested 72 h after onset of PMSG-hCG treatment. To obtain granulosa cells expressing low basal levels of CAT, we used a modification of a previously described method (35Orly J. Clemens J.W. Singer O. Richards J.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation in hypertonic sucrose/EGTA-containing medium, the ovaries were incubated for additional 45 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10 μm indomethacin. The same medium also served for further procedures, including needle pricking of the ovaries and post-electroporation treatments. After electroporation the cells were plated onto serum-coated wells (35Orly J. Clemens J.W. Singer O. Richards J.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (24-well plated; Nunc, Copenhagen, Denmark) and incubated at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Estradiol-primed granulosa cells (4 × 105) obtained from 3–4 ovaries were electroporated in the presence of 20 μg of DNA as described before (35Orly J. Clemens J.W. Singer O. Richards J.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells from each cuvette were seeded into four wells and hormonal treatments were initiated after a 3-h recovery period. Following a 6-h treatment with FSH (100 ng/ml), cell lysates were prepared and CAT activity was analyzed as described previously (35Orly J. Clemens J.W. Singer O. Richards J.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the CAT assay was performed using a Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer (BAS-1000, Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Protein was determined by a modified method of Bradford (36Zor T. Selinger Z. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Data are presented as percent of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) converted to its acetylated products (per protein and time of assay) and the -fold induction of CAT activity over basal values measured in the absence of hormone. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of several independent transfections as indicated in each figure. Whole ovarian extracts for EMSA was performed as described before (37Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1091-1102PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ovaries were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using 2–3 volumes of buffer A containing 400 mm KCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μm pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following homogenization, the protein slurry was freeze-thawed three times in liquid nitrogen and finally centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g. After determination of the protein content, the supernatant was aliquoted and kept at −70 °C until use. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described before (37Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1091-1102PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts (3–15 μg) were incubated with 2 ng of double-stranded DNA, previously labeled by a fill-in reaction using Klenow fragment (Promega, Madison, WI) and [α-32P]-dCTP (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Incubation was performed using a final volume of 30 μl of buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 12% glycerol, and 4.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). After incubation for 35 min at room temperature, the binding reactions were resolved on pre-run 5% acrylamide gel as described previously for quantitative RT-PCR analyses (38Orly J. Rei Z. Greenberg N.M. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When competition experiments were conducted in the presence of molar excess of cold probe, the protein extracts were added last to the reaction mixture. When antibodies were used for supershift (or ablation) of a given protein-DNA complex, the protein extracts were preincubated for 25 min at room temperature with 2–8 μg of the antiserum, prior to the addition of the DNA-labeled probe. The following oligonucleotide probes used for EMSA included overhanging restriction site sequences: SCC1(SF-1) (32Clemens J.W. Lala D.S. Parker K.L. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (upper strand, 5′-GATCGCCCTCTCTTAGCCTTGAGCTA GTTA); consensus Sp1 (upper strand, 5′-GATCCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC); −148/−127 StAR (upper strand, 5′-TGCTCCCTCCCACCTTGGCCAG); −148/−127mut2Sp1 (upper strand, 5′-TGCTCCCTCtgACCTTGGCCAG); −87/−70 StAR (upper strand, 5′-GGCCAAGCTTGCACAATGACTGATGACT); and −73/42 StAR (upper strand, 5′-GGCCAAGCTTGACTTTTTTATCTCAAGTGATGATGCACAGCC). A previously published sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse StAR gene (30Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Soo S.C. Stocco D.M. Parker K.L. Clark B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), was used to clone most of the StAR promoter constructs by a PCR-based approach. 5′-HindIII and 3′-XbaI cloning sites were included in all forward and reverse primers, respectively. To generate the −1002/+6 DNA fragment, the oligonucleotide sequence −1002/−982 (5′-GGCCAAGCTTTTCTAAGGTTCCCTGGATCT) and −14/+6 (5′-GGCCTCTAGAAGCTGTGGCGCAGATCAAGT) were included in the PCR reaction (38Orly J. Rei Z. Greenberg N.M. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) using mouse genomic DNA (prepared as described in Ref. 39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols In Molecular Biology. 1st Ed. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar), as template. The PCR product was digested with HindIII andXbaI (New England Biolabs) and ligated (T4-DNA ligase; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) into the HindIII and XbaI sites of a promoterless pCAT-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting construct was designated −1002StAR. Two deletion constructs were generated from −1002StAR by StuI and AccI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to generate the −823/+6 (−823StAR) and −257/+6 (−257StAR) constructs, respectively. Further progressive deletions of the promoter constructs were prepared using the −14/+6 reverse primer and the appropriate 5′- forward primers: −152StAR (5′-GGCCAAGCTTAGTCTGCTCCCTCCCACCTTGGCCAGCACT); −123StAR (5′-GGCCAAGCTTTGCAGGATGAGGCAATCATTCCAT); −96StAR (5′-GGCCAAGCTTTGACCCTCTGCACAATGACTGA); −73StAR (the same oligonucleotide sequence used for the EMSA probe, −73/−42StAR); −51StAR (5′-GGCCAAGCTTATGCACAGCCTTCCACGG). To generate constructs with point mutations, oligonucleotides containing the point mutations of choice were used for the PCR reaction as the forward primers, using the −14/+6 as the reverse primer (unless stated otherwise): −152mutSF-1 (5′- GGCCAAGCTTAGTCTGCTCCCTCCCAtaTTGGCCAGCACT); −152mut1“Sp-1” (5′-GGCCAAGCTTAGTCTGCTCCCTCtgACCTTGGCCAGCACT); −152mut2“Sp-1” (5′-GGCCAAGCTTAGTCTGCTCCCTggCACCTTGGCCAGCACT); −123mutC/EBPβ-2 (5′-GGCCAAGCTTTGCAGGATGAGtcccaCATTCCAT); −96mutβ −2(5′-GGCCAAGCTTTGACCCTCTCtcccaGACTGAT); −96mutβ-3 (5′-GGCCAAGCTTTGACCCTCTGCACAATGAtctgTGACTT; −96mutGATA (5′-GGCCAAGCTTTGACCCTCTGCACAATGACTGATGACTTTTTTAagTCAAGTG); −73mutGATA (5′- GGCCAAGCTTGACTTTTTTAagTCAAGTGATGATGCACAGCC); The −96rStAR construct was built using the −96StAR primer as the forward primer, and the −53/+6mutStAR (5′-GGCCTCTAGATGATctcgacgtccaggacgcAAGCATTTAAGGCAGAGCACTTGATCTGCGCCACAGCT) as the reverse primer. The double mutant construct −96doublemut was generated using the −96mutβ-3 as the forward primer, the −14/+6 oligonucleotide as the reverse primer, and the construct −96mutGATA as the template. PCR reaction (total volume of 100 μl) consisted of 30 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 60–65 °C (2 min), and 72 °C (3 min) (38Orly J. Rei Z. Greenberg N.M. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). At the indicated time points, granulosa cells were extracted by lysis buffer (RIPA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electro-blotting procedures as described previously (40Ronen F.T. Timberg R. King S.R. Hales K.H. Hales D.B. Stocco D.M. Orly J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation with anti-C/EBPβ (1:2000) or anti-GATA-4 (1:4000), the nitrocellulose membranes were washed and further incubated for 1 h with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:10,000 dilution). Specific signals were detected by chemiluminescence utilizing the LumiGlo substrate (New England Biolabs). Quantitation of chemiluminescence signals on x-ray films was performed as described previously (40Ronen F.T. Timberg R. King S.R. Hales K.H. Hales D.B. Stocco D.M. Orly J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by dissolving the granulosa cells in 0.5 ml of RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendwood, TX) added to each culture well (16 mm). Further steps followed the manufacturer's instructions. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of total RNA extracts from granulosa cells was performed exactly as described previously (40Ronen F.T. Timberg R. King S.R. Hales K.H. Hales D.B. Stocco D.M. Orly J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Student's unpaired two-tailedt test was performed using Microsoft Excel 97 statistical analysis functions. Differences between the activities of the indicated constructs were considered statistically significant atp < 0.05. Aiming to identify the regulatory elements controlling StAR expression, we have applied transient expression assays of the mouse StAR promoter by use of granulosa cells from prepubertal rat ovary. To this end, a −1002 to +6 fragment of the StAR gene was cloned by PCR and ligated to a promoterless pCAT-Basic plasmid. We reasoned that the expression of the mouse promoter in rat cells is justified by the fact that the proximal regions of the rat and mouse promoters are almost identical, in particular through the first 150 base pairs upstream to the transcription start site (Fig. 1). Testing the hormonal inducibility of the promoter constructs was performed following a 6-h incubation with FSH added shortly after transfection by electroporation. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed that under similar experimental conditions the levels of StAR mRNA and protein rise acutely upon the addition of FSH (Fig. 2).Figure 2Time-dependent rise of StAR mRNA and protein induced by FSH . Freshly prepared granulosa cells were seeded to culture and 3 h later, FSH was added (100 ng/ml). At the indicated time points, duplicate wells, were harvested with either RNAzol B or lysis buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). A, RT-PCR was performed to determine the levels of StAR mRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presented autoradiogram depicts the amplified PCR signals obtained for StAR and the ribosomal protein L19 mRNAs.B, Western blot analysis was performed, and the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction depicts the mitochondrial 30-kDa StAR protein. The lower panel presents the time dependent increase of StAR transcript and protein. Quantitation of StAR mRNA and protein was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) At large, the activity values obtained by transfecting a series of progressive deletions of the promoter showed that hormone inducibility remained high in all constructs pruned down to −96/+6 (Fig.3). The latter region exhibited the highest -fold induction by FSH (44-fold), suggesting that two potential upstream binding sites for SF-1 (−139/−132 and −102/−95), are not necessarily required for the FSH activation of the promoter. These results did not agree with earlier reports, which strongly advocated the notion that SF-1 is implicated in regulation of StAR expression (26Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Kiriakidou M. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9052-9059Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 27Sugawara T. Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Kallen C.B. Strauss III, J.F.

Steroids. 1997; 62: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This inconsistency, together with the fact that deletion of the −139/−132 SF-1 site significantly reduced the basal activity of −152StAR (Fig. 3), urged us to cautiously reassess the importance of this element by site-directed mutations and EMSAs. To our surprise, SF-1 did not bind to a −148/−127 probe (Fig.4), previously shown to be capable of SF-1 binding using extracts of Y-1 adrenocortical cell line (30Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Soo S.C. Stocco D.M. Parker K.L. Clark B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Instead, the rat cell extracts generated a slower migrating protein complex, which was not affected by antiserum to SF-1 (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 4). A closer examination of this sequence revealed a potential Sp1 site, which is overlapping the SF-1 binding element to create an “Sp1”/SF-1 motif (see Fig.5 B, probe 2). This G-rich element (−146, 5′-TGGGAGGGAG, lower strand) is nearly identical to an Sp1-like binding sequence previously reported to be involved in cAMP-dependent regulation of the bovine P450scc transcription (34Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 42Venepally P. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In StAR promoter, this Sp1-like site, termed “Sp1,” binds a protein that is antigenically cross-reactive with Sp1 antiserum (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6and 8). Moreover, molar excess of Sp1 consensus DNA can compete for the binding of “Sp1” to its site in StAR promoter (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and 5). Finally, a site-directed mutation replacing GG with ca (Fig.5 B, lane 16) resulted in the loss of “Sp1” band shift and rendered the SF-1 site available for a typical SF-1 binding (Fig. 5 B, lane 16). Noteworthy, the “Sp1”/SF-1 element could bind both proteins, providing the extracts were prepared from the mouse MA-10 cells (Fig.5 B, lane 14), which are highly enriched with SF-1 content. These results suggest that the −148/−127 region has a dual capacity to bind both “Sp1”and SF-1, which compete with each other depending on their relative content in a given cell type.Figure 4SF-1 does not bind the −148/−127 StAR promoter region. Extracts prepared from PMSG/hCG-treated rats (see “Experimental Procedures”) were used for the following electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs): A, antiserum to SF-1 (4 μg) was added to protein extracts for a 25 min preincubation period prior to addition of either a32P-labeled −148/−127 probe (lane 2), or a positive control SF-1 probe, design"
https://openalex.org/W2026965831,"Using an affinity matrix in which a recombinant glypican-Fc fusion protein expressed in 293 cells was coupled to protein A-Sepharose, we have isolated from rat brain at least two proteins that were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single 200-kDa silver-stained band, from which 16 partial peptide sequences were obtained by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Mouse expressed sequence tags containing two of these peptides were employed for oligonucleotide design and synthesis of probes by polymerase chain reaction and enabled us to isolate from a rat brain cDNA library a 4.1-kilobase clone that encoded two of our peptide sequences and represented the N-terminal portion of a protein containing a signal peptide and three leucine-rich repeats. Comparisons with recently published sequences also showed that our peptides were derived from proteins that are members of the Slit/MEGF protein family, which share a number of structural features such as N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and C-terminal epidermal growth factor-like motifs, and in Drosophila Slit is necessary for the development of midline glia and commissural axon pathways. All of the five known rat and human Slit proteins contain 1523–1534 amino acids, and our peptide sequences correspond best to those present in human Slit-1 and Slit-2. Binding of these ligands to the glypican-Fc fusion protein requires the presence of the heparan sulfate chains, but the interaction appears to be relatively specific for glypican-1 insofar as no other identified heparin-binding proteins were isolated using our affinity matrix. Northern analysis demonstrated the presence of two mRNA species of 8.6 and 7.5 kilobase pairs using probes based on both N- and C-terminal sequences, and in situ hybridization histochemistry showed that these glypican-1 ligands are synthesized by neurons, such as hippocampal pyramidal cells and cerebellar granule cells, where we have previously also demonstrated glypican-1 mRNA and immunoreactivity. Our results therefore indicate that Slit family proteins are functional ligands of glypican-1 in nervous tissue and suggest that their interactions may be critical for certain stages of central nervous system histogenesis.

Glypican-1, whose primary structure was first reported based on its cloning from human lung fibroblasts (1David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J.

Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Northern analysis demonstrated high levels of glypican-1 mRNA in brain and skeletal muscle, and in situ hybridization histochemistry showed that glypican-1 mRNA is especially prominent in cerebellar granule cells, large motor neurons in the brain stem, and CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (9Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Engel M. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3213-3222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Glypican-1 was also found to be a dual modulator capable of enhancing the mitogenic response of fibroblast growth factor-1 but inhibiting the effects of fibroblast growth factor-7 in keratinocytes (10Bonneh-Barkay D.

Mok S.S. Henry A. Cappai R. Lander A.D. Nurcombe V. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Small D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31215-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Genetic studies provide additional support for a role of glypicans in cell growth and development. Dally, theDrosophila homologue of glypican-1, is required for the control of cell division in the developing visual system and for morphogenesis of other tissues (12Nakato H. Futch T.A. Selleck S.B. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3687-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the human homologue of glypican-3/OCI-5 (GPC3) was found to be mutated in patients with the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome (13Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Baybayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have also recently demonstrated a novel nuclear localization of glypican-1 in nervous tissue (14Liang Y. Häring M. Roughley P.J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be involved in the regulation of cell division and survival by direct participation in nuclear processes. Because the functional roles of glypican-1 in nervous tissue remain unknown, we have begun studies aimed at identifying ligands that may aid in understanding how it is involved in developmental and other neurobiological processes. By affinity chromatography of brain extracts on a matrix in which a recombinant glypican-Fc fusion protein was coupled to protein A-Sepharose, we isolated and partially cloned proteins whose sequences allowed us to identify mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Slit protein as ligands of glypican-1. Slit, which was initially identified by cross-hybridization using the sequence coding for tandem epidermal growth factor repeats of Notch, a gene involved in Drosophila neurogenesis (15Rothberg J.M. Hartley D.A. Walther Z. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1047-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), is necessary for development of midline glia and commissural axon pathways inDrosophila (16Rothberg J.M. Jacobs J.R. Goodman C.S. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2169-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Although information has only very recently become available concerning the functions of mammalian Slit proteins, our results suggest that interactions of these presumably extracellular proteins with cell surface glypican-1 may be important in axonal pathfinding and nervous tissue histogenesis. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with a glypican-Fc fusion protein construct (14Liang Y. Häring M. Roughley P.J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and grown in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% ITS+ (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). The conditioned medium was continuously collected and frozen after centrifugation for 30 min at 27,000 × g and addition of sodium azide to a concentration of 0.02%. The amount of the glypican-1 fusion protein in aliquots of the conditioned medium was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; EST, expressed sequence tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CID-MS/MS, collision-induced dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; kb, kilobase(s). in comparison with bovine serum albumin standards, after binding to an excess of protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) using a ratio of 0.5 ml of medium/20 μl of settled beads and elution twice by sample buffer. To determine the proportion of the glypican-Fc fusion protein that was synthesized in a glycanated form, 293 cells in a six-well plate were transfected with the fusion protein construct, and after 24 h cells were washed twice with a short term labeling medium (methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% ITS+) followed by incubation for 1 h with the same medium. The medium was subsequently changed for 4 h to labeling medium containing 125 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine. The glypican-Fc fusion protein was purified from the conditioned medium by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose beads, and an aliquot of the beads was digested with heparitin-sulfate lyase (EC 4.2.2.8, Seikagaku America, Rockville, MD) at a concentration of 50 milliunits/ml in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7.2, for 3 h at 37 °C and compared with another aliquot incubated with buffer alone. (Enzyme assays using bovine kidney heparan sulfate as substrate and measurement of unsaturated disaccharide products by their absorption at 232 nm demonstrated that the heparitinase retains >85% of its initial activity after 6-h incubation under these conditions.) Both aliquots were boiled in sample buffer; proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 5% gel; and after soaking for 30 min in 200 ml of 1 m sodium salicylate, the gel was dried and bands were quantitated by fluorography using the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Pools of conditioned medium were later thawed and concentrated by pressure ultrafiltration on an Amicon PM-30 membrane in a stirred cell. After reclarification by centrifugation (30 min, 27,000 ×g), the glypican-Fc fusion protein was bound to protein A-Sepharose beads with gentle mixing at 4 °C overnight, using a ratio of 1 mg of fusion protein (in 2–5 ml of concentrated medium)/ml of settled beads. The beads were thoroughly washed with cold PBS followed by 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. After re-equilibration in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, the glypican-1 fusion protein was cross-linked to the protein A (17Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at room temperature using a 30-fold molar excess of dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce) added four times at 10-min intervals. The coupling reaction was terminated by washing the beads with 1 m Tris-glycine buffer, pH 7, followed by PBS, and the beads were stored in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide. Before each use of the affinity matrix, any free fusion protein was removed by washing with 1 mNaCl in 50 mm PBS followed by 0.1 m glycine, and the beads were then again equilibrated in 50 mmPBS. In an initial experiment to determine which subcellular fractions might be enriched in glypican-1 ligands, brains of 30- to 130-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized using a Teflon-glass tissue grinder in 4 volumes of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.25 at 4 °C, containing 0.15 m NaCl and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 50 mm EDTA, and 100 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g, and the supernatant (S1) was saved. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of buffer, recentrifuged, and the pellet saved as P1. The S1 fraction was centrifuged for 30 min at 45,000 × g, the pellet (P2) saved, and the supernatant centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 ×g to yield a soluble fraction (S3) and pellet (P3). The P2 and P3 pellets were combined to give a mitochondrial/microsomal fraction (P2/3). The P1 and P2/3 pellets were resuspended in the original Tris-HCl buffer (2.75 ml/g original brain) containing 1% CHAPS, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin and extracted with stirring overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 × g, the supernatants were saved as fractions S4N (a crude “nuclear” extract) and a membrane extract (S5M), respectively. Later studies aimed at the isolation and amino acid sequencing of ligands used a simplified procedure. Brains of 30–40-day-old rats were homogenized in 4 volumes of 25 mm PBS, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μmpepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 ×g and washed once. The washed P1 pellet was then extracted by stirring overnight at 4 °C in PBS with protease inhibitors as described above but with the addition of 1% CHAPS, using 2.75 ml/g brain, and the extract was centrifuged for 2 h at 200,000 ×g. The resulting supernatant (designated S3N) was then used for affinity chromatography, after filtration through a pre-column of Sepharose CL-4B beads to remove any remaining particulate material or proteins that bind nonspecifically to the Sepharose. Beads containing the glypican-Fc fusion protein were equilibrated in 50 mm PBS and mixed overnight with the brain extract at 4 °C using gentle agitation, in a ratio of 10 ml of brain extract (3.6 g of brain)/ml of beads. Unbound proteins were removed by centrifugation followed by four washes (3 bead volumes each) with PBS. The beads were then transferred to a column, and bound proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl. (Initial trials demonstrated that no additional protein was released by subsequent elution with 50 mm diethylamine, pH 11.5, in 0.15 m NaCl or by 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.) Proteins eluted with 1 mNaCl were concentrated by adsorption to StrataClean resin (Stratagene) using 10 μl of beads/10 ml of eluate and released by boiling in SDS-containing sample buffer before use for SDS-PAGE (18Ziegler J. Vogt T. Miersch O. Strack D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Proteins in the 1m NaCl eluate from the glypican-1 affinity column were electrophoresed on several lanes of an 8% 1-mm minigel, silver-stained using a protocol suitable for subsequent sequencing (19Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar), and stored at 4 °C. A major band with an apparent molecular size of ∼200 kDa was excised from two to three lanes of the gel and digested in situ with trypsin (19Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). The complete tryptic peptide mixture was desalted and concentrated (20.Annan, R. S., McNulty, D. E., Huddleston, M. E., Carr, S.

The unfractionated digest was analyzed by nano-electrospray (21Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar) on a QTOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom), and partial or complete sequences from 16 peptides were obtained by tandem mass spectrometry (22Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of nine or more residues from 10 different peptides were used to search protein or EST data bases for matches. The peptide sequences obtained by mass spectrometry were compared with the nucleotide sequences in the nonredundant GenBankTM data base (EST Division), translated in all six reading frames using the NCBI BLAST server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST/nph-newblast?Jform=1). Two translated EST sequences matched perfectly to our peptides 3 and 8 and were designated P3EST and P8EST, respectively. P3EST was amplified by PCR from a rat brain stem/spinal cord cDNA library (Stratagene) using primers designed from the EST sequence (sense, 5′-CCATCGATGCACCTCAGAGTTCTTCAGCTC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGACAAGTTGTTCGAGTGGAGTCG-3′) and subcloned in pBluescript. P8EST could not be amplified from any of our three available rat brain cDNA libraries but was amplified from a neonatal mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene) using primers designed from the EST sequence (sense, 5′-CCATCGATTCCTTGACGTGGCATCCCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGACTCTATCACAGCTGTCCCCG-3′) and subcloned in pBluescript. The P3EST sense and antisense primers were also used for PCR screening of amplified pools from a 6-week rat brain and an adult rat brain stem/spinal cord cDNA library (Stratagene). Plaques from PCR-positive pools were screened using a 400-base pairXbaI/ClaI restriction fragment of pBluescript/P3EST that was labeled in the presence of [α-32P]CTP (18 mCi/ml) using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, after purification by agarose gel electrophoresis and QIAEX extraction (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Plaques were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and DNA was immobilized by baking in vacuo. Filters were hybridized overnight at 42 °C and washed three times at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice at 65 °C with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Supernatants of positive plaques were first screened by PCR using the antisense primer of P3EST in combination with T3 or T7 vector primers, and clones showing the largest insert sizes were subjected to a second screening. Individual plaques were lifted and the plasmids isolated by in vivo excision. pBluescript/P3EST and pBluescript/P8EST were linearized by ClaI digestion and transcribed into digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA with T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) using the GENIUS 4 RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting probes were used for hybridization with Northern blots and for in situ hybridization histochemistry. mRNA from rat tissues and rat C6 glioma cells was prepared using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). Hybridization, washing, and detection with alkaline phosphataselabeled anti-digoxigenin antibodies were performed as described previously (23Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digoxigenin-labeled sense RNA probes were prepared as described above except that plasmids were linearized by XbaI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. In situ hybridization histochemistry was performed as described by Engel et al. (24Engel M. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Initial experiments surveyed extracts prepared from several subcellular fractions of brain (see “Experimental Procedures”) for the presence of glypican-1 ligands, which were detected predominantly in the “crude nuclear fraction.” This fraction was therefore used for all subsequent studies. Specific ligands were considered to be those proteins that bound only to the glypican-Fc fusion protein affinity beads, but not to protein A-Sepharose beads that did not contain the fusion protein. SDS-PAGE analysis and silver staining revealed a major specific ligand with an apparent molecular size of ∼200 kDa (Fig.1 A), and a second band with a slightly slower mobility could frequently also be resolved (data not shown). Methionine/cysteine labeling of the glypican-Fc fusion protein secreted by transfected 293 cells followed by SDS-PAGE before and after heparitinase treatment showed that approximately 40% of the fusion protein is glycanated (data not shown). These results indicate that in comparison with endogenous glypican-1 in rat brain and C6 glioma cells (14Liang Y. Häring M. Roughley P.J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the addition of heparan sulfate chains in transfected 293 cells lagged considerably behind the high level of expression of the glypican-1 core protein. Interaction of the 200-kDa ligand with the glypican-1 affinity matrix is at least partially mediated by the heparan sulfate chains, insofar as binding is abolished after treatment of the beads for 5 h with heparitinase (Fig. 1 B). However, the 200-kDa band was not detected in eluates of brain proteins bound to heparin-agarose using identical conditions (data not shown). Another specific ligand with an apparent molecular size of ∼22 kDa was also detected, and at least five major bands were seen in the 40–70 kDa range (Fig. 1 A), but since these latter proteins bound equally well to protein A-Sepharose beads that did not contain the fusion protein they probably represent rat immunoglobulins or other nonspecific ligands. No sequence could be obtained from the 22-kDa band after transfer to a ProBlott membrane, indicating that it was N-terminally blocked. The 200-kDa band stained poorly with Coomassie Blue and sufficient amounts could not be obtained for transfer to a membrane for N-terminal Edman sequencing or for protease treatment and high performance liquid chromatography fractionation of peptides. We therefore used nano-electrospray collision-induced dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-electrospray CID-MS/MS), a more sensitive peptide sequencing technique that is capable of yielding useful sequence at the femtomole level from single silver-stained polyacrylamide gel bands (21Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). When applied to an unfractionated tryptic digest derived from several lanes of the 200-kDa protein, MS/MS spectra for 17 peptides were generated (Fig. 2 A). From these data, 16 complete or partial peptide sequences could be deduced (Table I). The MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged [M + 2H]2+ peptide P8 ion is shown in Fig.2 B. The m/z 756.4 value for this ion corresponds to a molecular weight of 1510.6 for the peptide. The spectrum shows a nearly complete set of C-terminal sequence ions (labeled y n) beginning with fragmenty 1 that contains only Arg and ending with fragment y 10 that includes all of the residues up to and including Tyr. Although this amount of sequence was sufficient to identify the 200-kDa protein (see below), additional sequence information can be obtained by interrogating the mass difference between the highest observable y n ion and the molecular mass of the peptide. This difference corresponds to the sum of the in-chain masses of any N-terminal amino acids not yet accounted for by the MS sequencing (most often the first two residues). In the example shown (Fig. 2 B), the difference of 227 Da can correspond to only three possible pairs of amino acids (Table I, considering Leu and Ile as a single possibility, and assuming no posttranslational modifications). In this case, the combination N,X (X = L) matched the first two residues for the hit from the data base (Fig. 3). At low m/z, several N-terminal sequence ions (labeled b n) are also evident, and them/z value of the b 2 ion confirms the residual mass of the first two N-terminal residues (b 2 = 227 + H).Table IPeptide sequences obtained by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometryP1(200)NSXVXYGNK200 = S,X; E,A; or V,TP2(212)QXHENQXGAVER212 = P,D or V,XP3(228)XSENQXQAXPR228 = D,X; N,N; P,M; or E,VP4XDXSENSXQAVPRP5(276)QXVDXSNNK276 = F,E or Y,XP6(200)DXDSXXAEVK200 = S,X; E,A; or V,TP7(227)YXNNEXQDFTK227 =X,N; Q,V; A,R; or K,VP8(227)YXNSEXQDFR227 = X,N; Q,V; A,R; or K,VP9(212)QXFENQXQVER212 = P,D or V,XP10(242)PXQDVAFPDFR242 = N,Q; E,X; or K,NP11QRPTXGXFTQC*SGPASXRP12NQXQVXPEXXFQNNQAXSRP13SXNSXVXYGNKXTDXPRP14XNNNEXSXXEATGXFKP15RXDXSNNQXAEXAPDAFQGLRP16VSEXEDGTFEGATSVSEXHXTANQXESVRFor P1–10, the number in parentheses at the beginning of the sequence is the mass of the residual N-terminal amino acids (usually two residues) that could not be individually identified.

Here we report that metabolic incorporation of 125I-labeled 5-iodo-2′deoxyuridine, which produces DNA dsb, signaled de novo ceramide synthesis by post-translational activation of ceramide synthase (CS) and apoptosis. CS activation was obligatory, since fumonisin B1, a fungal pathogen that acts as a specific CS inhibitor, abrogated DNA damage-induced death. X-irradiation yielded similar results. Furthermore, inhibition of apoptosis using the peptide caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone did not affect CS activation, indicating this event is not a consequence of induction of apoptosis.

Although most radiation-induced DNA dsb are rapidly repaired by constitutively expressed repair mechanisms, residual unrepaired or misrepaired breaks lead to genetic instability, increased frequency of mutations, and chromosomal aberrations (1Radford I.R.

Although this mechanism has been extensively investigated, the signaling pathways involved are only partially known. Once generated, DNA damage activates a coordinate network of signal transduction pathways that detect DNA breaks, arrest the cells temporarily at G1, S, and G2 checkpoints, and activate DNA repair (7Kastan M.B.

This signaling network is regulated by a family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3-K) which in the human includes the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene product (ATM), the catalytic unit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), the AT- and RAD3-related kinase (Atr), and Frap (FKBP12 and rapamycin-binding protein kinase) (8Brown E.J.

Repair of DNA damage is believed to be carried out, at least in part, by non-homologous recombination and ligase IV-mediated end joining (17Jeggo P.A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: S80-S91Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Radiation-induced DNA dsb can also signal apoptosis, albeit significantly less frequently than reproductive cell death (18Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kolesnick R.N. Fuks Z. Semin. Radiat. Oncol. 1996; 6: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Definitive evidence for the involvement of radiation-induced DNA dsb in apoptosis was provided by experiments utilizing metabolic incorporation of 125I-labeled 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine ([125I]dURd). IdURd replaces thymidine in DNA without affecting cell viability, although it sensitizes mammalian cells to the lethal effects of radiation (4Dewey W.C. Miller H.H. Leeper D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

When targeted to DNA via [125I]dURd, the radioactive iodine produces dsb within a range of 6 base pairs from the site of 125I incorporation (22LeMotte P.K. Little J.B.

[125I]dURd incorporation into the DNA was reported to induce apoptotic responses in murine lymphoid and myeloid cell lines (5Bedford J.S. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

The apoptotic response in cells treated with [125I]dURd was shown to correlate with the number of 125I-induced DNA dsb (5Bedford J.S. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

Hypersensitivity to radiation-induced apoptosis was reported recently in ATM mutant fibroblast lines (28Meyn M.S. Strasfeld L. Allen C. Int. J. Radiat.

ATMmutations produce the genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a multi-system disease manifested by abnormalities of the immune, nervous, cutaneous, and endocrine systems (16Lavin M.F.

The hypersensitivity of some AT cells to radiation-induced apoptosis suggests that concomitant with its role in the regulation of DNA repair and recovery of the cell from potentially lethal DNA damage,ATM may function as inhibitor of an apoptotic pathway activated by DNA damage. The best known apoptotic response to radiation-induced DNA damage is p53-mediated (32Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 36Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T.

In murine thymic cells, p53-mediated apoptosis was not affected by ATM (29Westphal C.H. Rowan S. Schmaltz C. Elson A. Fisher D.E. Leder P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 38Barlow C. Brown K.D. Deng C.X. Tagle D.A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), although in spermatogonia undergoing meiosis ATM suppressed p53-dependent apoptosis (39Barlow C. Liyanage M. Moens P.B. Deng C.X. Ried T. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, theATM/DNA-PK doubly mutated M059J glioma cell line was shown to respond to radiation with apoptosis, whereas its sister line M059K, isolated from a different region of the same tumor, was shown to have intact ATM/DNA-PK and to be apoptosis-resistant.2 Both cell lines are p53-mutated (40Allalunis-Turner J. Barron G.M. Day R.S.R. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that in some cells p53 and ATM may function coordinately, whereas in others they may regulate apoptosis independently. Similar to the lack of effect on thymic apoptosis, ATM does not appear to regulate sphingomyelinase (SMase)-mediated apoptosis, known to be activated at the plasma membrane rather than the nucleus. Haimovitz-Friedman et al. (41Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) reported that radiation induced in nuclei-free membrane preparations of endothelial cells a rapid hydrolysis of the phospholipid sphingomyelin to generate ceramide via activation of SMase. The same response was observed in intact cells, and the ceramide generated served as a second messenger in initiating apoptotic signaling. Definitive evidence for the role of SMase in initiating radiation-induced apoptosis was provided by the use of genetic models. ASMase knock-out mice failed to generate ceramide and to develop typical apoptotic lesions in the pulmonary endothelium after whole body irradiation, although the apoptotic response in the thymus was preserved (42Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The converse pattern was observed in whole body irradiated p53 knock-out mice, which failed to exhibit thymic apoptosis but showed a normal apoptotic response in the lung. These data indicated that ASMase-mediated apoptosis, expressed in pulmonary endothelial cells, is distinct from the p53-dependent pathway that operates in thymocytes. Barlow et al. (38Barlow C. Brown K.D. Deng C.X. Tagle D.A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) reported that both thymic and pulmonary endothelial apoptosis remained unaltered in whole body irradiated ATM knock-out mice, indicating that ATM may regulate yet another, currently undefined, apoptotic pathway. Whereas ASMase activation represents a general mechanism for pro-apoptotic generation of ceramide, there is an alternative mechanism that involves de novo synthesis of ceramide and apoptosis via activation of the enzyme ceramide synthase (CS). De novosynthesis of ceramide occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (43Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 44Shimeno H. Soeda S. Yasukouchi M. Okamura N. Nagamatsu A. Biol. & Pharm. Bull. 1995; 18: 1335-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) via CS-mediated condensation of the sphingoid base sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoA to form dihydroceramide, which is rapidly oxidized to ceramide (45Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Bose et al. (46Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) have recently reported that daunorubicin activated CS and induced ceramide generation and apoptosis in P388 and U937 cells. Furthermore, the fungal toxin fumonisin B1 (FB1), a natural specific inhibitor of CS (47Merrill A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked daunorubicin-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis in both cell types. FB1 was also reported to abrogate daunorubicin-induced apoptosis in hen granulosa cells (48Witty J.P. Bridgham J.T. Johnson A.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5269-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and CPT-11-induced apoptosis in L929 cells (49Suzuki A. Iwasaki M. Kato M. Wagai N. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whether CS activation induced by daunorubicin and CPT-11 is associated with DNA damage remains unknown. Since FB1 did not block tumor necrosis factor-induced ceramide generation nor tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis, both of which involve SMase activation in U937 cells (46Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), it appears that CS-mediated apoptosis is distinct and independent of the SMase-mediated mechanism. In the present study, we investigated whether DNA damage andATM regulate the pro-apoptotic function of CS. The data indicate that radiation-induced DNA damage signals post-translational activation of CS, ceramide generation, and apoptosis, whereas ATM down-modulates this response. CS activation appeared obligatory for DNA damage-induced death since FB1 blocked [125I]dURd-induced ceramide elevation and apoptosis. Irradiated AT cells exhibited increased CS activation and apoptosis, reversed by transfection with wild type ATM, whereas antisense inactivation of ATM in normal cells recapitulated the AT phenotype. Thus, signals from DNA damage and ATM appear to reciprocally regulate the activity of CS and consequently apoptosis after radiation exposure. Cloned populations of BAEC were established from the intima of bovine aorta and grown as described previously in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere (50Haimovitz-Friedman A. Balaban N. McLoughlin M. Ehleiter D. Michaeli J. Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2591-2597PubMed Google Scholar). During the phase of exponential growth, purified human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (1 ng/ml) was added every other day. After 5–7 days in culture, the cells reached confluence and exhibited features of contact-inhibited monolayers. The culture medium was then changed to fresh DMEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). These plateau phase cells were maintained in culture medium for another 3–4 days before experiments. AT lines are EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells derived from the peripheral blood of adult AT patients and have been previously characterized, whereas control lymphoblastoid lines are derived from normal donors (35Chen P.C. Lavin M.F. Kidson C. Moss D. Nature. 1978; 274: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Stably transfected cell lines containing ATM or antisenseATM cDNA expression vectors were generated by Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) transfection of pMAT1 and pMAT2 vectors, respectively (51Zhang N.

For experiments, expression of ATM or antisense ATM cDNA constructs in C3ABR and AT1ABR cells was achieved by treating cells with 3–5 μm CdCl2 (Sigma) for 8–16 h and was evaluated by Western blotting using ATM-4BA antibody as described (51Zhang N.

Irradiation of cultured cells was carried out at 25 °C in a Gamma-cell 40 chamber containing two sources of 137Cs (Atomic Energy of Canada) at a dose rate of 100 cGy/min. One hour prior to irradiation, the culture medium was changed to RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% human albumin (Alpine Biologics). For irradiation of mice, 4–6-week-old male C3H/HeJ or homozygous acid sphingomyelinase knock-out mice (54Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J.

Our animal housing facility is approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and is maintained in accordance with the regulations and standards of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health. Incorporation of [125I]dURd was carried out using pre-confluent BAEC, pulsed with [125I]dURd (0.25 nm IdURd; 0.5 μCi 125I/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks' buffered saline solution and incubated in fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. After 3 h, cells were detached from the monolayer by 2 min incubation with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA at 25 °C, pelleted, and resuspended in the freezing medium (25% calf serum, 10% Me2SO, 65% DMEM). The cell pellet was frozen at −80 °C overnight and subsequently stored at −180 °C in liquid nitrogen for 1–30 days. Prior to experiments, cells were thawed by incubation in a 38 °C water bath and subsequently plated in culture media as described above. Endothelial cells appear resistant to the freeze and thaw procedure employed, since after thawing >95% of the cells were recovered, and the viability according to the trypan blue exclusion test was >98%. Morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin of cells undergoing apoptosis were detected by staining with the DNA-binding fluorochrome bisbenzimide trihydrochloride (Hoechst 33258; Sigma) as described previously (46Bose R.

For these studies, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and nuclei and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation at 11,000 × g. Reactions were performed using 20 μg of cell extract in 0.2 ml of reaction buffer containing 8 μm Z-DEVD-AFC according to the manufacturer's instructions (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA). At the indicated times after irradiation, monolayers of BAEC or A431 cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lipids were extracted with two incubations of methanol for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by an equal volume of chloroform and 0.6 volume of buffered saline solution/EDTA (135 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA). For cells in suspension culture, cells were pelleted at 800 × g for 5 min, washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended in 0.6 ml of cold PBS, and extracted with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol, 1 n HCl (100:100:1, v/v/v), as described (46Bose R.

Lipids in the organic (lower) phase were dried under N2 and subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis (1 n methanolic KOH for 1 h at 37 °C) to remove glycerophospholipids. Ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol kinase (DAG) assay as described previously (46Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.

[125I]dURd-treated BAEC were thawed, plated in culture medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h as described above. Cells were then placed on ice followed by the addition of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) and incubation at 37 °C to start incorporation. At the indicated times, lipids were extracted and subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis as described above. 3H-Labeled ceramide was resolved by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (94:2:4), detected by comigration with ceramide standards, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting (46Bose R.

These proteins were found to contain N-terminal caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs) and novel C-terminal domains (CTDs) and were therefore named CLAPs (CARD-like apoptoticproteins). The cellular and viral CLAPs induce apoptosis downstream of caspase-8 by activating the Apaf-1-caspase-9 pathway and activate NF-κB by acting upstream of the NF-κB-inducing kinase, NIK, and the IkB kinase, IKKα. Deletion of either the CARD or the CTD domain inhibits both activities. The CARD domain was found to be important for homo- and heterodimerization of CLAPs. Substitution of the CARD domain with an inducible FKBP12 oligomerization domain produced a molecule that can induce NF-κB activation, suggesting that the CARD domain functions as an oligomerization domain, whereas the CTD domain functions as the effector domain in the NF-κB activation pathway. Expression of the CARD domain of human CLAP abrogates tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB activation, suggesting that cellular CLAP plays an essential role in this pathway of NF-κB activation.

The transcription factor NF-κB is a critical regulator of cellular response to infectious agents, stress, injury, and inflammation (reviewed in Refs. 1Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwartz E.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). The transcriptionally active NF-κB is a homo- or a heterodimer of two subunits, which belong to a family of transcriptional regulatory proteins known as the NF-κB/Rel family (reviewed in Refs. 8Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar and 9May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol.

Among these, the p50 and p52 are made as inactive precursor molecules (p105 and p100, respectively), which are proteolytically processed to the smaller transcriptionally active forms. All family members contain a conserved N-terminal domain called the Rel homology domain that contains the necessary residues for dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding (8Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar, 9May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol.

Science. 1991; 251: 1490-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, the NF-κB heterodimer is sequestered in an inactive form in the cytosol through non-covalent interactions with the family of the IκB inhibitory proteins which includes IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε (1Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwartz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). These interactions mask the nuclear localization signals of the NF-κB heterodimer, thereby preventing it from translocating to the nucleus. In response to a variety of signaling events, IκBα is phosphorylated, which targets the protein to degradation via a ubiquitination-dependent pathway. This unmasks the NF-κB nuclear localization signals allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and induce the expression of a number of target genes (9May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Some of the target gene products, such as cIAP-1, cIAP-2, TRAF1, and TRAF2, have been shown to protect cells from cell death induced by TNF-α 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; CARD, caspase-recruitment domains; IL-1R, interleukin-1 receptor; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; CTD, C-terminal domains; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ORF, open reading frame; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; DED, death-effector domain; EHV, equine herpesvirus; HA, hemagglutinin.

The proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and interleukin-1 induce NF-κB activation by binding to their cell-surface receptors, TNF-R1, TNF-R2, or IL-1R, respectively (8Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar, 15Baeuele P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar, 16Vandenabeele P.

Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these receptors do not share sequence homology, they all activate the NF-κB-inducing kinase NIK and NF-κB through distinct signaling pathways (9May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 17Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the TNF-R1, like several other members of the TNF-R family, contains an intracellular region known as the death domain which is required for both apoptosis induction and NF-κB activation (reviewed in Refs. 18Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar and 19Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). Binding of TNF-α to the extracellular ligand binding domain of TNF-R1 induces aggregation of its death domain and assembly of a signaling complex containing TRADD (TNF-R1-associated death domain protein), TRAF2 (TNF-associated factor 2), and RIP (receptor interacting protein) (20Hsu H.

Similarly, aggregation of the IL-1R by its ligand results in the assembly of an intracellular signaling complex containing the IL-1R accessory protein AcP, the adaptor protein MyD88, the IL-1-activated kinases, IRAK1 and IRAK2, and the TRAF protein, TRAF6 (25Cao Z.

These two distinct complexes somehow trigger activation of NIK which in turn phosphorylates the IκB kinases α and β (IKKα and IKKβ) that then phosphorylate IkBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (reviewed in Refs. 9May M.J.

Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of IκBα targets it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, allowing the active NF-κB heterodimer to translocate to the nucleus (9May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol.

Signals are relayed from the non-enzymatic components of the TNF-R1 or IL-1R complexes to the enzymatic effector components via homotypic and heterotypic interactions between domains present in these components. The death domain for example, which is present in TNF-R1, TRADD, and RIP, mediates interactions necessary for the assembly of the NF-κB-activating complex and the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (9May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 17Baeuerle P.A. Curr.

This domain is also present in proteins of the IL-1R complex, such as MyD88, IRAK1, and IRAK2 (25Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 27Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A. Ju G. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Two other structurally related domains, known as the death-effector domain (DED) and the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD), mediate interactions between the initiator caspases and death-inducing signaling complexes (31Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 257: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 32Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G.

Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The DISC of TNF-R1 utilizes the adaptor molecule FADD which contains both death and DED domains to relay its death signal (19Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). After stimulation of TNF-R1 by its ligand, TNF-R1 recruits TRADD and FADD through homologous death domain interactions. The DED domain of FADD then interacts with the homologous DED domains of procaspase-8 and -10, causing their oligomerization and activation (19Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). The DISC of TNF-R1 also recruits another adaptor molecule with a death domain called CRADD or RAIDD to transmit its death signal (34Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 615-619PubMed Google Scholar, 35Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Similar to FADD, CRADD uses its CARD domain to interact with the homologous CARD domain of procaspase-2 to induce its oligomerization and activation (34Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 615-619PubMed Google Scholar, 35Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The CARD is also found in the prodomain of other apical caspases such as procaspase-1, -4, -5, and -9 and the apoptosis regulatory molecule Apaf-1 (31Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 257: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 36Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). In the Apaf-1 DISC, this domain is involved in binding and subsequent oligomerization of procaspase-9 by Apaf-1 (37Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Because of the importance of CARD-containing proteins as regulators of apoptosis, we decided to search the public data base for novel sequences that contain homologous CARD domains. Here we report the identification of a CARD-containing viral protein and its mammalian homolog, and we provide evidence that these proteins, named CLAPs, are involved in regulation of NF-κB activation and apoptosis. The full-length open reading frame of E10 (vCLAP) within the genome of the equine herpesvirus-2 (EHV-2) (GenBankTM accession number U20824) was cloned by PCR using the EHV-2 genomic template (a kind gift from Dr. A. J. Davison, University of Glasgow, UK) and the following PCR adaptor primers: E10-start, GAAGATCTATGGCGGAGAAATACCCTC; E10-stop, CCGCTCGAGTCTCTTAGATGTGTTGCAC. The resulting PCR product was digested with BglII and XhoI and ligated to aBamHI/XhoI cut T7-pcDNA-3 vector. By using the TBLASTN program, several human and mouse partial EST sequences with homology to the CARD domain of vCLAP were identified. The corresponding EST clones (human clones 703916 and 812172; mouse clone 902716) were obtained from the IMAGE consortium, and their entire nucleotide sequences were determined by automated sequencing. These clones were found to encode identical full-length open reading frames as evident from the presence of stop codons upstream of the initiator methionines. Tissue distribution analysis of human CLAP mRNA was performed by Northern blot analysis on normal and tumor MTN Blots (purchased from CLONTECH). Each lane contains 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from specific tissues or cell lines. The blots were probed with a radiolabeled riboprobe prepared from a full-length human CLAP cDNA template and then subjected to autoradiography. The entire open reading frames of vCLAP and hCLAP were amplified by PCR using complementary PCR adaptor primers spanning the initiation and stop codons of these genes. CLAP deletion mutants were also generated by PCR using modified complementary PCR adaptor primers. The conserved L41 in the CARD domain of hCLAP was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlapping PCR as described before (39Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N.

FLAG and T7 epitope tagging was done by cloning the PCR-generated cDNAs of the respective genes in-frame into pFLAG CMV-2 and pcDNA-3-T7 vectors, respectively. GFP fusion constructs were generated by cloning the PCR-generated cDNAs of the respective genes in frame into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP (CLONTECH). FKBP12 fusion of CLAP-L41R and CLAP-CTD was constructed in pFkp3-HA vector (generous gift of Dr. X. Yang, University of Pennsylvania) which contain three tandem repeats of FKBP12 with an N-terminally fused c-Src myristoylation signal and a C-terminally fused HA tag (40Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding CRADD, caspase-9DN, Apaf-1, DR5, X-IAP, Bcl-xL, p35, and kinase-inactive mutants of NIK or IKKα have been described before (34Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V.

The 5×κB-luciferase reporter plasmid was from Stratagene. 293 or 293T cells (5 × 106 cells) in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids (8 μg/plate) using the LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) method. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with anti-FLAG-M5 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.). The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose, washed extensively, and then eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western analysis with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated T7-antibody (Novagen). The total lysates were also resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western analysis using the anti-FLAG-M5 and T7 antibody. The phosphatase treatments of hCLAP were done using λ phosphatase as described in Bellacosa et al. (45Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). MCF-Fas cells (0.5 × 105cells/well) in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.1 μg of LacZ reporter plasmid, 0.25 μg of various expression plasmids, and 0.75 μg of various apoptosis inhibitor/empty vector plasmids using the LipofectAMINETM method. Cells were stained for β-galactosidase activity 30–36 h after transfection. In some experiments cells were treated with cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) with or without hTNF-α (10 ng/ml) or Fas antibody (50 ng/ml) or recombinant soluble TRAIL (200 ng/ml) for 6 h before staining. Normal and apoptotic blue cells were counted. The percentage of apoptotic cells in each experiment was expressed as the mean percentage of stained apoptotic cells as a fraction of the total number of blue cells. Data represent the average of at least three individual experiments (n = 3 and S.D. ±1–4%). NF-κB activation was done using a luciferase reporter gene. 2 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate were transfected with 5×κB-luciferase reporter plasmid and various expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINETM method as per the manufacturer's instructions. For Jurkat cells, transfections were done by electroporation using Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase assay as described in Lin et al. (44Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T.J. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In certain experiments, cells were treated with hTNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 5 h prior to harvesting. To normalize for transfection efficiency, all transfections included a LacZ-expressing plasmid, and the lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Data represent the average of at least three individual experiments (n = 3 and S.D. ±0.1–0.4). To identify novel molecules that contain CARD domains, we searched public data bases for sequences that are homologous to the CARD sequence of Apaf-1 (residues 1–100). By using this strategy, we found that the 210-amino acid deduced open reading frame of the EHV-2 E10 (ORF-E10) contains an N-terminal CARD domain (residues 21–107) that is ∼27% identical to the CARD of Apaf-1 (Fig. 1,A and C). Interestingly, the E10 CARD domain exhibits higher identity with the N-terminal prodomains of caspase-9 (∼31%), caspase-2 (∼28%), and CED-3 (∼29%) and exhibits significant homology with the CARD domain of the adaptor molecule CRADD/RAIDD (23% identity). To clone the ORF-E10, we generated PCR primers complementary to the start and stop codons of E10 based on the GenBankTM genomic sequence of EHV-2-E10 (accession number U20824). The PCR primers were then used on an EHV-2 genomic template to amplify the ORF-E10 by PCR. Interestingly, after sequencing of the cloned PCR products, we found an extra base (G) at position 428 relative to the ATG start site. This extra base shifts the reading frame of E10, resulting in a longer open reading frame which encodes a 311-amino acid-long protein (Fig.1 A). The corrected ORF-E10, which represents the actual ORF of the EHV-2-E10 gene, differs from the GenBankTM ORF-E10 after amino acid 142. To identify cellular homologs of EHV-2-E10, we searched the GenBankTM expressed sequence tags (EST) data base with the ORF-E10 sequence. Several human and mouse EST clones were identified, and their 3′ and 5′ sequences were compiled. Sequence analysis of the human and mouse cDNAs revealed that they encode proteins of 233 amino acids with an overall ∼34% identity to the viral E10 (Fig.1 B). The two proteins share a high sequence identity (∼91%), suggesting that they are the human and mouse orthologs. Interestingly, the highest sequence identity between the cellular and viral proteins lies within the N-terminal CARD homology domain (cellular protein, residues 13–99; viral protein, residues 21–107). In this region the two proteins share ∼47% identity. In this region also, the cellular protein has 20, 21, 26, and 29% identity to the CARD domain of Apaf-1, caspase-9, caspase-2, and CRADD, respectively (Fig. 1 C). The selective conservation of the CARD homology domain within the mammalian and viral proteins suggests that they might play a role in regulating apoptosis. Based on their homology to the CARD domain and their apoptotic activity (see below), we call these proteins CLAPs (for CARD-likeapoptotic proteins). Sequence analysis of the cellular and viral CLAPs revealed that they have a dual domain structure similar to several adaptor molecules that regulate apoptosis, such as FADD and CRADD. As mentioned above, the vCLAP and cCLAP have N-terminal CARD homology domains that might be necessary for interaction with proximal signal transducing molecules. However, their C-terminal domains (CTD, cCLAP residues 100–233; vCLAP residues 108–311) are unique in that they share no significant sequence homology with each other or any other known proteins. Interestingly, the CTD domain of cCLAP is rich in Ser/Thr residues, whereas that of vCLAP is rich in Gly residues. An abundance of the Ser/Thr residues in cCLAP suggests that it might be regulated by phosphorylation. Hydrophilicity plots revealed that the CARDs of CLAPs contain characteristic hydrophilic stretches similar to the ones present in the CARDs of several CARD-containing proteins such as caspase-9, Apaf-1, or CRADD (Fig. 1 D). Surprisingly, the hydrophilicity plots revealed that their CTD domains are also structurally related and contain similar profiles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic stretches (Fig.1 D). Therefore, the cellular and viral CLAPs may be overall structurally related and may function as adaptor molecules for an as yet unidentified signaling complex(es). To determine the distribution of cCLAP, various normal human tissues and tumor cell line mRNA samples were subjected to Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.2 A, cCLAP mRNA (∼2.5 kilobase pairs) is constitutively expressed in all the normal tissues examined with particularly high expression in the pancreas and in lymphoid organs. Smaller transcripts (∼2.0, ∼1.6, and ∼1.3 kilobase pairs), which could represent alternatively spliced cCLAP mRNAs, were detected in skeletal muscle, placenta, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocyte. The major cCLAP mRNA transcript and the smaller isoforms were also detected in all the tumor cell mRNA samples examined (Fig. 2, lower panel). Many regulators of apoptosis such as the death receptors, the adaptor molecules FADD, CRADD, and RIP, the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and others, induce apoptosis when overexpressed in the absence of additional apoptotic signals (34Ahmad M.

It is possible that overexpression of these molecules mimics or provides the necessary signal to initiate the apoptotic cascade. We therefore examined whether the viral and cellular CLAPs are able to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in human cells. To this end we transiently transfected MCF-7 cells with constructs encoding full-length CLAP proteins or the CARD or CTD domains of cCLAP. The transfected cells were then examined for morphological features of apoptosis. Both the full-length viral and cellular CLAP proteins induced apoptosis in the absence of additional apoptotic signals (Fig. 3 A). However, the CARD or the CTD of cCLAP had marginal apoptotic activity, suggesting that the intact protein is required for induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, both intact vCLAP and cCLAPs exhibited higher apoptotic activity in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that these molecules could also regulate genes that inhibit apoptosis (see below). To gain a better understanding of how vCLAP and cCLAP might engage the death pathway, we investigated their activities with respect to various inhibitors of apoptosis. The viral serpin CrmA inhibits the initiator caspase-8 but has relatively weak inhibitory activity toward the initiator caspase-9 or the effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) (48Srinivasula S.M.

Incubation of these carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins with adipocyte cell extracts revealed a specific interaction of GLUT4 with fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. In the presence of aldolase, GST-G4 but not GST-G1 was able to co-pellet with filamentous (F)-actin. This interaction was prevented by incubation with the aldolase substrates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrated a significant co-localization of aldolase and GLUT4 in intact 3T3L1 adipocytes, which decreased following insulin stimulation. Introduction into permeabilized 3T3L1 adipocytes of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or the metabolic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose, two agents that disrupt the interaction between aldolase and actin, inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis without affecting GLUT4 endocytosis. Furthermore, microinjection of an aldolase-specific antibody also inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. These data suggest that aldolase functions as a scaffolding protein for GLUT4 and that glucose metabolism may provide a negative feedback signal for the regulation of glucose transport by insulin.

Under basal conditions, GLUT4 slowly recycles between poorly defined intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane with the vast majority sequestered in these intracellular storage sites. Insulin stimulates a large increase in the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis concomitant with a smaller decrease in the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis (5Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol.

The overall insulin-induced changes in GLUT4 trafficking kinetics result in a 10–20-fold increase in the number of cell surface GLUT4 proteins that accounts for the majority of insulin-stimulated increases in glucose transport activity (8Rea S.

Recently, several laboratories have begun to examine the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 to identify the mechanism responsible for the intracellular sequestration of the GLUT4 protein. Steady-state and kinetic analysis of various expressed GLUT4 chimeric proteins have indicated that both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains are important in GLUT4 internalization from the plasma membrane (10Marshall B.A. Murata H.

In particular, the carboxyl-terminal dileucine motif (SLL) was found to substantially alter GLUT4 trafficking kinetics and steady-state localization (16Corvera S. Chawla A. Chakrabarti R. Joly M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a specific GLUT4 sequence responsible for intracellular localization has yet to be identified, the presence of a carboxyl-terminal retention signal is consistent with the observation that expression of the GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal domain results in the translocation of the endogenous GLUT4 protein to the plasma membrane (18Lee W. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21427-21431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of a GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal binding protein can also account for the apparent increase in GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal antibody immunoreactivity following insulin stimulation (19Smith R.M.

To address these issues, we have used GST fusion proteins to identify and characterize GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal specific binding proteins. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of GLUT4 can specifically associate with the bifunctional glycolytic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. This in vitrointeraction appears to be physiologically important as glycolytic intermediates that disrupt aldolase-actin interactions also inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.

Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In labeling experiments, 3T3L1 adipocytes were incubated with 10 μCi/ml Tran35S label (ICN) for 24 h before isolation of cell extracts in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol. Insoluble material was separated by microcentrifugation and extracts precleared by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 48 °C followed by a second 1 h incubation with the GST fusion protein. The beads were then washed three times with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton-100, 10% glycerol, bound proteins eluted using Laemmli sample buffer and samples subjected to SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography or aldolase immunoblotting. For large scale preparation of the GST-GLUT4 binding proteins, rat epididymal fat pads were isolated from 50 rats. Cell extracts were incubated with the GST fusion proteins, eluants transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and N-terminal sequences determined using an automated protein sequencer at the University of Michigan Protein Core Facility. Immunoblotting was performed as described (22Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Aldolase and GST fusion protein solutions were dialyzed against 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8, overnight at 48 °C and precleared by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm (TLA100 rotor, Beckman). 200 μg of rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin (Sigma) purified as described (23Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) and 100 μl of the 20-μl aldolase solution were mixed for 30 min at room temperature following 5–10 strokes in a pestle homogenizer. The mixture was centrifuged and 300 μg/ml GST fusion protein was added to the pellet and suspended with a small plastic homogenizer rod. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the mixture was again centrifuged, and the supernatants and pellets subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) were added to both the aldolase and the GST fusion proteins at a concentration of 50 μm as indicated. 3T3L1 adipocytes on glass coverslips were serum-starved for 3 h then left untreated or stimulated for 30 min with 100 nminsulin. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and quenched in 100 mm glutamine/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cells were then washed and sequentially incubated in 5% donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline blocking buffer, 1:200 IA02 anti-GLUT4 and 1:100 anti-aldolase (Biogenesis), and 12.5 μg/ml FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and 12.5 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs) and viewed with a Bio-Rad laser confocal. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared from 3T3L1 adipocytes as described (24Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

For 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) treatment of intact 3T3L1 adipocytes, cells were serum starved and placed into glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm pyruvate and 5 mm glutamine with or without 5 mm 2DG for 5 min before insulin stimulation. For fluorescence microscopy, the membrane sheets were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and sequentially incubated with 5% donkey serum, a 1:100 dilution of a rabbit anti-insulin regulatable glucose transporter antibody (East Acres) and 6.25 μg/ml of LRSC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For immunoblotting experiments, cells were stimulated with 20 nm insulin for 20 min, membrane sheets were isolated and solubilized in a modified lysis buffer (22Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Santeler S.R.

A protein assay was performed, and lysates were placed into Laemmli sample buffer without boiling. The 3T3L1 adipocytes were permeabilized with Streptolysin-O (SLO; Murex Diagnostics Limited) as described (25Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, adipocytes were washed 3 times with an intracellular buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 140 mml-glutamic acid, 5 mm EGTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) and then incubated for 5 min at 378 °C in intracellular buffer with 0.8 IU/ml Streptolysin-O and 10 mm MgATP. For immunofluorescence studies, cells were washed in buffer (10 mm MgATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and treated for 5 min with either 5 mm 2DG, 25 mmFBP, or other aldolase substrates as indicated before insulin stimulation. 3T3L1 adipocytes were placed into L-15 medium and microinjected using an Eppendorf Micromanipulator 5171 and Transjector 5246. Injection buffer consisted of 100 mm KCl and 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, with 1.0 mg/ml FITC-dextran (Sigma), 1.2 mg/ml maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Ras CAAX, and 2.5 mg/ml either aldolase antibody (Biogenesis) or pre-immune serum (Research Genetics). Microinjected cells were placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h, treated with or without 20 nm insulin for 20 min, and plasma membrane sheets isolated. Sheets were incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of sheep anti-MBP antibody (generously provided by Dr. Morris Birnbaum) and 1:400 dilution of IAO2 GLUT4 antibody, followed by incubation in 12.5 mg/ml FITC-conjugated donkey anti-sheep and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). In each experiment, 20–40 injected cells positive for FITC-MBP were scored for GLUT4-specific immunofluorescence by two individuals blinded to treatment. The results of two or three independent experiments were analyzed using the analysis program InStat 2.0. To identify proteins that interact with the GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal domain, we expressed the GLUT1 and GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids as GST fusions, GST-G1 and GST-G4, respectively. An additional fusion construct of the GLUT4 carboxyl terminus was generated containing a substitution of two residues shown to be important in GLUT4 endocytosis, leucines 488 and 489, with alanine and serine (GST-G4*), respectively (15Garippa R.J.

Incubation of GST and GST-G4 with extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in the binding of multiple proteins. However, there were two faint bands at 40 and 43 kDa that appeared to specifically precipitate with GST-G4 and GST-G4* but not with GST or GST-G1 (Fig. 1 A). Pretreatment of 3T3L1 adipocytes with insulin before isolation of the cell extracts had no significant effect on the in vitro association of the 40 and 43 kDa protein with GST-G4 and GST-G4* (Fig. 1 A). Cell extracts were also prepared from primary isolated rat adipocytes and incubated with the GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1 B). Similar to 3T3L1 adipocytes, Coomassie Blue staining of these precipitates demonstrated that the 40- and 43-kDa proteins were specifically precipitated with GST-G4 and GST-G4* but not by GST or GST-G1. Although other more intense bands were detected on the Coomassie Blue stained gel, these were also seen in the absence of lysate and were therefore nonspecific. We could not obtain a defined amino acid sequence following purification of the 43-kDa protein; however, the 40-kDa protein was partially sequenced and identified as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. To confirm that the 40-kDa protein that bound GST-G4 and GST-G4* was aldolase, immunoblotting with an aldolase-specific antibody was performed (Fig. 1 C). Incubation of cell extracts with GST-G4 and GST-G4* resulted in the co-precipitation of a 40-kDa protein that demonstrated specific immunoreactivity with an aldolase antibody. In contrast, no immunoreactive proteins were detected in the GST or GST-G1 precipitates. Furthermore, as observed in the [35S]methionine-labeled 3T3L1 adipocytes, cell extracts from insulin-stimulated cells also precipitated aldolase immunoreactivity in the presence of GST-G4 and GST-G4* but not GST or GST-G1. These data demonstrate that the 40-kDa protein that specifically binds the carboxyl-terminal domain of GLUT4 is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. Aldolase is an unusual protein in that it not only possesses enzymatic activity but also plays a structural role in the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton (26O'Reilly G. Clarke F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The interaction of aldolase with actin can be modulated by aldolase substrates and products (27Wang J. Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. Pagliaro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6861-6865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Kusakabe T. Motoki K. Hori K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine the allosteric effect of these and related molecules on the binding of aldolase to GST-G4 (Fig.2). Dose-response relationships demonstrated that 1 mm FBP, a concentration similar to theK m of the enzyme for this substrate, completely inhibited the binding of aldolase to GST-G4 in vitro (Fig.2 A). The aldolase reaction product, G3P, also inhibited GST-G4 binding to aldolase, although at a significantly higher concentration, 10 mm (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the aldolase product dihydroxyacetone phosphate, as well as two other structurally related sugars, fructose 1-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, had no effect on the interaction between GST-G4 and aldolase (Fig. 2, C, D, and E). Previous studies have demonstrated that aldolase is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and can cross-link actin fibers (27Wang J. Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. Pagliaro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6861-6865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Pagliaro L. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the actin cytoskeleton has also been implicated in the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking (30Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we next examined the ability of aldolase to function as a molecular scaffold linking GLUT4 to F-actin (Fig.3). F-actin was pre-incubated with aldolase, followed by a second incubation with GST-G1 or GST-G4. When the actin was pelleted by centrifugation, GST-G4 was found to be specifically associated with actin in the presence of aldolase (Fig. 3,lane 1). GST-G4 did not co-pellet with actin in the absence of aldolase, suggesting that the GLUT4 protein binds to actin indirectly (Fig. 3, lane 5). Likewise, the aldolase·GST-G4 complex was not pelleted by centrifugation in the absence of actin (Fig. 3, lane 7). GST-G1 did not associate with actin in either the absence or presence of aldolase (Fig. 3, lanes 4and 6). As previously observed in Fig. 2, FBP and G3P can inhibit the association of aldolase with GST-G4. FBP and G3P were also able to prevent the formation of the F-actin·aldolase·GST-G4 ternary complex (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). These data indicate that in vitro, aldolase can function as a molecular scaffold linking the carboxyl-terminal domain of GLUT4 with filamentous actin. To determine whether aldolase and GLUT4 were co-localized in vivo, double immunofluorescence labeling was performed. 3T3L1 adipocytes were treated with or without insulin, fixed, and incubated with aldolase and GLUT4-specific antibodies followed by labeling with complimentary fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (Fig.4). Under basal conditions, the membrane bound GLUT4 protein was found primarily in a peri-nuclear distribution and in small vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4,panel A). Following insulin stimulation, GLUT4 moved to the cell surface generating a “rim”-like fluorescence (Fig. 4,panel D). Conversely, the soluble protein aldolase stained in a diffusely cytosolic pattern although it was also concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell (Fig. 4, panels B andE). When their respective labels are superimposed, GLUT4 and aldolase exhibited a high degree of co-localization (Fig. 4,panels C and F), suggesting an in vivoassociation between aldolase and the GLUT4-containing compartments. To further investigate the in vivo significance of these findings, we took advantage of the glycolytic inhibitor 2DG, which induces the dissociation of perinuclear aldolase from the actin cytoskeleton (32Pagliaro L. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane can be detected by the fluorescent detection of a GLUT4 antibody on the cytoplasmic face of isolated plasma membrane sheets. Pretreatment of 3T3L1 adipocytes with 5 mm 2DG slightly reduced the amount of basal plasma membrane GLUT4 immunofluorescence (Fig.5 A, panels 1 and3). In contrast, pretreatment with 2DG markedly attenuated the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface (Fig.5 A, panels 2 and 4). The 2DG inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation occurred in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of approximately 100 mm (data not shown). This inhibition of GLUT4 translocation was also observed in GLUT4 immunoblots of isolated plasma membranes without any effect on the plasma membrane association of the clathrin heavy chain (Fig. 5 B). The blockade of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by 2DG could be due to either an inhibition of exocytosis or an increase in endocytosis. To determine whether 2DG affected the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis, we stimulated cells with insulin, removed the insulin by washing with an acidic buffer, and then assayed plasma membrane GLUT4 at various times after insulin removal in the presence of 2DG. Disappearance of GLUT4 from the cell surface after insulin removal was not inhibited by 2DG treatment but rather seemed to be slightly enhanced (data not shown). This small increase in the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis in the presence of 2DG likely reflected the inhibition of further GLUT4 exocytosis following insulin removal. This effect was similar to that reported for wortmannin, which also inhibits GLUT4 exocytosis but appears to enhance endocytosis due to the inhibition of residual exocytosis (33Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis was not significantly affected by 2DG pretreatment and is consistent with an inhibition of GLUT4 exocytosis. Although cells were incubated with glutamine and pyruvate as alternative energy sources during 2DG treatment, cellular ATP levels were found to decrease by 40% (data not shown). Because endocytosis and exocytosis may have different sensitivities to ATP depletion, the inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis could have been due to this decrease in ATP. To ensure adequate cellular ATP levels while directly assessing the uncoupling of aldolase from GLUT4 in vivo, 3T3L1 adipocytes were permeabilized with SLO in the presence of 10 mm MgATP (Fig. 5, C and D). Under these experimental conditions, cellular metabolism did not deplete local concentrations of ATP (data not shown). In the SLO-permeabilized adipocytes, insulin induced an increase in the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 C,panels 1 and 2). As in the intact cells, preincubation with 2DG prevented GLUT4 translocation (data not shown). In addition, although preincubation with FBP slightly enhanced the basal amount of GLUT4 associated with the plasma membrane, FBP pretreatment markedly inhibited the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 (Fig. 5 C, panels 3 and 4). It should be noted that the small increase in plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 following SLO permeabilization has also been previously observed by others (25Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In agreement with the immunofluorescence analysis, immunoblotting of isolated plasma membranes demonstrated that FBP preincubation partially increased the basal plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 and inhibited the insulin-stimulated increase without affecting the plasma membrane association of the clathrin heavy chain (Fig.5 D). To examine the metabolite specificity for the inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we compared the effects of several aldolase substrates, products and related sugars on GLUT4 translocation (data not shown). Consistent with their effect on aldolase-actin binding, pretreatment of SLO-permeabilized adipocytes with dihydroxyacetone phosphate, fructose 1-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, or glucose had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation compared with control cells. To further confirm a specific requirement for aldolase in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we next microinjected cells with control or aldolase antibodies and assessed single cell GLUT4 translocation (Fig.6). Specific identification of the microinjected cells was accomplished by co-injection with a carboxyl-terminal domain of Ras fused to the MBP as a plasma membrane marker. In unstimulated cells, microinjection of either pre-immune IgG or the aldolase IgG had no effect on GLUT4 translocation, which remained at low basal levels (Fig. 6 A, panels 1-4). Microinjection of pre-immune IgG did not inhibit the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 (Fig. 6 B,panels 1 and 2). In contrast, the aldolase-specific IgG reduced the extent of GLUT4 translocation only in the cells that were microinjected but not in the surrounding nonmicroinjected cells (Fig. 6 B, panels 3 and4). Quantitation of these data demonstrated that insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 49% of cells microinjected with pre-immune IgG and 29% of cells microinjected with aldolase-specific IgG (Fig. 6 C). Together, these data provide compelling evidence for a specific functional role of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in the insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes. Previous studies have demonstrated that aldolase exhibits functional duality. In addition to its enzymatic activity, this protein plays a structural role in the binding and polymerization of actin (28Kusakabe T. Motoki K. Hori K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Pagliaro L. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,34Chen-Zion M. Livnat T. Beitner R. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D or latrunculin B has been shown to attenuate insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, suggesting that an intact actin cytoskeleton is required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (30Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, our data demonstrate that aldolase, a functional tetramer, may also serve as a scaffolding protein linking GLUT4 and hence GLUT4 vesicles, to the actin cytoskeleton. In in vitroexperiments, aldolase not only specifically interacted with the carboxyl-terminal domain of GLUT4, but linked GLUT4 to polymerized actin. This interaction was disrupted by specific substrates of aldolase that inhibit GLUT4-aldolase or aldolase-actin interactions. These specific substrates not only prevented aldolase-actin interaction but also prevented GLUT4-aldolase binding in vitro and in a manner consistent with their ability to interfere with insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in vivo. Furthermore, aldolase and GLUT4 exhibited an overlapping subcellular distribution, and microinjection of an aldolase-specific antibody reduced the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. Together, these data strongly suggest that aldolase plays a critical role in the dynamic association of GLUT4 vesicles with the actin cytoskeleton. The ability of aldolase substrates to disrupt the actin·aldolase·GLUT4 complex, as well as GLUT4 vesicle trafficking, suggests that the metabolism of glucose may provide a negative feedback signal to prevent further exocytosis of GLUT4 vesicles and potentially contribute to the mechanism of glucotoxicity. We thank Dr. Morris Birnbaum for providing glucose transporter, MBP-Ras cDNAs, and MBP antibody, Dr. Jurgen Bereiter-Hahn for supplying aldolase antibody, Dr. Jeffrey Elmendorf for assistance in analyzing microinjection results and Dr. Konstantin Kandror for helpful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript."

They died shortly after birth and displayed symptoms of severe respiratory distress with lungs filled with meconium. These features are similar to those of a severe type of human meconium aspiration syndrome. The increased expression of the hypoxia inducible genes suggests that hypoxia occurs in the mutant embryos and that it may lead to strong gasping respiration with consequent aspiration of the amniotic fluid containing meconium. A reduced number of cytotrophoblast cells in the mutant placenta was found and may be responsible for an insufficient supply of oxygen prior to birth. Using the cDNA subtraction and microarray-based expression monitoring method, the expression level of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor α gene, which plays an important role in the proliferation of trophoblasts, was found to be low in the cytotrophoblasts of the mutant placenta. In addition, ATF-2 can trans-activate the PDGF receptor α gene promoter in the co-transfection assay. These results indicate the important role of ATF-2 in the formation of the placenta and the relationship between placental anomalies and neonatal respiratory distress.

Early Hum. Dev. 1995; 41: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 2Katz V.L. Bowes Jr., W.A. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1992; 166: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, our understanding of this entity is incomplete. Aspiration of meconium particles may occur before, during, or after delivery and is associated with deep inspiratory movements because of fetal respiratory depression. Aspiration of meconium may cause mechanical obstruction of the airways, chemical pneumonitis, and surfactant inactivation. Although MAS can be prevented in the majority of infants by appropriate suctioning at birth or by early administration of surfactant, the severe form of MAS is still a neonatal problem that remains to be resolved (3Thureen P.J. Hall D.M. Hoffenberg A. Tyson R.W. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 967-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A number of transcription factors of the ATF/CREB family, all of which contain a DNA-binding domain consisting of a cluster of basic amino acids and a leucine zipper region (b-zip), have been identified (for review, see Ref. 4Karin M. Smeal T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). They bind to the cAMP response element (CRE) as homodimers or heterodimers formed through the leucine zipper. Among the numerous transcription factors of the ATF/CREB family, three factors, ATF-2 (also called CRE-BP1), ATF-a, and CRE-BPa form a subgroup (5Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T.

Zu Y.-L. Maekawa T. Tabata S. Akiyama T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4259-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These factors are capable of forming homodimers or heterodimers with c-Jun (10Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). A common characteristic of this group of factors is their activation by the stress-activated protein kinases such as the Jun amino-terminal kinase and p38 (11Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 12Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N.

The stress-activated protein kinases phosphorylate this group of factors at sites close to the NH2-terminal transcriptional activation domain containing the metal finger structure and stimulate theirtrans-activating capacity. Because a group of factors of the ATF/CREB family including CREB are activated via direct phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (14Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar), the CREB and ATF-2 subgroups are linked to the distinct signaling cascades involving the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and stress-activated protein kinase pathways. Within its subgroup ATF-2 has been most extensively studied and shown to be ubiquitously expressed with the highest level of expression being observed in the brain (15Takeda J. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Seino Y. Imura H. Saito N. Tanaka C. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar). ATF-2 mutant mice generated by gene targeting exhibited decreased postnatal viability and growth with a defect in endochondral ossification and ataxia accompanied by a decreased number of cerebellar Purkinje cells (16Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W.U. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Colins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Here we report that independently generated mouse null mutants of ATF-2 show features of severe respiratory distress, which are similar to those of a severe type of human MAS (3Thureen P.J. Hall D.M. Hoffenberg A. Tyson R.W. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 967-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This phenotype is different from that previously reported for ATF-2-deficient mice (16Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W.U. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Colins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which we show here to contain small amounts of a mutant protein and hence refer to as ATF-2m/m. The ATF-2 genomic clones were isolated from a library derived from TT2 cells by the standard plaque hybridization procedure. A 10.0-kb genomic DNA subfragment, which contains the exon encoding amino acids 327–395, was used to generate the targeting vector. A neomycin cassette driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase gene promoter was inserted into the newly generated BglII site between amino acids 378 and 379 in this exon. To increase the frequency of gene targeting, the diphtheria toxin-poly(A) signal cassette for negative selection was fused to the short arm as described (17Yagi T. Nada S. Watanabe N. Tamemoto H. Kohmura N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The embryonic stem (ES) cells used were TT2 cells derived from an F1 embryo resulting from a cross between C57BL/6 and CBA mice (18Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Furuta Y. Nada S. Yoshida M. Tsukada T. Saga Y. Takeda T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). TheNotI-linearized targeting vector (100 μg) was electroporated into 1.0 × 107 TT2 cells. Targeted clones were selected after 7–10 days growth in the presence of G418 (150 μg/ml) and were then expanded in duplicate 24-well plates. The homologous nature of the recombination was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using several restriction enzymes and several probes located either inside or outside the targeting vector. In addition, three different primers, shown in Fig. 1 A, were used to amplify a 1100-base pair fragment from the wild type allele or a 1000-base pair fragment from the mutant allele. Chimeras were produced by injecting about 10 ES cells into 40 ICR 8-cell embryos and transplanting the embryos into the uterus of pseudopregnant females. Six- to eight-week-old male progeny with a high degree of chimerism were derived from three clones and were bred with BALB/c, C57BL/6, or ICR females to produce heterozygous mice capable of transmitting the targeted allele through the germ line. The mice were maintained by the Division of Experimental Animal Research, RIKEN. Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured cells, embryos, and tail clippings by digestion overnight at 55 °C in lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) followed by RNase A treatment, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA (about 20 μg) was digested withBglII and resolved on 0.8% agarose gels. The brains of 18.5-days postcoitum (dpc) fetuses were washed in PBS, resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm EDTA, 0.9% Triton X-100, 0.9% sodium deoxycholate, 0.09% SDS, and 1% Trasylol, and homogenized. After centrifugation, samples of lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and ATF-2 protein was detected using anti-ATF-2 polyclonal antibodies, which were raised against the full-length recombinant ATF-2 protein and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Embryos and placentas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to standard procedures. Paraffin sections of 4 μm were cut and used for immunohistochemistry. Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the bacterially expressed full-length ATF-2 and anti-PDGF receptor α antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz) were used. ATF-2 immunoreactivity was enhanced by treatment for 15 min in an autoclave at 120 °C, and PDGF receptor α immunoreactivity was enhanced by microwave treatment for 25 min at 60 °C. Primary antibody-antigen complexes were detected by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel Co.), and the signal was amplified by biotin-tyramide (NEN Life Science Products). In situ hybridization using the digoxigenin-labeled PDGF receptor α RNA was performed essentially as described (19Holmgren L. Glaser A. Pfeifer-Ohlsson S. Ohlsson R. Development. 1991; 113: 749-754PubMed Google Scholar). RNase protection assays using the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tyrosine 3-hydroxylase probes, which were prepared by the PCR-based method, were performed as described (20Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Gropper M.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). cDNA subtraction was done using the PCR-SelectTM cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH) according to the protocol supplied by the supplier. Microarrays containing 18,378 nonredundant mouse cDNA clones chosen from the I.M.A.G.E. collection (Genome Systems, Gene Discovery Array mouse version 1.0) were used to identify the putative target genes of ATF-2 according to the procedure described by the supplier. Jar cells, a human choriocarcinoma cell line, were maintained in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB (Pepro Tech Inc.) was added to the cells directly at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. The degree of BrdUrd incorporation was examined using the cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the protocol from supplier. The luciferase reporter, in which the 2.2-kb human PDGF receptor α promoter (from −2120 to +118) was linked to the luciferase gene, was provided by Dr. S. Mosselman (21Afink G.B. Nistér M. Stassen B.H.G.J. Joosten P.H.L.J. Rademakers P.J.H. Bongcam-Rudloff E. Van Zoelen E.J.J. Mosselman S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1667-1672PubMed Google Scholar). A mixture containing 0.2 μg of the luciferase plasmid pPDGFRα-2120-luc, 0.5 μg of the plasmid to express various forms of ATF-2, and 1 μg of the internal control plasmid pact-β-gal, in which the chicken cytoplasmic β-actin promoter is linked to the β-galactosidase gene, was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and luciferase assays were performed. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 3 μg by adding the control plasmid DNA pact1. ATF-2o/o mutant mice were generated by homologous recombination in TT2 ES cells. The gene was disrupted by inserting the neomycin resistance (neo r) gene into the exon (amino acids 327–395) that encodes the DNA-binding domain consisting of the basic amino acid region between amino acids 378 and 379. Homologous recombinants were characterized by the appearance of a 2.9-kb BglII fragment with the 3′-probe and a 1000-base pair PCR-amplified fragment with the two primers A and C (Fig. 1, A and B). Chimeras were obtained from three independent mutant ES clones and mated with BALB/c females to generate F1 heterozygous mutant mice. Intercrosses between heterozygotes yielded the homozygous mutants. Wild type mice, heterozygotes, and homozygotes were born with the expected 1:2:1 ratio, but the homozygous mutant mice died immediately after birth. After birth, of a total of 326 offspring, 243 breathed regularly, made movements, arched their backs, and turned pink after ventilation of their lungs. Genotype analyses of these mice by Southern blot analysis indicated that 85 were wild type and 158 were heterozygous for the ATF-2 mutated allele. However, none were homozygous for the mutated allele. In contrast, 83 pups exhibited respiratory distress, cyanosis, and subsequently died within 10 min (Fig. 2 A). The shape, size, and body weight of these pups were similar to those of the wild type. Genotyping of the dead pups revealed that these pups were all homozygous for the ATF-2 mutated allele. Thus, the ATF-2 mutation results in perinatal recessive lethality. The same result was obtained with homozygous mutants generated from two other independently derived ATF-2-defective ES cell lines, regardless of whether they had been crossed with BALB/c, C57BL/6, or ICR mice. From these results, we conclude that homozygous ATF-2o/o mutant mice are able to develop to term but die shortly after birth as a result of respiratory failure. This phenotype of the ATF-2o/o homozygotes differed from that we 2A. Reimold and L. H. Glimcher, unpublished results. previously reported for the ATF-2m/m mice. Approximately half of ATF-2m/m mice survived over one month and exhibited complex anomalies including a defect in endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plates, an ataxic gait, and reduced numbers of cerebellar Purkinje cells (16Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W.U. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Colins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The ATF-2m/m mutant was generated by inserting the neomycin cassette into the exon encoding amino acids 277–326. However, domain analyses of the ATF-2 protein indicated that the region between amino acids 155 and 338 can be deleted without a loss of trans-activating capacity (22Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the phenotypes of the two independently generated lines of ATF-2 mutant mice suggested that a certain amount of a splice form of ATF-2 protein that we2 had failed to detect originally may be generated in the ATF-2m/m mice. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of ATF-2m/m RNA revealed a transcript that, upon sequencing, contained an in-frame splicing that removed the exon disrupted by the neomycin cassette. The mRNA species expressed in ATF-2m/m encoded the ATF-2 protein lacking the region between amino acids 277 and 326 (Fig. 1 C, lower panel). To examine whether a mutant protein was made from this transcript, whole cell lysates were prepared from the brains of wild type, ATF-2m/m, and ATF-2o/o homozygous mutant fetuses of 18.5 dpc and used for Western blotting (Fig. 1 C,upper panel). In the wild type lysates, the two forms of ATF-2 protein, consisting of 70- and 62-kDa polypeptides (Fig.1 C, bands 1 and 2), were detected. Although these two forms were not detected in either the ATF-2m/m or ATF-2o/o homozygotes, a novel 66-kDa protein was detected in the ATF-2m/m lysate (Fig. 1 C, band 3). These results indicate that the ATF-2o/o mutant described here is a null mutant, whereas the previously described ATF-2m/mmutant contains a mutant protein. It is likely that the use of much larger amounts of extract permitted the detection of this mutant protein, which we2 had previously failed to detect. We conclude that small amounts of a mutant ATF-2 protein are sufficient to protect at least some ATF-2m/m mice (but not all, because the viability of the ATF-2m/m mice is only 50%) from death shortly after birth by respiratory failure, and the surviving ATF-2m/m mice allowed an assessment of the role of ATF-2 in other organ systems. Interestingly, when ATF-2m/+ and ATF-2o/+ mice were mated, the compound ATF-2m/oheterozygotes displayed the same phenotype (neonatal lethality from respiratory failure) as the ATF-2o/o homozygotes, demonstrating a gene dosage effect of the ATF-2m allele. Thus, a 50% reduction in levels of the ATF-2 mutant protein in the compound heterozygote results in the emergence of neonatal lethality, demonstrating exquisite sensitivity of the phenotype to levels of ATF-2. To understand the mechanism of impaired respiratory function, the lungs prepared from neonates were analyzed. Careful histological analyses of the ATF-2o/o mutant lung sections indicated the presence of meconium in the alveoli, showing that prenatal aspiration of the amniotic fluid containing meconium had probably occurred (Fig.2 B). Consistent with this, the wild type lung floated on PBS, but the mutant lung sank, indicating absence of air in the alveoli of the mutant lung at birth (Fig. 2 C). Pulmonary histology showed normal architecture of the mutant lung including the presence of branching, alveolization, septation, and alveolar volume. We examined the expression level of the four surfactant proteins, which are important for the mechanical stability of the lung (for review, see Ref. 23Floros J. Kala P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 365-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the level of surfactant protein B expression was decreased to half of that of the wild type in the ATF-2o/omutant, the other three surfactant genes were expressed at the same level as that of the wild type (data not shown). It has been observed that hypoxia in embryos may lead to strong gasping respiration with consequent aspiration of the amniotic fluid containing meconium (1Greenough A. Early Hum. Dev. 1995; 41: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Katz V.L. Bowes Jr., W.A. Am. J. Obstet.

Therefore, we examined whether hypoxia occurs in the mutant embryos. RNA was prepared from various tissues of the wild type and ATF-2o/o embryos at 18.5 dpc, and the expression levels of VEGF and tyrosine 3-hydroxylase genes, which are known to be induced by hypoxia (25Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Kesher E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4100) Google Scholar, 26Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Bayliss D.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), were examined by RNase protection (Fig. 3 A). The levels of VEGF mRNA in the mutant brain and liver were 4- and 23-fold, respectively, higher than those of the wild type. In addition, the tyrosine 3-hydroxylase mRNA level in the mutant brain was 26-fold higher than that of the wild type. These results suggest that hypoxia occurs in the mutant embryos. In the case of ATF-2m/m embryos, a similar induction of VEGF and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA was observed only in the limited number of embryos (data not shown). This is consistent with the fact that the limited number of ATF-2m/m mutant mice also died immediately after birth like ATF-20/0. To investigate the mechanism of hypoxia in 18.5-dpc embryo, we histologically analyzed the wild type and mutant embryos. No detectable differences in the histological structures of any of the organs could be detected, including the central nervous system, where ATF-2 is expressed at the highest level (15Takeda J. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Seino Y. Imura H. Saito N. Tanaka C. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar), and the cardiovascular system (data not shown). To examine whether some abnormality in the central nervous system leads to the phenotype of the ATF-2o/omutants, we made transgenic mice expressing ATF-2 from the neurofilament promoter in the central nervous system. However, transgenic ATF-2o/o mice were not rescued from postnatal lethality (data not shown). A histological comparison of E18.5 placentas from wild type mice and homozygous mutants revealed a slight but significant alteration in the labyrinth region of the mutant placentas. The labyrinth region in the normal placenta has numerous fine embryonic vessels surrounded by trophoblast epithelial cells that are bathed in maternal blood. In the labyrinth region of the mutant placenta, the number of cytotrophoblast cells was clearly lower, although the size of the region was almost the same as that of the wild type (Fig. 3 B). The average number of cytotrophoblast cells/mm2 obtained by examining the 18 placentas was 465 ± 52, 483 ± 40, and 216 ± 17 in the wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous placenta, respectively. Furthermore, the network of embryonic vessels and maternal sinuses was poorly developed, and fibrinoid had accumulated around the fetal blood vessels (data not shown). The number of spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone, which produces hormones and growth factors, was approximately the same in the mutant and normal placentas. The expression of ATF-2 in the trophoblast was confirmed by immunostaining using the anti-ATF-2 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3 C), supporting the idea that ATF-2 is required for the normal proliferation of trophoblasts. In most of the ATF-2m/m placentas, a decrease in number of cytotrophoblast cells was not evident, and the faint but significant signal of ATF-2 immunostaining was detected (data not shown). However, the placental defect similar to that of ATF-20/0 was also detected in the limited number of ATF-2m/m placentas (data not shown). This is consistent with the fact that some ATF-2m/m pups died immediately after birth like the ATF-20/0 pups. From approximately E11 onwards, the labyrinth region of the placenta starts to function as a nutrient and oxygen transport unit (27Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). A decrease in the number of cytotrophoblastic cells was not observed at early stages such as E14.5 (Fig. 3 B, right panels). This is consistent with the observation that the sizes of the mutant embryos were almost the same as those of the wild type. The reduced number of cytotrophoblast cells at the late stage may lead to an insufficient oxygen supply, resulting in gasping respiration and aspiration of the amniotic fluid containing meconium. To identify the gene(s) regulated by ATF-2 in cytotrophoblast cells, we employed a cDNA subtraction method. Total RNA was prepared from the placenta of wild type and ATF-2o/o homozygous embryos of 18.5 dpc and used for cDNA subtraction analysis. The expression levels of the genes identified by the cDNA subtraction method were further examined by Northern blotting. Five genes were found to be down-regulated in the mutant, and one of them was the PDGF receptor α gene. PDGF receptor α has been reported to be expressed in a subpopulation of cytotrophoblasts and to be required for their proliferation (28Holmgren L. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Ohlsson R. Growth Factors. 1992; 6: 219-231PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, six genes up-regulated in the ATF-2o/o mutant were identified, and two of them, such as the glucose transporter and cytokeratin genes, are known to be hypoxia inducible (29Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 30Genbacev O. Zhou Y. Ludlow J.W. Fisher S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1669-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Among them, however, there was no obvious candidate that might be expected to block the proliferation of trophoblasts. In addition to cDNA subtraction analysis, we also used the microarray-based expression monitoring. Microarrays containing 18,378 nonredundant mouse cDNA clones chosen from the I.M.A.G.E. collection, which is thought to be 20% in the mouse genome, were hybridized with the cDNA probes prepared using the wild type and ATF-2o/o placenta RNAs. Because the placental tissue prepared from ATF-2o/o homozygous embryos should contain a significant amount of ATF-2o/+ maternal tissue, we speculated that the difference in the expression level of ATF-2 target genes detected by this method is not so high. Therefore, we picked up the genes whose expression level is different more than 2.5-fold between the wild type and ATF-2o/o homozygous mutant. Two hundred fifty-three genes were found to be down-regulated in the mutant, and 78 genes among them encoded the known proteins. One of them was the PDGF receptor α gene, and the difference in the PDGF receptor α expression level between wild type and mutant was 2.7-fold. Although some other genes in this group, including the hepatocyte growth factor activator-like protein and the ect2 oncogene, also appear to be involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, no evidence was reported so far indicating that these genes are involved in the proliferation control of cytotrophoblast cells. On the other hand, 213 genes up-regulated in the ATF-2o/omutant were identified, and 54 genes among them encoded the known proteins. This group contains the hypoxia inducible genes encoding glucose transporter-3, epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, GADD45, and insulin-like growth factor-II. Among them, however, there was no obvious candidate that might be expected to block the proliferation of trophoblasts. Because the PDGF receptor α gene was identified as a candidate of the target gene of ATF-2 by using two different methods, we examined the expression of the PDGF receptor α gene in wild type and mutant placentas using immunostaining and in situ hybridization (Fig. 4 A). The expression level of PDGF receptor α was significantly decreased in the mutant, although some PDGF receptor α expression still remained. This partial decrease in PDGF receptor α expression may explain the mild defects of the placenta in ATF-2o/o homozygotes. Although PDGF receptor α has been reported to be expressed in a subpopulation of cytotrophoblasts (28Holmgren L. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Ohlsson R. Growth Factors. 1992; 6: 219-231PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether PDGF really stimulates the proliferation of cytotrophoblast-derived cells using a human choriocarcinoma cell line, Jar. PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB stimulated BrdUrd incorporation into Jar cells by 40.5 ± 7.5% and 72.0 ± 6% (mean ± S.E.), respectively (Fig. 4 B). Although this degree of stimulation is not high, it is significant compared with the published data (31Battegay E.J. Rupp J. Iruela-Arispe L. Sage E.H. Pech M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To further examine whether the promoter activity of the PDGF receptor α gene is directly regulated by ATF-2, we performed co-transfection experiments. A luciferase reporter plasmid, in which the human PDGF receptor α promoter was linked to the luciferase gene, (21Afink G.B. Nistér M. Stassen B.H.G.J. Joosten P.H.L.J. Rademakers P.J.H. Bongcam-Rudloff E. Van Zoelen E.J.J. Mosselman S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1667-1672PubMed Google Scholar) was co-transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells along with the ATF-2 expression plasmid (Fig. 4 C). ATF-2 increased luciferase gene expression about 2.7-fold. In contrast, the ATF-2 mutant (ΔBR), in which the basic region of the b-zip DNA-binding domain was deleted, did not enhance the activity of the PDGF receptor α promoter. Another mutant (C32S), in which the metal finger structure in the NH2-terminal activation domain was disrupted by changing the cysteine residue at amino acid 32 into serine, also did not stimulate the luciferase expression. The modest activation of the PDGF receptor α promoter by wild type ATF-2 is consistent with the partial decrease in PDGF receptor α expression in the ATF-2o/o homozygotes. Consistent with the phenotype of ATF-2m/m embryos, the ATF-2 protein lacking the region between amino acids 271 and 338 (Δ 271/338), which is similar to the ATF-2 protein expressed in ATF-2m/m mutant, retained the capacity to enhance the PDGF receptor α promoter activity. These results indicate that ATF-2 activates the PDGF receptor α promoter. Although the PDGF receptor α promoter region contains the sequence suitable for binding to ATF-2, we cannot exclude the possibility that ATF-2 indirectly activates this promoter. All of the ATF-2 null mutants examined displayed symptoms of severe respiratory distress with the lungs filled with meconium and had the reduced number of cytotrophoblast cells in the placenta. Although both PDGF receptor α and ATF-2 are expressed in various tissues other than placenta, only the placental defect was evident during embryogenesis. CRE-BPa and ATF-a, which have a striking homology with ATF-2 and form a subgroup in the ATF/CREB gene family (8Gaire M. Chatton B. Kedinger C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3467-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Nomura N. Zu Y.-L. Maekawa T. Tabata S. Akiyama T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4259-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may compensate for the lack of ATF-2 in other tissues. Aspiration of the amniotic fluid containing meconium is observed in MAS, which is a common neonatal problem that results in acute and chronic respiratory morbidity (1Greenough A. Early Hum. Dev. 1995; 41: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Katz V.L. Bowes Jr., W.A. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1992; 166: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although human MAS has been speculated to be caused by multiple mechanisms, no direct evidence exists to show that a deficiency in any one gene leads to MAS. MAS exhibits a varying severity, but mortality occurs rarely in the human infant and not usually within minutes of birth. In this sense, the phenotype of ATF-2 null mutant is apparently different from a typical type of MAS. However, it should be noted that the human infants can be treated by appropriate suctioning at birth or by early administration of surfactant, whereas the ATF-2 mutant mice could not be treated because of a lack of appropriate systems. In addition, a severe form of human MAS, which cannot be prevented by these treatments, shows features similar to those of ATF-2 null mutants. Interestingly, the placentas of some severe MAS infants showed significant abnormalities (3Thureen P.J. Hall D.M. Hoffenberg A. Tyson R.W. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 176: 967-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least some type of MAS may be a prenatal rather than a postnatal disease. In addition to the presence of fluid, the level of surfactant protein B in the ATF-2 mutant lungs was decreased to half of the level of the wild type. The decrease in the surfactant protein level is associated with respiration distress syndrome (23Floros J. Kala P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 365-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the ATF-2 null mutants appear to assume the aspects of multiple syndromes of respiration failure. The ATF-2 null mutants described here will be useful to understand the mechanism of severe neonatal respiration distress and should lead, eventually, to the development of new diagnostic tools and therapies for this type of disease.

https://openalex.org/W2086741479,"Adaptors appear to control clathrin-coat assembly by determining the site of lattice polymerization but the nucleating events that target soluble adaptors to an appropriate membrane are poorly understood. Using an in vitro model system that allows AP-2-containing clathrin coats to assemble on lysosomes, we show that adaptor recruitment and coat initiation requires phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) synthesis. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is generated on lysosomes by the sequential action of a lysosome-associated type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and a soluble type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase. Phosphatidic acid, which potently stimulates type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase activity, is generated on the bilayer by a phospholipase D1-like enzyme located on the lysosomal surface. Quenching phosphatidic acid function with primary alcohols prevents the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and blocks coat assembly. Generating phosphatidic acid directly on lysosomes with exogenous bacterial phospholipase D in the absence of ATP still drives adaptor recruitment and limited coat assembly, indicating that PtdIns(4,5)P2functions, at least in part, to activate the PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent phospholipase D1. These results provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of anionic phospholipids in clathrin-coat assembly on membranes and define the enzymes responsible for the production of these important lipid mediators.

An area of membrane that will give rise to a clathrin-coated bud is demarcated by the placement of adaptors at that site. This necessitates that adaptor recruitment onto membranes be controlled with good precision. The first glimpse of the real complexity of the adaptor recruitment process came from studies using the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (1Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 2Wong D.H. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the site where this heterotetrameric adaptor complex is usually massed to initiate the formation of clathrin-coated buds (3Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell U. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The effect of brefeldin A led to the demonstration that the binding of AP-1 to the TGN is regulated by ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) in a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis (4Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We proposed a model in which an AP-1-specific, ARF-activated docking site initiates clathrin-coat assembly at the TGN (5Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Bound to an ARF·GTP-activated docking site, AP-1 would begin to recruit clathrin (6Shih W. Galluser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31083-31090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4933-4942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Sustained recruitment of both AP-1 and clathrin would result in the formation of an extensive polyhedral lattice. The association between AP-1 and the presumptive docking molecule is terminated on hydrolysis of ARF-GTP to GDP (8Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We envisioned that the laterally expanding lattice would be tethered to the underlying membrane by AP-1-docking protein associations, primarily occurring at the perimeter of the growing coat. The density of AP-1 within the developing bud would be sufficiently high so that even low-affinity interactions between protein-sorting signals and the μ1 subunit of the adaptor heterotetramer (9Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 10Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) would result in preferential retention of select transmembrane proteins within the structure. If a sorting signal on a protein to be included within the clathrin coat disengaged from one μ1 subunit, it would immediately encounter another AP-1 molecule so the mobility of sorted proteins would be severely restricted over the period in which the bud grows. Brefeldin A subverts coat assembly at the TGN by interfering with earliest known step of the process, catalyzed nucleotide exchange (11Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 12Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), blocking ARF·GTP delivery onto the membrane and all downstream events. Unlike the clathrin-coated structures on the TGN, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is not perturbed by brefeldin A (1Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 2Wong D.H. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This clearly establishes that the recruitment of AP-1 and AP-2 adaptors is regulated differently but, currently, very little is known about the nucleating events that precede AP-2 translocation onto membranes (9Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 13Pishvaee B. Payne G.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Overexpression of several plasma-membrane receptors normally internalized in clathrin-coated vesicles does not alter the steady-state distribution of AP-2 (14Santini F. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1177-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), arguing that unregulated association between protein-sorting signals and AP-2 adaptors is unlikely to begin the clathrin-coat assembly process. Synaptotagmin, a calcium- and phospholipid-binding protein first identified in synaptic vesicles, has been suggested to be a high-affinity AP-2-docking molecule (17Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The mild phenotype of synaptotagmin I-null animals argues against this idea, but there are at least 7 other synaptotagmin isoforms, each able to bind AP-2 (18Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). If synaptotagmin is an AP-2-docking protein, the association with AP-2 must be tightly regulated because synaptotagmin I is predominantly a synaptic vesicle protein and synaptic vesicles are not clathrin coated until they are rapidly retrieved following their fusion with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Stage-specific assays for endocytosis show that early, but as yet uncharacterized events in clathrin-coat assembly at the cell surface require ATP hydrolysis (19Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 896Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Polymerization of AP-2 and clathrin into coats on lysed synaptosomes also requires ATP (20Takei K. Mundigl O. Daniell L. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that AP-2-containing clathrin coats can also assemble and invaginate on lysosomes in a strictly ATP-dependent fashion (21Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional EM images reveal that the polyhedral lattice formed on the lysosome surface is identical to clathrin coats formed at the cell surface. Using this model system, we have now carefully dissected the role of ATP in initiating clathrin-coat assembly. Our results show that phosphoinositides, in particular phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), are critical regulators of AP-2 adaptor binding. Direct evidence for a positive feedback loop between type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) and phospholipase D (PLD) is presented. Both of the lipids generated by this regulatory loop, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), appear to play important roles in initiating clathrin-coat assembly on lysosomes.

Rat brain cytosol and rat liver Golgi membranes and lysosomes were prepared as described previously (5Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J.

Lysosomes were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose with 25 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A (protease inhibitors). A plasmid bearing the SH3 domain of amphiphysin I fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was provided by H. McMahon (29Wigge P. Vallis Y. Mcmahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Bovine ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), with amino acids 3–7 replaced with the corresponding residues from yeast ARF2, was from S. Kornfeld (8Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by standard procedures. For depletion of dynamin, 1-ml aliquots of cytosol (10 mg/ml) were mixed with 150 μg of either GST or GST-amphSH3 overnight at 4 °C. GSH-Sepharose was then added to collect the protein complexes and then removed by brief centrifugation. The supernatants were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C while the pellets were washed 4 times in phosphate-buffered saline before solubilization in SDS sample buffer. Immunodepletion of AP-2 from cytosol with AP.6-Sepharose was exactly as described (5Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For the separation of type I and type II PIP5Ks (25Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R.

Nature. 1995; 347: 173-177Crossref Scopus (451) Google Scholar), 25 ml of rat brain cytosol was dialyzed into 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A) and then loaded at 1.5 ml/min onto a phosphocellulose column (1.6 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. After washing with 200 ml of buffer A, bound protein was eluted with a 250-ml linear gradient of 0.25–1.25 m NaCl in buffer A, collecting 4-ml fractions. Fractions were analyzed on immunoblots after concentration by methanol/chloroform precipitation or assayed for PIP5K activity after dialysis into buffer A lacking sodium chloride. For some experiments, the PIP5KI and PIP5KII pools were concentrated with a Centricon 10. When assayed for PtdInsP production with lysosomes, the PIP5KI and PIP5KII pools were exchanged into 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol over NAP-5 columns. Recruitment onto lysosomes was performed as outlined previously (21Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were performed in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol in a volume of 400 μl. All assays contained 25 μg/ml of each of the protease inhibitors indicated above. Lysosomes were added to final concentrations of 30–50 μg/ml and cytosol to 2–2.5 mg/ml as indicated in the legends. ATP, an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatine kinase), apyrase, A-3, neomycin, various alcohols, and PLD were added and mixed on ice. After 20 min at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by chilling in an ice-water bath. Variations are noted in the figure legends. After centrifugation, membrane-containing pellets and aliquots of the supernatants were prepared for immunoblotting. Details of the conditions used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting have been published elsewhere (5Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 21Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For thin-section EM analysis, glutaraldehyde was added to the chilled reactions to give a final concentration of 2% and, after 15 min on ice, the membranes were collected by centrifugation and processed as detailed elsewhere (21Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The immunofluorescence-based morphological binding assay, using digitonin-permeabilized NRK cells, was carried out on glass coverslips exactly as described (21Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and then processed for indirect fluorescence microscopy. Synthesis of phosphoinositides on lysosomal membranes was assayed in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 50 μl. Membranes were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and cytosol, when present, to 5 mg/ml. Incubations were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (0.5–1 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 500 μm. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by addition of 3 ml of chloroform:methanol:concentrated HCl (200:100:0.75), followed by vigorous mixing. Carrier phosphoinositides (50 μg/tube) were added and then a biphasic mixture generated by addition of 0.6 ml of 0.6 m HCl. After centrifugation at 200 × g ave for 5 min, the lower organic phase was removed, transferred to a new tube, washed twice with 1.5 ml of chloroform, methanol, 0.6 m HCl (3:48:47) and then dried under a stream of N2 gas at about 40 °C. Dried lipid films were resuspended in chloroform:methanol:H2O (75:25:1) and spotted onto TLC plates. Formation of PtdIns(4,5)P2from either commercial PtdIns(4)P or synthetic PtdIns(5)P was assayed in a final volume of 50 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 80 μm PtdInsP, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5 Ci/mmol), and a source of enzyme. PtdInsP micelles were prepared by resuspending the dried lipid at 5 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, and stored at −80 °C in small aliquots. Reaction mixtures were equilibrated to ∼25 °C for 5 min before starting the assays with the addition of ATP. After 6 min at ∼25 °C, 3 ml of chloroform:methanol:concentrated HCl (200:100:0.75) was added and the lipids extracted as described above except that no carrier lipid was added and the lower organic phase was only washed once. PLD activity was assayed in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm potassium chloride, 4.5 mm magnesium chloride, 3 mm calcium chloride, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, and 0.5% 1-butanol in a final volume of 60 μl (32Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Organelles were added to a final concentration of 160 μg/ml and activators were added as follows: a final concentration of 0.85 μm ARF1 together with 100 μm GTPγS, and 0.1 μm PKCα with 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Exogenous substrate (mixed micelles of phosphatidyethanolamine, [14C]PtdCho (52 mCi/mmol), PtdIns(4,5)P2 at a molar ratio of 6.7:1.15:1) was added to a final lipid concentration of 132 μm, prepared as described (32Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additions were made on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Assays were stopped by addition of 1 ml of chloroform:methanol:concentrated HCl (50:50:0.3) and 0.35 ml of 1m HCl, 5 mm EDTA, followed by vigorous mixing. After centrifugation at 370 × g max for 5 min, 0.4 ml of the lower organic phase was removed and dried under a stream of N2 gas. Dried lipid films were resuspended in chloroform:methanol:concentrated HCl (50:50:0.3) and spotted onto TLC plates. Phosphoinositides were resolved on silica gel HPTLC plates that had been previously immersed in 1% potassium oxalate, 2 mm EDTA in 50% ethanol. Lipids were spotted onto the plates after activation at 105 °C for several hours. The developing solvent consisted of chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (160:60:52:48:28). PtdOH and phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut) were resolved from PtdCho on heat-activated Silica Gel LK6 plates in a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (13:5:1). After chromatography, lipid standards were visualized with iodine vapor and marked. Radiolabeled lipids were visualized by autoradiography. Plates containing 14C-labeled lipids were sprayed with Enhance before exposure to film. Signals were quantitated by scintillation counting after scraping the relevant portions of the plate into vials. For the anion-exchange HPLC analysis, the relevant lipid spots were scraped off the plates and deacylated directly on the silica with methylamine reagent after addition of authentic [3H]PtdIns(4)P or [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 (NEN Life Science Products). The water-soluble products were applied to a Partisil 10 SAX column and eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.8, as described elsewhere (27Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17756-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The recruitment of AP-2 onto purified lysosomes and subsequent clathrin lattice assembly is absolutely dependent on hydrolyzable ATP (21Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This makes it unlikely that coat assembly is initiated simply by the direct association of AP-2 adaptors with sorting signals located on the cytosolic domain of lysosomal glycoproteins or plasma-membrane proteins which have made their way to the limiting membrane of the lysosome. When added to gel-filtered cytosol, ATP supports coat assembly with an EC50 of approximately 100 μm (Fig.1 A), suggesting that a phosphorylation event might be involved rather than constant ATP hydrolysis to actively drive coat assembly. Indeed, a broad specificity kinase inhibitor, the naphthalenesulfonamide A-3 (33Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Itoh H. Saitoh M. Hagiwara M. Takahashi J. Hidaka H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 577-581PubMed Google Scholar), blocks clathrin assembly on lysosomes (Fig. 1 B). Compared with the recruitment of AP-2 and clathrin seen when purified lysosomes are incubated at 37 °C with brain cytosol and 500 μm ATP (lane e), addition of equimolar (lane i) or higher (lane k) concentrations of A-3 fully inhibits the translocation of the α and μ2 subunits of the AP-2 complex and clathrin onto lysosomes. The amount of these proteins recovered in the pellets (lanes iand k) is equivalent to that found in the pellets from incubations lacking lysosomes (lanes h and j). Coat recruitment is little changed by addition of 250 μmA-3 (lane g), a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. Three lines of evidence suggest that inositide phosphorylation might be important for the initiation of clathrin-coat assembly on lysosomes. First, poorly hydrolyzable analogues of ATP, AMP-PNF, and ATPγS, do not support coat assembly (21Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and neither derivative serves as a phosphate donor for phosphoinositide synthesis (34Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Second, neomycin, a polyamine antibiotic that binds to PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 with high affinity (35Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been widely used to intercede in phosphoinositide-regulated processes, inhibits clathrin-coat assembly on purified lysosomes in a dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition is apparent at 100 μm and, in the presence of 300 μm neomycin, the recruitment of both the AP-2 complex and clathrin is completely blocked, indicating that the compound inhibits an early stage of the assembly reaction (data not shown). A similar observation has been made in a study of AP-2 recruitment onto endosomes (36West M.A. Bright N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Third, A-3-mediated inhibition of AP-2 and clathrin recruitment (Fig. 1 B) occurs together with a complete block of PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis (Fig. 1 C). Lysosomes exhibit intrinsic PI4K activity (37Collins C.A. Wells W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2130-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and mixing purified lysosomes with ATP allows this enzyme to phosphorylate endogenous PtdIns, generating PtdIns(4)P in a temperature-sensitive reaction (Fig.1 C, lane b compared with lane a). Anion-exchange HPLC analysis of the deacylated product of this lipid shows exact co-elution with an internal [3H]glycerophosphorylinositol (GroPIns) 4-phosphate standard (data not shown), verifying this lipid as PtdIns(4)P. Addition of brain cytosol to an incubation containing lysosomes and ATP results in the synthesis of PtdIns(4)P and a second phospholipid, which comigrates with an authentic PtdIns(4,5)P2 standard (Fig.1 C, lane d). The deacylated product of this lipid elutes coincidentally with a [3H]GroPIns(4,5)P2standard (data not shown). Including 1 mm A-3, which completely abrogates AP-2 and clathrin recruitment onto the lysosome surface (Fig. 1 B), totally inhibits the activity of the soluble PIP5K (Fig. 1 C, lane f) without affecting the PI4K activity. These experiments show that mixing lysosomes with cytosol and ATP allows for a robust synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on the lysosome surface and suggest that this lipid might be important for the initiation of clathrin coat formation on lysosomes. The pleckstrin homology domain is a modular protein fold that appears to regulate the trans"

Members of the Rho family GTPases, which include RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, act as molecular switches that control the organization of actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular signals (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). Experiments using cultured cells showed that each member of the Rho family has a different influence on the cytoskeletal structure and eventually on cellular morphology. RhoA induces stress fibers associated with focal adhesions, Rac1 produces lamellipodia or membrane ruffling, and Cdc42 evokes filopodia on the plasma membrane of fibroblasts (2Ridley A.J.

Evidence has accumulated that the Rho family proteins have a variety of roles in distinct types of cells and tissues. For instance, they are involved in extension and collapse of neurites (6Luo L. Liao Y.J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 7Gallo G. Letourneau P.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 80-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chemotaxis of macrophages when stimulated by colony-stimulating factor-1 (8Allen W.E. Jones G.E. Pollard J.W. Ridley A.J.

Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the activities of Rho family proteins are spatially and temporally regulated to express their functions in vivo. There are three kinds of proteins that regulate the activities of Rho family proteins by controlling the ratio of the GTP-bound active form to the GDP-bound inactive form. GEFs 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription; kb, kilobase pair(s); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; En , embryonic day n . 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription; kb, kilobase pair(s); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; En , embryonic day n . activate the G proteins by converting the GDP-bound inactive state to the GTP-bound active state, whereas GTPase-activating proteins and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors inactivate Rho family proteins (10Aelst L.V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Recently, more than 20 putative GEFs for Rho family GTPases have been identified and are characterized by the presence of the conserved amino acid sequence, Dbl homology (DH) domain, which catalyzes the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction. These proteins have been shown to regulate various cellular events including morphological changes of cells, oncogenesis, or activation of transcription factors (11Whitehead A.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses also revealed that GEFs play important roles in development; DRhoGEF2 mediates cell shape changes in gastrulation ofDrosophila embryos (12Barrett K. Leptin M. Settleman J. Cell. 1997; 91: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and UNC-73A is required for cell and growth cone migrations in Caenorhabtidis elegans (13Steven R. Kubiseski T.J. Zheng H. Kulkarni S. Mancillas J. Morales A.R. Hogue C.W. Pawson T. Culotti J. Cell. 1998; 92: 785-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although the Rho family GTPases appear to be widely distributed in a variety of tissues, several GEFs are preferentially expressed in a limited number of tissues at certain developmental stages. Therefore, it is hypothesized that each of the GEFs has a distinct role in the regulation of various cellular events by activating the GTPases during development. One of the GEFs whose tissue and subcellular localization has been clearly shown is SIF protein, which is encoded by the still life (sif) gene of Drosophila, identified by our behavioral mutant screen (14Sone M. Hoshino M. Suzuki E. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nakagoshi H. Saigo K. Nabeshima Y.-I. Hama C. Science. 1997; 275: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SIF protein is predominantly expressed in the nervous system and confined to the synaptic terminals. At the ultrastructural level, it is found in lateral regions of the active zones for neurotransmission. A loss-of-function sifmutation causes reduced motor activities, which can be rescued by expression of a sif minigene in the nervous system. Moreover, expression of a truncated SIF protein induced membrane ruffling with altered actin localization in human KB cells. These data suggested that SIF protein regulates the formation or maintenance of synapses, possibly by organizing the actin cytoskeleton through the activation of Rho family GTPases. SIF protein contains a DH domain, two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (15Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and a PDZ domain (16Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Craven S.E. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The organization and amino acid sequences of these domains are highly related to those of mouse Tiam1. The Tiam1 gene was originally identified by its ability to induce invasion of T-lymphoma cells (18Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Tiam1 protein functions as a GEF that specifically reacts to Rac1 and Cdc42 in vitro and induces membrane ruffling in NIH 3T3 cells by activating Rac1 (19Michiels F. Habets G.G.

Tiam1 affects the morphology of neuroblastoma cells, including neurite outgrowth (20Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O.W. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion of epithelial cells (21Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The transcripts are mainly expressed in the brain and testis, and the developmental distribution patterns in the brain suggest that Tiam1 contributes to cytoskeletal reorganization required during cell migration and neurite extension in a specified population of neurons (22Ehler E. van Leeuwen F. Collard J.G. Salinas P.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of Rho family GTPases, particularly Rac1, and the biological phenomena that the related signaling cascade may regulate, we have made efforts to identify a new GEF. Here we report a novel mouse protein, STEF (SIF and Tiam1-like exchangefactor), which was isolated on the basis of sequence similarity to both SIF and Tiam1. Our biochemical and cell biological analyses showed that STEF protein functions as a GEF specific for Rac1in vitro and in vivo. These data together with the similar domain organization of STEF and Tiam1 suggest that these two proteins execute their functions in similar molecular environments to activate Rac1 cascades in cells. However, in situhybridization revealed that the stef transcript is preferentially localized in narrower regions when compared with the distribution pattern of the Tiam1 transcript, suggesting a distinct or more limited role of STEF in mouse development. To isolate a murine gene homologous to the Drosophila sif gene, we designed degenerated oligonucleotide PCR primers corresponding to the conserved amino acid residues between SIF and Tiam-1. The first set of primers (PF1, PR1, and PR3) was designed in the PHn-TSS domain. The second set (DF1, DR1, and DR2) was designed in the DH domain. The primer sequences are as follows: PF1, 5′-GG(A/C/G/T)(A/G)C(A/C/G/T)GT(A/C/G/T)(A/C)G(A/C/G/T)AA(A/G)AC-3′ (amino acids G(A/T)VRKA); PR1, 5′-GC(A/C/G/T)GC(A/G)CA(A/C/G/T)GC(A/C/G/T)(C/G)(A/T)(A/G)TG(A/T/G)AT-3′ (complementary to amino acids IHSACAA); PR3, 5′-CCA(A/G)TT(C/T)TC(A/C/G/T)A(A/G)(C/T)TC(A/C/G/T)(A/G)(C/T)(C/T)TG-3′ (complementary to amino acids Q(V/T)ELENW); DF1, 5′-AC(A/C/G/T)GA(A/G)(A/C)G(A/C/G/T)AC(A/C/G/T)TA(C/T)GT(A/C/G/T)AA-3′ (amino acids TERTYVK); DR1, 5′-(C/T)(G/T)(C/T)TGCAT(C/T)TC(A/G)TT(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TG-3′ (complementary to amino acids HINEMQ(R/K)); and DR2, 5′-TC(C/T)TC(A/G)TG(A/T/G)AT(A/C/G/T)(C/T)(G/T)(C/T)TGCAT-3′ (complementary to amino acids MQ(R/K)IHEE). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the brains of ICR mice with the QuickPrep mRNA Purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 4 μg of RNA was used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using the First-strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the entire product was subsequently used as a template for one PCR reaction. PCR was performed in the 100-μl scale with the primer set PF1 and PR1 or the primer set DF1 and DR2, employing the following protocol: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. Then 1 μl of each of the products was used as a template for a second PCR reaction with the nested primer set PF1 and PR3 or nested primer set DF1 and DR1. The DNA fragments of predicted sizes were recovered from agarose gels, cloned into pBluescriptII SK− (Stratagene), and sequenced. The PHn-TSS domain primer pair yielded mr5-23, and the DH domain primer pair produced mr1-5. To test whether these fragments were derived from the same gene, RT-PCR was again executed using the LA-PCR kit version 2 (Takara) with a primer pair to amplify a fragment spanning the two fragments. The primers used were: mrF1, 5′-GGAAAGAATTCCACAGAGCAGAATAGTGCC-3′, and mrR3, 5′-AGCTTAAAGTGATCCGCATAGTAGAGGAAAG-3′. The PCR protocol was as follows: 40 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 10 min, and finally 72 °C for 10 min. A 2.0-kb DNA fragment was successfully amplified. Bacterially expressed GST-Dbl, GST-RhoA, GST-Rac1, and GST-Cdc42 fusion proteins were purified as described previously (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar,24Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Nonaka H. Sakoda T. Kawamura M. Mizuno T. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 289-293PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.2-kb fragment encoding the DH-PHc domain of STEF (amino acids 1096–1502) was obtained by PCR amplification from the STEF cDNA clones, digested with SmaI and XhoI, and inserted into the SmaI and XhoI sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to construct pGEX-STEF. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pGEX-STEF was cultured at 37 °C and treated for 4 h at 25 °C with 0.1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to induce expression of GST-STEF. The fusion protein was purified through a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Effects of STEF on the dissociation of [3H]GDP from and the binding of [35S]GTPγS to the Rho family proteins were assayed as described previously (24Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Nonaka H. Sakoda T.

Regarding the dissociation assay, in short, the [3H]GDP-bound form of small G proteins were obtained by incubating 20 pmol of each small G protein with 1 μm [3H]GDP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol) for 20 min at 30 °C in the reaction mixture I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm EDTA). To prevent the dissociation of [3H]GDP from the G proteins, 0.375m MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the mixtures were immediately cooled on ice. The dissociation of [3H]GDP was performed at 25 °C by adding a 200-fold excess of unlabeled GTP and the indicated amounts of GST-Dbl or GST-STEF to the reaction mixture II (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2.9 mm EDTA). As to the association assay, the GDP-bound form of GST-Rac1 was obtained by incubating 10 pmol of GST-Rac1 with 2 μm unlabeled GDP for 20 min at 30 °C in the reaction mixture I and by successive addition of 0.375m MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mm. The association of [35S]GTPγS to the GDP-bound form of GST-Rac1 was carried out at 25 °C by adding 10 μm [35S]GTPγS (2000 cpm/pmol) and indicated amounts of GST-Dbl or GST-STEF to the reaction mixture II. In both dissociation and association assays, the reaction was stopped at the indicated time by adding 2 ml of an ice-cold solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl). The diluted mixtures were filtrated through nitrocellulose filters, and then the filters were washed a few times with the same solution. The radioactivity trapped on the filters was counted. Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein. Wax sections were obtained from Novagen (Hybrid-Ready Tissues). After treatment with xylene and rehydration through an ethanol series and PBS, and the specimens were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then washed with PBS for 2 min. The sections were treated with 7.5 μg/ml proteinase K in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h, washed with PBS for 2 min, refixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, again washed with PBS for 2 min, and placed in 0.2 m HCl for 10 min. After washing with PBS for 1 min, the specimens were acetylated by incubation in 0.1 m triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 min and further in 0.1 m triethanolamine-HCl, 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min. After washing with PBS for 2 min, the samples were dehydrated through a series of ethanols. Hybridization was performed with probes at concentrations of 200–500 ng/ml in a hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml tRNA, and 50 μg/ml heparin) at 55 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, the specimens were washed in 5× SSC at 55 °C for 15 min and then in 50% formamide, 2× SSC at 55 °C for 15 min, followed by RNase treatment in 50 μg/ml RNase A in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mNaCl and 1 mm EDTA. Then the sections were washed twice with 2× SSC at 50 °C for 15 min, twice with 0.2× SSC at 50 °C for 15 min, and once with TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) for 5 min. After treatment with 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in TBST for 1 h, the samples were incubated with anti-DIG AP conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:2000 with TBST for 1 h. The sections were washed twice with TBST containing 2 mm levamisole and then incubated in 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and 2 mm levamisole. Coloring reactions were performed with BM purple substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight and then washed with PBS. The samples were dehydrated and mounted with HSR (Kokusai-Shiyaku). The plasmid DNA, pFCMVstefΔN, was constructed by inserting DNA fragments encoding portions of STEF (amino acids 411–1715) into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Kodak). pFCMVsifΔN, pEF-BOS-HA-Rac1val12, and pEF-BOS-HA-Cdc42val12 were prepared as described (14Sone M.

The expression plasmids were transfected into the KB cells (3 × 106/well dish) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. pGFP (CLONTECH) was cotransfected only when pFCMVsifΔN was used for transfection. After the cells were cultured in the growth medium for 24 h, they were incubated in the serum-starved medium for 24 h, fixed, and doubly stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin and with either anti-Flag antibody or anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) (29Kobayashi K.

To isolate a mouse gene homologous to the Drosophila sif gene, we performed a RT-PCR experiment using mRNA extracted from the mouse adult brain because the siftranscript in Drosophila is abundant in the adult brain. 2M. Sone and C. Hama, unpublished data. Two sets of degenerated oligonucleotide PCR primers were designed from conserved amino acid sequences found in SIF and Tiam1 to amplify two corresponding DNA fragments expected to contain the first PH (PHn) domain or the DH domain (Fig.1 B). The first primer set produced an unidentified DNA sequence that encodes a PH domain with high similarity to the PHn domains of SIF and Tiam-1 proteins. Using the second primer set, we obtained another new DNA sequence that encodes a DH domain, which is highly related to the DH domains of SIF and Tiam-1. To test whether these two DNA fragments were derived from one novel gene, we again performed the RT-PCR experiment with a new set of primers, one in the sequence of PHn domain and the other in DH domain. A 2.0-kb DNA fragment was successfully amplified, and the sequencing analysis revealed that this fragment contained nucleotide sequences encoding a PDZ domain as well as the PH and DH domains described above. The overall amino acid sequences and the organization of the domains were highly conserved among the novel protein, SIF and Tiam1. These data suggested that the DNA fragment amplified in our procedure was derived from a novel gene that may be a mouse homologue of the Drosophila sif gene. Screening a cDNA library prepared from the mouse newborn brain RNA using the 2.0-kb DNA fragment as a probe identified several cDNA clones. We further obtained the corresponding cDNA fragments expected to extend to the 5′ or 3′ ends of the full-length transcript by 5′ or 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Sequencing several overlapping cDNAs revealed the structure of the stef transcript, a stretch of 6157-base pair sequence that contains the 5′-untranslated region, a long open reading frame, the 3′-untranslated region, and poly(A)+.Figure 1Amino acid sequence and domain structure of STEF protein.

Amino acid residues conserved among two or more proteins are highlighted by a black background.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sequence of the 6157-base pair cDNA contains a long open reading frame that predicts a protein of 1715 amino acids (Fig.1 A). As found in Tiam1 and SIF proteins, this protein has a potential myristoylation site at the N terminus, two PH domains, one PDZ domain, and one DH domain (Fig. 1 B). Because these motifs are present in many intracellular signaling molecules and STEF protein does not contain a signal sequence or a transmembrane region, STEF is likely to be a cytoplasmic protein. Several regions of STEF protein are highly related in amino acid sequence to Tiam1 and SIF proteins (Fig. 1, B–E); the PHn domain together with its C-terminally flanking region is 66.9% identical to Tiam1 and 52.5% identical to SIF, and the DH domain with the following second PH domain (PHc) is 63.6% identical to Tiam1 and 47.8% to SIF. However, the PDZ domain of STEF is moderately conserved, being 27.6% identical to Tiam1 and 30.0% identical to SIF. We hereafter refer to the conserved region flanking the PHn domain as the TSS domain (Tiam1-STEF-SIF homologous domain). Several DH domain-containing proteins including Tiam1 have been shown to be GEFs that specifically function for the Rho family proteinsin vitro (11Whitehead A.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether STEF has any influence on the dissociation of GDP from and the association of GTP to Rho family proteins. Because the truncated GEFs comprising only the DH domain and the adjacent PH domain have been shown to sufficiently exhibit the GDP/GTP exchange activity for the specific Rho family proteins (30Chuang T.H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we employed a recombinant GST fusion protein carrying the DH-PHc domain of STEF to assay its exchange activity. In addition, the GST-Dbl protein was used as a positive control, which is known to exhibit GEF activity for all RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (25Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because it has been reported that Tiam1 is a GEF for Rac1 (19Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), we first analyzed whether GST-STEF enhanced the dissociation of GDP from Rac1. The results obtained in this assay indicated that GST-STEF as well as GST-Dbl stimulated the dissociation of [3H]GDP from Rac1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). To confirm these findings, we investigated the influence of STEF on the exchange of preloaded GDP for [35S]GTPγS on Rac1. GST-STEF and GST-Dbl enhanced the incorporation of [35S]GTPγS to Rac1 (Fig. 2 B). We then examined the kinetic properties of GST-STEF and GST-Dbl for Rac1. Both stimulated the dissociation of [3H]GDP from Rac1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). However, measurement of the kinetic parameters (e.g. k cat and K m) of GST-STEF was unsuccessful because the reaction was not saturated under our experimental conditions (data not shown). We subsequently performed the dissociation assay for RhoA and Cdc42 under the same conditions. GST-STEF did not show the dissociation activity for RhoA or Cdc42, while GST-Dbl clearly increased the release of [3H]GDP from RhoA and Cdc42 (Fig. 2 C). Consistently, GST-STEF did not prompt the exchange of preloaded GDP for [35S]GTPγS on RhoA or Cdc42 (data not shown). From the data obtained in these experiments, we conclude that STEF is a GDP/GTP exchange factor that specifically reacts to Rac1. We next examined whether STEF also activates Rac1 in cultured cells. When KB cells were transfected with the cDNA of constitutively activated Rac1 (V12Rac1), the cells exhibited membrane ruffling accompanied by the accumulation of actin filaments along the altered plasma membrane as previously reported (Fig.3, g–i) (2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar), whereas constitutively activated Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) induced filopodia (Fig. 3,j–l). Because many DH domain-containing proteins express their oncogenic or invasive activities when their N-terminal portions are truncated (18Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A.

SIFΔN, as previously reported (14Sone M. Hoshino M. Suzuki E. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nakagoshi H. Saigo K. Nabeshima Y.-I. Hama C. Science. 1997; 275: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was found to induce membrane ruffling in KB cells (Fig. 3, d–f). When STEFΔN was introduced into KB cells (Fig. 3, a–c) and NIH3T3 cells (data not shown), membrane ruffles were also evoked, where STEFΔN colocalized with F-actin along the periphery. However, STEFΔN induced neither filopodia nor stress fibers in KB cells or NIH3T3 cells. These data implied that STEF activated Rac1 but not Cdc42 or RhoA in vivo, which was consistent with the results of the GEF assayin vitro. To determine when the stef gene is expressed during embryogenesis, we performed a Northern blot analysis for the RNA samples prepared from embryos at various stages (Fig.4 A). A weak signal of thestef RNA was detected at 6.3 kb in the E7 embryo, and the signal intensity increased as development proceeded up to E17 during embryogenesis.

Ectopic expression of wild type PTPH1 dramatically inhibited cell growth, whereas a catalytically impaired mutant showed no effect. To identify the direct target of PTPH1 in the cell, we generated a substrate-trapping mutant, in which an invariant aspartate residue was changed to alanine (D811A in PTPH1). The PTPH1-D811A mutant trapped primarily a 97-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, which was determined to be VCP (also named p97 or yeast CDC48), from various cell lysates in vitro. However, when expressed in mammalian cells, the D811A mutant was observed to contain high levels of phosphotyrosine and did not trap substrates. Mutation of tyrosine 676 to phenylalanine (Y676F) in the PTPH1-D811A mutant led to a marked reduction in phosphotyrosine content. Furthermore, this double mutant specifically trapped VCPin vivo and recognized the C-terminal tyrosines of VCP, whose phosphorylation is important for cell cycle progression in yeast. Like wild type PTPH1, this double mutant also inhibited cell proliferation. Moreover, induction of wild type PTPH1 resulted in specific dephosphorylation of VCP without changing the overall phosphotyrosine profile of the cells. VCP has been implicated in control of a variety of membrane functions, including membrane fusions, and is a regulator of the cell cycle. Our results suggest that PTPH1 may exert its effects on cell growth through dephosphorylation of VCP, thus implicating tyrosine phosphorylation as an important regulator of VCP function.

The diversity and complexity of PTPs are beginning to rival that of protein-tyrosine kinases and it is now clear that PTPs are equally important in delivering both positive and negative signals for proper function of cellular machinery. Approximately 80 PTPs have been identified, with ∼300 members estimated from genome sequencing efforts (1Pennisi E. Science. 1998; 282: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, information about the function and regulation of most PTPs in cellular contexts is limited. PTPH1 and PTPMEG are the prototypes of a growing family of PTPs characterized by N-terminal segments containing sequence motifs with homology to band 4.1 domains and PDZ domains (2Yang Q. Tonks N.K.

PTPH1 was found to be mostly associated with membrane structures in the cells and this association appears to be mediated by the N-terminal portion of PTPH1. 2S.-H. Zhang and N. K.

The PDZ domains of PTPBAS (also known as FAP-1), a member of the PTPH1 family, were found to interact with the cell surface receptor FAS and, as a result, it has been suggested to be involved in FAS-mediated apoptosis (7Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). We have shown that the N-terminal segment of PTPH1 exerts an inhibitory effect on its enzymatic activity in vitro (8Zhang S.H. Eckberg W.R. Yang Q. Samatar A.A. Tonks N.K. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 20067-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that 20–50% of PTPH1 is complexed with the 14-3-3 adaptor protein in cells, in a manner that is dependent on the phosphorylation of PTPH1 and is regulated by mitogenic signals (4Zhang S.H. Kobayashi R. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27281-27287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the biological function and physiological substrate(s) of PTPH1 remain to be elucidated. To understand the function of PTPH1, it is critical to identify its physiological substrates. PTP catalytic domains consist of ∼240 residues containing a number of invariant amino acids, including those in the PTP signature motif (9Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are the invariant cysteine residue, which functions in nucleophilic attack upon the phosphate group of the substrate, and the invariant aspartate, which acts both as a general acid to facilitate the protonation of the tyrosyl leaving group and as a general base to facilitate hydrolysis of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate (10Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mutation of the aspartate residue to alanine dramatically slows catalysis, with minimal effect on substrate affinity, thus stabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex (11Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). This observation led us to develop a “substrate trapping” approach for identifying physiological substrates of various PTPs (11Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 12Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this approach, substrates are isolated as proteins that bind specifically to the Asp → Ala mutant enzyme. By applying this strategy in this study, we have been able to identify the first substrate for the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPH1. We expressed the substrate-trapping mutant of PTPH1 as a GST fusion protein, GST-PTPH1-D811A, and found that it interacted primarily with a 97-kDa protein from various cell lysates in vitro. Peptide sequencing revealed that the 97-kDa protein was thevalosin-containing protein (VCP), an ATPase belonging to the AAA (ATPaseassociated with different cellular activities) family (14Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon expression in mammalian cells, we observed a high phosphotyrosine content in the PTPH1-D811A mutant which appeared to curtail its trapping ability in a cellular context. By mutating tyrosine 676, which defines one side of the catalytic cleft, to phenylalanine in PTPH1-D811A, we created a mutant in which phosphotyrosine content was reduced and which displayed the ability to trap VCP specifically in mammalian cells with concomitant inhibition of cell proliferation. Importantly, the induction of wild type PTPH1 in stable cell lines also inhibited cell proliferation and led to specific dephosphorylation of VCP, without changes in the overall level and pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. These results suggest that PTPH1 may exert its effect on cell growth through dephosphorylation of VCP. Monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine were either developed in our laboratory (G98) (13Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (4G10) and Transduction Labs (PY20). Polyclonal antibodies against FAK (SC-558) and cyclin D1 (SC-753) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Agarose-coupled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PT66 was from Sigma. Ascites containing monoclonal antibodies against epitopes HA (12CA5) and Myc (9E10) were produced in our laboratory. Polyclonal antiserum CS531 against VCP was raised in rabbit using a peptide (GGSVYTEDNDDDLYG), corresponding to the last 15 residues of murine VCP, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). All monoclonal antibodies against PTPH1 (mAbZ1, Z2, Z56, Z63, Z64) were made using recombinant PTPH1, purified from Sf9 insect cells, as antigen (4Zhang S.H. Kobayashi R. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27281-27287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in one of the following three buffers: (i) Nonidet P-40 buffer, which consists of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); (ii) RIPA buffer, which is Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS; or (iii) hypotonic buffer, which contains 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm sucrose, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Immunoprecipitations were performed with various antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) as described previously (4Zhang S.H. Kobayashi R. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27281-27287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates, or cell lysates, were solubilized with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and transferred onto Imobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Immunoblot analysis was performed in a buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection. The C842S, D811A, and Y676F/D811A mutations in PTPH1 cDNA were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the Muta-Gene kit (Bio-Rad) and confirmed by double strand DNA sequencing. The catalytic domain (residues 634 to 913) of PTPH1 was fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in a pGEX vector. These GST-PTPH1 fusion proteins were produced in three forms: wild type, D811A, and C842S. For transfection of mammalian cells, wild type or mutant PTPH1 was tagged at the C terminus with the HA epitope (SYPYDVPDYAS). After confirmation by sequencing, these constructs were cloned into vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) and retroviral vector pBSTR1 (S. Reeves, Massachusetts General Hospital), Myc-tagged murine VCP constructs, wild type (VCPmyc), and mutant with a Y796F/Y805F double mutation (VCPmyc-FF) were generous gifts of Dr. L. Samelson (National Institutes of Health). Mammalian cell lines, including 293, A431, COS-7, HepG2, MDCK, NIH3T3, REF-52, Saos-2 and Vero, were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable NIH3T3 cell lines expressing full-length PTPH1 under the control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter were made using a retroviral gene delivery system (15Paulus W. Baur I. Boyce F.M. Breakefield X.O. Reeves S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Briefly, viral packaging line LinX (G. Hannon, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) was transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation with 15 μg of PTPH1 retroviral constructs. All the following steps of establishing and maintaining the stable cell lines were performed in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline to suppress the expression of PTPH1. Retroviruses were produced at 30 °C and filtered to remove packaging cells (0.45-μm filter; Millipore). NIH3T3 cells were then infected overnight at 30 °C with the viral supernatants supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Two days after infection, cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. Individual colonies were isolated and maintained in puromycin and tetracycline. To induce PTPH1 expression, cells were washed and reseeded in new dishes in the presence of puromycin but the absence of tetracycline. For cell synchronization, cells were induced to express PTPH1 for 24 h and then cultured in the presence of 1 mmhydroxyurea for 18 h to arrest cells at the G1/S boundary. The block was released by washing the cells with fresh medium 3 times. At different times after the release, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer for immunoblot analysis. Serum starvation of cells was achieved by culturing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 16 h. Stimulation of these starved cells was performed with 10 μg/ml insulin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmacia). Mammalian cells were treated with 50 μmpervanadate for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in substrate-trapping buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture). Before clarifying the lysates, 10 mmdithiothreitol was added to inactivate any unreacted iodoacetic acid. These lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with GST or GST-PTPH1 catalytic domain fusion proteins bound on beads, then the beads were washed 4 times with trapping buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Imobilon-P membranes. Blots were then incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and developed by ECL. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins identified by this assay were subjected to scale-up purification and sequenced by Edman degradation of K-endopeptidase-digested peptides (17Russo G.L. Vandenberg M.T. Yu I.J. Bae Y.S. Franza Jr., B.R. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20317-20325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to gain insight into the biological function of PTPH1, we made stable NIH3T3 cell lines expressing the phosphatase under the control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter. As shown in Fig.1, when expression of wild type PTPH1 was induced by removal of tetracycline from the media, cell growth was strongly inhibited. The same stable cell line, containing the wild type PTPH1 expression construct, accumulated 7-fold fewer cells upon induction of PTPH1 (Fig. 1 B). Approximately 10% of the cells gradually detached and floated off the dish during the induction of wild type PTPH1. These floating cells were stained by trypan blue, indicating that they were no longer viable. In contrast, overexpression of the catalytically impaired D811A mutant of PTPH1 had no effect on either cell growth or viability, suggesting that the catalytic activity of PTPH1 is required for growth inhibition. Similar results were obtained in 3 individual cell lines for each PTPH1 construct, indicating that the results presented do not arise from clonal variation. In light of the fact that ∼10% of cells induced to express wild type PTPH1 died, we considered that one explanation for the growth inhibition imposed by PTPH1 could be the induction of apoptosis. However, using a DNA fragmentation assay, we did not detect any apoptotic traits in cells induced to express PTPH1 (data not shown). Since there was no apparent effect on apoptosis, we investigated whether the growth inhibition may arise from interference with the cell cycle machinery. Using flow cytometric assays of DNA content, we observed that upon induction of PTPH1 expression the distribution of cells throughout the cell cycle was not altered compared with control cells, indicating that arrest did not occur in a particular phase of the cell cycle (data not shown). In addition, we investigated the effects of PTPH1 expression on reentry into the cell cycle during the recovery of cells from G1/S arrest by hydroxyurea. As shown in Fig. 2, the elevation of cyclin D1 during cell cycle reinitiation and progression was totally abolished by the induction of PTPH1. These data indicate that expression of PTPH1 disrupts cell cycle progression, thus slowing down or arresting cell growth. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of PTPH1-induced growth inhibition, we generated a substrate-trapping mutant form of the PTP (PTPH1-D811A) with which to identify critical substrates. Pervanadate-treated cell lysates were incubated with GST-PTPH1 catalytic domain fusion proteins bound on beads. Bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. We observed that a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 97 kDa (pp97) was isolated specifically by the PTPH1-D811A mutant from 293 cell lysates, but not by either the wild type or the PTPH1-C842S mutant (Fig.3). Furthermore, pp97 was also consistently recovered as the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from other cell lines tested including A431, COS-7, HepG2, MDCK, REF-52, Saos-2, and Vero (data not shown). Other proteins were occasionally isolated at lesser intensities, but due to their variable recovery they were not considered further. However, it is important to note that in any starting lysate, which contains hundreds of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, pp97 is not a major component, thus indicating the selectivity of the interaction between the isolated catalytic domain of PTPH1 and this substrate. We subjected pp97 to a large scale purification and obtained protein sequence by Edman degradation of K-endopeptidase-digested peptides. Sequences of 7 individual peptides were obtained and were all found to match sequences in VCP, a membrane-associated ATPase (18Egerton M. Ashe O.R. Chen D. Druker B.J. Burgess W.H. Samelson L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3533-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). VCP, also named p97, and its yeast ortholog CDC48, has been demonstrated to play an essential role in regulating many membrane activities and is a well established cell cycle regulator (14Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This function of VCP as a regulator of cell cycle progression is interesting in light of the suppression of cell proliferation induced by ectopic expression of PTPH1. Although the PTPH1-D811A mutant of PTPH1 trapped VCP in the above assay in vitro, it was difficult to detect trapping directly in mammalian cells. We noted that the PTPH1-D811A mutant incorporated significant levels of phosphotyrosine when expressed in mammalian cells (Fig. 4 A), whereas the GST-PTPH1-D811A fusion protein expressed in E. coli bore no phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3). We reasoned that the presence of phosphate on the PTPH1-D811A mutant may impede access of other tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates to its active site and thus compromise its trapping ability. A conserved tyrosine residue is located in the active site and provides a hydrophobic interaction with the substrate phosphotyrosine, serving a role in orienting the substrate (10Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We thought it was possible that this residue may be a receptor for a phosphate from the highly active thiophosphate intermediate formed between the cysteine residue of the Asp → Ala mutant and the phosphate group of its substrates. When we mutated this tyrosine residue (Tyr676) in PTPH1-D811A to phenylalanine to make a Y676F/D811A double mutant, we observed that the level of phosphotyrosine was dramatically reduced compared with the PTPH1-D811A single mutant (Fig. 4 B). More importantly, the PTPH1-Y676F/D811A double mutant specifically trapped VCP in vivo. These results indicate that mutation of this conserved tyrosine residue may improve the efficiency of substrate trapping, particularly for those PTPs in which the Asp → Ala mutants are susceptible to modification of the tyrosine residue that defines the active site. The tyrosines (Tyr796 and Tyr805) at the C terminus of VCP have been reported to be the major sites of phosphorylation, with Tyr805 accounting for more than 90% of the tyrosine phosphorylation on the protein (19Egerton M. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11435-11441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site in yeast CDC48, equivalent to Tyr805 in VCP, abolished translocation of the protein to the nucleus during mitosis and led to elongation of the cell cycle and a growth defect (20Madeo F. Schlauer J. Zischka H. Mecke D. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We tested whether PTPH1 recognized these residues in VCP in mammalian cells. Human 293 cells were co-transfected with individual PTPH1 constructs and wild type VCP, or VCP containing a Y796F/Y805F double mutation. Immunoprecipitates of PTPH1 from lysates of these co-transfected 293 cells were monitored for the presence of VCP (Fig. 5). We found that only wild type VCP was trapped by the PTPH1-Y676F/D811A mutant and that the wild type or the D811A single mutant of PTPH1 were ineffective substrate traps. The Y796F/Y805F VCP mutant was not associated with any of the PTPH1 constructs. It is important to note that under the conditions of these experiments, the wild type and mutant PTPH1 were expressed to similar levels, as were both forms of VCP (data not shown). Therefore, these results indicate that phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosines of VCP is required for its recognition as substrate by PTPH1. Our trapping studies have identified the cell cycle regulator VCP as a substrate of PTPH1. Therefore, it was important to study the phosphorylation status of VCP in stable cell lines expressing wild type PTPH1. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP has been found to be very transient in vivo and difficult to measure (19Egerton M. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11435-11441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schulte R.J. Campbell M.A. Fischer W.H. Sefton B.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5465-5472PubMed Google Scholar). We addressed this issue in two ways. First, we examined the level of phosphotyrosine in VCP immunoprecipitated from cells that were pretreated with 1 mm vanadate before lysis. Vanadate is a PTP inhibitor which preserves phosphotyrosine residues in cellular proteins and will minimize nonspecific dephosphorylation events during the experimental manipulations. We observed a 3–5-fold decrease in the phosphotyrosine level of VCP following ectopic expression of PTPH1 (Fig.6a). Second, we determined the distribution of VCP in the total population of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins immunoprecipitated from randomly growing cells. In pools containing similar amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the population of tyrosine-phosphorylated VCP was dramatically reduced following the induction of PTPH1 (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, a well known tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in NIH3T3 cells, was unchanged when analyzed under the same conditions. Furthermore, expression of PTPH1 did not alter the global pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in starved, randomly growing or insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 6 C). This indicates that the overexpression of PTPH1 results in selective, rather than random, dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and highlights the importance of VCP as a target in the cell growth arrest induced by PTPH1 expression. An important step in understanding the function of PTPs is to identify their physiological substrates. Use of catalytically impaired, substrate-trapping mutants, in which the invariant general acid aspartate residue is changed to alanine, has proved to be a potent strategy for identifying substrates of a number of PTPs (11Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 12Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In our pursuit of the substrate(s) of PTPH1, we have refined the approach by combining the Asp → Ala mutation with a second mutation, which changes a conserved tyrosine residue at the active site to phenylalanine, to produce an effective substrate trap in a cellular context. As a result, we have identified the cell cycle regulator VCP/CDC48 as a substrate of PTPH1. In the initial substrate trapping experiments performedin vitro, we utilized a GST-PTPH1-D811A mutant fusion protein, which was produced in bacteria, to identify VCP as a potential substrate of PTPH1. However, no tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins co-immunoprecipitated with the PTPH1-D811A mutant following expression in mammalian cells. We found that, unlike the bacterially expressed D811A mutant, the PTPH1-D811A expressed in mammalian cells was itself recovered in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form and could not trap substrates. We have also observed this problem with several other members of the PTP family. 3S.-H. Zhang, and N. K. Tonks, unpublished data. Interestingly, the inactive Cys → Ser mutants of these PTPs, in which the essential nucleophilic cysteine was changed to serine, were not tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting that the catalytic activity of these PTPs was required for the accumulation of phosphotyrosine. Thus the presence of phosphotyrosine may be a consequence of catalysis rather than these mutants being phosphorylated by protein-tyrosine kinases. These observations led us to speculate that the tyrosyl residue undergoing modification in PTPH1-D811A may be Tyr676, the residue which helps to define the active site cleft of the enzyme. The presence of phosphate on this residue, which may come from transfer of the unstable phosphate in the cysteine-phosphate intermediate, would be likely to impede access of other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to the active site and thus inhibit substrate trapping. Mutation of Tyr676 to phenylalanine should preserve the hydrophobic interaction with the substrate and maintain the integrity of the active site cleft, while removing the hydroxyl group that may act as a phosphate acceptor. We expect that this mutant would be structurally similar to the wild type enzyme but would not contain phosphotyrosine. As shown, indeed the PTPH1-Y676F/D811A double mutant does not accumulate a significant amount of phosphotyrosine and, importantly, traps VCP as a substrate in mammalian cells. Interestingly, in the Asp → Ala mutants of PTP1B and TCPTP, which function as substrate traps in a cellular context, the incorporation of phosphotyrosine has not been noted as a major problem (11Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 13Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference between members of the PTP family is currently unclear. VCP/p97/CDC48 and other members of the AAA family of ATPases are involved in cell cycle regulation, protein degradation, organelle biogenesis, and vesicle-mediated protein transport (14Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of VCP for normal cellular function can also be implied by the fact that it is highly conserved in protein sequence from yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants to animals. Mutants of CDC48, the yeast ortholog of mammalian VCP, are arrested late in mitosis and accumulate elongated nuclei that appear unable to undergo fission, a process that involves membrane fusion (22Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 82: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A homozygous insertion mutation in smallmind, aDrosophila gene encoding a protein in the subfamily of VCP/p97/CDC48, arrests development at the larval stage with neuronal defects (23Long A.R. Yang M. Kaiser K. Shepherd D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). VCP/p97/CDC48 was found to be a critically required component in organelle membrane fusions, such as the fusion of endoplasmic reticulum membrane and the rebuilding of Golgi cisternae from mitotic Golgi fragments, that occur at the end of mitosis in both yeast and animal cells (24Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N.D.

Cell. 1998; 92: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). VCP/CDC48 is mainly attached to the endoplasmic reticulum in quiescent cells and relocalizes in a cell cycle-dependent manner: CDC48 enters the nucleus during late G1 in yeast and VCP aggregates at the centrosomes during mitosis in mammalian cells (20Madeo F. Schlauer J. Zischka H. Mecke D. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP was stimulated upon activation of T cell antigen receptors and tyrosine 805 of VCP accounted for more than ∼90% of the total phosphorylation (18Egerton M. Ashe O.R. Chen D. Druker B.J. Burgess W.H. Samelson L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3533-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Egerton M. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11435-11441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schulte R.J. Campbell M.A. Fischer W.H. Sefton B.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5465-5472PubMed Google Scholar). Rather than directly effecting the ATPase activity of VCP (19Egerton M. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11435-11441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP and CDC48 appears to play a role in regulating subcellular distribution (20Madeo F. Schlauer J. Zischka H. Mecke D. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Failure of CDC48/VCP to migrate into the nucleus in yeast, or to centrosomes in mammalian cells, would be expected to result in disturbance of cell division. Mutation of tyrosine 834 of CDC48, which is equivalent to the major phosphorylation site Tyr805 in VCP, to phenylalanine abolishes this translocation and causes an elongated cell cycle and growth retardation, whereas mutation of the same residue to glutamate, to mimic phosphorylation, allows translocation to the nucleus and results in normal cell growth (20Madeo F. Schlauer J. Zischka H. Mecke D. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The growth inhibition mediated by ectopic expression of PTPH1 is reminiscent of the yeast CDC48 mutant that harbors this tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation. We demonstrated that ectopic expression of wild type PTPH1 inhibited cell growth in the stable NIH3T3 cell lines and that the phosphatase activity of PTPH1 is required for this growth arrest. In cells in which PTPH1 expression had been induced, tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP was dramatically and selectively reduced, with no change detected in the phosphotyrosine levels on FAK or the total profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the cell. These results suggest that a selective interaction between VCP and PTPH1 was not compromised by overexpression of the phosphatase and that the growth inhibition by PTPH1 may be due to the specific dephosphorylation of VCP. Moreover, the PTPH1-Y676F/D811A double mutant recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated VCP specifically and engagement of VCP in a complex with this trapping mutant, presumably interfering with the interaction between VCP and its appropriate targets in the membrane, yields the same phenotype as expression of the wild type enzyme. These results argue that PTPH1 specifically dephosphorylates the C-terminal tyrosines of VCP, thus interfering with the phosphotyrosine-dependent regulation of VCP in the cell cycle, resulting in growth inhibition. In summary, using a modification of the substrate-trapping strategy developed in the laboratory, we have identified the cell cycle regulator VCP as a major cellular substrate of PTPH1. Ectopic expression of PTPH1 led to selective dephosphorylation of VCP in stable NIH3T3 cell lines and inhibited cell cycle progression and growth. In light of reports that disruption of VCP/CDC48 function, and in particular the disruption of tyrosine phosphorylation site in VCP/CDC48, also inhibits cell proliferation, our data are consistent with the interpretation that the effects of ectopic expression of PTPH1 are manifested primarily through its dephosphorylation of VCP. These results further demonstrate the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating the function of VCP in cell cycle progression.

https://openalex.org/W2043389228,"We have used an in vitro translation initiation assay to investigate the requirements for the efficient transfer of Met-tRNAf (as Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of mRNA (or an AUG codon) to form the 40 S preinitiation complex. We observed that the 17-kDa initiation factor eIF1A is necessary and sufficient to mediate nearly quantitative transfer of Met-tRNAf to isolated 40 S ribosomal subunits. However, the addition of 60 S ribosomal subunits to the 40 S preinitiation complex formed under these conditions disrupted the 40 S complex resulting in dissociation of Met-tRNAf from the 40 S subunit. When the eIF1A-dependent preinitiation reaction was carried out with 40 S ribosomal subunits that had been preincubated with eIF3, the 40 S preinitiation complex formed included bound eIF3 (40 S·eIF3·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). In contrast to the complex lacking eIF3, this complex was not disrupted by the addition of 60 S ribosomal subunits. These results suggest that in vivo, both eIF1A and eIF3 are required to form a stable 40 S preinitiation complex, eIF1A catalyzing the transfer of Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP to 40 S subunits, and eIF3 stabilizing the resulting complex and preventing its disruption by 60 S ribosomal subunits.

Initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells occurs by a sequence of partial reactions requiring the participation of a large number of specific proteins called eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). 1The abbreviations used are: eIF(s), eukaryotic (translation) initiation factor(s). In vitrostudies using purified initiation factors have shown that the overall initiation reaction commences with the binding of the initiator Met-tRNAf as the Met-tRNAf ·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to a 40 S ribosomal subunit containing bound initiation factor eIF3 to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). In the next step, the 40 S preinitiation complex binds to the capped 5′-end of mRNA in a reaction requiring initiation factors eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B and then scans the mRNA to locate the correct initiation AUG codon where the preinitiation complex is positioned on the mRNA to form the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·eIF3·mRNA·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). Subsequently, the 60 S ribosomal subunit joins the 40 S complex in an eIF5-dependent reaction to form a functional 80 S initiation complex (80 S·mRNA·Met-tRNAf; for reviews, see Refs. 1Maitra U.

Recently, we described (4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) an efficient in vitro translation initiation assay in which the 17-kDa initiation factor eIF1A is necessary and sufficient for the transfer of the initiator Met-tRNAf (as Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to isolated 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of mRNA (or an AUG codon) to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). Several laboratories have, however, reported that the multimeric initiation factor eIF3 that binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit in vitro in the absence of other initiation components (5Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) also stimulated the transfer of the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S subunits to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP) (6Trachsel H.

There is also evidence that in vivo, the majority of native 40 S ribosomal subunits contain bound eIF3 (10Thompson H.A. Sadnik I. Scheinbuks J. Moldave K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Smith K.E. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6880-6884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists thatin vivo, in the presence of eIF1A, the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex binds to a 40 S·eIF3 complex rather than to free 40 S ribosomal subunits to form the 40 S preinitiation complex. In this paper, we investigate the role of both eIF1A and eIF3 in the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex in vitro. We show that these two proteins perform distinct functions in 40 S preinitiation complex formation. Whereas eIF1A alone is necessary and sufficient for the quantitative transfer of Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP to isolated 40 S ribosomal subunits, in reaction mixtures containing both 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits, eIF3, in addition to eIF1A, is required to form a stable 40 S preinitiation complex. The preparation of 35S-labeled rabbit liver Met-tRNAf (20,000–100,000 cpm/pmol) and ribosomal subunits from Artemia salina eggs was described previously (12Stringer E.A. Chaudhuri A. Maitra U. J.

Initiation factor eIF2 was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysates by established procedures (4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); homogeneous bacterially expressed recombinant human eIF1A was isolated as described (4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purified eIF3 was isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysates as we described recently (9Chaudhuri J. Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol.

It consists of six major polypeptides of 110, 67, 42, 40, 36, and 35 kDa but lacked the 170-kDa polypeptide reported by others (14Schreier M.H. Erni B. Staehelin T. J. Mol.

These eIF3 preparations are highly active in forming AUG-dependent 40 S initiation complex that is fully competent in joining 60 S ribosomal subunits to form a functional 80 S initiation complex (9Chaudhuri J. Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Rabbit IgG antibodies specific for mammalian eIF1A were obtained as described (4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and total IgY antibodies specific for mammalian eIF3 subunits were isolated from egg yolks of laying hens immunized with purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF3 (9Chaudhuri J. Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was as described previously (4Chaudhuri J. Si K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex was measured by eIF1A-dependent transfer of Met-tRNAf (as the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits at 1 mm Mg2+ in the absence of mRNA or AUG as follows. Reactions were carried out in two stages. In stage 1, reaction mixtures (50 μl each) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 6 μm GTP, 8 pmol of [35S]Met-tRNAf (20,000–50,000 cpm/pmol), and 0.8–1.2 μg of purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF2 were incubated at 37 °C for 4 min to promote formation of the [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. Reaction mixtures were then chilled in an ice-water bath, and a 5-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was subjected to nitrocellulose membrane filtration to determine the amount of the ternary complex formed as described previously (12Stringer E.A. Chaudhuri A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6845-6848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In stage 2, another set of reaction mixtures (25 μl each) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.6 A 260 unit of 40 S ribosomal subunits, and 30–100 ng of purified recombinant eIF1A were incubated at 37 °C for 4 min and then chilled in an ice-water bath. Each mixture was then supplemented with 45 μl of the incubated stage 1 reaction mixture containing about 2 pmol of [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 min, reaction mixtures (now 70 μl each) were chilled in an ice-water bath, the MgCl2concentration of each reaction was adjusted to 5 mm, and the mixture was layered onto a 5-ml 7.5–30% (w/v) sucrose gradient containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 105 min in an SW 50.1 rotor. Fractions (200–300 μl) were collected from the bottom of each tube, and the radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Under the conditions of this assay, formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex was totally dependent on the presence of eIF1A, 40 S subunits, as well as the [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP formed in stage 1 incubation. The efficiency of the 40 S preinitiation complex formation was calculated relative to [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex formed in stage 1 incubation. A reaction mixture (175 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 15 μg of bovine serum albumin, 40 pmol of [35S]Met-tRNAf (100,000 cpm/pmol), 18 μm GTP, and 12 μg of eIF2 was incubated for 4 min at 37 °C to form the [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. The reaction mixture was then supplemented with 1.8A 260 units of 40 S ribosomal subunits, 0.6 μg of purified recombinant eIF1A, and MgCl2 (1 mmfinal concentration). After incubation at 37 °C for 4 min, the reaction mixture was chilled in an ice-water bath, and the MgCl2 concentration was raised to 5 mm and then resolved on sucrose gradients exactly as described above. Fractions containing the 40 S preinitiation complex with bound [35S]Met-tRNAf, free of unreacted reaction components, were pooled, divided into small aliquots, and stored at −70 °C until used. We have shown previously (4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that the 17 kDa-initiation factor eIF1A was both necessary and sufficient for the transfer of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits (4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Whereas the multimeric initiation factor eIF3, which binds to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of other factors (5Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), also can promote this transfer reaction, the efficiency of Met-tRNAf transferred by eIF1A was far greater than with an excess of eIF3 alone (4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the catalytic reutilization of eIF1A in the transfer reaction was independent of eIF3. It was not immediately apparent that the binding of eIF3 to 40 S ribosomal subunits played any role in the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex. The reactions described above were performed with isolated 40 S ribosomal subunits. To investigate complex formation under more physiological conditions, namely when both 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits were present in the same reaction, a preformed [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex was incubated with 40 S ribosomal subunits and eIF1A in the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits, and the reaction products were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1). Although eIF1A, as expected, mediated the efficient transfer of [35S]Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits to form the 40 S preinitiation complex, the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits severely inhibited the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex (Fig. 1 A). The addition of 60 S subunits reduced the amount of Met-tRNAf bound to 40 S subunits from 1.2 pmol to about 0.02 pmol (Fig. 1 A). If however, the 40 S ribosomal subunits were preincubated with both eIF1A and eIF3, the 40 S preinitiation complex was formed efficiently even in the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1 B). About 1.8 pmol of Met-tRNAf was bound to 40 S ribosomes in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits; the addition of 60 S subunits to the preinitiation reaction resulted in the binding of nearly 1.4 pmol of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits. The efficient formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex under these conditions (i.e. in the presence eIF3 and 60 S ribosomal subunits) was still dependent on the presence of eIF1A in the reaction mixture. Omission of eIF1A from a preinitiation reaction containing only eIF3 resulted in a marked decrease in the amount of Met-tRNAfbound to 40 S ribosomes (Fig. 1 B). However, even under these conditions, the small amount of the 40 S preinitiation formed in the presence of eIF3 alone was unaffected by the addition of 60 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrate that in the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits, efficient formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex requires the participation of both eIF3 and eIF1A in the reaction. It should be noted here that in these 40 S preinitiation reactions containing 60 S ribosomal subunits, no 80 S initiation complexes were formed because initiation factor eIF5 was not added to these reactions. The simplest interpretation of the results obtained above is that the addition of 60 S subunits to 40 S preinitiation reactions at 5 mm MgCl2 resulted in the nonenzymatic association of the ribosomal subunits to form 80 S ribosomes prior to 40 S preinitiation complex formation. It is well established that formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex requires free 40 S subunits; 80 S ribosomes cannot participate in this reaction. Initiation factor eIF3 has been reported to bind to free 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of initiator Met-tRNAf and other initiation factors and prevent the Mg2+-dependent association between 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits to form 80 S ribosomes (5, 10, 18, 19; also see Ref. 3Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). Similar antiassociation activity has also been reported for eIF1A (20Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In light of this reported antiassociation activity of these two initiation factors, the possibility exists that the presence of both eIF1A and eIF3 in the preinitiation reaction prevented association of the ribosomal subunits, thereby making free 40 S subunits available for 40 S preinitiation complex formation. We therefore investigated whether eIF3 and eIF1A indeed function as ribosomal subunit antiassociation factors in the absence of Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. Isolated 40 S ribosomal subunits were incubated with eIF1A and eIF3 at 1 mm Mg2+; the Mg2+ concentration of the reaction mixture was then raised to 5 mm, 60 S ribosomal subunits were added, and the level of 80 S ribosome formation was determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig.2). In control incubations in which no protein factors were added, ribosomal subunits, as expected, remained dissociated at 1 mm Mg2+; at 5 mmMg2+, the ribosomal subunits associated to form 80 S ribosomes (Fig. 2, left panel, A andB). However, prior incubation of 40 S ribosomal subunits with eIF3 and eIF1A followed by the addition of 60 S ribosomal subunits failed to prevent association of the subunits to form 80 S ribosomes (Fig. 2, left panel, C). Under similar assay conditions, eIF6, which binds to 60 S ribosomal subunits, prevents the association of 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits (data not shown here; see Refs. 21Russell D.W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8796-8800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Valenzuela D. Chaudhuri A. Maitra U. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 14285-14290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that in contrast to other reports (18Trachsel H. Staehelin T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 565: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Goss D.J. Rounds D. Harrigan T. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), eIF1A and eIF3 by themselves do not have ribosomal subunit antiassociation activity in the absence of Met-tRNAf and other initiation components. It should be noted that the lack of antiassociation factor activity of eIF3 was not caused by the absence of binding of eIF3 to 40 S ribosomal subunits. This was shown by incubating eIF3 with 40 S ribosomal subunits followed by the addition of 60 S particles either at 1 mm Mg2+ (to keep the subunits dissociated) or at 5 mm Mg2+ (to promote ribosomal subunit association). In accord with a previous report (5Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), at 1 mmMg2+ when the ribosomal subunits remained dissociated, eIF3 bound stably to 40 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 2, right immunoblot, panel A). However, at 5 mmMg2+, the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits resulted in the release of eIF3 from 40 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 2, right immunoblot, panel B) with the concomitant formation of 80 S ribosomes (compare Fig. 2, A and C, of left panel). The release of eIF3 from the 40 S subunits is not caused by the elevated Mg2+ concentration alone, since in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits, eIF3 remained bound to 40 S particles even at 5 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). These results suggest that although eIF3 binds stably to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex, eIF3 alone or in the presence of eIF1A is devoid of ribosomal subunit antiassociation factor activity. Thus, the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex by eIF3 and eIF1A in the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits is not the result of any ribosomal subunit antiassociation activity of these two initiation factors. These results suggested that the inhibition of eIF1A-mediated 40 S preinitiation complex formation by 60 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of eIF3 could be caused by displacement of the 40 S subunits from the 40 S preinitiation complex formed in an eIF1A-dependent reaction. To investigate this possibility, a preformed [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex was incubated with 40 S ribosomal subunits in presence of eIF1A to form the 40 S preinitiation complex that was detected by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig.3 A). When such a preformed 40 S preinitiation complex was incubated with 60 S ribosomal subunits and then subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, the amount of Met-tRNAf bound to 40 S ribosomes was reduced markedly (Fig. 3 A). If, however, 40 S ribosomal subunits were first incubated with eIF3 and then used to form an eIF1A-dependent 40 S preinitiation complex, the subsequent addition of 60 S ribosomal subunits did not destabilize the preinitiation complex (Fig. 3 A). Western blot analysis (using anti-eIF3 and anti-eIF1A antibodies as probes) of the gradient fractions derived from the reaction in which the 40 S preinitiation complex was formed in the presence of eIF1A and eIF3 was carried also out (Fig. 3 B). As shown, eIF3 was detected in the region of the gradient where the 40 S preinitiation complex also sedimented (Fig.3 B, top panel). In contrast, anti-eIF1A antibodies did not detect eIF1A in this region; eIF1A was detected near the top of the gradient at a position expected for a 17 kDa-protein (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). These results show that although eIF1A is released from the 40 S subunit after formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex, eIF3 remains bound to the complex. Furthermore, in contrast to the complex lacking eIF3, the eIF3-bound complex was not disrupted by 60 S ribosomal subunits. It should be noted that in data not presented here, we have shown that 60 S-mediated disruption of the 40 S preinitiation complex in the absence of eIF3 leads to the concomitant formation of 80 S particles devoid of bound Met-tRNAf. The results described above suggest that the 40 S preinitiation complex formed in an eIF1A-dependent reaction was stable in the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits only when the initiation reaction also contained eIF3. Because eIF1A and eIF3 were present in these initiation reactions, it was unclear whether eIF1A, which is essential for the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex, also plays a cooperative role with eIF3 in the stabilization of the 40 S preinitiation complex. To investigate this possibility, a preformed [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex was incubated with 40 S ribosomal subunits and eIF1A in the absence of AUG. The preinitiation complex formed was then isolated free of unreacted reaction components by sucrose gradient centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Western blotting using anti-eIF1A antibodies confirmed that the purified isolated 40 S preinitiation complex was devoid of eIF1A (data not shown here; see Ref. 4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The stability of such an isolated 40 S preinitiation complex was then investigated (Fig. 4). When the isolated 40 S preinitiation complex was again subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, most of the bound Met-tRNAf dissociated from the 40 S ribosomal subunit (Fig. 4). Released [35S]Met-tRNAf sedimented near the top of the gradient (data not shown in the figure). 2In a separate experiment, we observed that nearly 70–80% of the released 35S radioactivity was retained on nitrocellulose membrane filters, indicating that Met-tRNAf was released from the 40 S subunit as [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. These results indicate that an isolated 40 S preinitiation complex, purified free of unreacted reaction components, cannot sustain a second round of sedimentation through sucrose gradients even in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits, indicating an intrinsic instability of the 40 S preinitiation complex. If, however, the isolated 40 S preinitiation complex was incubated with eIF3 and then subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, most (approximately 88%) of the Met-tRNAfremained bound to the 40 S preinitiation complex (Fig. 4). eIF1A, by itself, did not stabilize the isolated 40 S preinitiation complex, and eIF1A did not increase eIF3-mediated stability of the preinitiation complex (Fig. 4). Furthermore, when the isolated 40 S preinitiation complex was first incubated with eIF3, a substantial fraction of the resulting preinitiation complex was not destabilized by 60 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 4). Whereas only about 6% of the preformed 40 S preinitiation complex could be recovered on sucrose gradient centrifugation after incubation with 60 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of eIF3, the presence of eIF3 allowed the recovery of nearly 54% of the input 40 S preinitiation complex after incubation with 60 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 4, inset). The eIF3-mediated stabilization under these conditions was not significantly improved by the addition of eIF1A in the reaction mixture (data not shown). These results show that although eIF1A is essential for the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex, the presence of eIF3 bound to the 40 S ribosomes is required for the stability of the 40 S preinitiation complex. eIF1A plays no role in this stabilization effect. The 60 S ribosomal subunit-mediated dissociation of Met-tRNAf from the 40 S preinitiation complex, formed in the absence of eIF3, occurred prior to its recognition of the AUG codon. If the 40 S preinitiation complex was allowed to interact with AUG to form an initiation complex (40 S·AUG·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP), subsequent incubation with 60 S ribosomal subunits did not cause dissociation of Met-tRNAf even in the absence of eIF3 (Fig.5). This experiment also indicates that the 40 S preinitiation complex formed in the absence of eIF3 is an unstable complex with a conformation distinct from that of the 40 S initiation complex. An obligatory intermediate step in translation initiation in eukaryotic cells is the initial binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits (in the absence of mRNA) to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (1Maitra U. Stringer E.A. Chaudhuri A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 869-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Kozak M. Annu. Rev.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). This is then followed by the scanning of the mRNA by the 40 S preinitiation complex to locate and then recognize the initiation AUG codon to form the 40 S initiation complex. In this paper, we have investigated the role of eIF1A and eIF3 in the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex. Results presented here show that although eIF1A can mediate nearly quantitative transfer of Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to free 40 S ribosomal subunits, the addition of 60 S ribosomal subunits totally abolished 40 S preinitiation complex formation. This was shown to be due to disruption of the preformed 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·Met-tRNAf ·eIF2·GTP) by 60 S ribosomal subunits. If the eIF1A-mediated 40 S preinitiation complex was formed using 40 S ribosomal subunits preincubated with eIF3, the resulting 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP) was resistant to the disruptive action of 60 S ribosomal subunits. These results along with the previous observations made by Thompson et al. (10Thompson H.A. Sadnik I. Scheinbuks J. Moldave K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Smith and Henshaw (11Smith K.E. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6880-6884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that the majority of native 40 S ribosomal subunits contain bound eIF3, suggest that in the presence of eIF1A, the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex binds to a 40 S·eIF3 complex rather than to free 40 S ribosomal subunits. Thus,in vivo, when 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits are present in the same milieu, both eIF1A and eIF3 are required to form a stable 40 S preinitiation complex, eIF1A catalyzing the transfer of Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP to 40 S ribosomal subunits, and eIF3 stabilizing the complex against 60 S-mediated disruption. The recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunits containing bound Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 5′-cap structure of eukaryotic mRNAs occurs by interaction between eIF3 bound to the 40 S subunit with the eIF4G subunit of initiation factor eIF4F that is associated with the 5′-cap structure of mRNA (24Hentze M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 500-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In light of this finding, it is tempting to speculate on the physiological significance of the binding of eIF3 to 40 S subunits prior to the transfer of Met-tRNAf to form the 40 S preinitiation complex. First, as demonstrated in this work, the 40 S preinitiation complex formed in an eIF1A-dependent reaction in the absence of eIF3 is intrinsically unstable, and disruption of the complex by 60 S subunits is a reflection of this instability. This is consistent with our observation that the 40 S preinitiation complex not containing bound eIF3 and purified free of unreacted reaction components, by sucrose gradient centrifugation, is unstable to a second round of sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4). Second, the presence of eIF3 in the 40 S preinitiation complex is a stringent prerequisite for it to bind to mRNA. A 40 S preinitiation complex formed in the absence of eIF3 is a “dead-end” complex because it cannot bind mRNA, and the disruption by 60 S ribosomal subunits leads to the release of bound initiation factors that can then participate in effective initiation reactions. Thus, it can be argued that the 60 S subunit has a “proofreading” role ensuring that only a bona fide 40 S preinitiation complex, one with bound eIF3, and thus cued to bind mRNA in the subsequent step, is formed stably during translation initiation. Our results also demonstrate that eIF3 and eIFlA do not prevent 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunit association in the absence of other initiation components and may not be involved in the generation of free ribosomal subunits. It is worth noting that electronmicrographic studies of Srivastava et al. (26Srivastava S. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) showed that eIF3 binds to a site on the 40 S particle which is oriented away from the interaction site with the 60 S subunit. The ribosomal subunit antiassociation activity of eIF3 and eIF1A reported by other laboratories (10Thompson H.A. Sadnik I. Scheinbuks J. Moldave K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Trachsel H. Staehelin T. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) could be caused by the use of fixatives (e.g.glutaraldehyde) to stabilize the 40 S·eIF3 complex which may lead to nonphysiological interactions. The results presented here, however show that eIF3 does have antiassociation factor activity in the context of 40 S preinitiation reactions. In the absence of eIF3, 60 S subunits can displace the 40 S subunit present in the 40 S preinitiation complex and associate with 40 S subunits to form 80 S ribosomes. The presence of eIF3 bound to the 40 S preinitiation complex prevents 60 S subunits from displacing 40 S subunits from the preinitiation complex. Thus, under these conditions, 80 S ribosomes cannot be formed. The eIF3 preparations used in the present study were purified based on their ability to stimulate the AUG-dependent binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits to form the 40 S initiation complex (9Chaudhuri J. Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The subunit composition of these eIF3 preparations is somewhat different from that reported by others (see Ref. 3Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar), notably the absence of p170 polypeptide in our purified eIF3 preparations (9Chaudhuri J. Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously (9Chaudhuri J. Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30975-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that the p170 polypeptide is a “dissociable” subunit of mammalian eIF3. Thus although the presence of this polypeptide in eIF3 may be required for the 40 S preinitiation complex to bind mRNA, or for its ribosomal subunit antiassociation activity in the absence of other initiation components, this polypeptide is dispensable for reactions described in this paper. Pestova et al. (27Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) have reported recently that initiation factors eIF1A and eIF1 acted synergistically to mediate the assembly of the 40 S ribosomal initiation complex at the initiation codon. In light of our studies (Ref. 4Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and this work) demonstrating that eIF1A is essential for the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex, it is possible that the role of eIF1A on AUG selection observed by a Pestovaet al. (27Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) may be the result of the effect of eIF1A on 40 S preinitiation complex formation prior to its binding to mRNA. Further experiments are clearly necessary to establish whether eIF1A, in addition to its function in the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex, is also essential for the selection of the AUG codon on mRNA by the 40 S preinitiation complex.

https://openalex.org/W2124690308,"Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite that disassembles the Golgi apparatus into tubular networks and causes the dissociation of coatomer proteins from Golgi membranes. We have previously shown that an additional effect of BFA is to stimulate the ADP-ribosylation of two cytosolic proteins of 38 and 50 kDa (brefeldin A-ADP-riboslyated substrate (BARS)) and that this effect greatly facilitates the Golgi-disassembling activity of the toxin. In this study, BARS has been purified from rat brain cytosol and microsequenced, and the BARS cDNA has been cloned. BARS shares high homology with two known proteins, C-terminal-binding protein 1 (CtBP1) and CtBP2. It is therefore a third member of the CtBP family. The role of BARS in Golgi disassembly by BFA was verified in permeabilized cells. In the presence of dialyzed cytosol that had been previously depleted of BARS or treated with an anti-BARS antibody, BFA potently disassembled the Golgi. However, in cytosol complemented with purified BARS, or even in control cytosols containing physiological levels of BARS, the action of BFA on Golgi disassembly was strongly inhibited. These results suggest that BARS exerts a negative control on Golgi tubulation, with important consequences for the structure and function of the Golgi complex."
https://openalex.org/W2089023848,"Ligand-dependent changes in accessibility of purified P-glycoprotein, functionally reconstituted in liposomes, were investigated by fluorescence measurements. Trp quenching experiments provided evidence that P-glycoprotein adopts different tertiary structures upon binding of drug substrates in the absence and presence of MgATP and its nonhydrolyzable analog, MgATPγS. Five anthracycline derivatives were tested as drug substrates: daunorubicin, 4′-epi-doxorubicin, iododoxorubicin, 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin, and methoxy-morpholino-doxorubicin. Among them, daunorubicin and 4′-epi-doxorubicin have been shown to be rejected outside the multidrug-resistant cells, whereas the three others have been shown to accumulate in multidrug-resistant cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein and therefore retain their cytotoxic activity. A small conformational change was associated with nucleotide binding and amplified after nucleotide hydrolysis. Different conformational states were adopted by P-glycoprotein upon the addition of the anthracycline derivatives in the absence and presence of MgATP or MgATPγS. These conformational changes are shown to be related to the nature of the antitumor agents and more precisely to their capacity to accumulate in resistant cells. These data also suggest that the cytotoxicity of iododoxorubicin and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin is related to the fact they are not transported by P-glycoprotein.

According to its sequence, P-glycoprotein is classified as a member of a large family of membrane transporters known as the ATP-binding cassette superfamily that includes yeast, bacteria, and mammalian transporters (6Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 7Doige C.A. Ames G.F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 291-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein is proposed to function as an ATP-driven efflux pump, transporting through the plasma membrane an unusually broad but well defined spectrum of structurally unrelated cytotoxic drugs, including the Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and taxanes (8Horio M.

The mechanism of coupling ATP hydrolysis at the two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding sites to drug transport by the intramembrane drug-binding site(s) is likely to involve substantial conformational changes in the P-glycoprotein structure (17Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Different tertiary conformational changes have previously been shown to take place upon addition of MgATP and MgATP-verapamil, an actively transported chemosensitizer (18Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B.

The comprehension of the mechanism of interaction between the drug-binding site(s) and the NBD domains is essential for understanding how P-glycoprotein transports its substrates. The aim of this study was to further investigate the different conformations adopted by the protein in the presence of nucleotide ligands and drugs.Purified P-glycoprotein from CHO cells was reconstituted into lipid vesicles with an “inside-out” orientation, exposing its cytoplasmic region, which contains the NBD domains, to the external medium. The resulting proteoliposomes have previously been shown to exhibit both ATP-dependent drug transport and drug-stimulated ATPase activity (18Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V.

Three of these agents (iododoxorubicin, 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin, and FCE) have been shown to accumulate within multidrug-resistant cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein and to retain their cytotoxic activity. On the contrary, daunorubicin and 4′-epi-doxorubicin were rejected outside the multidrug-resistant cells. We analyze here how the P-glycoprotein conformational changes are related to the nature of the antitumor agents and, more precisely, to their capacity to accumulate into resistant cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDaunorubicin, ATP, ATPγS, octylglucoside, and asolectin were from Sigma. [3H]Azidopin (specific activity of 40 Ci/nmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 4′-epi-doxorubicin, iododoxorubicin, 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin, and FCE were obtained from Pharmacia-Farmitalia (Milan, Italy). Sephadex G-50 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.MethodsP-glycoprotein Reconstitution8 μg of P-glycoprotein (0.3 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Chaps), purified as described previously (20Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added to a dried film of asolectin (protein:lipid ratio of 1:20 w/w) and octylglucoside (lipid:octylglucoside ratio of 1:3 w/w). The mixture was centrifuged at 800 × g for 30 s on a 0.7 × 2-cm column of Sephadex G-50 (fine) equilibrated with 125 mm NaCl and 50 mmTricine-NaOH (pH 7.4). The proteoliposomes were collected in about 60 μl. 50% of the protein was recovered.ATP HydrolysisATP hydrolysis was measured as described by Shapiro and Ling (20Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations (2, 10, and 50 μm) of each anthracycline derivative. Protein determination was performed according to Peterson (21Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Quenching ExperimentsAcrylamide quenching experiments were carried out on a SLM Aminco 8000 fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm instead of 280 nm to reduce the absorbance by acrylamide. Control experiments established that no emission of the anthracycline derivatives occurred at 340 nm if excited at 295 nm (see Ref. 22Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Ferragut J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 937: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar for excitation spectrum, ∼390–540 nm, of daunomycin). Acrylamide aliquots were added from a 3 msolution to the proteoliposome suspension (1 ml in water) containing 8 μg of reconstituted P-glycoprotein and the various ligands. The final concentration was 3 mm for MgATP and MgATPγS and 10 μm for the various anthracycline derivatives. Fluorescence intensities were measured at 340 nm after each addition of quencher. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C. Acrylamide quenching data were subjected to a linear fit up to 80 mmacrylamide. Above this concentration, the static quenching by acrylamide is responsible for the deviation from linearity in Stern-Volmer plots.Azidopine PhotolabelingPlasma membrane vesicles were prepared from CHRB30 cells as described previously (23Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane vesicles are typically about 50% inside-out, exposing the cytoplasmic ATP-binding sites, and are sealed (24Shapiro A.B. Corder A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The vesicles were incubated in darkness at room temperature for 1 h with 0.3 μm [3H] azidopine and the indicated concentrations of anthracycline derivatives. After incubation, the samples were exposed to a UV lamp for 10 min while being kept on ice. Laemmli's buffer was added, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by autoradiography of the dried gel.DISCUSSIONPrevious experiments, including infrared spectroscopy (18Sonveaux N.

Our data provide strong evidence that the protein undergoes tertiary conformational changes depending on the nature of the ligands.Our experiments demonstrated that upon addition of MgATP, the enzyme adopts a different tertiary structure, resulting in a significantly increased solvent accessibility, according to previous data (18Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). MgATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analog of MgATP, was used to investigate the structural changes associated with nucleotide binding. Our fluorescence measurements provide evidence that MgATPγS binding increases, slightly but significantly, the accessibility of some P-glycoprotein domains. The structural change observed upon ATP binding (P-glycoprotein + MgATPγS) was much more pronounced when ATP hydrolysis occurred (P-glycoprotein + MgATP).In this study, we also demonstrated the influence of the binding of five anthracycline derivatives to P-glycoprotein. Binding of the five anthracycline derivatives to P-glycoprotein reduces accessibility of the protein to solvent. The enzyme therefore undergoes a first conformational change. However, in the presence of MgATP or MgATPγS, addition of cytotoxic and noncytotoxic derivatives resulted in various degrees of Trp fluorescence quenching. In the presence of noncytotoxic derivatives (daunorubicin and 4′-epi-doxorubicin), binding of MgATPγS was necessary and sufficient for the protein to undergo a conformational change. The protein was stabilized in a conformation state intermediate between the “opened” structure observed in the presence of MgATP alone and the “closed” structure observed upon binding of the drug. In the presence of the cytotoxic iododoxorubicin and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin, neither ATP binding nor ATP hydrolysis were capable of modifying the tertiary structure of P-glycoprotein. The protein was maintained in the closed conformational state induced by the binding of drug derivative. However, the ATPase activity measurements described in this paper clearly indicated that ATP is still able to bind to P-glycoprotein and is hydrolyzed in the presence of the five anthracycline derivatives tested. In the presence of noncytotoxic agents, the protein probably undergoes a conformational change after ATP binding and hydrolysis, which might be an important step in the catalytic cycle of drug transport. In contrast, the cytotoxic derivatives iododoxorubicin and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin probably inhibit one or more steps in the catalytic cycle of P-glycoprotein. This impairs their transport by the protein and results in an improved accumulation of these compounds within multidrug-resistant cells. In the presence of the cytotoxic FCE derivative, a third situation was observed: only hydrolysis of ATP increased accessibility of the protein. Binding of MgATPγS was not sufficient to induce a conformational change. After hydrolysis of ATP, FCE behaves like transported noncytotoxic molecules, and this argues in favor of transport of FCE by P-glycoprotein. It follows that cytotoxicity of this derivative may be due to its large hydrophobicity, which would favor rapid reincorporation into the plasma membrane after transport. Such a property has already been proposed for verapamil, a well known chemosensitizer that is thought to trap P-glycoprotein in a futile cycle by rapid rediffusion through the membrane (31Eytan G.D. Regev R. Oren G. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12897-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 32Sharom F.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Briefly, these data suggest that the step of the catalytic cycle stabilizing the P-glycoprotein depends on the nature of the drug.The existence of such different conformational states could be due to the involvement of distinct binding sites for the anthracycline derivatives tested. Azidopine photolabeling experiments also suggest the possibility for the drugs to bind to different P-glycoprotein sites. These experiments, performed in the presence of varying amounts of each anthracycline derivative, revealed a higher ability of the three cytotoxic derivatives to compete with azidopine, suggesting a stronger affinity of the cytotoxic drugs for P-glycoprotein or the presence of several different drug-binding sites. Independent experimental data also support the hypothesis that P-glycoprotein contains several substrate sites (33Dey S. Muralidhara R. Pastan I. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Shapiro and Ling (34Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) previously showed the existence of two different and positively cooperative sites for Hoechst 33342 and rhodamine 123 binding and transport. Furthermore, unpublished data 2A. B. Shapiro, unpublished data. suggest the possibility of binding of cytotoxic and noncytotoxic anthracycline derivatives to distinct but overlapping P-glycoprotein domains. The initial rates of rhodamine 123 and Hoechst 33342 transport in P-glycoprotein-containing plasma membrane vesicles isolated from CHRB30 cells were followed in the presence of varying concentrations of each anthracycline derivative by fluorescence monitoring. According to these data, noncytotoxic daunorubicin and 4′-epi-doxorubicin inhibit rhodamine 123 transport but stimulate Hoechst 33342 transport. Cytotoxic iododoxorubicin and FCE seem to bind to the Hoechst 33342 site as well as the rhodamine 123 site, whereas 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin binds more weakly to the Hoechst site. All together, these data suggest distinct binding sites for the cytotoxic and noncytotoxic drugs.In conclusion, this study describes distinct P-glycoprotein conformations corresponding to different drug and ATP binding and hydrolysis states. Separate or simultaneous addition of MgATP and drug substrates give rise to distinct conformational changes in the P-glycoprotein molecule, confirming that coupling between the drug-binding site(s) and the catalytic sites for ATP hydrolysis occurs.Interestingly, a difference in the protein comportment during these stages has been identified in the presence of cytotoxic and noncytotoxic derivatives. It is currently assumed that P-glycoprotein binds and transports substrates with a low specificity via a relatively nonspecific hydrophobic binding pocket (35Pawagi A.B. Wang J. Silverman M. Reithmeier R.A. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, our results demonstrate that minor changes in the anthracycline structure cause major modifications in the conformational states adopted by the enzyme, suggesting that if P-glycoprotein effectively binds its substrates with a low specificity, the following steps in its catalytic cycle leading to transport are much more dependent on the drug structure. P-glycoprotein is a 170-kDa plasma membrane protein involved in the multidrug resistance phenomenon responsible for failure of many human cancer chemotherapies (1Goldstein L.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 1039-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A structural prediction based on its sequence predicts two homologous halves, each containing six putative membrane-spanning α helices and a cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; FCE, methoxy-morpholino-doxorubicin; Hoechst 33342, 2-[2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-6-benzimidazolyl]-6-(1-methyl)-4-piperazil)-benzimidazole; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; FCE, methoxy-morpholino-doxorubicin; Hoechst 33342, 2-[2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-6-benzimidazolyl]-6-(1-methyl)-4-piperazil)-benzimidazole; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. with characteristic Walker motifs A and B. However, experimental studies concerning this proposed topology (2Skach W.R. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6903-6908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Loo T.W.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9728-9736Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) remain controversial. According to its sequence, P-glycoprotein is classified as a member of a large family of membrane transporters known as the ATP-binding cassette superfamily that includes yeast, bacteria, and mammalian transporters (6Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 7Doige C.A. Ames G.F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 291-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein is proposed to function as an ATP-driven efflux pump, transporting through the plasma membrane an unusually broad but well defined spectrum of structurally unrelated cytotoxic drugs, including the Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and taxanes (8Horio M. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3580-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 9Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev.

A large body of evidence suggests that the transmembrane domains of the P-glycoprotein participate in the recognition of substrates, whereas the ATP hydrolysis necessary for transport is carried out by both NBD regions with a similar efficiency in an alternating fashion (11Loo T.W.

The mechanism of coupling ATP hydrolysis at the two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding sites to drug transport by the intramembrane drug-binding site(s) is likely to involve substantial conformational changes in the P-glycoprotein structure (17Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Different tertiary conformational changes have previously been shown to take place upon addition of MgATP and MgATP-verapamil, an actively transported chemosensitizer (18Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The comprehension of the mechanism of interaction between the drug-binding site(s) and the NBD domains is essential for understanding how P-glycoprotein transports its substrates. The aim of this study was to further investigate the different conformations adopted by the protein in the presence of nucleotide ligands and drugs. Purified P-glycoprotein from CHO cells was reconstituted into lipid vesicles with an “inside-out” orientation, exposing its cytoplasmic region, which contains the NBD domains, to the external medium. The resulting proteoliposomes have previously been shown to exhibit both ATP-dependent drug transport and drug-stimulated ATPase activity (18Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Acrylamide quenching of Trp fluorescence was used to monitor ligand-dependent changes in the accessibility of reconstituted P-glycoprotein in the presence of MgATP, MgATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analog of MgATP, and of five anthracycline antitumor agents (daunorubicin, 4′-epi-doxorubicin, iododoxorubicin, 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin, and FCE) previously used in pharmacokinetics studies on multidrug-resistant and sensitive K562 cells (19Praet M. Stryckmans P. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Three of these agents (iododoxorubicin, 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin, and FCE) have been shown to accumulate within multidrug-resistant cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein and to retain their cytotoxic activity. On the contrary, daunorubicin and 4′-epi-doxorubicin were rejected outside the multidrug-resistant cells. We analyze here how the P-glycoprotein conformational changes are related to the nature of the antitumor agents and, more precisely, to their capacity to accumulate into resistant cells. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDaunorubicin, ATP, ATPγS, octylglucoside, and asolectin were from Sigma. [3H]Azidopin (specific activity of 40 Ci/nmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 4′-epi-doxorubicin, iododoxorubicin, 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin, and FCE were obtained from Pharmacia-Farmitalia (Milan, Italy). Sephadex G-50 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.MethodsP-glycoprotein Reconstitution8 μg of P-glycoprotein (0.3 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Chaps), purified as described previously (20Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added to a dried film of asolectin (protein:lipid ratio of 1:20 w/w) and octylglucoside (lipid:octylglucoside ratio of 1:3 w/w). The mixture was centrifuged at 800 × g for 30 s on a 0.7 × 2-cm column of Sephadex G-50 (fine) equilibrated with 125 mm NaCl and 50 mmTricine-NaOH (pH 7.4). The proteoliposomes were collected in about 60 μl. 50% of the protein was recovered.ATP HydrolysisATP hydrolysis was measured as described by Shapiro and Ling (20Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations (2, 10, and 50 μm) of each anthracycline derivative. Protein determination was performed according to Peterson (21Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Quenching ExperimentsAcrylamide quenching experiments were carried out on a SLM Aminco 8000 fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm instead of 280 nm to reduce the absorbance by acrylamide. Control experiments established that no emission of the anthracycline derivatives occurred at 340 nm if excited at 295 nm (see Ref. 22Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Ferragut J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 937: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar for excitation spectrum, ∼390–540 nm, of daunomycin).

Here we analyzed the in vivo function of p122. Microinjection of the GTPase-activating domain of p122 suppressed the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions induced by lysophosphatidic acid, suggesting a GTPase-activating activity for Rho as in in vitro. Transfection of p122 also induced the disassembly of stress fibers and the morphological rounding of various adherent cells. Analyses using deletion and point mutants demonstrated that the GTPase-activating domain of p122 is responsible for the morphological changes and detachment and that arginine residues at positions 668 and 710 and a lysine residue at position 706 in the GTPase-activating domain are essential. Using Fluo-3-based Ca2+ microscopy, we found that p122 evoked a rapid elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, suggesting that p122 stimulates the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-hydrolyzing activity of phospholipase C δ1. These results demonstrate that p122 synergistically functions as a GTPase-activating protein specific for Rho and an activator of phospholipase C δ1 in vivo and induces morphological changes and detachment through cytoskeletal reorganization.

Recent studies have indicated a close association between the regulation of cytoskeletal assembly and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP2, PI 4,5-bisphosphate; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PLC, phospholipase C; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid. metabolism. That is, a number of PI 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding proteins including gelsolin, cofilin, profilin, and α-actinin are known to bind to actin and regulate cytoskeletal assembly (1Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 2Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 3Yonezawa N.

Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho has been shown to enhance the activity of PI 4-phosphate 5-kinase, the PIP2-synthesizing enzyme (5Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and the overexpression of PI 4-phosphate 5-kinase induces massive actin polymerization in COS-7 cells (6Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7578-7581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Alternatively, microinjection of antibodies against PIP2 inhibits the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (7Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that PIP2newly synthesized by PI 4-phosphate 5-kinase, which exists downstream of Rho, binds to PIP2-binding proteins (i.e.actin-binding protein) to release free G-actins. These reactions increase the intracellular concentrations of free G-actins, resulting in their reorganization to form actin fibers (8Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rho is inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (9Hall A. Cell. 1992; 69: 389-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It is possible that Rho GAPs, as downstream components of Rho, regulate cytoskeletal disassembly. We recently cloned a GAP as a novel molecule that interacts with phospholipase C δ1 (PLCδ1) (13Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to the GAP activity specific for Rho in vitro, p122 possesses the ability to enhance the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLCδ1 in vitro. Therefore, it is possible that p122 is an ideal link between Rho and cytoskeletal disassembly. To address this issue, we tried to isolate cells stably overexpressing p122. However, we have never succeeded in obtaining such cells, suggesting that p122 affects not only cytoskeletal assembly but also other physiological properties such as the ability to attach to the substrate. In this study, we analyze thein vivo functions of p122 by microinjection and transient expression into adherent cultures. The results demonstrate that p122 functions at least as a GAP for Rho and a stimulator of PLCδ1in vivo and phenotypically induces morphological changes including the disappearance of stress fibers and focal adhesions and detachment from the substrate. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cells, and mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and l-glutamine. For microinjection of proteins, 1 × 104 Swiss 3T3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips as described previously (14Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). After 4–7 days, the cells were washed extensively and starved in serum-free culture medium for 24–36 h. Recombinant proteins were microinjected at a concentration of 1 mg/ml along with 10 mg/ml FITC-dextran (average M r 20,000 Sigma) as a marker into the cytoplasm of the quiescent, serum-starved cells. For microinjection of plasmids, 1 × 104 MDCK cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and cultured for 1 day. Various plasmids were microinjected at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml into the nuclei. Microinjection was performed using Eppendorf 5170 micromanipulator and 5246 microinjector (Eppendorf, Germany). For construction of the N- and C-terminal recombinant p122 proteins, p122-N and p122-C, p122 cDNA was mutagenized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to create anNdeI site at the starting ATG and codon 617 using the following primer: 5′-TAtctagaCATATGATCCTAACACAAATTGAAGCC-3′ and 5′-AGCATATGAAAAGGATCAAGGTTCCAG-3′ (the XbaI site is indicated by lowercase letters, and the NdeI site is underlined), respectively. The PCR product encoding amino acid residues 1 to 533 was digested with XbaI and EcoRV, subcloned into the corresponding sites of pBluescript SK (Stratagene, CA) and then sequenced. The plasmid was digested with NdeI and XhoI (which cuts in the multiple cloning sites of pBluescript) and subcloned into theNdeI-XhoI sites of a bacterial expression vector pET-15b (Novagen, WI) to obtain the plasmid p122-N. For construction of the plasmid p122-C, the PCR product encoding amino acid residues 617 to 1083 was digested with NdeI andBamHI (which cuts in the 3′-untranslated segment of p122 cDNA), subcloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET-15b, and then confirmed by sequence analysis. The plasmids were routinely transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS to allow for the expression of (His)6-tagged recombinant p122-N and p122-C proteins (Fig. 1 A). The recombinant proteins were purified with a nickel-bound HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for microinjection. The purified proteins were probed with a 1:1000 dilution of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Qiagen, CA) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (Fig. 1 B). The various p122 constructs are summarized in Fig. 4 A. To express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to p122 in mammalian cells, a 5′XhoI site was introduced into the 5′-flanking sequence of the reading frame by PCR amplification using the primer 5′-AGACTCGAGACCATATGATCCTAACACAAATTGAAGCC-3′ (theXhoI site is underlined) and verified by sequencing. To construct pGFP-WT, the full-length p122 cDNA was digested withXhoI and KpnI (which cuts in the 3′-untranslated segment of p122 cDNA) and then inserted into the corresponding sites of the mammalian expression vector, pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), resulting in a fusion protein with GFP at the N terminus. Deletion derivatives of p122 were generated using the following restriction sites: XhoI andBamHI at positions 1–117 (pGFP-117ΔC), XhoI and EcoRV at positions 1–534 (pGFP-534ΔC),EcoRI and KpnI at positions 798–1083 (pGFP-798ΔN), and SalI and KpnI at positions 949–1083 (pGFP-949ΔN). For construction of pGFP-863ΔC, p122 cDNA was mutagenized by PCR to create a KpnI site at codon 864 using the primer 5′-CCGGTACCTCCAGTGTCAGGGGCTTCAG-3′ (the KpnI site is underlined). The PCR product encoding residues 1 to 863 was digested with XhoI and KpnI and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C1. For construction of pGFP-617ΔN, p122 cDNA was mutagenized by PCR to create aSacI site at codon 617 using the primer 5′-AGGAGCTCATATGAAAAGGATCAAGGTTCCAG-3′ (the SacI site is underlined). The PCR product encoding residues 617 to 1083 was digested with SacI and KpnI and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C1. Nucleotide changes in the p122 cDNA were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChang mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutant primers used to generate pGFP-R668E, pGFP-K706E, pGFP-R710E, and pGFP-N779V were 5′-GGTTGGGCTCTTCGAGAAGTCAGGTGTC-3′, 5′-GCAGACATGTTAGAGCAATATTTCCG-3′, 5′-GCAATATTTCGAGGATCTCCCCGAG-3′, and 5′-CCAGATGACTCCCACCGTCCTGGCTGTGTGC-3′, respectively (base changes are underlined). All mutant cDNA sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells growing on glass coverslips or glass-bottomed dishes were rinsed in PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After washing three times with PBS, actin filaments were stained with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. To visualize focal adhesions, cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of antiphosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), or a 1:100 dilution of anti-vinculin antibody (VIN-11-5, Sigma) for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated for 30 min with a 1:100 dilution of rhodamine B-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (BIOSOURCE, Camalliro, CA). For visualization of myc-tagged Val14-RhoA, monoclonal antibody 9E10 was used as a primary antibody. MDCK cells were loaded with 5 μm fluo-3/AM (Dojindo, Japan) and 0.02% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in a physiological salt solution (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, and 13.8 mm glucose) for 20 min at 37 °C, incubated with the solution for 1 h at 37 °C, and then washed with PBS. The loaded cells were mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope and microinjected with recombinant p122-N or p122-C protein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml into the cytoplasm. Fluorescence images were obtained by excitation at 480 nm using xenon lamps. The emission signal at 520 nm was collected with a cooled charge-coupled device camera, and the digitized signals were stored and analyzed with Merlin digital imaging system (Olympus, Japan). To address the physiological activities of the GAP domain of p122 in signaling pathways specific for Rho in vivo, purified recombinant p122-C proteins encompassing the complete GAP domain (Fig. 1) were microinjected into Swiss 3T3 cells. In agreement with the previous results (14Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar), removal of serum from the culture medium of Swiss 3T3 cells resulted in a reduction of both actin stress fibers and focal adhesions containing phosphotyrosine and vinculin, whereas lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulation restored stress fibers and focal adhesions in the serum-starved cells. Using this system, we examined whether p122-C could inhibit LPA-stimulated changes in actin fiber organization and focal adhesions in vivo. When cells were microinjected with p122-C and then treated with LPA for 10 min, the LPA-induced formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions was completely abolished as compared with uninjected cells (Fig.2, A–F). In contrast, p122-C had no effect on platelet-derived growth factor-induced membrane ruffling, which is mediated by Rac proteins (Fig. 2, G andH). These results indicate that the GAP domain of p122 specifically inhibits LPA-induced Rho activation in vivo, probably by stimulating the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho. To examine the potential functions of whole p122 molecules in mammalian cells in vivo, we constructed an expression vector, pGFP-WT, encoding a GFP fused to full-length p122. The plasmid was introduced into a variety of cell types, Swiss 3T3, MDCK, and BHK21, by liposome-mediated transfection. The p122-GFP fusion products were expressed in these cells and easily identified under fluorescence microscopy. After 24 h, all cells expressing p122 fusion proteins became profoundly rounded, refractile in cell shape, and left beaded dendritic process-like structures (i.e. protrusions) attached to the substrate (Fig. 3). In contrast, cells transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP alone displayed diffuse fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus and exhibited a regular phenotype on morphologic examinations (data not shown). These results indicate that the p122 protein induces morphological rounding not only in fibroblasts but also in other adherent cell types. Next, we constructed expression vectors encoding various p122 deletion mutants (Fig.4 A) and expressed the truncated proteins in BHK21 cells (Fig. 4 B). The expression of pGFP-534ΔC (Fig. 4 B, c), encoding the first 534 amino acids of p122, displayed diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm and did not cause the morphological changes as seen with pGFP-117ΔC (data not shown). The expression of pGFP-798ΔN (Fig.4 B, i) and pGFP-949ΔN (data not shown), encoding part of the C-terminal region of p122, also did not produce the changes. On the other hand, the expression of pGFP-863ΔC and pGFP-617ΔN (Fig. 4 B, e and g) induced morphological rounding and detachment as shown with pGFP-WT (Fig. 4 B, a). These results indicate that the GAP domain of p122 is necessary for the rounding and detachment of these cells. Because these morphological alterations were likely to be accompanied by changes in actin organization, we visualized F-actin fibers by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining. As shown in Fig.4 B, b, stress fibers were absent from cells expressing the p122-GFP fusion protein after 4 h of transfection. The expression of pGFP-863ΔC (Fig. 4 B, f) and pGFP-617ΔN (Fig. 4 B, h) induced the disassembly of stress fibers, whereas the expression of pGFP-534ΔC and pGFP-798ΔN did not affect actin organization (Fig. 4 B,d and j). These observations indicate that the GAP domain of p122 regulates actin organization. To further confirm the specificity of GAP, we used a constitutively active mutant of Rho, V14-RhoA. This mutant V14-RhoA causes a large decrease in intrinsic GTPase activity and is unresponsive to all GAP proteins. Because BHK21 cells are not suitable for nuclear injection of plasmids, we used MDCK cells and examined the effect of V14-RhoA on the morphological changes caused by p122. Microinjection of both pGFP-WT and pEXV-myc-VAL14-RhoA (kindly provided by A. Hall of University College London via S. Narumiya of Kyoto University) into MDCK cells resulted in a flat morphology (Fig. 5,A–C), whereas cells expressing p122 alone was prospectively rounded (Fig. 5, D–F). These results indicate that active V14-RhoA can neutralize the effect of p122 on the morphological changes, suggesting that p122 is a Rho-specific GAP. Crystal structure analyses of p50rhoGAP have suggested that Arg-85 and Asn-194 are important for binding to Rho proteins and enhancing GTPase activity (15Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The positions of these amino acids correspond to Arg-668 and Asn-779 of p122 (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, sequence alignment of the GAP domains of various GAPs reveals conserved lysine and arginine residues. Based of these findings, we replaced Arg-668 with Glu (R668E), Lys-706 with Glu (K706E), Arg-710 with Glu (R710E), or Asn-779 with Val (N779V) (Fig. 6 A) and transfected these mutants independently into BHK21 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, cells expressing of R668E, K706E, or R710E underwent no morphological alterations, whereas cells expressing N779V showed an altered morphology and detachment. Furthermore, no obvious alterations of F-actin organization in R668E, K706E, or R710E-transfected cells as compared with nontransfected cells were detected (Fig. 7 A,b, d, and f). In contrast, overexpression of N779V induced a loss of stress fibers (Fig.7 A, h). These results suggest that arginine residues 668 and 710 and lysine residue 706 of p122 are involved in stimulating the GTPase activity for Rho.Figure 7Effect of p122 mutants on the morphological changes and the organization of actin stress fibers in BHK21 cells. A, cells were transfected with plasmids pGFP-R668E (a and b), pGFP-K706E (cand d), pGFP-R710E (e and f), or pGFP-N779V (g and h). After 24 h, the cells were examined under fluorescence microscopy and photographed using a FITC-compatible filter (a, c, e, andg). In identical cell fields, F-actin was stained with TRITC-phalloidin (b, d, f, andh). The bar represents 20 μm. B, values represent the percentage of cells showing the rounded phenotype among total GFP-positive cells counted. The data were collected in three independent experiments (approximately 300 cells for each transfectant). WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously demonstrated that p122 functions as a specific activator of PLCδ1 but not PLCβ1 and PLCγ1 in vitro (13Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To further investigate the effect of p122 on the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLCδ1 in vivo, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Because Swiss 3T3 or BHK21 cells are not suitable for loading the nonratiometric Ca2+ indicator, fluo-3, we examined Ca2+ signals in MDCK cells microinjected with recombinant p122-N (Fig.8 A, n = 11) or p122-C (Fig. 8 B, n = 6) proteins. Cells showed a brisk elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels in central areas within 20 s after the microinjection with p122-C (Fig. 8 B). The intracellular Ca2+ then decreased to the basal level within 5 min (Fig. 8 C). In contrast, microinjection of p122-N had no effect on this Ca2+response (Fig. 8 A). The expression of PLCδ1 in MDCK cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). These results suggest that the C terminus of p122 encompassing the GAP domain can enhance the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of PLCδ1 in vivo, resulting in the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate generation, which predominantly induces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Here we demonstrated that the overexpression of p122 induces in adherent cells morphological changes and detachment from the substrate. The LPA-induced formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions is suppressed by microinjecting the GAP domain of p122 into cells, whereas platelet-derived growth factor-induced ruffle formation is not affected (Fig. 2). Cell rounding is also detected within 24 h after p122 transfection and the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions is suppressed during the course of these changes. These changes induced by p122 are attenuated by cotransfection with the constitutive active mutant of Rho, V14-RhoA. We previously reported that p122 shows strong GAP activity for RhoA but not for Rac or Cdc42 in vitro(13Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Considering that Rho controls the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions rather than membrane ruffling and filopodia formation, it appears certain that p122 functions as a GAP for Rho in vivo and is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal disassembly. Although stress fibers and focal adhesions have been widely studied in many types of cells, their regulations in vivo are not yet clear. The formation of focal adhesions is considered to be associated with integrin clustering, which is induced by exogenous stimuli such as formylpeptides and aggregation (16Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This clustering is suppressed by a Rho inhibitor, C3 transferase (16Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Stress fibers, in concert with focal adhesions, also regulate cell adhesion and motility. In MDCK cells, scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor stimulates motility and spreading, whereas active Rho inhibits these reactions, presumably by promoting filament assembly and adhesion (17Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reveal that p122 is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through reorganization of cytoskeletal components. In this context, the intracellular mechanisms underlying the regulation and localization of p122 are intriguing. It is thought that GAPs stimulate the GTP hydrolysis of monomeric G proteins by supplying basic amino acid residues to the active center of G proteins, resulting in a stabilization of the increasing negative charge in the center (18Brownbridge G.G. Lowe P.N. Moore K.J.M. Skinner R.H. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10914-10919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Almost all GAPs contain two conserved arginine residues and one conserved lysine residue (Arg-668, Lys-706, and Arg-710 in p122), and mutations in any of these basic residues significantly reduces GAP activity (20Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recently determined crystal structure of RhoA in its GDP-bound form with p50rhoGAP in the presence of AlF4−, which formed a transition-state analogue, suggested that Arg-85 and Asn-194 in p50rhoGAP act to stabilize the transition state of the GTPase reaction (21Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In particular, Arg-85 appears to be important in GAP-activated GTP hydrolysis through interaction with the β-γ bridging oxygen and Gln-63 in RhoA. In addition, Lys-122 and Arg-126 seem to be involved in an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with Asp-65 in RhoA. In this study, we introduce mutations at the putatively indispensable arginine, lysine, and asparagine sites in the GAP domain of p122 (Arg-668, Lys-706, Arg-710, and Asn-779). Replacing any of Arg-668, Lys-706, or Arg-710 with glutamate markedly diminishes the morphological changes and cell detachment caused by p122. These results indicate that residues Arg-668, Lys-706, and Arg-710 are essential for the function of p122 as a Rho-specific GAP in vivo, possibly by stabilizing the transition state of GTP hydrolysis. The importance of a charged residue at Arg-668 is also supported by Mülleret al. (22Müller R.T. Honnert U. Reinhard J. Bähler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). They demonstrated that mutation of arginine to methionine in the GAP domain of myr 5 (Arg-1695) corresponding to Arg-668 of p122 or Arg-85 of p50rhoGAP abolished the GAP activity bothin vitro and in vivo (22Müller R.T. Honnert U. Reinhard J. Bähler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is interesting that changing Asn-779 (equivalent to Asn-194 of p50) to valine does not affect the activity of p122, which is inconsistent with above crystal analysis. Asn-779 may not be essential for the biological activity of p122. In addition to its Rho GAP activity, p122 is able to enhance the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity for PLCδ1 in vitro(13Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Using the Ca2+-sensitive dye fluo-3, we demonstrate in this report that p122-C, but not p122-N, when injected into MDCK cells, leads to an increase in fluo-3 fluorescence. Therefore, the rise in Ca2+ is consistent with the hypothesis that p122 leads to an increase in PLCδ1 activity, leading to increased hydrolysis of PIP2 and the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which induces Ca2+ release (Fig. 8) (23Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 24Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In addition, it is also possible that the hydrolysis of PIP2 is enhanced by active PLCδ1, resulting in the release of actin-binding proteins from the membrane or PIP2 micelles. Free actin-binding proteins bind to G-actins, a process that accelerates the disassembly of actin fibers. These sequential reactions are quite similar to those induced by Rho GAPs. It is conceivable that the PLCδ1-enhancing activity of p122 acts synergistically with its GAP activity in causing the morphological changes and detachment. In fact, Tribioli et al. (25Tribioli C. Droetto S. Bione S. Cesareni G. Torrisi M.R. Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Toniolo D. Pelicci P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) previously reported that overexpression of p115, which is a protein with characteristics of a RhoGAP predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, in fibroblasts inhibited stress fiber formation but did not induce morphological changes. Furthermore, myr 5 required more than 40 h after transfection to induce a loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions concomitant with cell rounding (22Müller R.T. Honnert U. Reinhard J. Bähler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as compared with our results that p122 induces these alterations within 4 h (Fig. 4 B, a and b). Further careful studies using various mutants are required to assess the exact contribution of the PLCδ1-enhancing part of p122 on these changes. We thank Dr. A.

Cytochrome P450s have been the subject of intense investigation by toxicologists and pharmacologists over the past 4 decades because they catalyze the oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive metabolism of a wide variety of drugs, industrial chemicals, environmental pollutants, and carcinogens (1Nelson D.R.

Together, these findings suggest that the renal P450 arachidonic acid monooxygenases may be important in controlling blood pressure and body fluid volume/composition and may be part of an adaptive response of the kidney to excess dietary salt intake (6McGiff J.C.

Despite considerable investigations into the physiological aspects of the renal epoxygenase pathway, little is known with regard to the biochemical and molecular properties of the renal P450 enzyme(s) active in the biosynthesis of the EETs. A member of the CYP2C subfamily was purified from rabbit kidney and shown to catalyze arachidonic acid epoxidation and ω/ω-1 hydroxylation (33Laethem R.M. Laethem C.L. Koop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunochemical studies suggested that CYP2C isoforms were responsible for some of the arachidonic acid epoxygenase activity present in rat and rabbit kidney microsomal fractions (27Capdevila J.H.

Ther. 1993; 267: 1012-1016PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that CYP2C23 was highly expressed in rat kidney and active in the regio- and stereoselective epoxidation of arachidonic acid (34Karara A. Makita K. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Guengerich F.P. DuBois R.N. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13565-13570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Imaoka S. Wedlund P.J. Ogawa H.

CYP2C8, cloned from a human kidney cDNA library, was also an active arachidonic acid epoxygenase; however, this P450 was expressed at relatively low levels in human kidney (36Zeldin D.C. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 37Zeldin D.C. Moomaw C.R. Jesse N. Tomer K.B. Beetham J. Hammock B.D. Wu S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). More recently, our laboratory identified a human P450 of the CYP2J subfamily that was highly expressed in a number of extrahepatic tissues including the kidney and active in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to EETs (38Wu S. Moomaw C.R. Tomer K.B. Falck J.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3460-3468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, studies on the regulation, importance, and functional role of this new human P450 epoxygenase in the kidney have not been possible because of the limited availability of fresh, histologically normal and abnormal human kidney tissues. Herein, we report the cDNA cloning and heterologous expression of CYP2J5, a new mouse P450 that is abundant in the kidney and active in the epoxidation and midchain hydroxylation of arachidonic acid. We show that this heme-thiolate protein is regulated during development and in a tissue-specific fashion. We further demonstrate, using immunohistochemical techniques and in situ hybridization, that CYP2J5 mRNA and protein are localized to sites within the nephron where the EETs are known to affect fluid/electrolyte transport and mediate hormonal action. [α-32P]dATP and [1-14C]arachidonic acid were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). PCR reagents including AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase were purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Triphenylphosphine, α-bromo-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorotoluene,N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N,N-dimethylformamide, and diazald were purchased from Aldrich. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. An oligo(dT)-primed Lambda ZAP B6/CBAF1J male mouse liver cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with the 1.8-kb CYP2J3 cDNA probe under conditions identical to those described previously (14Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12551-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 duplicate positive clones were identified, of which 21, selected at random, were plaque-purified and rescued into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). Plasmid DNAs were isolated using a Qiagen Plasmid Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and insert sizes were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis after EcoRI digestion. The pBluescript cDNA inserts were partially sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and T3/T7 oligonucleotide primers. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by searching GenBankTMand EMBL data bases utilizing GCG software (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Sixteen of the duplicate positive clones contained sequences that were identical and shared homology with several human and rodent CYP2 family P450s (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J.

One of these clones (clone JM-6) 2The new sequence that is reported in this paper was submitted to the Committee on Standardized Cytochrome P450 Nomenclature and has been designated CYP2J5. was completely sequenced utilizing a total of 16 oligonucleotide primers (21–25 nucleotides, each) that spanned the entire length of the sense and antisense cDNA strands. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described (14Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12551-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the protein encoded by the cloned 1.886-kb JM-6 cDNA insert (CYP2J5) with CYPOR in Sf9 insect cells was accomplished with the pAcUW51-CYPOR shuttle vector (kindly provided by Dr. Cosette Serabjit-Singh, Glaxo Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) and the BaculoGold Baculovirus Expression System (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) using methods similar to those previously described (14Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol.

The CYP2J5 cDNA (nucleotides 42–1886) including the entire coding region was ligated into a slightly modified pAcUW51-CYPOR vector, and the orientation and identity of the resulting expression vector (pAcUW51-CYPOR-CYP2J5) were confirmed by sequence analysis. In this construct, the expression of CYPOR was controlled by the p10 promoter, whereas the expression of CYP2J5 was independently controlled by the polyhedrin promoter. Cultured Sf9 cells were co-transfected with the pAcUw51-CYPOR-CYP2J5 vector and linear wild-type BaculoGold viral DNA, and recombinant viruses were purified as described (14Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12551-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cultured Sf9 cells grown in spinner flasks at a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/ml were then infected with high titer CYP2J5-CYPOR recombinant baculovirus stock in the presence of δ-aminolevulinic acid and iron citrate (100 μm each). Cells co-expressing recombinant CYP2J5 and CYPOR were harvested 72 h after infection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and were used to prepare microsomal fractions by differential centrifugation at 4 °C as described previously (12Zeldin D.C. Plitman J.D. Kobayashi J. Miller R.F. Snapper J.R. Falck J.R. Szarek J.L. Philpot R.M. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). P450 content was determined spectrally according to the method of Omura and Sato (40Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu UV-3000 dual-wavelength/double-beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). CYP2J5 protein was also expressed without CYPOR in Sf9 cells using the pBlueBacIV expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Sf9 cells expressing recombinant CYPOR but not P450 were prepared as described (39Lee C. Kadwell S.H. Kost T.A. Serabjit-Singh C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 0.05 mTris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.15 m KCl, 0.01 mMgCl2, 8 mm sodium isocitrate, 0.5 IU/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase, 0.1–0.2 mg of CYP2J5-CYPOR-transfected Sf9 cell microsomal protein/ml, and [1-14C]arachidonic acid (25–55 μCi/μmol; 100 μm, final concentration) were constantly stirred at 37 °C. After temperature equilibration, NADPH (1 mm, final concentration) was added to initiate the reaction. At different time points, aliquots were withdrawn, and the reaction products were extracted and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described (41Zeldin D.C. Foley J. Goldsworthy S.M. Cook M.E. Boyle J.E. Ma J. Moomaw C.R. Tomer K.B. Steenbergen C. Wu S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Products were identified by comparing their reverse- and normal-phase HPLC properties with those of authentic standards and by GC/MS (42Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A.

Commun. 1986; 141: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For kinetic experiments, arachidonic acid concentrations were varied from 5 to 100 μm, and reactions were only allowed to proceed for 2–3 min to ensure that the quantitative assessment of the rates of product formation reflected initial rates. For chiral analysis, the EETs were collected from the HPLC eluent, derivatized, and resolved into the corresponding antipodes by chiral-phase HPLC as described previously (44Capdevila J.H. Dishman E.

Control studies were performed by incubating uninfected Sf9 cell microsomes and baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell microsomes expressing recombinant CYPOR but containing no spectrally evident P450 with arachidonic acid under identical conditions. Methods used to quantify endogenous EETs present in mouse kidney were similar to those used to quantify EETs in rat liver and heart (14Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J.

Normal mouse tissues were obtained from adult male C57BL/6J mice fed NIH 31 rodent chow (Agway, St. Mary, OH) ad libitum and sacrificed by lethal CO2 inhalation. RNA was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate/cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation method as described previously (47Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA (25 μg) prepared from mouse testes, small intestine, muscle, lung, liver, kidney, heart, colon, and brain was denatured and electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. After capillary pressure transfer to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the blots were hybridized with either the cloned 1.886-kb JM-6 cDNA insert or with the following JM-6 sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (5′-TCAAAAACATAATCATATTTGGGATCCTTGCACAC-3′, complementary to nucleotides 23–57 of the JM-6 cDNA). With the cDNA probe, hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide containing 0.7 m NaCl, 70 mm sodium citrate, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 0.1 mg of heatdenatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. With the oligonucleotide probe, hybridizations were performed at 50 °C in 10% formamide containing 0.9m NaCl, 90 mm sodium citrate, 2× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 0.1 mg of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. The double-stranded cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by nick translation usingEscherichia coli polymerase I. The oligonucleotide probe was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Northern blot results were confirmed by PCR amplification of reversetranscribed mouse RNAs using the GeneAmp® RNA PCR Kit (Perkin-Elmer). The following JM-6 sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used: forward primer, 5′-ATCAGAGAAGCGAAAAGAATGTAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1549–1572 of the JM-6 cDNA; reverse primer, 5′-CCATTTCCTCTGATTCTGACTCAT-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1810–1833 of the JM-6 cDNA. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of total RNA in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 1 mm each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and dCTP, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. The PCR amplifications were performed in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 μmforward and reverse primers, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase. Following an initial incubation for 105 s at 95 °C, samples were subjected to 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 62 °C.

In the heart, it reduces rate and force of contraction and preconditions the heart against injury by prolonged ischemia. Based on indirect kinetic arguments, an AMP-selective cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase designated cN-I has been implicated in adenosine formation during ATP breakdown. The molecular identity of cN-I is unknown, although an IMP/GMP-selective cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase (cN-II) and an ecto-5′-nucleotidase (e-N) have been cloned. We utilized the high abundance of cN-I in pigeon heart to purify a 40-kDa subunit for partial protein sequencing and subsequent cDNA cloning. We obtained a full-length clone encoding a novel 40-kDa peptide, unrelated to cN-II or e-N, that was most abundant in heart, brain, and breast muscle. Immunolocalization in heart showed a striated cytoplasmic location, suggesting association with contractile elements. Transient expression in COS-7 cells, generated a 5′-nucleotidase that catalyzed adenosine formation from AMP, which was increased during ATP catabolism. In conclusion, the cloning and expression of cN-I provides definitive evidence of its ability to produce adenosine during ATP breakdown.

Despite their importance, the mechanisms responsible for cytosolic AMP breakdown to adenosine have been based until now solely on indirect kinetic arguments. These have led to the conclusion that an IMP-preferring cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase, cN-II, abundant in the liver, probably plays a minor role in adenosine formation, especially in tissues such as heart that have an active AMP deaminase (12Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. Imai S. Nakazawa M. Role of Adenosine and Adenine Nucleotides in the Biological System. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1991: 289-300Google Scholar). An AMP preferring enzyme, cN-I, has been purified from pigeon, rabbit, rat, dog, and human hearts (13Truong V.L. Collinson A.R. Lowenstein J.M. Biochem.

Circulation. 1996; 94: 722Google Scholar), are more consistent with a role in adenosine formation. However, the high apparent K m for the enzyme of 5 mm (obtained at the optimum pH and with ADP concentrations above 50 μm) has cast doubt on its ability to generate adenosine under the conditions of the cell. Indeed, the capacity of any cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase to generate adenosine in intact cells has not previously been tested directly. The primary purpose of the present experiments was therefore to clone cN-I. Furthermore, we sought to obtain the first definitive evidence that a cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase was capable of catabolizing cytosolic AMP to adenosine under the conditions present within cells, particularly after metabolic poisoning to induce ATP breakdown.RESULTSWe took advantage of the high abundance of cN-I in pigeon heart to purify the enzyme using a published method (14Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The product yielded a major 40-kDa subunit on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (results not shown). The band was excised and digested with trypsin, peptides were separated by hplc, and four partial N-terminal sequences were obtained (19Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Gillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) (underlined in Fig.1). One sequence (doubly underlined in Fig. 1) was used to design degenerate oligonucleotide antisense primers. Touchdown PCR (20Hecker K.H. Roux K.H. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) was then performed on a pigeon heart cDNA library in λZap using the T3 promoter sequence as the sense primer. The resulting PCR product (178 base pairs) was used to screen the library and 10 clones were obtained. The clone with the longest insert (1710 base pairs) was sequenced in both directions to yield the sequence shown in Fig. 1. The clone contains an open reading frame that codes for a peptide of 358 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 39472 Da. The sequence contains not only that used to generate oligonucleotides for PCR but also each of the three other peptide sequences; all four were preceded, as expected, by a lysine residue. The protein sequence displays no homology (>20% overall) to any other in the Swissprot, PIR, translated EMBL, and GenBankTM data bases. A potential nuclear localization signal was recognized using the program PSORT (Fig. 1). Interestingly, there is no homology to the previously published human and bovine sequences of cN-II (27Oka J. Matsumoto A. Husokawa Y. Inoue S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Allegrini S. Pesi R. Tozzi M.G. Fiol C.J. Johnson R.B. Eriksson S.

Biochem. 1993; 113: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore reached the surprising conclusion that cN-I is a novel protein, unrelated to cN-II or e-N. The clone did, however, contain a sequence (amino acids 253–336) with 79% identity to a translated human testis expressed sequence tag (accession numberAA446194), implying this EST might code for a human cN-I.The cDNA subcloned into pTargeT for expression in COS-7 cells directed expression of 5′-nucleotidase activity measured under conditions previously shown to be optimal for the detection of pigeon heart cN-I (22Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Activities were 0.23 ± 0.02 μmol·min−1·mg protein−1, which compared with activities of 0.004 ± 0.001 in untransfected cells. Parallel experiments using a plasmid encoding active β-galactosidase indicated that more than 30% of COS-7 cells were transfected under these conditions. The activity in transfected COS-7 cells was approximately 14-fold that previously reported in pigeon heart (14Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 5′-nucleotidase activity had properties similar to published values from pigeon heart (Table I). In particular, the cloned enzyme had a K m (measured at pH 7.0 and with greater than 50 μm ADP) similar to that of the pigeon heart cN-I and had a similar absolute requirement for adenine nucleotides as an activator. The enzyme had a preference for AMP over IMP and was only weakly inhibited by isobutylthioadenosine, which distinguishes it from cN-II. Like purified cN-I, it was inhibited by p-nitrophenyl and also by 2′,3′ dideoxycytidine, dideoxythymidine, and dideoxyuridine, which have recently been shown to be potent and selective inhibitors of cN-I but not cN-II from rabbit heart (30Garvey E.P.

Open table in a new tab Incubation of cells with inhibitors of adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase was used to measure rates of adenosine formation from intact COS-7 cells (Fig. 2). Incubation with 2-deoxy-d-glucose and carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl-hydrazone was used to accelerate ATP catabolism. The effects of cN-I and β-galactosidase transfection (as a control for the effects of transfection per se) were compared with untransfected cells. In untransfected cells, the sum of ATP + ADP + AMP + adenosine was 107 ± 9 nmol/mg protein (n= 6). Purine metabolite concentrations remained unchanged during a control incubation for 5 min in the presence of inhibitors of adenosine metabolism (Fig. 2). Metabolic poisoning led to a 91 ± 1% fall in ATP concentration in 5 min, 85 ± 3% of which was accounted for by increased AMP concentration and 4 ± 1% of which was accounted for by increased adenosine concentration. IMP inosine and hypoxanthine concentrations remained undetectable (data not shown). These results indicate that flux through endogenous 5′-nucleotidase and AMP deaminase was low under these conditions. Cells transfected with the control β-galactosidase encoding plasmid had a similar initial total adenine metabolite (ATP + ADP + AMP + adenosine) concentration (103 ± 20 nmol/mg, n = 4). However, in contrast to untransfected cells, they showed a significant fall in ATP concentration (p < 0.05) and rise in AMP concentration (p < 0.01) over 5 min of control incubation (Fig. 2). This adverse effect of transfection did not result in any increase in adenosine concentration (Fig. 2). After incubation with metabolic poisons ATP concentration fell to levels similar to those in untransfected cells. Of the fall in ATP concentration, 99 ± 2% was accounted for by increased AMP concentration and 4 ± 1% was accounted for by increased adenosine concentration (Fig. 2), similar to values in untransfected cells. Cells transfected with the cN-I plasmid had a significantly lower initial total adenine metabolite concentration (64 ± 7 nmol/mg, n = 6) compared with untransfected cells (p < 0.05). However, when values were normalized (Fig. 2), they showed the same percentage fall in ATP concentrations during incubation without metabolic poisons as the cells transfected with β-galactosidase. In contrast to the β-galactosidase-transfected cells, there was no increase in AMP concentrations, but instead adenosine concentrations rose significantly (p < 0.02). These data show that there was basal flux through cN-I under these conditions. After metabolic poisoning of cN-I-transfected cells, ATP concentrations fell to a similar extent as in untransfected or β-galactosidase-transfected cells. However, only 60 ± 6% of the fall in ATP concentration was accounted for by increased AMP concentration, whereas 39 ± 3% was accounted for by increased adenosine concentration (both p < 0.001versus either untransfected or β-galactosidase-expressing control cells). From these data it is clear that AMP was stoichiometrically converted to adenosine in cN-I-transfected cells. Metabolic poisons clearly increased adenosine formation by 2.6-fold (Fig. 2).To control for possible effects on cell viability, we measured release of LDH under the various experimental conditions. Untransfected cells released 0.3 ± 0.2 and 1.3 ± 0.7% of LDH during incubation without and with metabolic poisons (n = 4). Cells transfected with β-galactosidase or cN-I released similarly increased levels of LDH (1.5 ± 1.3 and 2.6 ± 1.6%, respectively, without and 2.5 ± 1.7 and 4.6 ± 1.6%, respectively, with metabolic poisons). These increases in LDH release are consistent with the evidence from measurements of ATP and AMP concentrations that transfection per se causes metabolic stress. However, the effects on LDH release were small compared with the rises in adenosine in cN-I-expressing cells, which implies that most adenosine formation occurred inside intact cells. Further data were obtained against the possibility that released AMP metabolized by e-N accounted for the rises in adenosine formation. The selective e-N inhibitor, α,β-methylene-ADP (50 μm), did not decrease the percentage of ATP converted to adenosine in two separate batches of metabolically poisoned, cN-I-expressing cells (28 or 56% without α,β-methylene-ADP versus 41 or 61% with α,β-methylene-ADP).The distribution of cN-I was investigated by reverse transcriptase-PCR (not shown) and Northern blotting (Fig.3). Reverse transcriptase-PCR products of the correct size were obtained from all the pigeon tissues tested, albeit at trace levels in aorta, liver, and kidney. Products were most abundant in heart, brain, and skeletal (breast) muscle. These results were corroborated by Northern analysis (Fig. 3), in which a single 2.3-kilobase transcript was prominent in heart, brain, and breast muscle.Figure 3Distribution of cN-I mRNA in various pigeon tissues by Northern blot analysis.

Husokawa Y. Inoue S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Allegrini S. Pesi R. Tozzi M.G. Fiol C.J. Johnson R.B. Eriksson S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and an ecto-5′-nucleotidase (e-N) (9Misumi Y. Ogata S. Hirose S. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2178-2183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been previously cloned. One of the most surprising conclusions of our study is that the sequence of cN-I bears no similarity to cN-II. Interestingly e-N is related neither to cN-I nor to cN-II. Presumably the potent, selective activation of cN-I, the less potent and less selective activation of cN-II, and inhibition of e-N by ADP represent cases of convergent evolution. The only recognizable structural motif in cN-I was a putative nuclear localization signal, and this proved to be inactive, as indicated by immunocytochemistry. Indeed, cN-I was confirmed to be cytoplasmic, in agreement with a previous study (31Darvish A. Postlewaite J.J. Metting P.J. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 906-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results imply association with the contractile apparatus, as has been suggested previously from subcellular fractionation studies. These experiments (22Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that the addition of KCl to buffers used for homogenization led to a redistribution of cN-I from the particulate to the soluble fraction, implying a loose interaction with contractile elements. This association may provide a mechanism for sensing local AMP concentrations in the region of the contractile proteins. Our results showed that cN-I is abundant in oxidative muscles (heart and breast muscle) and also in brain.Adenosine production from endogenous pathways amounted to 4% of ATP breakdown in untransfected cells. We therefore had to obtain expression of recombinant cN-I in a substantial proportion of cells to exceed this background. We achieved this by liposome-mediated transfection and used transfection with the irrelevant gene, β-galactosidase, as a control. Our results demonstrate that transfection per se caused metabolic stress, as evidenced by increased AMP concentrations under basal conditions. Given this, it was not surprising that when we inhibited adenosine metabolism, we demonstrated substantial adenosine formation in cN-I-transfected cells, even in the absence of metabolic poisons. However, flux through the enzyme was clearly elevated during ATP catabolism, consistent with the role proposed for cN-I in catalyzing the cytoprotective actions of adenosine. Interestingly, overexpression of cN-I also caused a long term decline in total adenine nucleotide concentrations in the absence of inhibitors of adenosine metabolism. It will be interesting to investigate in future experiments whether decreasing cN-I activity causes a corresponding increase in the total adenine nucleotide pool.In conclusion, the aims of this study were to clone cN-I and provide definite evidence for its role in ATP catabolism and adenosine formation. Our results clearly demonstrate that we have achieved these two aims. The formation of adenosine during net catabolism of cytosolic ATP has been proposed to function as a signal of metabolic stress that brings about appropriate retaliatory actions against the conditions leading to stress (1Newby A.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 42-44Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 2Newby A.C. Worku Y. Meghji P. Nakazawa M. Skladanowski A.C. News Physiol. Sci. 1990; 5: 67-70Google Scholar). The actions of adenosine include A1 receptor-mediated opening of K+ channels leading to decreased stimulatory neurone firing and hyperpolarization of postsynaptic cells and antagonism of the effects of catecholamines on adenylate cyclase (3Schrader J. Circulation. 1990; 81: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). A2A receptor-mediated effects include vasodilatation leading to the increased delivery of substrates and oxygen to underperfused tissues (4Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 5Olsson R.A. Pearson J.D. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 761-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In the heart, these mechanisms lead to a spectrum of responses including decreased heart rate, slower atrioventricular conduction, decreased force of contraction, and increased blood flow, all of which tend to reverse an imbalance between ATP formation and utilization (3Schrader J. Circulation. 1990; 81: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Berne R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1964; 44: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Adenosine, acting through A1 or A3 receptors, also appears to play a role in ischemic preconditioning, a process by which brief ischemia can protect the heart against a subsequent longer period of infarction (4Ralevic V.

Mutations cause genomic instability and gene dysfunction, many of which affect cell growth and lead to tumorigenesis. Fortunately, in normal cells, mutation rate is low due to the existence of different DNA repair systems such as mismatch, excision, and recombinational DNA repair pathways. In humans, DNA mutation accumulation is a critical step in carcinogenesis. Dysfunctional mutations of DNA mismatch repair genes such as MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2, are the main cause of the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (1Fishel R. Lescoe M.K. Rao M.R. Copeland N.G.

DNA fragments containing a lesion are removed by the combined efforts of a helicase and a nuclease. For instance, in the DNA mismatch repair of E. coli, exonucleases, exo I (3′-5′ excision) and exo VII or Rec J (5′-3′ excision) are responsible for the bi-directional removal of DNA fragments containing mismatched lesions (18Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 19Modrich P. Science. 1994; 266: 1959-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). For DNA recombination or repair of double strand DNA breaks through recombination, an important step is to generate a 3′ single-stranded terminus for strand invasion. This step is accomplished by 5′-3′ exonucleases (20Maryon M. Carroll D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4862-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N.

During DNA replication the removal of RNA primers in the lagging strand also requires 5′-3′ nuclease activity (23Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In E. coli and other bacteria, the removal of RNA primers is performed by the 5′-3′ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I (24Konrad E.B. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The polA ex1 mutant, defective in 5′-3′ exonuclease activity, exhibits retarded joining of nascent DNA fragments. In eukaryotes, DNA polymerases lack an intrinsic 5′-nuclease. Removal of RNA primers is carried out by an independent enzyme, Rad27/FEN-1 nuclease, with both flap endonuclease and 5′-3′exonuclease activities (28Lieber M.R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3014-3023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the messenger RNA level and enzyme activity were dramatically induced during meiosis in S. pombe (44Szankasi P.

In D. melanogaster, the gene is specifically expressed in the early embryogenesis and female germline (46Digilio F.A. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. Furia M. Polito L.C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiaeand human exonucleases 1 interact with mismatch repair protein Msh2 as demonstrated by the two-hybrid system and immuno-coprecipitation (48Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P.

Disruption of EXO1 increased mutation rate in bothS. pombe and S. cerevisiae cells, indicating thatEXO1 is a mutator gene (45Szankasi P. Smith G.R. Science. 1995; 267: 1166-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 48Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7487-7492Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the mutational spectrum of the exo1Δ cells suggested a role for the encoded protein in mismatch correction, most likely during homologous recombination. In addition, deletion of yEXO1significantly decreased both meiotic and mitotic recombination rates (45Szankasi P. Smith G.R. Science. 1995; 267: 1166-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 47Fiorentini P. Huang K.N. Tishkoff D.X. Kolodner R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 7487-7492Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). One speculation is that the nuclease plays a role creating 3′ single-stranded complementary tails, thereby promoting joint molecule formation. Moreover, the null mutant displays a minor UV sensitivity unlikely due to a nucleotide excision repair deficiency but may be due to a defective DNA replication by-pass pathway (51Qiu J. Guan M.X. Bailis A.M. Shen B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3077-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the Exo1 homologs function as 5′-3′ exonucleases in mutation prevention via multiple DNA metabolic pathways. More recently, human homolog of the exonuclease 1 has been identified and the gene was named HEX1 (52Wilson III, D.M. Carney J.P. Coleman M.A. Adamson A.W. Christensen M. Lamerdin J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3762-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is specifically expressed in fetal liver and adult bone marrow, suggesting that the enzyme may operate prominently in processes specific to hemopoietic stem cell development. The gene has been mapped to 1q43, a region lost in some cases of acute leukemia and in several solid tumors (49Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar, 52Wilson III, D.M. Carney J.P. Coleman M.A. Adamson A.W. Christensen M. Lamerdin J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3762-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Human and S. cerevisiae exonuclease sequences have high similarity. This similarity leads us to predict that functions of these two enzymes are also similar and the human gene may complement the Exo1 functions in yeast. In addition, when Szankasi and Smith (45Szankasi P. Smith G.R. Science. 1995; 267: 1166-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) identified the S. pombe gene (SpEXO1), they noticed that the encoded protein displays significant similarity to the proteins of rad13 (XPG/Rad2) and rad2 (FEN-1/Rad27) nuclease families. However, the similarities were limited to regions of N-terminal putative nuclease domains and the major part at C terminus was largely divergent (45Szankasi P. Smith G.R. Science. 1995; 267: 1166-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the human exonuclease 1 may further complement the Rad27 nuclease functions in RNA primer removal during lagging strand DNA synthesis based on the observations of the sequence conservation between these two proteins, their enzymological properties, and phenotypical characteristics (i.e.conditional lethality) of the rad27 null mutants. Our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that the human exonuclease can functionally complement the yeast homologues (yExo 1 and yRad27) in recombination, UV resistance, RNA primer removal during the Okazaki fragment processing, and mutation avoidance. A cDNA clone (number 843301) harboring a putative human exonuclease 1 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized in the City of Hope Cancer Center core facility. The vector pET-28a and E. coli strains BL21 and BL21 (DE3) were from Novagen (Madison, WI) and E. coli strain XL2 blue and pBSK vector were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Yeast expression vector pDB20 was a gift from D. Becker, California Institute of Technology. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Yeast culture media including YPD, synthetic complete (SC), minimal sporulation, and synthetic dextrose minimal (SD) media were prepared according to Sherman et al. (53Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Habor, NY1986Google Scholar). Amino acids and all other medium components and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). All of the yeast strains constructed and used in this study are listed in TableI. For construction of theEXO1 null mutant strain, the EXO1 gene was amplified by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). using primers with HindIII and NcoI sites (exolpl (AGAAAGCCATGGGTATCCAAGGT) and exolp2 (CTCCGAAAGCTTTCAGTGATGATGGTGGTGGTGTTTACCTTTATAAACAAATTGGGAA) and cloned into the vector pET-28b (Novagen). The marker gene URA3 was obtained from plasmid YEp24 and inserted into PstI sites, replacing the EXO1 coding sequence between positions 170 and 828. The fragment containing theexo1::URA3 construct was removed from the plasmid with restriction enzymes XbaI andNotI. The exo1::URA3 fragment was then transformed into yeast strains W1021-7c and W1089-6c (Table I). Ura3+ transformants were analyzed by PCR using primers exolp3 (CGAACAAACTGAAAGGCGTAG) and exolp4 (GTCTTGAGGCATTTCGACGAG) and Southern blotting to verify disruption of EXO1. Theexo1 rad51 double mutant was obtained by crossingexo1 (FDAB15D) with rad51 (U687, a gift from Adam Bailis, City of Hope). RAD27 gene was deleted by transforming the wild type strains W1021-7c and W1089-6c with a PCR-generated DNA fragment. The PCR product was generated using YEp13 containing LEU2 marker gene as a template and two primers KNRTH1 (CATCGATGAAAAGCGTTGACAGCATACATTGGAAAGAAATAGGAAACGGACACCGGAAGTTAACTGTGGGAATACTCA) and KNRTH2 (AGCTGTTCCTTTGTCTTAGGCACCACTTGGAAGAACCCATCTAACCTACCCTGACTACGTCGTAAGGCCGTTT )(underlined sequences were designed to amplify LEU2 marker gene, the remaining sequences are from RAD27). Another pair of the primers was used to confirm the deletion of RAD27gene by PCR: RAD27F (AAACGCGACGCGTAACATCG) and RAD27R (ATATGCCAAGGTGAAGGACC). Null mutant strains of RAD51 andRAD51/EXO1 were from laboratory stock (51Qiu J. Guan M.X. Bailis A.M. Shen B.

Two vectors, pDB20 and pRS314, were used for the expression ofEXO1 in S. cerevisiae. pDB20 is a URA3and ADH1 promoter-based yeast expression vector. Two plasmids, PDB-ScE and PDB-hE, were constructed to expressSc- and h- exonuclease 1 in S. cerevisiae. PDB-ScE has an insertion of S. cerevisiae EXO1(ScEXO1) at the HindIII site of pDB20 while PDB-hE has an insertion of human EXO1 (hEXO1) at the NotI site of pDB20. pRS314 is a yeast subclone vector using TRP 1 as a selection marker. PRS-ScE and PRS-hE were constructed to complement the exonuclease 1 function in therad27::URA3 background. PRS-ScE has an insertion of Padh-ScEXO1-Tadh (Padh, ADH 1 promoter; Tadh, ADH1 terminator) at SacI and ApaI sites. PRS-hE has an insertion of Padh-hEXO1-Tadh at BamHI site. The plasmids were transformed into different S. cerevisiaestrains for exonuclease 1 functional complementation as listed in TableI. Full-length humanEXO1 coding sequence was subcloned into pET-28a vector (Novagen) using the cDNA clone harboring hEXO1 and PCR primers 5exo1 and 3exo1 containing NheI and SalI sites (5exo1, GACTGTGCTAGCATGGGGATACAGGGATTG and 3exo1, TGTCACTGTCGACAATCCAAAGTTTTTCCAG), respectively, yielding pET-HEX. Both pET-28a and pET-HEX were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen). Colonies were inoculated into 50 ml of LB broth supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and cultured overnight. The culture was pelleted and transferred in 4 × 1-liter of sorbitol medium (54Blackwell J.R. Horgan R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown at 37 °C to OD 0.6 followed by induction at 25 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h. The cells were harvested and stored at −80 °C until use. All of the purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells was thawed in a mixture of ice and water and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.9, 0.5 NaCl) with 10 mm imidazole. Cells were sonicated and the lysate was then centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 45 min to remove cell debris. A 5-ml HiTrap Chelating Ni2+ column was equilibrated with buffer A using Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system (Pharmacia). After loading, the column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A with 10 mm imidazole, 25 ml of buffer A with 60 mmimidazole, and then eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient from 60 to 500 mm imidazole in buffer A at 2 ml/min. The fractions were run on the 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to visualize the purity of protein. Buffers of the fractions were exchanged to 10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, pH 8.0, by HiTrap desalting column (Pharmacia). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. To prepare substrates for ribonuclease activity assays, an upstream primer (5′-TTTTATAACTCGGAGAGCCGTAATG-3′, the bold nucleotides are the 5′ single-stranded portion of exonuclease 1 substrates) and a 5′-labeled 21-ribonucleotide/30-deoxyribonucleotide junction oligo (5′-gggaacaaaagcuugcaugccTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA-3′, the lowercase indicates the ribonucleotides) were annealed to the 76-mer template (5′-TTTTTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTTTGTTCCCCATTACGGCTCTCCGAGTTAT-3′) resulting in a Okazaki fragment-like substrate (ribo-substrate-1). To test the ability of human exonuclease 1 in removal of the last ribonucleotide attached to DNA, 5′-labeled mono-ribonucleotide/30-deoxynucleotide junction oligo (5′cTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA-3′) were annealed to a 55-mer complementary strand (5′-TTTTTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGTAGACGTCTGACACAGCCGT-3′) to form a nicked duplex substrate (ribo-substrate-2). An upstream primer (5′-TTTTACGGCTGTGTCAGACGTCTA-3′) has also been added to the above substrate (ribo-substrate-2) to form the ribo-substrate-3. Furthermore, a 5′ end-labeled oligo (5′-ACGGCTGTGTCAGACGTCTACTGAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTA-3′) was annealed to the template strand of the ribo-substrate-2 to form blunt end double-stranded DNA as a substrate for a 5′ DNA exonuclease activity assay. Based on the property that hExo 1 has a negligible activity on a single-stranded DNA, all unlabeled 5′ ends of the substrates have four additional nucleotides to form the single-stranded ends and block the enzyme activity. The ribonuclease reactions were performed as described previously (55Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2244-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, a standard reaction mixture contained 0.8 pmol of [γ-32P]nucleic acid substrate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 ng of enzyme in 13 μl and were incubated at 33 °C for 30 min. The labeled substrates were prepared in a concentration ratio of 1 labeled oligonucleotide to 103-106 unlabeled oligonucleotide. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), mixed, boiled for 3 min, and cooled in ice. 3 μl of each reaction product was run on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed to Kodak x-ray film for an image. For time-dependent kinetic analysis, the cleavage reaction was stopped in different time points. The products were resolved on a denaturing gel. Quantification of the band intensities was done with a PhosphorImager (Stratagene, CA) and the computer program IPLab Gel assay (Signal Analytics, VA). The recombination assay was based on a construct of URA3 gene flanked at both ends by the same DNA fragment (413 bp) from the HIS3 gene direct repeats (see Fig. 2 and Ref. 56Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Genetics. 1989; 123: 725-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construct was inserted into theHIS3 gene in the wild type S. cerevisiae cells. These cells were hybridized with exo1 or rad27null mutants. They were then sporulated and dissected to produce the exo1 or rad27 null mutant strains with the assay construct. The strains were cultured in the SD-URA medium to saturation. They were then plated onto histidine minus SD (SD-HIS) medium. The optimal concentration for plating was tested based on three different concentrations (5 × concentrated, saturated, and 10 × diluted). For the wild type and exo1 null mutants, 100 μl of saturated culture cells was optimal and plated onto SD-HIS medium. After 3–4 days, HIS3+ recombinant colonies were counted and recombination rate was calculated by the number of recombinants divided by the total number of viable cells. Analysis was carried out as described previously (51Qiu J. Guan M.X. Bailis A.M. Shen B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3077-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) except that the strains in this study were transformed with plasmids, pRS314, pRS-ScE, or pRS-hE, respectively (Table I). Strains were grown in tryptophan minus SD (SD-TRP) liquid to saturation at 30 °C and cell density was measured with a spectrophotometer (600 nm), diluted in water, and plated on SD-TRP agar plate. The plates were exposed to different UV dosages (254 nm germicidal lamp) and incubated in the dark for 3–4 days at 30 °C before colonies were counted. Survival rate was determined based on the ratio between colony counts with and without UV treatment. Survival curves represent the average from at least six independent experiments.

CRP inhibits migration of neutrophils toward the chemoattractant, f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and therefore acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. Since tyrosine kinases are involved in neutrophil migration and CRP has been shown to decrease phosphorylation of some neutrophil proteins, we hypothesized that CRP inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis via inhibition of MAP kinase activity. The importance of p38 MAP kinase in neutrophil movement was determined by use of the specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580. CRP and SB203580 both blocked random and fMLP-directed neutrophil movement in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinase (ERK) was not involved in fMLP-induced neutrophil movement as determined by use of the MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059. Blockade of ERK with PD98059 did not inhibit chemotaxis nor did it alter the ability of CRP or SB203580 to inhibit fMLP-induced chemotaxis. More importantly, CRP inhibited fMLP-induced p38 MAP kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner as measured by an in vitro kinase assay. Impressively, CRP-mediated inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity correlated with CRP-mediated inhibition of fMLP-induced chemotaxis (r = −0.7144). These data show that signal transduction through p38 MAP kinase is necessary for neutrophil chemotaxis and that CRP intercedes through this pathway in inhibiting neutrophil movement.

Upon the onset of inflammation, there is an increase in the concentration of a number of plasma proteins which are collectively termed acute-phase reactants. C-reactive protein (CRP), 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, C-reactive protein; fMLP, f-Met-Leu-Phe; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPKAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATF, activating transcription factor. 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, C-reactive protein; fMLP, f-Met-Leu-Phe; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPKAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATF, activating transcription factor. the classic acute-phase reactant in man, has a normal serum concentration of less than 1 μg/ml; however, within 24 h after onset of inflammation, levels can increase as much as 1000-fold (1Kushner I. Gewurz H. Benson M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1981; 97: 739-749PubMed Google Scholar). This dramatic increase in CRP suggests an important role for CRP in inflammation and the fact that CRP is highly conserved throughout evolution indicates an important biological role for CRP. Besides this humoral acute-phase response, there are also cellular components of acute inflammation. Neutrophils are among the first leukocytic cells to migrate into tissues in response to invading pathogens or other initiators of inflammatory injury. One of the first steps of neutrophil involvement in acute inflammation is chemotaxis, directed movement toward chemotactic agents, such as complement fragments (C5a and C5a des-Arg), cytokines (interleukin-8), and bacteria-derived peptides such as formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP). CRP is present at sites of inflammation in association with neutrophils. Selective localization of CRP to sites of inflammationin vivo has been shown by double staining rabbit muscle tissue sections to visualize necrotic muscle associated with CRP (2Kushner I. Kaplan M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1961; 114: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Du Clos et al. (3Du Clos T.W. Mold C. Paterson P.Y. Alroy J. Gewurz H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1981; 43: 565-573PubMed Google Scholar) induced allergic encephalomyelitis in rabbits and found increased neutrophil numbers in the spinal cord sections that correlated with elevated spinal fluid CRP levels. Parish showed that serum CRP levels in patients with chronic neutrophil vasculitis lesions were double that seen in patients with chronic mononuclear cell vasculitis lesions (4Parish W.E. Clin. Allergy. 1976; 6: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In humans, neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several acute inflammatory diseases such as acute myocardial infarction, bacterial infections, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (5Ban K. Ikeda U. Takahashi M. Kanbe T. Kasahara T. Shimada K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1258-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Fowler A.A. Hyers T.M. Fisher B.J. Bechard D.E. Centor R.M.

Dis. 1986; 133: 218-225PubMed Google Scholar). Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with characteristics of an acute inflammatory reaction located primarily in the lung causing gross alterations in lung structure and function. In addition to massive influx of neutrophils into the alveolar space, significant elevations of CRP have been found in serum (8Kew R.R. Hyers T.M. Webster R.O. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 115: 339-345PubMed Google Scholar) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (9Li J.J. Sanders R.L. McAdam K.P.W.J. Hales C.A. Thompson B.T. Gelfand J.A. Burke J.F. J. Trauma. 1989; 29: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) from acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. CRP plays a role in modulating inflammatory and immune responses as a result of its ability to activate the classical complement pathway (10Kaplan M.H. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1974; 112: 2135-2147PubMed Google Scholar, 11Claus D.R. Siegel J. Petras K. Osmand A.P. Gewurz H. J.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3418-3422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to bind T lymphocytes and suppress certain lymphocyte functions (13Mortensen R.F. Braun D. Gewurz H. Cell Immunol. 1977; 28: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and to enhance phagocytosis (14Ganrot P.O. Kindmark C.-O. Scand. J. Clin. Lab.

We have shown that CRP inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro (8Kew R.R. Hyers T.M. Webster R.O. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 115: 339-345PubMed Google Scholar) and neutrophil alveolitisin vivo (16Heuertz R.M. Xia D. Samols D. Webster R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L649-L654PubMed Google Scholar, 17Heuertz R.M.

Care Med. 1996; 153: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Little is known about CRP-induced signal transduction in the neutrophil. A specific CRP receptor is present on the surface of neutrophils (19Buchta R. Pontet M. Fridkin M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Dobrinich R. Spagnuolo P.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) but the identity of the receptor remains elusive. CRP pretreatment of human neutrophils stimulated with fMLP results in a significant reduction in the degree of phosphorylation of several neutrophil proteins (21Buchta R. Gennaro R. Pontet M. Fridkin M. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the fMLP receptor on the neutrophil results in activation of two known members of the MAP kinase family, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAP kinase (22Zu Y.L. Qi J.

Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAP kinase, but not ERK, is indispensable for fMLP-induced chemotaxis of human neutrophils (22Zu Y.L. Qi J. Gilchrist A. Fernandez G.A. Vazquez-Abad D. Kreutzer D.L. Huang C.-K. Sha'afi R.I. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1982-1989PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase blocks transforming growth factor-β-induced neutrophil chemotaxis and actin polymerization (24Hannigan M. Zhan L.J. Ai Y.X. Huang C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and β2-integrin mobilization from cytoplasmic granules to the plasma membrane (25Schnyder B. Meunier P.C. Car B.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAP kinase leads to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase-2 (26Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) which phosphorylates the small heat shock protein, hsp27 (27Cuenda A. Rouse J.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Hsp27 has chaperone-like properties and acts as an inhibitor of actin polymerization (29Miron T. Vancompernolle K.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and so help to repair the actin microfilament network disrupted during cellular stress thereby maintaining cellular integrity and aiding cell survival during stress. In the current study, we hypothesized that CRP inhibits neutrophil movement by blocking the p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Here we show that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase with the specific inhibitor, SB203580, inhibits directed and random movement of neutrophils similar to that seen with CRP. Additionally, we show that CRP inhibits p38 MAP kinase activity and that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity correlates with inhibition of chemotaxis. Human CRP was obtained from a commercial source (Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME). SDS-PAGE of the human CRP followed by silver stain revealed a single band at 23 kDa and was ascertained as pure by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The concentration of endotoxin in the purified CRP was 132 endotoxin units/ml (11 ng/ml) as determined by theLimulus amebocyte assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Woods Hole, MA). Immunoblotting for serum amyloid P, a common contaminant found in CRP preparations, was negative. Concentration of the purified CRP was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). In all experiments, CRP concentrations were expressed as micrograms/ml. Using 125 kDa as the molecular mass of native human CRP, 100 μg/ml corresponded to 0.8 μm native molecule. Venous blood obtained from normal healthy human volunteers was treated with EDTA (0.15%) to prevent coagulation and layered onto NIMTM isolation media (Cardinal Associates, Santa Fe, NM) using a ratio of 1 part NIMTM to 1.4 parts whole blood. After centrifugation (630 × g, 22 °C, 40 min), the granulocyte-rich fraction was collected and recentrifuged (1000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered (pH 7.3) saline and hypotonic lysis performed to remove contaminating erythrocytes. Neutrophils were pelleted and washed once with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Neutrophil yields were routinely >95% with >98% viability. Chemotaxis was quantified by the leading front method of Zigmond and Hirsch (32Zigmond S.H. Hirsch J.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 127: 290-300PubMed Google Scholar) utilizing a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) and nitrocellulose filters with a pore size of 3 μm (Neuroprobe). All samples were prepared in chemotaxis buffer consisting of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, Sigma) and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Neutrophils were pretreated with the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor, PD98059 (Calbiochem) at a concentration (100 μm) that blocks ERK1 and ERK2 activities (33Kuroki M. O'Flaherty J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), human CRP or normal human plasma with or without addition of purified human CRP for 10 min at 23 °C. Buffer or the chemoattractant fMLP (1 × 10−7m) was added in duplicate to the lower chambers and neutrophils (200,000/well) were added to the upper chambers. After incubation for 35 min at 37 °C, the filters were removed, fixed in isopropyl alcohol, and stained with Harris acid hematoxylin. Either net neutrophil migration (distance moved in response to treatment minus distance moved in response to buffer (μm/35 min)) or percent inhibition of chemotaxis ([1 − net migration of treatment group divided by net migration of fMLP] × 100) was reported. In order to study mechanisms by which CRP inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis, an optimal concentration of fMLP (0.1 μm) was used. At this concentration of fMLP, concentrations of SB203580 severalfold higher than the IC50were used. Purified neutrophils were diluted to 1 × 108/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution with 0.25% bovine serum albumin (HBSA: Sigma) and 2 × 107 cells were pretreated with CRP by incubation for 10 min at 23 °C. In some experiments, cells were treated with 50% normal human plasma with or without the addition of purified human CRP. Cells were activated by the addition of fMLP (1 × 10−7m) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 min after which all tubes were immediately centrifuged (200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to pellet the neutrophils. Supernatants were aspirated and pellets resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Reaction mixtures were sonicated on wet ice at 35% power for ten 1-s pulses using a Sonic Dismembrator 300 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Reactions were then centrifuged (15,000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C) and supernatants quantitated for protein content using the BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co.). Neutrophil cell lysates were frozen at −70 °C until assayed. Neutrophil lysates (200 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μl of rabbit anti-human p38 MAP kinase polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) followed by adsorption with protein A-Sepharose (1 h, 4 °C: Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Samples were centrifuged (15,000 ×g, 1 min, 4 °C), washed twice with lysis buffer, and twice with kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2). Each pellet was resuspended and incubated (30 min, 30 °C) in kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP (New England Biolabs) and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein (New England Biolabs). Reactions were stopped by addition of 6 × Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Cell lysates (50 μg of protein/lane) were resolved on 12.75% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm pore size: Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA) using a semidry transfer unit (Fisher Scientific). Each membrane was stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to verify efficient and equal transfer of protein samples. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST: 1 h, 23 °C) followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human phospho-ATF2 (Thr71) peptide (New England Biolabs) in TBST with 5% bovine serum albumin (1:1000). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:2000. To detect the phosphorylated ATF2-antibody-peroxidase complex, enhanced chemiluminescence was used (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). Band intensity was quantitated by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Results were expressed as the ratio of ATF-2 intensity units to IgG intensity units (treatment/load control) or as the percent of the positive control (activity of treatment group divided by activity of fMLP group × 100). Neutrophils were treated with CRP or HBSA buffer for 10 min at 23 °C followed by exposure to fMLP (1 × 10−7m) or HBSA buffer for 1 min at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged (200 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and pellets suspended vigorously in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μl of antiprotease mixture (Sigma)). Reaction mixtures were centrifuged (3000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and equal volumes of supernatant and kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 μm okadaic acid, 30 μm H-7 protein kinase C inhibitor, 10 μm Na3VO4, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml hsp27, and 60 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.)) were mixed. Reactions were incubated (30 °C, 10 min) and stopped by the addition of 6 × Laemmli buffer and boiling (100 °C, 5 min). Reactants were separated by SDS-PAGE and protein bands stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure equal protein loading in each lane. Gels were dried and band intensity quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Results were expressed as percent of unstimulated control. Data are reported as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons of sample means were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA followed by a Tukey multiple range test. To determine if a difference existed between treatments (CRP or SB203580 ± PD98059), a two-way ANOVA was performed. A correlation coefficient was obtained by linear regression of percent inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis on p38 MAP kinase activity displayed as percent of positive control. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Since chemotaxis of neutrophils is an indicator of the cellular inflammatory response, the effect of purified human CRP on neutrophil chemotaxis to the bacterial chemotactic peptide, fMLP, was examined. To gain insight into mechanistic aspects of CRP on neutrophil motility, random movement was also assessed. CRP inhibited fMLP-induced chemotaxis and random movement of neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1) similar to what has been reported (8Kew R.R. Hyers T.M. Webster R.O. J. Lab.

CRP significantly inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis from 100 to 500 μg/ml and random movement at 100 and 200 μg/ml. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for neutrophil chemotaxis to fMLP was 90 μg/ml and for random movement was 80 μg/ml. Since it has been reported that activation of p38 MAP kinase is necessary for fMLP-induced chemotaxis of human neutrophils (22Zu Y.L. Qi J. Gilchrist A. Fernandez G.A. Vazquez-Abad D. Kreutzer D.L. Huang C.-K. Sha'afi R.I. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1982-1989PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether random movement also required p38 MAP kinase and to verify that the p38 MAP kinase specific inhibitor, SB203580, blocked fMLP-induced chemotactic movement. As shown in Fig.2, blockade of p38 MAP kinase inhibited fMLP-induced chemotaxis and random movement of neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner. SB203580 effectively inhibited fMLP-induced chemotaxis from 39.5 ± 5.3 μm/35 min (fMLP) to 31.3 ± 7.2, 15.3 ± 6.7, and 6.0 ± 6.6 μm/35 min (30, 50, and 100 μm SB203580, respectively) with the maximal degree of inhibition being 85%. Additionally, SB203580 blocked random movement concentration dependently from 0 to −22.3 ± 7.0 μm/35 min (100 μm SB203580). These results indicate p38 MAP kinase is involved in both random and fMLP-induced neutrophil movement. The IC50 for chemotaxis to fMLP was 45 μm. To aid in understanding whether CRP and SB203580 inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis through similar signal transduction pathways, the effect of co-addition of CRP and SB203580 on fMLP-induced movement was assessed. When CRP and SB203580 were both added at their IC50 concentrations, no additive nor synergistic augmentation of inhibition of fMLP-induced neutrophil chemotaxis was observed over that seen with CRP alone (Fig.3). These results suggest that both CRP and SB203580 inhibit neutrophil movement via the p38 MAP kinase pathway. It has been reported that p38 MAP kinase, but not ERK is required for chemotaxis of neutrophils (22Zu Y.L. Qi J. Gilchrist A. Fernandez G.A. Vazquez-Abad D. Kreutzer D.L. Huang C.-K. Sha'afi R.I. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1982-1989PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether blockade of ERK1 and ERK2 affected the ability of CRP and SB203580 to inhibit chemotaxis. PD98059 specifically inhibits ERK1 and ERK2 by blocking their upstream activators, MEK1 and MEK2 (34Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). We confirmed the findings of Zu et al. (22Zu Y.L. Qi J. Gilchrist A. Fernandez G.A. Vazquez-Abad D. Kreutzer D.L. Huang C.-K. Sha'afi R.I. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1982-1989PubMed Google Scholar) that PD98059 did not block fMLP-induced chemotaxis at any concentration tested (Fig.4 A). Additionally, inhibition of ERK with PD98059 at a concentration (100 μm) that completely blocks MEK-induced activation of ERK in neutrophils (33Kuroki M. O'Flaherty J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) did not affect the ability of CRP (Fig. 4 B) or SB203580 (Fig.4 C) to inhibit fMLP-induced neutrophil chemotaxis. These results suggest that CRP and blockade of p38 MAP kinase inhibit chemotaxis through a pathway separate from ERK. In view of the above results, a likely mechanism that explains the inhibitory action of CRP on neutrophil chemotaxis is that CRP inhibits p38 MAP kinase. For this reason, the effect of CRP on p38 MAP kinase activity was examined. When p38 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated and an in vitro kinase assay performed to detect p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation of its substrate, activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2), CRP was found to inhibit fMLP-induced p38 MAP kinase activity of neutrophils, especially at concentrations ≥100 μg/ml (Fig.5 A). The presence of two predominant bands was noted, one of the phosphorylated ATF2 substrate and the other of the immunoprecipitating antibody (IgG) reacting with the anti-IgG secondary antibody. Stimulation of neutrophils with fMLP significantly activated p38 MAP kinase over unstimulated (vehicle) cells as previously reported (23Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 35Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). Analysis of CRP inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity revealed that CRP inhibited substrate phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase in a concentration-dependent fashion with significance observed at 100 and 200 μg/ml CRP. CRP also inhibited p38 MAP kinase activity in an in vitrokinase activity assay assessing MAPKAP kinase-2 phosphorylation of hsp27. MAPKAP kinase-2 is a physiologic target of p38 MAP kinase (26Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) and phosphorylates hsp27 (28Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, fMLP activates MAPKAP kinase-2 which phosphorylates and activates hsp27 (36Zu Y.L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 5287-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRP inhibited phosphorylation of hsp27 by MAPKAP kinase-2 in a concentration-dependent manner with significant inhibition evident at 500 μg/ml (Fig. 6). This result confirms that CRP inhibits p38 MAP kinase activity. Interestingly, CRP concentrations inhibitory for fMLP-induced p38 MAP kinase activity were also inhibitory for fMLP-induced chemotaxis (compare Figs. 1 and5 B). As shown in Fig. 7, CRP-mediated inhibition of fMLP-induced p38 MAP kinase activity correlated with CRP-mediated inhibition of fMLP-induced chemotaxis with a correlation coefficient of −0.7144. To examine the physiological relevance of CRP inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity and correlative inhibition of neutrophil movement, the effects of normal human plasma spiked with purified human CRP on neutrophil chemotaxis and p38 MAP kinase activity were assessed. CRP addition to normal plasma resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of fMLP-directed movement of neutrophils with significant inhibition seen at 200 μg/ml CRP (Fig.8 A). Similarly, CRP addition to normal plasma resulted in inhibition of fMLP-induced p38 MAP kinase activity with significance observed at 200 μg/ml CRP (Fig.8 B). These results indicate that in the presence of normal plasma, CRP inhibits both fMLP-directed neutrophil movement and p38 MAP kinase activity. Stimulation of neutrophils by chemotactic peptides leads to the phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins believed to participate in activation of the microbicidal function of these cells. In the present study we described the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by CRP and correlated inhibition of kinase with arrest of movement. The specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, inhibited both fMLP-directed and random movement of neutrophils similar to that seen with CRP. Additionally, inhibition of ERK1 and ERK2 with the specific inhibitor, PD98059, revealed no significant difference from control in chemotaxis thereby supporting the hypothesis that ERK1 and ERK2 are not involved in neutrophil movement. The role of ERK in neutrophil migration remains unclear, however, since it has been reported that inhibition of ERK with PD98059 does not inhibit fMLP-induced chemotaxis (22Zu Y.L. Qi J. Gilchrist A.

Grinstein S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 434-443PubMed Google Scholar) and that PD98059 potentiates the chemotactic response of neutrophils (39Zhong W. Qin Z. Tebo J. Schlottmann K. Coggeshall M. Mortensen R.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2533-2540PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, addition of purified CRP to normal plasma resulted in inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and p38 MAP kinase activity indicating that these results have physiological significance. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an endogenous serum protein which inhibits cell movement by blockade of an intracellular signal transduction pathway. The precise kinase inhibited by CRP in this cascade remains to be elucidated. Since CRP inhibits phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase substrates, the expectation is that the site of CRP action is upstream of or at the point of p38 MAP kinase activation. Additionally, the precise mechanism by which CRP inhibits p38 MAP kinase (or an upstream activator) remains undetermined. It is known that CRP binds a specific receptor on neutrophils (19Buchta R. Pontet M. Fridkin M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Dobrinich R. Spagnuolo P.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) which to date has not been cloned. After binding, CRP may activate its own signal transduction pathway which intercepts and alters the fMLP-induced signaling cascade. Alternatively, CRP may directly intercept the signaling pathway of fMLP. Conceivably, CRP in its native or one of its altered forms could enter the cell and act directly on a member of the p38 MAP kinase cascade. Finally, CRP may inhibit signal transduction through receptors with similar structural motifs, for example, the seven transmembrane-spanning receptors of chemoattractants such as fMLP, complement fragment (C5a), and interleukin-8 (reviewed in Ref. 40Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). It has been reported that fMLP and C5a receptors are highly conserved in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains while being maximally divergent in the extracellular loops where ligand binds (41Alvarez V. Coto E. Setien F. Gonzalez-Roces S. Lopez-Larrea C. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that the ability of CRP to inhibit neutrophil movement to several different chemoattractants (16Heuertz R.M. Xia D. Samols D. Webster R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L649-L654PubMed Google Scholar, 17Heuertz R.M. Piquette C.A. Webster R.O. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 319-328PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ahmed N. Thorley R. Xia D. Samols D. Webster R.O. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) may be by alteration of signaling through the conserved cytoplasmic domains. It has been proposed that a specific signaling pathway for chemoattractant-induced neutrophil movement exists (42Yasui K. Yamazaki M. Miyabayashi M. Tsuno T. Komiyama A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5922-5929PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been suggested based upon the observation that both respiratory burst and migration of neutrophils require tyrosine phosphorylation in the signaling pathway; however, the former needs phospholipase D activation and the latter does not (42Yasui K. Yamazaki M. Miyabayashi M. Tsuno T. Komiyama A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5922-5929PubMed Google Scholar). Signal transduction therefore appears to be similar for respiratory burst and migration until the pathway reaches phospholipase D, at which point there is a split in the signaling paths. CRP-induced signal transduction may intercept fMLP-induced signaling at a point after phospholipase D activation and before p38 MAP kinase substrate phosphorylation. In addition, SB203580 inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis but not superoxide production whereas PD98059 potentiates superoxide and has no effect on chemotaxis (22Zu Y.L. Qi J. Gilchrist A. Fernandez G.A. Vazquez-Abad D. Kreutzer D.L. Huang C.-K. Sha'afi R.I. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1982-1989PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that p38 MAP kinase is necessary for movement and ERK may be an important pathway for the respiratory burst response. Cell movement is of the utmost importance in phagocytic cells such as neutrophils since migration to the site of infection is an important early step in host defense against microbial invasion. The recruitment of neutrophils and their accumulation at extravascular sites of inflammation is stimulated by soluble chemotactic factors and is accompanied by several biochemical events related to activation of the cells. As is seen in many cell types, phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase initiates a cascade of activation events associated with the cytoskeleton. Phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase in neutrophils results in the activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 which phosphorylates hsp27 and lymphocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1), both of which are F-actin-binding proteins (31Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 43Huang C.-K. Zhan L. Ai Y. Jongstra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additionally, LSP1 is reported to be the major substrate for MAPKAP kinase-2 in human neutrophils (36Zu Y.L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 5287-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Huang C.-K. Zhan L. Ai Y. Jongstra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Neutrophils isolated from patients with neutrophil actin dysfunction are defective in motility and fMLP-induced actin polymerization and overexpress LSP1 (44Howard T.H. Li Y. Torres M. Guerrero A. Coates T. Blood. 1994; 83: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by CRP leads to decreased phosphorylation of LSP1 with resultant loss of actin polymerization and cell motility. It has also been shown that transient increases in intracellular calcium are required for cellular release from previous sites of attachment but does not prevent cell polarization, ruffling, or other processes associated with motility (45Marks P.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CRP has no effect on transient calcium increases in stimulated neutrophils 2R. M. Heuertz, unpublished data. thereby suggesting that CRP is not acting at the point of cellular release from attachment sites but rather at the step of ruffling or polarization. Phosphorylation of hsp27 by MAPKAP kinase-2 may play a role in membrane ruffling since a nonphosphorylatable hsp27 mutant inhibits membrane ruffles (reviewed in Ref. 46Ridley A.J. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). CRP inhibition of p38 MAP kinase may be eliciting its inhibitory effect on neutrophil movement by inhibiting the p38 MAP kinase substrate, MAPKAP kinase-2, and its substrate, hsp27. By inhibiting phosphorylation of hsp27, CRP may be preventing the formation of membrane ruffles necessary for movement. Finally, microtubules are necessary for neutrophil polarization and microtubule inhibitors decrease neutrophil motility (47Malech H.L. Root R.K. Gallin J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 666-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), revealing the importance of polarization to the movement process. Activation of p38 MAP kinase may play an important role in proper arrangement of microtubules and CRP may be inhibiting movement at this step. The basis for the current study was the observation that CRP pretreatment of fMLP-stimulated human neutrophils resulted in a significant reduction in the degree of phosphorylation of several neutrophil proteins (21Buchta R. Gennaro R. Pontet M. Fridkin M. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These included proteins that were not identified but had molecular weights similar to p38 MAP kinase and other members of the MAP kinase family. Since ERK1 and ERK2 are not involved in F-actin polymerization of neutrophils (38Downey G.P. Butler J.R. Tapper H. Fialkow L. Saltiel A.R. Rubin B.B. Grinstein S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 434-443PubMed Google Scholar) nor are they required for the activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 or hsp27 (27Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) or other actin-binding proteins, a likely candidate was p38 MAP kinase. Of importance to this discussion is the report that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase prevents the progression of inflammation-mediated arthritis in an animal model (48Jackson J.R. Bolognese B. Hillegass L. Kassis S. Adams J. Griswold D.E. Winkler J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 687-692PubMed Google Scholar). Arthritis patients have increased serum CRP levels (49Morley J.J. Kushner I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 389: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and interestingly, transgenic mice expressing a rabbit CRP transgene had mild or no inflammation compared with animals not expressing the transgene in an antigen-induced arthritis model (50Samols D. Xia D. Jiang S.-L. Pizzuto T. Stevenson S. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38 (abstr.): S233Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of rabbit CRP by these transgenic mice prevented neutrophil movement into chemoattractant-instilled lungs in an acute lung injury animal model (16Heuertz R.M. Xia D. Samols D. Webster R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L649-L654PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the mechanism of inhibition of neutrophil movement is of great importance in models of inflammation. The current findings support inhibition of p38 MAP kinase as a mechanism by which CRP inhibits neutrophil movement. Additionally, CRP may play important roles in regulation of other neutrophil functions, thereby halting the acute inflammation process. Future work will focus on determining the precise mechanism by which CRP inhibits p38 MAP kinase. We thank Tradina R. Pichon and Deborah A. Williams for technical assistance."

Whereas the Ras-binding domains have a similar ubiquitin-like structure, the Ral-binding domain of RLIP was predicted to comprise a coiled-coil region. In order to obtain more information about the specificity and the structural mode of the interaction between Ral and RLIP, we have performed a sequence space and a mutational analysis. The sequence space analysis of a comprehensive nonredundant assembly of Ras-like proteins strongly indicated that positions 36 and 37 in the core of the effector region are tree-determinant positions for all subfamilies of Ras-like proteins and dictate the specificity of the interaction of these GTPases with their effector proteins. Indeed, we could convert the specific interaction with Ras effectors and RLIP by mutating these residues in Ras and Ral. We therefore conclude that positions 36 and 37 are critical for the discrimination between Ras and Ral effectors and that, despite the absence of sequence homology between the Ral-binding and the Ras-binding domains, their mode of interaction is most probably similar.

Ral is a small GTP-binding protein belonging to the subfamily of Ras proteins (1Chardin P. Tavitian A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Chardin P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4830Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which function as molecular switches in signal transduction pathways by alternating between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound conformation. The ratio between the active and inactive form of the Ras proteins is regulated by the action of two types of proteins (3Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

The guanine nucleotide affinities and the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ral are very similar to that of Ras (5Frech M. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Chardin P. J. Biol.

Recently, however, progress was made via the discovery of Ral-specific regulatory activities. Multiple Ral-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs) have been isolated (13Albright C.F.

Furthermore, although so far the corresponding genes have not been isolated, Ral-specific GAP activities were identified in brain, testis, and platelets (19Emkey R. Freedman S. Feig L. J. Biol.

Strikingly, in addition to a Ral-specific GEF domain, the RalGEFs contain a C-terminally located Ras-binding domain (RBD), which is able to bind the GTP-bound forms of Ras and Rap proteins, so that the RalGEFs were recognized as one of the new families of Ras protein effectors (Ref. 21McCormick F.

In addition to the regulatory proteins, a putative Ral effector protein was identified: RLIP76, also named RalBP1 or RIP (37Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S.

Its Ral-binding domain (RalBD) was identified by deletion studies (37Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitan A. Gacon G. Camonis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and was used successfully as a probe in a pull-down assay to measure the activation of endogenous Ral upon cellular stimulation (35Wolthuis R.M.F.

Finally, Ral was shown to be involved in the phorbol ester-stimulated phospholipase D activity, apparently through a direct interaction of Ral with phospholipase D 1 (28Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Additional complexity in the Ral pathway(s) emerged with the isolation of the RLIP76-binding protein Reps1, which can also bind to the adaptor proteins Crk and Grb2 (43Yamaguchi A. Urano T. Goi T. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31230-31234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and with the observation that calmodulin binds to RalA (44Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and that both Ral and Arf are needed for phospholipase D activation (45Luo J.-Q. Liu X. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Ramos M. Flom J. Jiang H. Feig L.A. Morris A.J. Kahn R.A. Foster D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3632-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Even though Ral interacts with RLIP76, it is largely unknown how this interaction takes place. Secondary structure prediction of RLIP76 indicated that the structure of RalBD comprises a coiled-coil region (37Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitan A. Gacon G. Camonis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and thus differs from the ubiquitin-like fold of the RBDs. In this work, we have investigated the effects of several mutations on the interaction between Ral and RLIP76 by double hybrid analysis and biochemical methods. Moreover, the specificity of the interaction of Ras and Ral proteins with their effectors was studied by sequence space analysis of the Ras-like protein sequences. The foremost result is that Lys-47 and Ala-48 (corresponding to Ras residues Ile-36 and Glu-37) in the effector region enable Ral to discriminate between RLIP76 and Ras effector molecules. Ral(K47I) is able to interact almost as potently as Ras with RalGEF-RBDs, whereas mutation E37A in Ras is sufficient for a significantly interaction with RLIP76. We thus conclude that, as opposed to the other members of the Ras-subfamily, Ral is unable to interact with Ras effector molecules due to critical differences in the effector region. Furthermore, introduction of mutations in the effector region may induce erroneous binding to effectors specific for other GTP-binding proteins. Finally, the fact that mutation of only two residues changes binding specificity suggests that the modes of protein-protein interaction in the Ral·RLIP and in the Ras·RBD complexes are similar. Using PCR, we cloned in the pGEX-4T3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) the fragment of the simian RalA gene encoding amino acids 1–178 (sRalA1–178; hereafter called sRalA) via restriction sites BamHI/EcoRI and the fragment of the human RalB gene encoding amino acids 1–179 (hRalB1–179; hereafter called hRalB) viaBamHI/SalI sites. For overproduction of recombinant proteins, we used the protease-negative Escherichia coli strain AD202 (46Nakano H. Yamazaki T. Ikeda M. Masai H. Miyatake S. Saito T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in standard I-medium (Merck) containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 10 mg/liter kanamycin. Synthesis of recombinant proteins was induced at anA 600 of 0.9 by addition of 100 nmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and subsequent incubation at 30 °C overnight. Bacteria cells were harvested by centrifugation; resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithioerythritol, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 25 μm Pefabloc SC (Merck), and 10 μm GDP; and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation for 1 h at 40,000 × g, the supernatant was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose column and washed with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 10 μm GDP, 10% glycerol). Subsequently, we loaded the column with thrombin (Serva; 2 NIH units per estimated mg of GST-fused protein) in Buffer A containing 5 mm CaCl2 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cleaved Ral protein was eluted with Buffer A, concentrated in Vivaspin vials (Vivascience), and further purified using a Superdex 75-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 10 μm GDP. After concentration of the pooled fractions, the Ral proteins were dialyzed against Buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithioerythritol), aliquoted, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Ral and Ras proteins were loaded with Gpp(NH)p or mGpp(NH)p (the derivative of 5′-guanylylimidodiphosphate, carrying the fluorescentN-methylanthraniloyl-group at the 2′- or 3′-position of the ribose (mixture of both isoforms)) by incubation with a 4-fold excess of (m)Gpp(NH)p in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithioerythritol, and 5 units of alkaline phosphatase per mg of Ral or Ras for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, separation of the Ral or Ras protein from unbound nucleotides was obtained by gel filtration in Buffer B. Thereafter, the protein was concentrated using Vivaspin vials, and the concentration of Ral·(m)Gpp(NH)p was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. The effector mutants of hRalB were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (71Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) using template pGEX-4T3-hRalB1–179, upstream primer 5′-CGCGTGGATCCATGGCT-3′ (the BamHI restriction site is underlined), and downstream primer 5′-TCCCTGAATTCGGCTG-3′ (the EcoRI restriction site is underlined). The downstream primer hybridizes to a sequence of hRalB comprising an internal EcoRI restriction site located in the triplets encoding amino acids Glu-106/Phe-107 of hRalB. The mutagenic primers were 5′-GTTGGCAAGAACGCCCTGACG-3′ for S28N, 5′-GAGTTTGTAAAAGACTATGA-3′ for E41K, 5′-GTTTGTAGAAAAGTATGAACC-3′ for D42K, 5′-TGAACCTACCATCGCTGACAGTTAT-3′ for K47I, 5′-ACCTACCAAAGAAGACAGTTAT-3′ for A48E, 5′-TATGAACCTACCATCGAAGACAGTTATAG-3′ for the double mutant K47I/A48E, 5′-CTACCAAAGCTGAGAGTTA-3′ for D49E, and 5′-CTACCAAAGCTAACAGTTATAG-3′ for D49N (the mutated codons are underlined). The BamHI/EcoRI-cleaved PCR fragments were ligated into theBamHI/EcoRI-cleaved pGEX-4T3-hRalB1–179 vector. The Ras mutants were made as described above for the Ral mutants using upstream primer 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACAGAATACAAGCTTGTTGTTGTTG-3′ (the BamHI restriction site is underlined), downstream primer 5′-CCACAGTGCGTGCAGCCAGGTCAC-3′ (Ras residues Cys-118 to Val-125), and mutagenesis primers 5′-GACCCCACTAAAGAGGATTCCTACC-3′ for I36K, 5′-GACCCCACTATAGCGGATTCCTACC-3′ for E37A, and 5′-GACCCCACTAAAGCGGATTCCTACC-3′ for I36K/E37A (mutated codons underlined). The plasmid pGEX-4T3-Ras, a kind gift of Dorothee Vogt, was used as a template. The mutatedBamHI/NcoI-fragments were switched with the corresponding fragment in the pGEX-4T3-Ras wild type plasmid. The Ral-binding domain (RalBD) of human RLIP76, comprising amino acids 397–518 (37Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitan A. Gacon G. Camonis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), was cloned by PCR in theBamHI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T3. Synthesis, isolation, and storage were performed basically as described for Ral but using buffers without GDP. GST-fused RalBD was eluted from the column with Buffer A containing 10 mm of reduced glutathione and subsequently dialyzed against Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 nm Pefabloc, 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), and 2 mm MgCl2). To prepare the complex sRalA·Gpp(NH)p·RalBD, the lysate of 20 g of GST-RalBD-expressing AD202 cells were loaded on a GSH-Sepharose column and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm dithioerythritol, 10 nm Gpp(NH)p, 25 nm Pefabloc, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Thereafter, 20 mg of Gpp(NH)p-bound sRalA were loaded on the column. The GST fusion was cleaved with 40 NIH units of thrombin at 4 °C overnight, after which the complex was eluted. The complex was separated from noncomplexed RalBD by two successive chromatographic steps on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm dithioerythritol, 10 μm Gpp(NH)p, 25 μm Pefabloc, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. The wild type and mutated Ral and Ras genes were subcloned by BamHI/SalI fragments into pVJL10, a derivative of pBTM116 (47Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fragments containing the RalBD or the RBD of c-Raf-1 (amino acids 51–131) were subcloned by PCR in the pGAD3S2X vector. The Ras-binding domain of mRalGDS (amino acids 702–852) or mRlf (amino acids 607–778) was expressed from pGAD1318. Plasmids pGAD3S2X and pGAD1318 are derivatives of the two-hybrid vector pGAD-GH. 2H assays were performed as described (37Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R.

L40 yeast cells transformed with plasmids allowing expression of LexA-fused proteins were mated with AMR70 cells transformed with plasmids allowing expression of proteins fused to the GAL4 activation domain. Diploids were tested for histidine prototrophy and LacZ expression. Quantification of β-galactosidase activity was performed as described (48Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). 400 μg of GST-RalBD was bound to 400 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads in 3 ml of Buffer C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with the same buffer. For each assay 5 μm of sRalA wt, hRalB wt, or hRalB mutants, loaded with GDP or Gpp(NH)p, were incubated in 1 ml with 3.5 μm GST-RalBD bound to GSH-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with Buffer C, and resuspended with 15 μl of SDS-sample buffer. The proteins were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The interaction of hRalB wt and the hRalB(K47I/A48E) mutant with the Rlf-, Rgl-, and RalGDS-RBDs was characterized with a Perkin-Elmer fluorescence spectrometer LS50B as described before (24Esser D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in Buffer B containing 5% glycerol at 37 °C; excitation wavelength was 366 nm, and emission wavelength was 450 nm. The determined dissociation constants were corrected with the percentage of the activity of the effector, which was specified by an active site titration as described (49Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). An assembly of 476 Ras sequences was collected from different data bases with the help of the Genequiz software (50Andrade M.A. Brown N.P. Leroy C. Hoersch S. Daruvar A.D. Reich C. Franchini A. Tamames J. Valencia A. Ouzounis C. Sander C. Genome Sequence Analysis and Annotation, Bioinformatics. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). A comprehensive nonredundant alignment of these sequences was build with CLUSTALW (51Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55629) Google Scholar) using the BLOSUM62 matrix (52Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4311) Google Scholar). Only sequences with maximal 80% similarity were accepted, with the exception of Ral: only 8 Ral sequences were found in the data bases, all of which were accepted in the alignment. The final multiple sequence alignment that was obtained after some hand editing included 179 sequences, corresponding to 98 Rab, 36 Rho, 37 Ras, and 8 Ral sequences. This alignment can be found athttp://www.cnb.uam.es/∼cnbprot/ral.dir. The detection of those residues that allot specificity to a subfamily,i.e. those residues that are conserved within a given subfamily and differ from the other subfamilies, which are named tree-determinant residues, was carried out with SequenceSpace (53Casari G. Sander C. Valencia A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These tree-determinant residues are likely to be responsible for the functional differences between protein subfamilies. This approach was used in different systems, including the α-subunits of the trimeric G-proteins (54Pazos F. Sanchez-Pulido L. Garcı́a-Ranea J.A. Andrade M.A. Atrian S. Valencia A. Lundh D. Olsson B.

Evol. 1997; 47: 211-221Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), among others. In all these cases, the positions of the tree-determinant residues fit nicely with known protein interaction sites, e.g. the peptide substrate binding sites in the SH2 domains. Surface accessibility of residues in the GDP-bound conformation of sRalA, 3I. R. Vetter, manuscript in preparation. and the GDP- and the GTP-bound conformation of Ras (Protein Data Bank codes 4q21 and 5p21, respectively) was calculated with the program DSSP (57Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar). The first trials to isolate the complex by incubating the purified proteins sRalA·Gpp(NH)p and RalBD, and subsequent purification over gel filtration column in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithioerythritol, were unsuccessful. Under these conditions, Ral behaved as a dimer and RalBD as a multimer (not shown). Consequently, a proper separation of the complex from the single proteins was not possible, and we could not be certain that a complex was formed. Therefore, we modified our strategy. We bound GST-RalBD to a GSH-Sepharose column, loaded sRalA·Gpp(NH)p to the column, and, after washing in order to remove unbound Ral, cleaved with thrombin and eluted the complex from the column. Only with sRalA·Gpp(NH)p could a complex be eluted (Fig. 1); one could not be eluted with sRalA·GDP (not shown), demonstrating that the interaction between Ral and RalBD is GTP-specific, consistent with earlier findings with different techniques (37Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitan A. Gacon G. Camonis J. J. Biol.

The complex-containing fractions of the GSH-Sepharose elution were further purified by gel filtration to remove noncomplexed proteins and to determine the ratio in which the complex is build. A partial separation of noncomplexed RalBD, which here behaved as a dimer, from the complex could be obtained by a first Superdex-75 chromatography step (Fig. 1 A). The pooled fractions containing the complex (fractions 18–22) were subjected to a second gel filtration, after which a nearly pure complex (fractions 20–22) could be obtained (Fig.1 B). The complex eluted as a 33-kDa protein, showing it to be a 1:1 complex of the Ral protein (20.4 kDa) and RalBD (14.7 kDa). It was noted that the nonfused form of RalBD runs with a too high apparent molecular mass (Fig. 1), whereas GST-fused RalBD runs normally on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2) (molecular mass, 40.9 kDa). It was shown by fluorescence measurements for several effector molecules that they can inhibit the intrinsic dissociation rate of the GTP-bound complex of Ras-like proteins in a concentration-dependent manner (15Wolthuis R.M.F. Bauer B. van't Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 353-362Google Scholar, 49Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A.

However, addition of up to 10 μm RalBD did not lead to any effect on the intrinsic dissociation rate of sRalA·mGpp(NH)p or hRalB·mGpp(NH)p (not shown), nor to a change in emission spectrum. Because fluorescence measurements did not allow the characterization of the interaction,"

O-Glycosylation of pro-sucrase-isomaltase (pro-SI), aminopeptidase N (ApN), and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is drastically reduced when processing of the mannose-rich N-linked glycans is blocked by deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of the Golgi-located mannosidase I. By contrast, O-glycosylation is not affected in the presence of swainsonine, an inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase II. The results indicate that removal of the outermost mannose residues by mannosidase I from the mannose-rich N-linked glycans is required before O-glycosylation can ensue. On the other hand, subsequent mannose residues in the core chain impose no sterical constraints on the progression of O-glycosylation. Reduction or modification of N- andO-glycosylation do not affect the transport of pro-SI, ApN, or DPPIV to the cell surface per se. However, the polarized sorting of two of these proteins, pro-SI and DPPIV, to the apical membrane is substantially altered when O-glycans are not completely processed, while the sorting of ApN is not affected. The processing of N-linked glycans, on the other hand, has no influence on sorting of all three proteins. The results indicate thatO-linked carbohydrates are at least a part of the sorting mechanism of pro-SI and DPPIV. The sorting of ApN implicates neitherO-linked nor N-linked glycans and is driven most likely by carbohydrate-independent mechanisms.

The results indicate thatO-linked carbohydrates are at least a part of the sorting mechanism of pro-SI and DPPIV. The sorting of ApN implicates neitherO-linked nor N-linked glycans and is driven most likely by carbohydrate-independent mechanisms. Glycosylation of membrane and secretory glycoproteins comprises a cascade of steps that implicate a number of oligo- and monosaccharide transferases and commences in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; SI, sucrase-isomaltase (all forms); pro-SI, uncleaved sucrase-isomaltase; ApN, aminopeptidase N; LPH, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase; DPPIV, dipeptidyl peptidase IV; dMM, deoxymannojirimycin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; endo H, endoglycosidase H; endo F/GF, endoglycosidase F/N-glycopeptidase F; TFMS, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid; VIP36, 36-kDa vesicular integral membrane protein. concomitant with protein translation and translocation (1Jenkins N.

This initial glycosylation event, known as N-linked core glycosylation, involves the transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 unit to acceptor asparagine residues in the tripeptide sequon Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr and is catalyzed by the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase (1Jenkins N.

Upon arrival to the cis-Golgi network, the initial mannose-rich core chains are trimmed by mannosidases I and II of the cis–Golgi. In the medial andtrans-Golgi formation of complex type of glycans ensues and is terminated by the addition of sialic acid in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) (1Jenkins N. Parekh R.B. James D.C. Nat.

Another glycosylation event of many, but not all, membrane and secretory glycoproteins is O-linked glycosylation at particular serine or threonine residues. In contrast toN-linked glycosylation, O-glycosylation is a posttranslational event and occurs in the cis-Golgi (4Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5003) Google Scholar, 10Roth J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,11Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9264-9271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A consensus acceptor sequence, as the tripeptide Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr in N-linked glycosylation, does not exist. However, comparison of amino acid sequences around a large number ofO-glycosylation sites of several glycoproteins revealed a significantly increased frequency of proline residues at positions −1 and +3 relative to the glycosylated residues and a marked increase of serine, threonine, and alanine residues (12Wilson I.B. Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It has been also suggested that stretches of serine and threonine residues in glycoproteins, such as in sucrase-isomaltase (SI, EC 3.2.1.48–10) (13Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), aminopeptidase N (ApN, EC 3.4.15.1) (14Olsen J. Cowell G.M. Konigshofer E. Danielsen E.M. Moller J. Laustsen L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11314-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the low density lipoprotein receptor (16Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4335-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), are potential sites forO-glycosylation. A role of O-glycosylation in the biological function of glycoproteins and in conferring stability and protection against proteolytic degradation has been proposed (16Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4335-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25494-25504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A direct implication of O-glycosylation in the intracellular transport of proteins is unlikely, since acquisition of transport competence implicates a cascade of steps that occur in the ER andO-glycosylation is a cis-Golgi event. Consistent with this is the finding that truncation of the highlyO-glycosylated stalk region of ApN does not affect the transport and targeting of this enzyme (19Vogel L.K. Noren O. Sjostrom H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At first glance N- and O-linked glycosylation could be considered as independent events by virtue of the different structural requirements of the glycosylation sites, the temporal aspect (cotranslational versus posttranslational), and the different monosaccharide composition of the individual chains. Recent observations, however, suggested that at least an indirect association between the two events does exist. Here, inhibition of trimming of the mannose-rich chains of brush border lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH, EC 3.2.1.23–62) (20Naim H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) by deoxymannojirimycin (dMM), an inhibitor ofcis-Golgi α-mannosidase I (21Fuhrman U. Bause E. Legler G. Ploegh H. Nature. 1984; 307: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), was accompanied by generation of only N- rather than N- andO-glycosylated forms of LPH (17Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25494-25504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this very example, it was proposed that conformational alterations in LPH due to persisting mannose-rich type of glycosylation in the presence of dMM may render potential O-glycosylation sites in LPH inaccessible to Golgi transferases. It is not clear, however, whether the observed effect with LPH may be generalized to other O-glycosylated proteins. In an effort to analyze the role of carbohydrate modification on the sorting of the brush border hydrolases, pro-SI, ApN, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5), we used inhibitors of trimming of carbohydrate chains in the cis-Golgi and surprisingly found that dMM has generated similar effects on three different proteins as those observed with LPH. The O-linked glycosylation of pro-SI, ApN, and DPPIV was substantially affected. Moreover, the polarized sorting of SI and DPPIV, but not of ApN, was drastically altered from high sorting fidelity to the apical membrane to random distribution on both sides. Human intestinal biopsies (5–10 mg) were obtained for routine diagnosis by suction with a pediatric Watson capsule and processed as described elsewhere (22Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells (23Rousset M. Chevalier G. Rousset J.P. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 531-534PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.45% glucose and supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human small intestinal brush border membrane hydrolases were a generous gift from Dr. H.-P. Hauri (Biocenter, Basel, Switzerland) and Dr. E. E. Sterchi (University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland) (24Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The mouse mAb anti-ApN and anti-DPPIV were products of hybridomas HBB 3/775 and HBB 3/153, respectively. For immunoprecipitation of pro-SI, a mixture of four different monoclonal antibodies was used (HBB 1/691, HBB 2/614, HBB 3/705, HBB 2/219). Intestinal biopsy specimens were either continuously labeled with [35S]methionine or subjected to a pulse-chase protocol essentially as described elsewhere (18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were cultured on membrane filters (Falcon) according to the procedure described previously for LPH in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (25Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were usually labeled at day 6 after confluence. When used, dMM, an inhibitor of mannosidase I (21Fuhrman U. Bause E. Legler G. Ploegh H. Nature. 1984; 307: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and swainsonine, an inhibitor of mannosidase II (26Elbein A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 135-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), were present in the culture medium during preincubation of the tissue or cells in methionine-deficient medium and during the pulse and chase periods essentially as described before (20Naim H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The final concentration of dMM was 5 mm and that of swainsonine was 4 μg/ml (both reagents were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled biopsy specimens were homogenized with a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, supplemented with 50 mmNaCl and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), benzamidine (17.4 μg/ml), and aprotinin (1 μg/ml)) (all were from Sigma). Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was recovered and solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (final concentrations) by stirring on ice for 30 min. Caco-2 cells were lysed at 4 °C for 1 h in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and the mixture of protease inhibitors mentioned above). The solubilized cells or biopsy homogenates were spun for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated as described by Naim et al. (18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar), and the apparent molecular masses were assessed by comparison with high molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany) run on the same gel. Cell surface immunoprecipitations of proteins from biosynthetically labeled Caco-2 cells on membrane filters were performed by adding the appropriate antibody to either the apical or basolateral compartment. The cells were extensively washed to remove excessive antibody and lysed as described above. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was finally added to capture the antigen-antibody complexes. Treatments with endoglycosidase H (endo H) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and endoglycosidase F/N-glycopeptidase F (endo F/GF) (Sigma) were performed according to Naim et al. (22Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For elimination ofO-linked sugars, the immunoprecipitated glycoproteins were first N-deglycosylated with endo F/GF and the digestion products were precipitated with ice-cold acetone. The protein pellets were subjected to treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) that cleaves O-glycosidically linked sugar chains (28Edge A.S.B. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert Jr., L.E. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) as described (18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that pro-SI is anO-glycosylated molecule, whose O-glycosylation pattern is heterogeneous and correlates with the position of the individual subunits, sucrase and isomaltase, that comprise this enzyme complex (18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data were obtained by employing a number of approaches, including enzymatic and chemical deglycosylation and lectin binding studies. Here, we extended these studies to ApN and DPPIV. First we demonstrate that ApN and DPPIV are O-glycosylated and that, as in the case of pro-SI and LPH, this glycosylation is also heterogeneous. Human ApN is synthesized in intestinal cells as a 130-kDa mannose-rich glycosylated precursor, which matures with a half time of 30–40 min to a complex glycosylated species of apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa (24Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 29Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis and processing of ApN in other species has been also studied (30Danielsen E.M. Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1039-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of the human enzyme has been cloned (14Olsen J. Cowell G.M. Konigshofer E. Danielsen E.M. Moller J. Laustsen L. Hansen O.C. Welinder K.G. Engberg J. Hunziker W. Sjostrom H. Noren O. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and the amino acid sequence of the protein deduced from cDNA revealed a Ser/Thr-rich domain, which, as in SI, may provide potential O-glycosylation sites. However, no direct evidence from biosynthetic or structural analyses has been described so far. We first assessed the O-glycosylation pattern by employing a strategy that combines enzymatic and chemical deglycosylation of precursor and mature forms of ApN and compared the apparent molecular weights of the deglycosylation products. First, the glycoprotein was enzymatically deglycosylated of its N-linked sugars by using the combination endoglycosidase F/N-glycopeptidase F (endo F/GF), which removes complex and mannose-rich N-linked carbohydrates. Endo H, which cleaves mannose-rich glycans, was used when mannose-rich glycoproteins were analyzed. In either case, the resulting molecular form(s) were further treated with TFMS, a chemical reagent that cleaves O-glycosidic linkages (28Edge A.S.B. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert Jr., L.E. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). A further reduction in the apparent molecular weight of an enzymaticallyN-deglycosylated species provides an ample evidence for the presence of O-linked sugars in the treated protein. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Immunoprecipitation of biopsy samples with mAb anti-ApN revealed a 130-kDa labeled protein after 30 min of chase. This band corresponded to the mannose-rich precursor of ApN (denoted ApNh) as assessed by its sensitivity to treatment with endo H and its conversion to a 100-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). A similar digestion product was obtained with endo F/GF (Fig. 1 A, lane 3), supporting the endo H data that the 130-kDa polypeptide is N-glycosylated of the mannose-rich type. Treatment of the endo F/GF product with TFMS did not produce a further shift in the size of the 100-kDa band (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), indicating that the 130-kDa protein is not O-glycosylated. After 4 h of chase, a predominantly labeled endo H-resistant 160-kDa ApN band could be detected, which corresponded to the complex glycosylated mature form of ApN (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6) (this form will be referred to throughout as ApNc). When this immunoprecipitate was treated with endo F/GF, a diffuse band pattern was obtained that, however, could be resolved into at least two bands (Fig. 1 A,lane 7; see also Fig. 1 B). Prolonged treatment of mature ApNc with endo F/GF by using higher concentrations of the endoglycosidase did not eliminate the blurred band pattern (data not shown), indicating the existence of endo F/GF-resistant oligosaccharides. Treatment with TFMS eliminated the band heterogeneity and generated one single band, which was slightly smaller than the lowest periphery of the diffuse band pattern. Due to the specificity of TFMS in cleaving O-glycosidic bonds, the result demonstrates the existence of O-linked glycans in mature ApNc. Fig. 1 B provides a clearer evidence for the existence of several products of N-deglycosylated ApN and compares further in the same experimental sample the endo F/GF products of the 130-kDa mannose-rich ApNh and the 160-kDa complex glycosylated ApNc species (Fig. 1 B,lane 4). In this experiment, ApN was immunoprecipitated from a biopsy sample that was continuously labeled for 2 h, during which time the proportion of ApNhrelative to ApNc is still high enough, thus allowing a direct comparison of the N-deglycosylated forms of the two species in the same experimental sample (Fig. 1 B,lane 3). Mannose-rich ApNhimmunoprecipitated from a biopsy sample labeled for 30 min served as a control (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Endo F/GF-treated ApN from the 2-h labeled biopsy sample revealed three major bands (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). The lowest of these is the N-deglycosylation product of the 130-kDa form, since a similar product was obtained upon deglycosylation of the 130-kDa ApNh alone (compare with lane 2). The other two larger products corresponded hence to the endo F/GF-treated 160-kDa ApNc species. The smaller size of the N-deglycosylated mannose-rich 130-kDa ApNh(lanes 2 and 4) as compared with theN-deglycosylated mature 160-kDa ApNc provides additional evidence for the existence of sugar residues in mature ApN other than the N-linked ones. The earliest detectable form of DPPIV synthesized in intestinal epithelial cells is the mannose-rich precursor of apparent molecular mass ∼100 kDa (DPPIVh) (Fig.2, lane 1; see Refs. 24Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar and 31Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This form is rapidly converted to a complex glycosylated mature form (DPPIVc) (Fig. 2, lane 5) with a half-time of 15–25 min (24Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 31Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mature DDPIVc appears as a diffuse band of an average apparent molecular mass of 124 kDa (this molecular mass will be referred to throughout). Deglycosylation of the DPPIVh mannose-rich polypeptide with endo H and endo F/GF revealed essentially similar molecular species of an apparent molecular mass around 85 kDa (Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 3). TFMS treatment of theN-deglycosylated DPPIVh did not generate a further shift in its size indicating that the 85-kDa species is devoid of O-glycosidically linked glycans. By contrast, the mature 124-kDa DPPIVc form obtained within 4 h of chase (Fig.2, lane 5) is heavily O-glycosylated as assessed by the combined endo F/GF and TFMS treatments.N-Deglycosylation generated a diffuse band of an apparent molecular mass ranging between 90 and 110 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 7). TFMS treatment converted this heterogeneous form to a band of an apparent molecular weight smaller than the lowest band periphery of the N-deglycosylated product (Fig. 2,lane 8, and compare this band with the band inlane 7). The result demonstrates that theN-deglycosylated protein containsO-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides, which have been eliminated by TFMS. Altogether, the chemical and enzymatic treatments provide an evidence for O-glycosylation of ApN and DPPIV. Further, the observed multiple and heterogeneous band patterns in N-deglycosylated ApN and DPPIV suggest the presence of several populations of differently O-glycosylated species of these glycoproteins, which could be converted to one unglycosylated species upon TFMS treatment. The existence of several populations of N- andO-glycosylated glycoproteins has been also reported for two other brush border enzymes, LPH (17Naim H.Y. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25494-25504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Naim H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and SI (18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all these cases, a possible association between the differentiation state of intestinal cells and the various glycoforms is favored. We have demonstrated before that impaired processing of cotranslationally added mannose-rich N-linked sugars in thecis- and medial Golgi by inhibitors of mannosidases I and II is associated with drastic reduction, if not complete blocking, of theO-linked glycosylation of human intestinal LPH (20Naim H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A possible conformational interference of unprocessed N-linked sugar chains with potential O-glycosylation sites lying in their vicinity was proposed. This has inspired us to further examine other heavily O-glycosylated proteins such as ApN, DPPIV, and pro-SI, with the ultimate goal of analyzing the role ofN-linked and more importantly O-linked glycosylation on the sorting behavior of proteins in polarized cells. We studied therefore the effects of dMM, an inhibitor of mannosidase I (21Fuhrman U. Bause E. Legler G. Ploegh H. Nature. 1984; 307: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and swainsonine, an inhibitor of mannosidase II (26Elbein A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 135-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), on the processing of pro-SI, ApN, and DPPIV in intestinal cells. The results are depicted in Fig. 3 and a survey of the glycoforms of the proteins analyzed is provided in TableI.Table IGlycoforms of the brush border proteins pro-SI, ApN, and DPPIVProteinMannose-richComplexdMMSwainsoninePro-SIPro-SIhPro-SIcPro-SIdMMPro-SIswa210 kDa245 kDa∼210 kDa∼235 kDaApNApNhApNcApNdMMApNswa130 kDa160 kDa∼130 kDa∼145 kDaDPPIVDPPIVhDPPIVcDPPIVdMMDPPIVswa100 kDa124 kDa∼105 kDa∼115 kDa Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows the molecular forms of pro-SI, ApN, and DPPIV immunoprecipitated from a normal intestinal biopsy specimen that has been labeled for 6 h. In each case, a mannose-rich and a complex glycosylated polypeptides were detected, as has been shown previously for pro-SI (18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and above for ApN and DPPIV. For pro-SI these forms are denoted pro-SIh (mannose-rich 210 kDa) and pro-SIc (complex glycosylated 245 kDa) (18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For ApN and DPPIV, these forms have been described above (ApNh, ApNc, and DPPIVh and DPPIVc; see Figs. 1 and 2). Treatment of the biopsy specimen with 5 mmdMM during the labeling period has resulted in the generation of single glycosylated forms of pro-SI (pro-SIdMM), ApN (ApNdMM), and DPPIV (DPPIVdMM). Pro-SIdMM and ApNdMM had apparent molecular weights almost similar to their mannose-rich pro-SIh and ApNh counterparts, respectively. The glycoform of DPPIV was a diffuse band of an average apparent molecular around 100 kDa (denoted DDPIVdMM) and is therefore significantly smaller than complex glycosylated DPPIVc (124 kDa). All three glycoforms were sensitive to endo H, indicating their predominant mannose-rich type glycosylation. The endo H-resistant proportions of the sugar content in pro-SIdMM, ApNdMM, and DPPIVdMM were eliminated by endo F/GF, as assessed by the shift in the apparent molecular weight upon treatment with the endoglycosidase (in the case of pro-SIdMM, this shift was slight). N-Deglycosylation of pro-SIdMM and ApNdMM revealed in each case a single band pattern that corresponded to the lowest band of the endo F/GF forms of the control glycoforms pro-SIc and ApNc. For DPPIVdMM, endo F/GF treatment resulted in the generation of a substantially less diffuse band than that of DPPIVc and which had also a reduced apparent molecular weight. Since the endo F/GF-forms of pro-SIc, ApNc, and DPPIVc, which are O-glycosylated (Ref. 18Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and see above), are substantially larger than those of their pro-SIdMM, ApNdMM, and DPPIVdMMcounterparts, our results demonstrate a drastic reduction inO-linked glycosylation of pro-SI, ApN, and DPPIV in the presence of dMM. The same type of analysis was performed with swainsonine. A marked effect on the glycosylation patterns of pro-SI, ApN, and DPPIV was obtained with this inhibitor, albeit to a lesser extent than that revealed with dMM (Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W2027509945,"PrPSc, an abnormal isoform of PrPC, is the only known component of the prion, an agent causing fatal neurodegenerative disorders such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). It has been postulated that prion diseases propagate by the conversion of detergent-soluble and protease-sensitive PrPC molecules into protease-resistant and insoluble PrPSc molecules by a mechanism in which PrPSc serves as a template. We show here that the chemical chaperone dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) can partially inhibit the aggregation of either PrPSc or that of its protease-resistant core PrP27–30. Following Me2SO removal by methanol precipitation, solubilized PrP27–30 molecules aggregated into small and amorphous structures that did not resemble the rod configuration observed when scrapie brain membranes were extracted with Sarkosyl and digested with proteinase K. Interestingly, aggregates derived from Me2SO-solubilized PrP27–30 presented less than 1% of the prion infectivity obtained when the same amount of PrP27–30 in rods was inoculated into hamsters. These results suggest that the conversion of PrPC into protease-resistant and detergent-insoluble PrP molecules is not the only crucial step in prion replication.

Alternatively, the nucleation-dependent protein polymerization model argues that the formation of new PrPSc molecules depends on the presence of a seed composed of aggregated PrPSc molecules and that new PrPSc molecules join previously assembled prion polymers (5Come J.H.

J. 1995; 69: 640-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). After a single dose of Me2SO, the urine of human amyloidotic patients contained fibrils with the tinctorial properties of amyloids, suggesting that Me2SO can either break large amyloid fibrils or inhibit their formation, resulting in smaller structures that can be mobilized from the connective tissue and eliminated by the kidneys (10Ravid M. Kedar I. Sohar E. Lancet. 1977; 1: 730-731Abstract PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Me2SO was also shown to inhibit the accumulation of PrPSc in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (11Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting that Me2SO, in its function as a “chemical chaperone,” stabilized the conformation of PrPC molecules, thereby preventing them from undergoing the conformational changes required for the conversion of PrPCto PrPSc.In this work, we investigated whether the hallmark properties of PrPSc, i.e. resistance to proteases and insolubility in detergents, are affected by in vitrotreatment with Me2SO. These biochemical properties of PrP have been traditionally linked to the presence of prion infectivity (12Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5898-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), although in some experimental setups, protease-resistant PrP could not be found in samples that contain prion infectivity (13Lasmezas C.I.

Interestingly, it was shown lately that in prion strains with long incubation times, PrPSc is considerably less resistant to proteases than in short incubation time strains (16Safar J. Wille H.

Me2SO, although it can inhibit the aggregation of protease-resistant PrP molecules, could not solubilize previously aggregated PrPSc. These soluble PrP27–30 molecules will aggregate upon the removal of Me2SO, albeit not to the characteristic rod structure obtained when scrapie brain membranes are extracted with Sarkosyl and digested with proteinase K (PK) (17McKinley M.P. Meyer R.K. Kenaga L. Rahbar F. Cotter R. Serban A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When inoculated into hamster brains, only traces of scrapie infectivity were associated with this prion-specific isoform.RESULTS10- μl microsomes (20Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A.

Me2SO was removed from the supernatants by methanol precipitation, and pellets were rinsed once with 70% methanol. Ethanol or methanol precipitation are established methods to precipitate PrPSc and prions for infectivity assays as well as for biochemical manipulations (22Prusiner S.B. Groth D. Serban A. Stahl N.

All samples were resuspended in STE with 2% Sarkosyl, incubated with proteinase K (40 μg/ml, 1 h, 37 °C), and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with αPrP mAb 3F4 (26Kascsak R.J.

Proteinase K completely digests PrPC and concomitantly converts PrPSc into PrP27–30(1). In the presence of Me2SO (Fig. 1, lane 1), a considerable part of the protease-resistant PrP remained in the supernatant; otherwise almost all of it pelleted in the high speed spin (lane 3). Me2SO was almost ineffective in solubilizing PrPSc if added 2 h after the detergent, when most PrPSc molecules were already aggregated (comparelanes 2 and 4). This suggests that although Me2SO can inhibit PrPSc aggregation, it does not solubilize previously aggregated PrPSc. Me2SO was also unable to solubilize purified PrP27–30 or PrPSc 33–35, which are already aggregated (not shown).To test whether the results obtained in Fig. 1 resulted from thein vitro conversion of PrPC to a protease-resistant species by the Me2SO treatment or whether traces of Me2SO inhibit the activity of PK, microsomes from scrapie-infected hamster brains were pretreated with PK before the incubation in the presence or absence of Me2SO. The effect of Me2SO on PrPSc aggregation was identical regardless of whether Me2SO was applied before or after digestion with PK (Fig. 2). We conclude therefore that Me2SO does not confer protease resistance to otherwise PK-sensitive PrP molecules but rather inhibits the aggregation of PrPSc molecules. Whether Me2SO just reveals and amplifies a pre-existing difference between two populations of PrPSc molecules (such as preaggregation) or actively partitions PrPSc molecules into two distinct populations remains to be established.Figure 2Me2SO (DMSO) inhibits the aggregation of PrP27–30 molecules. Membranes from scrapie-infected hamsters were incubated with Sarkosyl and in the presence (lanes b and d) and absence (lanes a and c) of Me2SO (as in Fig. 1). The samples presented in lanes a and b were digested for 1 h with 40 μg/ml PK before the addition of Me2SO and Sarkosyl. In lanes c and d, samples were digested with PK after Me2SO treatment (as in Fig. 1). After Me2SO incubation and PK treatment (or vice versa), all samples were centrifuged and immunoblotted as in Fig. 1.Lanes a–d represent the supernatants of all samples after the centrifugation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To estimate the degree of aggregation of Me2SO-solubilized PrPSc, normal and scrapie-infected hamster brain microsomes were incubated for 16 h in Sarkosyl in the presence or absence of Me2SO, and the resulting lysates were sedimented through 10–60% sucrose gradients containing 2% Sarkosyl. Molecules migrating to the bottom of such gradients are either in very large aggregates or of very large molecular weight, and detergent-soluble proteins of small size are expected to remain in the upper gradient fractions. As can be seen in Fig. 3, PrPC from normal microsomes, which solubilizes readily in the presence of detergents (20Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc.

In addition, the incubation of PrPC with Me2SO treatment did not convert the normal prion isoform into protease-resistant PrP (Fig. 3,a–d).Figure 3Me2SO-solubilized PrPSc presents as a low density oligomer.

McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), yielded a bimodal PrP distribution in the absence of Me2SO; about half of the PrP (presumably PrPC) was found in the top of the gradient, whereas the rest migrated to the bottom (Fig. 3 e). However, only the PrP at the bottom of the gradient resisted the action of proteinase K, as expected from PrPSc (Fig.3 f).When Me2SO was present during the lysis of scrapie microsomes, a profound change in the distribution of protease-resistant PrP was observed (Fig. 3 h). A considerable portion of the PrP molecules at the top of the gradient resisted proteinase K-catalyzed proteolysis, which instead produced PrP27–30, the protease-resistant core of PrPSc. Thus, the action of Me2SO on scrapie microsomes yielded protease-resistant, prion-specific PrP structures that are contained in low degree oligomers.To reinforce the conclusion that the Me2SO-soluble PrP27–30 is the protease-resistant core of PrPSc and not a partially resistant PrPC promoted either by the Me2SO incubation or by methanol precipitation, the three lightest fractions from sucrose gradients c andg, respectively, in Fig. 3 were combined, precipitated with methanol, resuspended in Sarkosyl, and subsequently digested with low PK concentrations for short periods. It has been shown lately that under such mild conditions of PK digestion, PrPC reveals a PK-resistant core of a lower M r than PrP27–30, since the 3F4 epitope (residues 108–111) is absent from this peptide (27Buschmann A. Kuczius T. Bodemer W. Groschup M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 25: 693-702Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These PK-digested samples were immunoblotted either with mAb 3F4 or with mAb 13A5, which reacts with residue 138 of hamster PrP. As can be seen in Fig. 4, while in the protease-resistant core of Me2SO-treated PrP in the scrapie fractions, both epitopes were present after 1 h PK digestion, and this was not the case for PrP from normal brain. These results show that Me2SO-solubilized PrP from scrapie brains was indeed PrPSc which, unlike PrPC, produced upon mild or harsh PK digestion a protease-resistant core of the same molecular weight as aggregated PrPSc (see also Figs. 3 and 8). In addition, these results also show that methanol precipitation does not confer or reduce protease resistance.Figure 4Me2SO-solubilized PK-resistant PrP is not derived from PrPC. Membranes from normal and scrapie-infected hamsters were incubated in the presence of Me2SO and subjected to sucrose gradients as described in Fig. 3 and under “Experimental Procedures.” The three lightest fractions from the normal and the scrapie gradient were combined, precipitated by methanol (4 volumes), and subsequently resuspended in STE + 2% Sarkosyl before PK digestion at 20 μg/ml for 0, 5, 10, or 60 min and immunoblotting with either mAb 3F4 (a) or mAb 13A5 (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8Prion infectivity is mostly associated with rods like PrPSc. PK-resistant control scrapie microsomes and fractions from sucrose gradients of scrapie-infected membranes with and without Me2SO as in Fig. 3 were precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol and resuspended so that they contain identical concentrations of PrP27–30. Light fractions prepared without Me2SO, which do not contain PrP27–30, were diluted similarly as the Me2SO light fractions. 50 μl of sampleC and bars 1–4 in the immunoblot, shown in the figure, were inoculated into Syrian hamster brains and monitored for signs of prion infection. Infectivity titers were calculated from incubation time (days) according to Prusiner et al. (29Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G.

The rationale of this experiment is that although monomeric PrPSc will not cross-link, aggregated PrPSc will cross-link heavily and thereby not enter the polyacrylamide gel. Indeed, as can be seen in Fig. 5, while treatment of the heavy fractions from the Me2SO gradient with DSS resulted in a reduction in the PrP27–30 band seen by 3F4 immunoblotting, PrP27–30 in the light fractions was resistant to cross-linking.Figure 5Me2SO-solubilized PrPSc does not cross-link. Me2SO-treated scrapie-infected membranes were subjected to a sucrose gradient as in Fig. 3. Fractions from this gradient were incubated in the presence or absence of 125 μm DSS for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m glycine. Samples were subjected to immunoblotting with mAb 3F4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test whether Me2SO-solubilized PrPScmolecules will either aggregate or remain soluble following the removal of Me2SO, fractions from the top and from the bottom of sucrose gradients were incubated with PK and then precipitated with methanol. Me2SO is very soluble in this alcohol. Methanol pellets of top and of bottom fractions were resuspended in 2% Sarkosyl, and suspensions were either incubated overnight at 4 °C or mixed prior to incubation. Suspensions were then resolved again in the same kind of sucrose gradient. Most of the soluble protease-resistant PrP27–30 (from the top fractions) sedimented to the bottom of the gradient under these conditions (Fig. 6). These results show that the Me2SO-solubilized PrP retained its propensity to aggregate upon Me2SO removal. When, instead of removal by methanol precipitation, Me2SO was dialyzed from the light fractions at 4 °C against a Sarkosyl containing buffer, only part of the PrP27–30 could be recovered from the dialysis tube. Aggregated PrPSc or PrP27–30 molecules are known for their nonspecific adhesion properties (28Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Groth D.F. Bowman K.A. Mock N.I. Cochran S.P. Masiarz F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6675-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Even under these conditions, only a fraction of the recoverable protease-resistant PrP was present in the light fractions of the new sucrose gradient (Fig. 6 d), suggesting the reaggregation of PrP27–30 upon Me2SO removal precipitation is an intrinsic property of Me2SO-solubilized PrPSc.Figure 6Me2SO-solubilized PrP becomes insoluble after Me2SO removal.

The three lightest and heaviest fractions (out of 12) of each gradient were combined, concentrated by methanol, and then resuspended in 10% bovine serum albumin in saline. The same protocol was applied on a control sample consisting of scrapie brain microsomes. Before inoculation, the control, both heavy fractions, as well as the light fraction of the Me2SO gradient were adjusted by dilution to contain comparable concentrations of PrP27–30 (as judged by immunoblotting with the mAb 3F4). The light fraction prepared in the absence of Me2SO, which did not contain visible PrPSc, was diluted for inoculation identically to the Me2SO-treated light fraction. Parallel samples were re-digested with PK and were shown to be identically resistant to digestion as the ones inoculated into hamsters. All samples were inoculated intracerebrally, and the hamsters were monitored for clinical signs of scrapie. The results are summarized in Fig.8. Regardless of the Me2SO treatment, most of the infectivity (<99%) was found in the heavy fractions (that contained rods), whereas only about 1% of the infectivity was associated with light fractions. Thus, Me2SO-soluble PrP27–30 was associated with very low, if any, prion infectivity. Interestingly, although the amount of protease-resistant PrP present in the light fractions prepared in the presence of Me2SO was at least 100 times higher than in the light fractions without Me2SO (as judged by immunoblotting), no significant difference in the infectivity associated with these fractions could be observed.A possible explanation for the infectivity results presented above is that Me2SO produced a profound change in the conformation of PrPSc, therefore generating a new prion strain (30Bruce M.E. Dickinson A.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Pattison I.H. Millson G.C. J. Comp. Pathol. 1961; 71: 101-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

However, since there is a residual infectivity in the light fractions of untreated microsomes, these results do not rule out the presence, in the Me2SO-treated samples, of a new prion strain with a much longer incubation time than that of the parent Sc263 strain.Figure 9a, PrPSc banding pattern in brains of hamsters inoculated with Me2SO-treated or untreated samples.

Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which PrPC converts into the scrapie isoform of the prion protein, as well as the specific role of the PrP isoforms before and during the disease, is still unknown. A puzzling point to the prion hypothesis is the lack of correlation between the number of PrPSc molecules in a sample and its infectivity as revealed by animal bioassays. In most cases, the infectious unit is associated with as many as 105 PrPSc molecules (36Beekes M. Baldauf E. Diringer H. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, in some cases, prion infectivity was transmitted even in the apparent absence of protease-resistant PrPSc molecules (13Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.P. Robain O. Jaegly A. Beringue V. Peyrin J.M.

We interpret these results as further evidence that a proton is transferred from Glu-46 to the coumaric acid chromophore of PYP, during pB formation. One cannot exclude the possibility, however, that this transfer proceeds through the bulk aqueous phase. Simultaneously, an amino acid side chain(s) (e.g. His-108) changes from a buried to an exposed position.

This ultimately leads to a modulation of the direction of rotation of the flagella of the photoreceptor-producing cell. The chromophore is present in the anionic form in the ground state (pG) of PYP (9Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D.

The anionic phenolate is buried within the hydrophobic core of PYP and is stabilized via a hydrogen-bonding network involving the amino acids Tyr-42, Thr-50, and (protonated) Glu-46 (9Borgstahl G.E.O.

The photocycle of PYP can be observed in a wide range of pH values, although significant effects on the rates of the transitions are observed (13Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L.

One aspect that has not yet been clearly resolved, however, is the involvement of net proton uptake/release during the transitions of the PYP photocycle. In an early study (23Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) it was reported that during the lifetime of pB, PYP takes up a proton from solution. In a subsequent paper (13Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) the observation of proton uptake in parallel with pB formation was confirmed. The proton uptake was interpreted as the result of protonation of the chromophore after its exposure to solvent (8Genick U.K. Borgstahl G.E. Ng K. Ren Z. Pradervand C. Burke P.M. Srajer V. Teng T.Y. Schildkamp W. McRee D.E. Moffat K. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1471-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In pR, at 77 K, the hydrogen bond between the chromophore and Glu-46 remains intact, as has been demonstrated with Fourier transform infrared (18Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and x-ray diffraction (24Genick U.K. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. Canestrelli I.L. Getzoff E.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This finding led to the proposal (18Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) that isomerization of the 4-hydroxycinnamic acid chromophore occurs through a two-bond isomerization reaction, which is characterized by a rotation of the carbonyl group of the chromophore around the long axis of the 4-hydroxycinnamic acid. In addition, it was proposed that during pB formation, proton transfer occurs from Glu-46 to the chromophore. Subsequent extension of these Fourier transform infrared analyses, using isotope enrichment and variants of PYP obtained through site-directed mutagenesis, provided further evidence supporting this proposal (22Imamoto Y. Mihara K. Hisatomi O. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Bojkova N. Yoshihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12905-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, time-resolved x-ray crystallography of PYP in the nanosecond time domain indicates that at room temperature the hydrogen bond between the side chain of Glu-46 and the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore is already disrupted in the pR intermediate (25Perman B. Srajer V. Ren Z. Teng T. Pradervand C. Ursby T. Bourgeois D. Schotte F. Wulff M. Kort R. Hellingwerf K.J. Moffat K. Science. 1998; 279: 1946-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, the pathway of proton transfer during the PYP photocycle still is an unresolved issue. The two most extreme views are that this proton transfer may take place directly, within the chromophore binding pocket inside the protein, or indirectly, through the bulk solvent. As the chromophore of PYP during pB formation is protonated (8Genick U.K. Borgstahl G.E. Ng K. Ren Z. Pradervand C. Burke P.M. Srajer V. Teng T.Y. Schildkamp W. McRee D.E. Moffat K. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1471-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and Glu-46 is deprotonated (18Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 22Imamoto Y. Mihara K. Hisatomi O. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Bojkova N. Yoshihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12905-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), net proton uptake by the protein while it progresses through the photocycle is difficult to understand. Therefore, we have investigated these reversible (de)protonation reactions, using not only transient absorption spectroscopy, in combination with pH indicator dyes, but also transient pH measurements with a sensitive combination pH electrode. The latter technique has been combined with simultaneous absorption measurements. Deprotonation of bacteriorhodopsin, present in the form of purple membranes, served as a control to test the sensitivity of the set-up for pH measurements. Recombinant apoPYP and two variants obtained through site-directed mutagenesis were produced heterologously inE. coli, as described previously (15Kort R. Hoff W.D. Van West M. Kroon A.R. Hoffer S.M. Vlieg K.H. Crielaard W. Van Beeumen J.J. Hellingwerf K.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3209-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). ApoPYP was reconstituted with the anhydride derivative of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid according to Imamoto et al. (16Imamoto Y. Ito T. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The obtained PYP was used after removal of its polyhistidine tail. Purple membranes were kindly provided by D. Oesterhelt (MPI, Martinsried, Germany). 4-Hydroxycinnamic acid was obtained from Sigma. All other materials were reagent grade and were obtained from commercial sources. The PYP variants E46Q and H108F were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the mega-primer method (26Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The gene products were first screened, using restriction analyses, and mutagenesis was subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing. UV/Vis static and transient absorption spectra were recorded with a model 8453 Hewlett Packard diode array spectrophotometer (Portland, OR), which has a time resolution of 0.1 s. Typically UV/Vis spectra from 250 to 550 nm were recorded every 0.1 s. Laser-induced transient absorption spectra were measured with a system composed of a Continuum Surelite I-10 YAG laser (output intensity 140 mJ at 355 nm), a Continuum Surelite OPO (output range 410–2200 nm, set at 446 nm), and a LP900 Spectrometer, custom made by Edinburgh Instruments Ltd. (Edinburgh, UK). The spectrometer contains a 450-watt short arc Xe lamp in combination with a pulsed power supply and a Peltier cooled CCD camera (Wright Instruments). The time resolution attainable with this set-up is 10 ns. pH measurements were carried out with a Mettler Toledo micro(combination)-electrode (InLab 423) connected to a Dulas Engineering amplifier (input impedance > 1013ohms). The amplified signal was fed into a linear strip-chart recorder (Kipp & Zonen, Delft, The Netherlands, type BD41). A battery driven back-off box was used to decrease the signal to the appropriate size. pH changes were converted into moles of protons by calibration with microliter amounts of 2.5 mm oxalic acid. Simultaneously, the absolute pH of the solution was visualized on the display of the pH meter. The electrode was calibrated with calibration buffers of pH 4.01, 6.98, and 9.18 (Yokogawa Europe BV, Amersfoort, The Netherlands). The electrode signal was usually recorded at 0.025–0.1 pH units full scale sensitivity. Absorption and pH signals were measured simultaneously by placing a “Kraayenhof vessel” (27Kraayenhof R. Schuurmans J.J. Valkier L.J. Veen J.P. Van Marum D. Jasper C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in the sample compartment of the Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrophotometer. Two of the four available ports of the vessel were used for the measuring beam of the spectrophotometer, and a third one was used for the combination pH electrode. Measurements were carried out at room temperature (between 291 and 293 K). Although this vessel is equipped with Peltier temperature control, this was not used to reduce temperature artifacts (see “Results”). Continuous actinic illumination was provided through the fourth port of the vessel by a Schott KL1500 light source (containing a 150-watt halogen lamp). PYP was routinely used at a concentration of 33 μm in a working volume of 1.8–2 ml using an unbuffered solution containing 1 m KCl. As a first test for the occurrence of reversible (de)protonation reactions linked to the photocycle of PYP, transient absorption spectra were recorded in an unbuffered suspension of PYP at pH 6 in the presence of the pH indicator dye bromcresol purple. In complete agreement with earlier observations (23Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it was observed that at this pH PYP caused a reversible alkalization of the medium upon actinic illumination, which in time parallels the formation and decay of the pB intermediate (Fig.1 A). Because it has been demonstrated that PYP exposes hydrophobic contact surface when it is present in the pB state (28Van Brederode M.E. Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Groot M.-L. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 365-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Hoff W.D. Xie A. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Tang X. Gural J. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and pH indicators might bind to such sites, similar measurements were performed in a solution buffered with 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0). Fig. 1 B shows that under these conditions bromcresol purple does not reveal any transient absorption signal, which implies that no pH change nor any artifact based upon nonspecific binding of the indicator to the pB form of PYP occurs. Because E. halophila is an alkaliphilic bacterium and therefore most probably has a slightly alkaline cytoplasm (30Booth I.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 359-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next tested the universality of these observations by performing similar experiments with the pH indicator dye cresol red, which has a pK of 8. The analyses given in Fig. 1, panel Cshows, however, that at pH 8 significant pH changes are not observed, but the photocycle intermediate is formed in an amount comparable with the experiment performed at pH 6 (Fig. 1 A). Because analysis of PYP (de)protonation with the use of pH indicator dyes is limited to the region around the pKof such dyes, we decided to use direct measurement with a pH electrode to investigate the pH dependence of the reversible protonation, as observed with PYP at pH 6. Initial experiments to test the sensitivity of the set-up were performed with unbuffered solutions of purple membrane (containing bacteriorhodopsin at a concentration of 130 μm, in 3 m KCl). These experiments revealed that the pH signal showed random noise (2.5·10−4 pH units), on top of a very slowly decaying drift, and confirmed the pH dependence of proton release by bacteriorhodopsin and the stimulation of this proton release by increasing salt concentrations (data not shown; see also Ref. 31Renthal R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Initial experiments with PYP revealed that pH changes could also be observed in unbuffered solutions containing micromolar concentrations of PYP using the pH electrode (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the sign of the PYP-dependent pH change was dependent on the absolute pH (compare panels A and B of Fig.2), whereas the sign of the drift in the pH, caused by the light-induced heating, was not. The latter was shown in experiments in which PYP was replaced by an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin (data not shown). For quantitative evaluation of these experiments, it is important to distinguish between these heating artifacts by the actinic illumination and actual proton uptake/release by PYP. The Peltier temperature control of the Kraayenhof vessel responded slowly to the light-induced change in temperature of the solution in the vessel, thus causing an oscillating signal from the pH electrode (data not shown). Therefore, this temperature control system was switched off in all subsequent experiments, and the PYP-mediated pH changes were calculated from the pH recordings after correction for the light-induced heating of the sample, which caused an apparent change in the drift of the pH electrode (Fig. 2, A and B). The response time of the electrode (t 0.9) to additions of small amounts of oxalic acid is ∼10 s, because of the mixing time in the vessel. The pH response upon illumination, however, is immediate (i.e. within 1 s). The contribution of PYP to the light-induced pH change can therefore be calculated from the measured pH changes by back extrapolation to the time of switching on the light, as shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Under most conditions, however, very little correction for this light-induced heating was necessary (Fig. 2 C). The minimal amount of actinic illumination required for the maximal extent of pB formation was determined at pH 4.5 by parallel absorbance measurements (see below). The intensity of the actinic illumination was adjusted by variation of the voltage on the Schott KL1500 light source. Absorbance changes of PYP (from 250 to 550 nm) were recorded every 0.1 s, simultaneously with the pH measurements. There was no measurable interference of the actinic illumination (as we concluded from experiments at slightly alkaline pH (pH ± 8) with wild type PYP and in the alkaline pH range with the E46Q mutant protein (see Figs. 3 and 5)). With this set-up, rates of (de)protonation and pG bleaching and recovery can be measured that are slower than ∼5 s−1. Fig. 2 C shows the result of a typical simultaneous recording of the pH and the absorbance (of which only the value at 446 nm is plotted).Figure 5PH dependence of the light-induced reversible (de)protonation of wild type PYP and the H108F and E46Q mutant forms. Data as shown in Fig. 3 for wild type PYP were recorded for the H108F and E46Q proteins as well and plotted for all three as the calculated H+/pB molar ratio: ●, wild type PYP; ▪, E46Q; ▴, H108F. The lines through the data points for wild type PYP and H108F are fitted curves, based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using n (the number of protons involved in the transition) = 1. The pK values obtained for wild type PYP and H108F are 6.6 and 5.5 for the titration between pH 8 and 5, respectively. For the titration between pH 8 and 10.5, these values are >10.2 and >10, respectively. When the data points for wild type PYP between pH 5 and 8 are fitted without fixing the n value, the fit yields n = 1.2 and pK = 6.6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The pB intermediate is by far the longest living intermediate of PYP at all pH values tested so far. Therefore, to a good approximation (compare Refs. 32Miller A. Leigeber H. Hoff W.D. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1141: 190-196Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 33Oesterhelt D. Hess B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the photocycle of PYP can be simplified to a two-state photocycle in which only the ground state pG and the intermediate pB are taken into consideration. The amount of pB formation can then be calculated from these transient absorbance measurements by taking pB(%)=1−A446lA446d×100in which the superscripts l and d refer to the steady state reading of the absorbance at 446 nm in the light and the dark, respectively. By analyzing the changes in pH induced by illumination of PYP in the range of pH 4–11, it was revealed that PYP transiently takes up protons at acidic pH but releases protons at alkaline pH (Fig. 3). In addition, in a wide pH range at slightly alkaline pH only a very small (de)protonation was observed. The inversion of the signal of the light-induced pH change could even be effected by having the sample (making use of the slight pH drift) go through the pH transition range (∼pH 7.8). Changes in the protonation level of PYP cannot be measured outside of the pH range from 4 to 11, because at a pH < 4.0 significant amounts of pBdarkare formed (14Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Gural J. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1322: 151-162Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and at pH > 11 the thiol ester linkage in PYP starts to hydrolyze at a significant rate (34Hoff W.D. Devreese B. Fokkens R. Nugteren-Roodzant I.M. Van Beeumen J. Nibbering N. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The noise on the signal from the pH electrode increases slightly at alkaline pH, but it is always less than 0.05 H+/PYP in the set-up used. Calculation of the amount of pB formed under these conditions shows that it varies between 85 (at acidic pH) and 20% (at neutral pH). The variation in this amount is primarily because of the pH dependence of the rate of the pG recovery reaction (13Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Gural J. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1322: 151-162Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These data can then be used to calculate the number of protons taken up or released per molecule of pB formed. This calculation leads to the conclusion that this number is ∼1 at low pH and >1 at high pH. The calculations at alkaline pH, however, are complicated by changes in the spectral characteristics of pB (see below). One of the groups that may contribute to the inversion from reversible proton uptake (at low pH) to reversible proton release at high pH in PYP is the phenolate moiety of the chromophore. Evidence suggests that the chromophore of PYP is exposed to solvent when the protein is in the pB state (8Genick U.K. Borgstahl G.E. Ng K. Ren Z. Pradervand C. Burke P.M. Srajer V. Teng T.Y.

Biophys. 1993; 306: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because phenolates generally have a pK around 9, one might anticipate that the chromophore in the pB state could not be protonated at pH values above 9. We therefore analyzed in detail the light-induced absorbance difference spectra of PYP in the alkaline pH range. The results obtained indeed show a transition from the known pB difference spectrum at neutral pH (with an absorbance maximum at 355 nm (4Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Van Ramesdonk J. Van Brederode M.E. Brouwer A.M. Fitch J.C. Meyer T.E. Van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1691-1705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)) to a difference spectrum with a component that absorbs maximally at 420 nm, which is indicative of the presence of a phenolate anion (Fig.4 and Ref. 34Hoff W.D.

A similar transition in the spectrum of pB was also detected with laser-induced transient absorbance measurements (data not shown). The latter experiments, however, are more complicated because they require (for technical reasons) that the sample be kept at the very alkaline pH for a longer period, which causes interference with the measurements through thiol ester hydrolysis (5Hoff W.D.

https://openalex.org/W2100629398,"Many Gs-coupled receptors can activate both cAMP and Ca2+ signaling pathways. Three mechanisms for dual activation have been proposed. One is receptor coupling to both Gs and G15 (a Gqclass heterotrimeric G protein) to initiate independent signaling cascades that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP and Ca+2, respectively. The other two mechanisms involve cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ either directly or by switching receptor coupling from Gs to Gi. These mechanisms were primarily inferred from studies with transfected cell lines. In native cells we found that two Gs-coupled receptors (the vasoactive intestinal peptide and β-adrenergic receptors) in pancreatic acinar and submandibular gland duct cells, respectively, evoke a Ca2+ signal by a mechanism involving both Gsand Gi. This inference was based on the inhibitory action of antibodies specific for Gαs, Gαi, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, pertussis toxin, RGS4, a fragment of β-adrenergic receptor kinase and inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. By contrast, Ca2+ signaling evoked by Gs-coupled receptor agonists was not blocked by Gq class-specific antibodies and was unaffected in Gα15 −/− knockout mice. We conclude that sequential activation of Gs and Gi, mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, may represent a general mechanism in native cells for dual stimulation of signaling pathways by Gs-coupled receptors.

A family of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) transduces a variety of signals across the plasma membrane by sequential interactions with receptor and effector proteins (e.g. second messenger-generating enzymes and ion channels). These interactions result from guanine nucleotide-driven conformational changes in G protein α subunits (1Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Agonist-bound receptors catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunits of their cognate G proteins to promote dissociation of α from a high affinity complex of βγ subunits. Dissociated subunits are competent to modulate the activity of effectors. GTP hydrolysis ultimately returns Gα to the GDP-bound state, thus allowing reformation of inactive heterotrimer. Sixteen distinct genes encode G protein α subunits in mammals. The family is commonly divided into four classes based on amino acid sequence identity and function: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12. Members of a newly identified family of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) 1The abbreviations used are: RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; PLCβ, phospholipase Cβ; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide; Iso, isoprenaline; βARK1, β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1; PTX, pertussis toxin; SMG, submandibular gland; SLO, streptolysin O toxin; Rs, Gs-coupled receptor; Rq, Gq-coupled receptor; Rp-8-CPT-cAMP-S, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine cyclic 3′,5′-phosphorothioate; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+. 1The abbreviations used are: RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; PLCβ, phospholipase Cβ; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide; Iso, isoprenaline; βARK1, β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1; PTX, pertussis toxin; SMG, submandibular gland; SLO, streptolysin O toxin; Rs, Gs-coupled receptor; Rq, Gq-coupled receptor; Rp-8-CPT-cAMP-S, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine cyclic 3′,5′-phosphorothioate; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+. have been shown to stimulate the GTPase activity of Gi and Gqclass α subunits, thus attenuating signaling (2Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). One of the more thoroughly characterized examples of G protein-mediated signal transduction is carried out by the hormone-sensitive adenylyl cyclase system. Relevant receptors communicate with homologous G proteins, one of which (Gs) activates adenylyl cyclase while others (Gi) inhibit the enzyme (1Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The second messenger (cAMP) mediates diverse cellular responses, primarily by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In the case of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, G protein activation is followed by stimulation of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) to generate IP3 in the cytosol, which initiates the [Ca2+]i signal by release of Ca2+from internal stores (1Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 3Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6165) Google Scholar). PLCβ can be activated by each of the four Gq class α subunits or by Gβγ subunits released from Gi class proteins (4Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Only Gi-mediated PLCβ activation is inhibited by pertussis toxin (4Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In this study we sought to learn the mechanism by which Gs-coupled receptors evoke Ca2+ signaling. Several Gs-coupled receptors can activate dual signaling cascades. For example, increases in both cAMP and [Ca2+]i have been observed by histamine acting on H2 receptors in parietal cells (5Chew C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G814-G823PubMed Google Scholar), parathyroid hormone acting on osteoblasts (6Yamaguchi D.T. Hahn T.J. Iida-Klein A. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Biol Chem. 1987; 262: 7711-7718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and isoprenaline acting on cardiac myocytes (7Xiao R.P. Ji X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) or salivary gland cells (8Dehaye J.P. Valdez I.H. Turner R.J. Am. J.

In contrast to the simple paradigm that each receptor molecule can activate a single class of G protein (10Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), activation of more than one signaling cascade could be due to coupling of one receptor type to two classes of G proteins. This model is supported by experiments in heterologous expression systems. Overexpression of histaminergic H2 (11Kuhn B. Schmid A. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) receptors resulted in stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and PLCβ. The β-adrenergic receptor (which is considered to be a classical Gs-coupled receptor) and the vasopressin V2, dopamine D1A, and adenosine A2A can functionally interact with the Gq family member, G15, when both proteins are overexpressed in COS cells (15Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 16Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An alternate mechanism for stimulation of Ca2+ signaling by Gs-coupled receptors is activation of PLCβ by PKA. In several cell types, increasing cellular cAMP with forskolin (5Chew C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G814-G823PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dehaye J.P. Valdez I.H. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1356-C1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or membrane permeable cAMP analogues (5Chew C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G814-G823PubMed Google Scholar) increased [Ca2+]i similar to stimulation of Gs-coupled receptors. In a recent study we showed that stimulation of submandibular gland (SMG) duct cells with forskolin results in PLCβ-mediated and IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from internal stores (9Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, at least in some cell types, stimulation of PKA can activate PLCβ to generate a Ca2+ signal. Phosphorylation-dependent switching of receptor specificity for G proteins is another mechanism by which a single receptor could activate more than one G protein (17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). As outlined recently by Lefkowitz (18Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), receptor-dependent activation of Gs stimulates adenylyl cyclase, generates cAMP, and activates PKA. Phosphorylation of the receptor by PKA is proposed to switch its coupling specificity from Gs to Gi. Receptor-dependent activation of Gi could thus release sufficient Gβγ to activate PLCβ. Activation of PLCβ generates IP3 (which releases Ca2+ from internal stores) and diacylglycerol to activate protein kinase C. Hence, PKA-dependent switching of receptor coupling to different classes of G proteins (the Gs/Giswitching model) is a potential mechanism for activation of multiple signal transduction cascades by the same receptor. In the work presented here we sought to determine if any of the above models applied to classical Gs-coupled receptors that evoke Ca2+ signals in cells freshly isolated from native tissues. We used vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells and isoprenaline (Iso) stimulation of SMG duct cells to show that switching or augmentation of receptor coupling to Gi could account for activation of cAMP and Ca2+ signaling systems in vivo. Affinity purified B087, C260, and C267 polyclonal antibodies specific for Gαi1 and Gαi2(Gαi1,2), Gαi3, and Gαo (Gαi3,0) and Gαs, respectively (19Linder M.E. Middleton P. Hepler J.R. Taussig R.

Pertussis toxin (PTX) (from List Biological Laboratories) was reconstituted into distilled H2O and diluted into a pipette solution containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. A glutathione-tagged fragment of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK1) was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC). His-tagged RGS4 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (22Xin X. Croy J.T. Zeng W. Zhao L. Davignon I. Popov S. Yu K. Jiang H. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27275-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of all antibodies, the βARK1 fragment, and RGS4 were dialyzed against a solution containing 100 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH) and stored at −20 °C until dilution into the pipette solution. H89 and Rp-8-CPT-cAMP-S were obtained from Biomole and BioLog, respectively. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 150 KCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH), 2 MgCl2, 1 ATP, and 0.1 EGTA. The standard bath solution A contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH), and 10 glucose. When this solution was supplemented with 10 mm pyruvate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor, it was abbreviated PSA. Production of Gα15(−/−)-mutant mice was described (22Xin X. Croy J.T. Zeng W. Zhao L. Davignon I. Popov S. Yu K. Jiang H. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol.

Single pancreatic acinar and submandibular gland (SMG) duct cells from wild type (WT) and Gα15 (−/−)-mice were prepared by standard collagenase and trypsin digestion procedures (24Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were sacrificed by exposure to a methoxyflurane-saturated atmosphere. The pancreas and SMG were removed and cleaned by injection of PSA. Minced tissues were incubated in a PSA solution containing 0.1 mg/ml collagenase (type CLSP, Worthington) before a short treatment with a trypsin/EDTA solution to release single cells. The cells were washed with PSA and kept on ice until use. The Ca2+-activated Cl− current of pancreatic acinar and SMG duct cells was recorded as detailed (21Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (26Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). The cells were dialyzed with the pipette solution for 8–10 min before the first stimulation to allow equilibration of proteins and antibodies when included in the pipette solution. Membrane potential was held at −40 mV to record the inward current. The output signal recorded with a pClamp 6 and DigiData 1200 interface was filtered at 20 Hz. Due to significant variations in the current magnitude between preparations, results are given primarily as the number of responding cells. For each protocol similar results were obtained with cells from at least three mice. Fig. 1 summarizes the signaling pathways by which Gs-coupled receptors (Rs) may trigger a Ca2+ signal. Stimulation of a Gq-coupled cholinergic receptor with carbachol (Rq) was used as a positive control. Three mechanisms were tested: (a) activation of Gα15 by Rs, (b) direct activation of PLCβ by PKA, and (c) switching or augmentation of coupling specificity of Rs from Gs to Gi. We tested these mechanisms using two Gs-coupled receptors which evoke different types of Ca2+ signals: pancreatic acinar cells stimulated with VIP and SMG duct cells stimulated with Iso. Ca2+ signaling was followed by measuring the activity of the Ca2+-activated Cl− current in each cell type. Previous work showed that pancreatic acinar and SMG cells express the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (21Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and this current faithfully reflects changes in [Ca2+]i (21Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 a shows that stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with a saturating concentration of VIP-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations which lasted for the duration of cell stimulation, as previously reported (28Kase H. Wakui M. Petersen O.H. Pflugers Arch. 1991; 419: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Maximal stimulation of the Gq-coupled muscarinic m3 receptor with 1 mm carbachol in the same cells resulted in a typical biphasic response of a spike and a plateau. This response was highly reproducible in mouse pancreatic acinar cells; similar responses were observed in 15/15 cells from 13 mice. Fig. 2 b shows that stimulation of SMG duct cells with the β-adrenergic agonist Iso caused a sustained increase in the Ca2+-activated Cl− current with no apparent oscillations. Following removal of Iso, stimulation with carbachol caused a large biphasic response. The Cl− current responses are similar in shape and time course to the previously reported changes in [Ca2+]i caused by these agonists in SMG cells (8Dehaye J.P. Valdez I.H. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1356-C1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,9Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among cells which responded to carbachol, prior stimulation with Iso elicited a response similar to that in Fig. 2 b in 19/25 SMG duct cells from 17 mice. β-Adrenergic, vasopressin V2, dopamine D1A, and adenosine A2A receptors overexpressed in COS cells can couple to Gα15, but not other members of the Gq class, and stimulate PLCβ activity (15Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 16Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This would suggest that Gα15 has the unique ability to couple to receptors which are usually coupled to Gs. Currently, there are no good biochemical tools to specifically evaluate Gα15 function in native cells. Genetics provide an alternative approach. We measured the effect of VIP and Iso on Ca2+ signaling in cells prepared from mutant Gα15 (−/−)-mice to rule out the possibility that Gα15 contributes to Ca2+ signaling by Gs-coupled receptors in SMG and pancreatic acinar cells. Fig. 2 c shows that VIP- and carbachol-induced Ca2+ signaling was completely normal in pancreatic acini for Gα15 (−/−)-mice. The same results were obtained in six out of six experiments with acini from six mice. Fig. 2 dshows that Iso- and carbachol-induced Ca2+ signaling was normal in SMG duct cells from Gα15 (−/−)-mice. Similar results were obtained in four out of six experiments with SMG ducts prepared from the six mice that were used to study the response of pancreatic acinar cells. These findings exclude coupling to Gα15 as obligatory for activation of Ca2+signaling by the Gs-coupled receptors. Coupling of Rs to other members of the Gq class is also excluded by experiments with antibodies described below. Experiments with RGS4 supplied our first evidence that activation of Ca2+ signaling by VIP and Iso involves more than activation of Gs. RGS4 accelerates GTP hydrolysis by Gqand Gi class α subunits but not Gαs (29Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar,30Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, infusion of 100 pm RGS4 through a patch pipette into pancreatic acinar (Fig. 3 a) or SMG duct (Fig. 3 b) cells completely inhibited the Ca2+ response to VIP and Iso, respectively. The control shows that the response to subsequent stimulation with carbachol was markedly reduced, as we reported recently (23Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.B. Davignon I. Yu K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Measurement of cAMP production in streptolysinO-permeabilized cells showed that inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by RGS4 was not due to inhibition of cAMP production by the Gs-coupled receptors (not shown). The results with RGS4 exclude model b of Fig. 1 as the mechanism by which Rs evokes a Ca2+ signal. In the next set of experiments we systematically tested the model for PKA-dependent Gs/Gi switching (or augmentation) of receptor specificity shown in Fig. 1 c (17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar,18Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). We first tested if stimulation of Gs is obligatory for launching a Ca2+ signal by the VIP and Iso receptors. This was achieved by introducing antibodies specific for Gαsinto the cells through a patch pipette. Antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of Gαs were used because they have been reported to block receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase (31Simonds W.F. Golgsmith P.K. Woodard C.J. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows that the antibodies specific for Gαs inhibited Ca2+ oscillations induced by VIP stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells and the Ca2+signal stimulated by Iso acting on SMG duct cells without affecting the oscillations or the biphasic response evoked by stimulation of the Gq-coupled m3 receptor with carbachol. Similar findings were observed in 4 additional acinar and 3 additional duct cells. As discussed below, infusion of Gαq specific antibodies did not effect VIP- or Iso-evoked Ca2+ signaling. Therefore, Gs stimulation was essential for launching a Ca2+ signal by the two classical Gs-coupled receptors. If PKA-dependent phosphorylation were involved, then inhibition of PKA activity should block Gs- but not Gq-dependent signaling (Fig. 1 c). The Rs in both cell types met this criterion as shown in Fig. 5. In control experiments, Ca2+ oscillations were initiated by stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with VIP. After termination of VIP stimulation by removing the agonist, very similar oscillations were initiated by stimulating the same cells with low concentrations of carbachol, which acts through the Gq-coupled muscarinic receptor. Finally, the cell was stimulated with a supermaximal concentration of carbachol (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained in 14 cells. In four separate experiments, the VIP response was completely abolished when pancreatic acinar cells were treated with 10 μm H89, a selective and potent inhibitor of PKA (32Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the ability of a low concentration of carbachol to induce oscillations or of a supermaximal concentration to induce a biphasic response was unaltered (Fig.5 b). Similarly, treatment of SMG duct cells with 10 μm H89 abolished Iso-dependent [Ca2+]i increase, without affecting the carbachol-dependent response (Fig. 5 d). Inhibition of the response to Iso was observed in all 6 SMG duct cells treated with H89. The requirement for PKA stimulation was further verified by testing the effect of the potent and selective inhibitor of PKA, Rp-8-CPT-cAMP-S. Infusing the cells with 10 μmRp-8-CPT-cAMP-S through the pipette abolished the response to VIP (n = 7) and Iso (n = 5) in all cells tested (Fig. 5, c and e). Again, control experiments in the same cells showed that all forms of Gq-dependent responses were unaffected by inhibition of PKA with Rp-8-CPT-cAMP-S. These inhibitory effects of the two PKA inhibitors argue against the possibilities that unregulated VIP or β-adrenergic receptors are coupled directly to Gi (33Asano T. Katada T. Gilman A.G. Ross E.M. J Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9351-9354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or that Gαs directly modulates Ca2+ channels (34Mattera R. Graziano M.P. Yatani A. Zhou Z. Graf R. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Gilman A.G. Brown A.M. Science. 1989; 243: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) in these systems. To directly address a role for Gi in Ca2+signaling by VIP and Iso we measured the effect of infusing the cells with PTX or antibodies specific for certain members of the Gi subclass of α subunits. Preliminary studies showed that concentrations of PTX below 20 ng/ml in the pipette solution did not consistently inhibit VIP-induced signaling. At concentrations above 50 ng/ml, PTX rapidly caused a large, time-dependent, nonselective increase in membrane conductance, as if PTX caused cell permeabilization. We therefore limited our testing to the effect of 20 ng/ml PTX on Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. Fig. 6 shows that treatment with PTX inhibited VIP but not carbachol-dependent Ca2+signaling. Similar results were obtained in four experiments. In 13 additional experiments, PTX-treated acinar cells lysed before the experimental protocol could be completed. We were unable to find a concentration of PTX that inhibited the Iso response in SMG duct cell without causing cell lysis. Antibodies generated against peptides representing the carboxyl termini of Gαi and Gαq subunits inhibit receptor-initiated activation of these G proteins (20Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D.G.

A. 1989; 86: 7809-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The results obtained by infusing antibodies into pancreatic acinar cells are illustrated in Fig. 7. Two types of polyclonal antibodies against Gi were used, one recognizing Gαi3 and Gαo or one specific for Gαi1 and Gαi2 (19Linder M.E. Middleton P. Hepler J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 ashows that infusing 17.5 μg/ml antibodies specific for Gαi3 and Gαo had no effect on Ca2+ signaling induced by Gs- or Gq-coupled receptors. Similar results were obtained in four cells. However, these antibodies were not without effect, as seen for SMG cells (described below). Fig. 7 b shows that infusing pancreatic acinar cells with 9 μg/ml Gαi1,i2-specific antibodies completely inhibited the response to VIP without affecting the response to carbachol. Similar results were observed in six cells. An important control is shown in Fig. 7 c. In contrast to the effect of Gi-specific antibodies, infusing the cells with Gαq,11 antibodies (at sufficient concentration to abolish the oscillation and largely inhibit the sustained response to carbachol) had no effect on the ability of VIP to induce oscillations. In seven experiments with cells infused with 80 μg/ml anti-Gαq IgG the response to VIP remained normal, while the response to the low concentration of carbachol was abolished and the response to supermaximal concentration of carbachol was inhibited by 83 ± 7%. Activation of Gi by Iso is further suggested by the results for SMG duct cells shown in Fig. 8. In six cells infused with Gαq,11 reactive IgG, the response to supermaximal concentrations of carbachol was reduced by 91 ± 6% while the response to Iso was not affected (Fig. 8 b). Unlike the findings in pancreatic acinar cells stimulated with VIP, both Gi antibody preparations effectively inhibited the response to Iso in SMG duct cells. Gαi1,i2-specific antibodies, at a concentration of 9 μg/ml, completely inhibited the Ca2+ response to Iso (Fig. 8 c). Infusion of only 3.5 μg/ml Gαi3,o antibodies completely inhibited the response to Iso in two cells and partially (63 ± 14%) in three cells (Fig. 8 d). At a concentration of 7 μg/ml the anti-Gαi3,o completely inhibited the response to Iso in five cells (Fig. 8 e). The findings in Figs. 7 and 8 provide strong evidence that activation of Ca2+ signaling by Gs-coupled receptors is independent of members of the Gq class. The inhibitory Gq antibodies used in the present work recognizes the predominant Gq class α subunits expressed in these cells, Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 (22Xin X. Croy J.T. Zeng W. Zhao L. Davignon I.

Furthermore, these antibodies were shown to inhibit Ca2+signaling evoked by several Gq-coupled receptors in pancreatic (21Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and other cell types (36Wilk-Blaszczak M.A. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Belardetti F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 109-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Stehno-Bittel L. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At a concentration inhibiting the oscillatory and the biphasic response to cholinergic stimulation, the antibodies had no apparent effect on the response to either VIP or Iso. This data supports the conclusion that inhibition of VIP- and Iso-induced Ca2+ signaling by RGS4 was due to acceleration of GTPase activity of a Gi class α subunit(s). The use of PTX and Gαi antibodies indicates that receptor-mediated activation of Gi was required for activation of Ca2+ signaling by VIP or Iso. It is notable that both Gi antibody preparations inhibited Iso-stimulated Ca2+ signaling in SMG duct cells whereas only the Gαi1,i2-specific preparation was effective for inhibiting VIP-stimulated signaling in the pancreatic acinar cells. This minor difference between the two systems may be attributed to cell type-specific expression patterns of Gαi isoforms or the degree of Gαi selectivity exhibited by putative PKA-phosphorylated VIP and β-adrenergic receptors. It is puzzling that the β-adrenergic Ca2+ response is inhibited completely by either Gi antibody preparation. If the β-adrenergic receptor couples to all members of the Giclass, then each antibody preparation would be expected to only partially inhibit and a mixture of the antibodies to completely inhibit signaling by these receptors. The complete inhibition of signaling by either antibody preparation suggests that partial inhibition of IP3 production by stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor had reduced IP3 below a threshold level needed to trigger Ca2+ release. This interpretation is supported by previous work showing that Iso released Ca2+ from the IP3 mobilizable Ca2+ pool (9Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) without causing a detectable increase in global IP3 concentration (8Dehaye J.P. Valdez I.H. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1356-C1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Gs/Gi switching model, activated receptor, phosphorylated by PKA, couples to Gi (18Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). This predicts that Gβγ released from Gi could activate PLCβ. Thus, inhibition of Gβγ or PLCβ activity is expected to inhibit the effect of the Gs-coupled receptors on [Ca2+]i. To test these predictions, we measured the effect of the Gβγ scavenging protein βARK1 (21Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1988; 239: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 40Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) on VIP-dependent Ca2+ signaling. Fig.9 a shows that infusing 5 μm βARK1 into pancreatic acinar cells completely inhibited the response to VIP. As we (21Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and others (37Stehno-Bittel L. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported earlier, βARK1 also inhibited the response to stimulation of the Gq-coupled muscarinic receptor. Inhibition by βARK1 was upstream of the Ca2+ increase because elevation of [Ca2+]i with A23187 strongly activated the Cl− current. Results similar to those in Fig.9 a, including the positive control with A23187, were obtained in five experiments. Fig. 9 b shows that cytoplasmic PIP2 antibodies completely inhibited the response to VIP and reduced the response to carbachol by 88 ± 11% (n = 7). These experiments indicate that both VIP and carbachol stimulate PLCβ to cause the hydrolysis of PIP2. In summary, our examination of the [Ca2+]iincrease triggered by Gs-coupled receptors supports a model for switching or augmentation of receptor coupling to extend to Gi in native cells freshly isolated from tissue. We conclude that the pathway involves activation of Gs and PKA, receptor stimulation of Gi, and activation of PLCβ by Gβγ (derived from Gi). We acknowledge that the PKA substrate(s) responsible for activation of Gi are not known but, as suggested by the switching model (17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 18Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), they could be the same receptors that were initially coupled only to Gs. We use caution, however, in referring to the Ca2+ pathway (Fig. 1 c), as a receptor switching model. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the VIP or β-adrenergic receptors could allow Gi to replace Gs but the data are also consistent with broadening of receptor coupling to Gs plus Gi. One mode for augmentation of receptor coupling can be envisioned if it is assumed that most β-adrenergic or VIP receptors are productively coupled to Gs but a smaller subpopulation are poised to couple to Gi. Effective Gi coupling would occur only when the receptors are phosphorylated by PKA. Because expression of a mutant (phosphorylation negative) β-adrenergic receptor prevented PKA-dependent activation of Gi in HEK 293 cells (17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that phosphorylation of proteins downstream of the VIP or β-adrenergic receptors are responsible for activation of Gi in pancreatic acinar or submandibular gland cells. An alternative to the assumption that mutant receptor is unable to couple to Gi (17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) is that the mutant cannot regulate its interaction with an RGS protein that may ordinarily suppress Gi activation stimulated by the β-adrenergic receptor. A role for regulation of RGS protein function by receptor phosphorylation is attractive, not only because RGS proteins exhibit selectivity among receptor signaling complexes (23Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but also because phosphorylation is not necessary for purified β-adrenergic receptors to activate Gi in vitro (33Asano T. Katada T. Gilman A.G. Ross E.M. J Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9351-9354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional experimental tools are needed to distinguish between these and other potential mechanisms. Independent of the mode of coupling it is clear that in pancreatic acinar and submandibular cells Gs-coupled receptors activate Ca2+ signaling by coupling to Gi and this coupling requires activation of Gs. An equally important conclusion is that VIP and β-adrenergic receptor regulation of Ca2+ release is completely independent of Gq class proteins. The observation that PKA-dependent switching/augmentation in receptor/G protein coupling occurs in two different native cell types via two different receptors (that generate different types of Ca2+ signals) suggests a generalization of the mechanism by which Gs-coupled receptors generate a second signal to activate a distinct signaling cascade. We thank Dr. Paul C. Sternweis for providing the Gq antibodies and Dr. Robert Lefkowitz for the βARK fragment and our colleagues for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2005628918,"Glucose constitutes a major fuel for the heart, and high glucose uptake during fetal development is coincident with the highest level of expression of the glucose transporter GLUT-1 during life. We have previously reported that GLUT-1 is repressed perinatally in rat heart, and GLUT-4, which shows a low level of expression in the fetal stage, becomes the main glucose transporter in the adult. Here, we show that the perinatal expression of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 glucose transporters in heart is controlled directly at the level of gene transcription. Transient transfection assays show that the −99/−33 fragment of the GLUT-1 gene is sufficient to drive transcriptional activity in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the transcription factor Sp1, a trans-activator ofGLUT-1 promoter, binds to the −102/−82 region ofGLUT-1 promoter during the fetal state but not during adulthood. Mutation of the Sp1 site in this region demonstrates that Sp1 is essential for maintaining a high transcriptional activity in cardiac myocytes. Sp1 is markedly down-regulated both in heart and in skeletal muscle during neonatal life, suggesting an active role for Sp1 in the regulation of GLUT-1 transcription. In all, these results indicate that the expression of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 in heart during perinatal development is largely controlled at a transcriptional level by mechanisms that might be related to hyperplasia and that are independent from the signals that trigger cell hypertrophy in the developing heart. Furthermore, our results provide the first functional insight into the mechanisms regulating muscle GLUT-1 gene expression in a live animal.

Furthermore, our results provide the first functional insight into the mechanisms regulating muscle GLUT-1 gene expression in a live animal. Facilitative glucose uptake in mammalian cells is mediated by a family of glucose transporter proteins (GLUT-1 to GLUT-5) (1Gould G.W. Seatter M.J. Gould G.W. Facilitative Glucose Transporters. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 1-38Google Scholar). The pattern of expression of these proteins is very complex: GLUT-1 is found in virtually all tissues and seems to be responsible for the basal glucose uptake (2Flier J.S. Mueckler M. McCall A.L. Lodish H.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas GLUT-4 is mainly expressed in the peripheral insulin-sensitive tissues (skeletal and cardiac muscle and brown and white adipose tissue) (1Gould G.W. Seatter M.J. Gould G.W. Facilitative Glucose Transporters. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 1-38Google Scholar). In insulin-sensitive-tissues, insulin is able to induce a rapid increase in glucose uptake, and this effect is due to the recruitment of GLUT-4 glucose transporters from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (3James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Insulin-sensitive tissues express both GLUT-4 and GLUT-1, although GLUT-4 is the major glucose transporter isoform. Thus, in the rat adipose tissue, 90% of glucose transporters expressed are GLUT-4 (4Zorzano A. Wilkinson W. Kotliar N. Thoidis G. Wadzinski B.E. Ruoho A.E. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12358-12363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a similar percentage has been observed in skeletal muscle (5Marette A. Richardson J.M. Ramlal T. Balon T.W. Vranic M. Pessin J.E. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C443-C452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A higher relative expression of GLUT-1 has been observed in rat cardiomyocytes, where GLUT-1 expression accounts for 30% of the total glucose transporters (6Fischer Y. Thomas J. Sevilla L. Muñoz P.

There are several reports (7Wang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3621-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Clark Jr., C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1971; 220: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) indicating that in the fetal heart, and also in other muscles, glucose consumption is very high during the late fetal stage and that the response to insulin increases postnatally (7Wang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3621-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, the glycogen content in fetal heart and other tissues is higher in near-term fetuses than in the mature rat (9Challice C.E. Virágh S. Challice C.E. Virágh S. Ultrastructure in Byological Systems. 6. Academic Press, New York1973: 91-126Google Scholar). This may constitute an adaptive trait that would confer protection against hypoxic stress in the fetus during delivery (10Newsholme E.A. Leech A.R. Biochemistry for the Medical Sciences. John Wiley & Sons, New York1983: 228-229Google Scholar). Given that glucose transport is a rate-limiting step for glycolysis (11Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is feasible that maintaining a high level of expression of GLUT-1 would be crucial for the fetus, because a constitutive high glucose transport rate would be ensured this way and would help to overcome any hypoxic events that may arise during birth. Thus, anaerobic metabolism of glucose would fulfill the ATP demand of the fetus during the hypoxic episode. Furthermore, the relevance of maintaining appropriate expression levels of GLUT-1 in vivo has been recently highlighted by Seidneret al. (12Seidner G. Garcı́a-Alvarez M. Yeh J.I. O'Driscoll K.R.

Genet. 1998; 18: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar); they attribute the cause of a severe human brain disorder to the existence of mutations in GLUT-1 gene that reduce the expression of this transporter, which is specially detrimental to the energy metabolism of brain. It has also been pointed out that an increase in glucose availability may be beneficial for reducing the stress during cardiac ischemic episodes (13Paternostro G. Camici P.G. Lammerstma A.A.

The expression of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 glucose transporters is strongly regulated during the perinatal development of rat heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue. We have described (16Santalucı́a T. Camps M. Castelló A. Muñoz P. Nuel A. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) that around birth and during the first weeks of neonatal life, glucose transporter expression is characterized by a dramatic change in the accumulations of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4, both mRNA and protein, in rat heart, in skeletal muscle, and in brown adipose tissue. Regarding the signals regulating these processes, we have previously shown (17Castello A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Camps M. Perez-Castillo A. Testar X. Palacin M. Santos A. Zorzano A. J. Biol.

Whether this effect is direct or not is still unknown. In further studies performed in the L6E9 skeletal muscle cell line, we have observed that the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes is associated with the repression of the expression of GLUT-1 and the induction of GLUT-4 (18Viñals F.

In these cells, the −99/−33 region of the GLUT-1proximal promoter drives transcriptional activity of GLUT-1and participates in the reduced transcription after muscle differentiation. Furthermore, we have shown that the Sp1 zinc-finger transcription factor is able to bind to a putative binding site in −91/−86 of the GLUT-1 promoter. Sp1 is able totrans-activate the GLUT-1 promoter in L6E9 cells, and its own expression undergoes down-regulation during muscle cell differentiation and in response to overexpression of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix factor MyoD (18Viñals F.

Here we show that the changes in GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 expression in rat heart are due, at least in part, to alterations in the transcriptional rate of both genes. Moreover, the −99/−33 region of the GLUT-1 promoter is also essential for the transcription of GLUT-1 in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes in primary culture and that mutation of the Sp1 site at −91/−86 region compromises the transcriptional activity. Furthermore, binding of Sp1 to this site can be detected in fetal heart and skeletal muscle nuclear extracts but not in extracts from adult heart and muscle. We also show that this reduced binding is due to a reduced Sp1 protein abundance in nuclear extracts from heart and muscle in the adult. Together, these findings suggest that Sp1 contributes to the high level of expression of GLUT-1 in the fetal heart.

Martin X. Wisnewsky C. Schwartz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12979-12985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although we introduced several modifications, described below. Nuclei were isolated from pooled hearts removed from several litters of anesthetized fetuses or after decapitation of neonates and washed in ice-cold saline. 0.25 g of rat ventricular muscle was homogenized in 25 ml of NA buffer (1 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 300 mm sucrose (Merck), 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 40 units of hrRNasin/ml of buffer), with 15 strokes in a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in the cold-room. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and mixed with one volume of NB buffer (1 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 2.4m sucrose, 2.5 mm acetate, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 40 units of rRNasin/ml of buffer). This mixture was layered onto 12-ml cushions of NB buffer and ultracentrifuged in a SW28 Beckman rotor at 27,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and the interphase were discarded, and the nuclei pellet was dislodged with a spatula in 20 ml of NA buffer (without Triton X-100). The nuclear suspension was centrifuged in a SS34 Sorvall rotor for 10 min at 2000 × g, and the nuclei resuspended in 1.5 ml of NA buffer (without Triton X-100). Nuclei were counted in a hemocytometer and pelleted at 4000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in Keller storage buffer (22Konieczny S.F. Emerson C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2423-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) containing 200 units of rRNasin/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in 200-μl aliquots of approximately 2 × 107nuclei each at −80 °C until used. Nuclear run-on reactions were carried out by incubating approximately 2 × 107 heart nuclei in a mixture containing 0.625 mm ATP, 0.312 mm CTP, 0.312 mm GTP, 0.625 μm UTP, 0.5 mCi of 800 Ci/mmol [α-32P]UTP, 300 units of hrRNasin/ml, 40 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.3, 150 mm NH4Cl, and 12.5 mm MgCl2, in a final volume of 400 μl, for 20 min at 27 °C. 2-μl samples were removed from the reactions at 0, 5, 10, and 20 min in order to calculate the incorporation of [α-32P]UTP into RNA. DNA was digested after the addition of an additional 80 units of hrRNasin to each reaction, with 75 μl of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 20 min at 27 °C, prior to isolation of RNA. This was isolated by pelleting the nuclei at room temperature for 2 min at low speed. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclei were resuspended in 500 μl of GuSCN solution (4m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosyne, 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol). Next, 50 μl of 2 m sodium acetate were added to the nuclei, prior to extracting RNA with 500 μl of water-equilibrated acid phenol and 100 μl of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (49:1) solution. RNA was precipitated with 1 volume of isopropanol and centrifuged for 5 min at full speed. The RNA pellet was washed in 70% ethanol and resuspended in GuSCN solution, followed by another precipitation in 100 μl of isopropanol. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of TE, pH 8, and 2 μl was counted by liquid scintillation, in order to calculate the activity of the RNA solution. Detection of GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 newly transcribed RNA was carried out by hybridization of the labeled RNA to membranes onto which the plasmids containing the cDNAs for GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 (10 μg of each per slot) had been previously slot-blotted. Hybridization and washes were performed as described (21Boheler K. Chassagne C. Martin X. Wisnewsky C. Schwartz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12979-12985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Isolated cells were collected by centrifugation, pooled, and then preplated for 30 min on plastic dishes (Primaria, Becton Dickinson) to remove non-myocytes, which attach rapidly to plastic. The supernatant, which contains >95% cardiomyocytes as determined by immunohistochemistry with an anti-sarcomeric actin antibody (26Sadoshima J. Aoki H. Izumo S. Circ.

Burton, personal communication. was used to seed 0.5 × 106 cells/well in 35-mm gelatin-coated plastic tissue culture dishes in culture medium (10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum in 4:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/199 medium plus 1% (v/v) antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin), 2 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing bromodeoxyuridine (100 μm), in order to stop proliferation of non-myocytic cells. A series of CAT reporter constructs containing different 5′ deletions of rat GLUT-1 promoter extending to a common 3′-end point at +134 (18Viñals F. Fandos C. Santalucia T. Ferre J. Testar X.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the −99/+134 GLUT-1 CAT construct was performed with the QuickChange™ kit from Stratagene, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide used for generating the mutant construct was 5′-CCTCAGGCCCCGTACCCCGGCCCACC-3′, which contains a two-nucleotide substitution (underlined) in the core of the Sp1 site (see below). The test plasmids were co-transfected with 7.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid pON239 (27Cherrington J.M. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to normalize for the efficiency of transfection. Cardiomyocytes were transfected on the day following isolation by a calcium phosphate protocol (25Bhavsar P.K. Brand N.J. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J.R.

Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). For the harvesting of cardiomyocytes and preparation of cytoplasmic extracts, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 300 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. CAT activity was measured by incubating 75 μl of cytoplasmic extract with 0.1 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol, 1.3 mm acetyl-CoA, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 3.5 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, extraction into ethyl acetate and thin layer chromatography (29Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) were performed. The CAT activity was quantitated using an InstantImager (Packard Instrument Co.). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described (30). Data are expressed as percentage of maximum expressing construct and represent the average of at least three independent rounds of transfection. Nuclei were isolated from adult rat ventricular muscle for the preparation of nuclear extracts essentially as described above (under “Nuclear Run-on”), although a different homogenization procedure was used, given the particular features of the tissue. Hearts were removed from 20 male Wistar rats after cervical dislocation and were washed in ice-cold saline. Atria were removed from the ventricles, and three sets of ventricular tissue of 4 g each were finely minced with scissors in 35 ml of NA buffer. The tissue was then homogenized with three strokes of 12 s each at 3000 rpm in a Polytron homogenizer (Kynematica, Littau, Switzerland). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2600 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended in another 35 ml of fresh NA buffer. The suspension was further homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjelm homogenizer with eight strokes of the pestle and then filtered through four layers of cheesecloth. The filtered homogenate was centrifuged again at 2600 × gfor 10 min. 25 ml of NA buffer supplemented with Triton X-100 was used in order to resuspend the pellet, and the suspension was centrifuged again at 2600 × g for 10 min. After this last centrifugation, all three pellets were resuspended in the same 35 ml of NB buffer (see the protocol of the nuclear run-on), and this volume was ultracentrifuged as described under “Nuclear Run-on”. The nuclei pellet was saved and processed for the nuclear extraction. Nuclei from fetal hind limb skeletal muscle were isolated as described under “Nuclear Run-on.” However, 2.2 m sucrose was used for making NB buffer. As to adult rat skeletal muscle, nuclei were isolated according to Zahradka et al. (31Zahradka P. Larson D.E. Selle B.H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1989; 185: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Neuferet al. (32Neufer P.D. Carey J.O. Dohm G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13824-13829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei from L6E9 myoblasts and myotubes were isolated as described (33). Nuclear extract preparation and EMSAs were performed as described previously (18Viñals F. Fandos C. Santalucia T. Ferre J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12913-12921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The −102/−37 probe was obtained by digesting withAvaII the −201/+134 CAT construct, purifying the 66-bp fragment, and filling in the cohesive ends with the Klenow fragment of the DNA polymerase and [α32P]dATP. Both a wild type (wtG1Sp1, 5′-CCTCAGGCCCCGCCCCCCG-3′) and a mutated (mutG1Sp1, 5′-CCTCAGGCCCCGTACCCCG-3′; mutation underlined) oligonucleotide encompassing positions −100 to −82 in the rat GLUT-1 proximal promoter were used as competitors in EMSA. When oligonucleotide wtG1Sp1 was used as a probe, 20 pmol of double stranded oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), and 10,000 cpm of the probe was incubated with 5 μg of the corresponding nuclear extracts as described by Viñals et al. (18Viñals F. Fandos C. Santalucia T. Ferre J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12913-12921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All competitor oligonucleotides were used at 100-fold molar excess. Supershift experiments were performed as described (18Viñals F. Fandos C. Santalucia T. Ferre J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12913-12921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in accordance with the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon as reported (35Camps M. Castello A. Muñoz P. Monfar M. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transfer was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel after the electroblot. An anti-Sp1 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (PEP-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 5 mg/ml dilution in 1% nonfat dry milk, 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Detection of the immune complexes with the rabbit polyclonal antibody was accomplished using the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblots were performed under conditions in which autoradiographic detection was in the linear response range. We have previously shown (16Santalucı́a T. Camps M. Castelló A. Muñoz P. Nuel A. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) that both GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 glucose transporters are strongly regulated during perinatal development in heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue. This results in changes to both mRNA and protein accumulation. The above observations led us to consider that the induction of GLUT-4 mRNA and repression of GLUT-1 during perinatal development may be due to transcriptional control. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a series of nuclear run-on experiments. These experiments were performed on nuclei isolated from fetal and neonatal rat heart, and the transcriptional rate of both GLUT-1 and GLUT-4genes was analyzed over a period of time spanning from fetal day 19 to postnatal day 20. The transcriptional run-on reactions were linear throughout the experiment (Fig. 1), indicating that the incubation conditions were appropriate during the reaction, and substrate was not limiting for the elongation of nascent transcripts. The rate of incorporation of labeled UTP into RNA inversely correlated with the age of the animals from which nuclei were prepared. Thus, transcriptional activity was higher in nuclei from fetal heart than in 15- or 20-day-old neonates. Such a postnatal decrease of general transcription in rat ventricle agrees with previous observations (36McCully J.D. Liew C.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows an autoradiograph of a run-on reaction performed with nuclei isolated from 19-day fetal heart. The signals corresponding to the hybridization of newly transcribed GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 RNAs were well above that of background (pBluescript and pGEM), thus indicating that transcription of both genes was active at this developmental stage. The data corresponding to the transcriptional activity ofGLUT-1 and GLUT-4 genes during rat heart perinatal development are shown in Fig.2. Transcription of GLUT-1 was maximal in 19-day fetal heart and had decreased by 50% at birth; in 20-day-old neonates, GLUT-1 transcription was lowest and accounted for <25% of the maximal values (Fig. 2). In contrast,GLUT-4 transcription increased markedly between the late fetal stage and 20-day-old neonates (a nearly 4-fold increase).GLUT-4 transcription levels increased very rapidly after birth, and in 5-day-old neonates were nearly 2-fold greater than those in fetal heart nuclei. As a control, total RNA was prepared from hearts saved from the same litters as the ones used in the nuclear run-on experiments and used to detect the mRNA levels of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 glucose transporters (data not shown). Thus, GLUT-1 mRNA levels in heart were highest in the fetal stage (18-day-old fetuses) but steadily decreased after birth (1- and 20-day-old rats showed 34 and 10% of the level in 18-day-old fetal heart, respectively), which is in contrast to the increase in GLUT-4 mRNA abundance observed over the same period of time (in 17-day-old fetal heart, expression levels accounted for only 35% of those observed in 20-day-old rat heart, whereas 5-day-old rat heart contained mRNA levels similar to those observed in 20-day-old rat heart). Given the similarity observed between the expression profiles of protein, mRNA, and transcriptional activity of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 transporters in rat ventricle during perinatal development, the regulation of these two genes in development appears to be regulated chiefly at the level of transcription. Our next goal was to identify thecis-elements that may regulate GLUT-1transcription and to understand how GLUT-1 expression was repressed postnatally in heart and skeletal muscle. In a previous report we showed that the −99/−33 fragment in GLUT-1 promoter drives transcriptional activity of the CAT reporter gene in the L6E9 rat muscle cell line (18Viñals F. Fandos C. Santalucia T. Ferre J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12913-12921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to consider that maybe this region would be also important for the transcription of GLUT-1 in rat cardiomyocytes. This hypothesis was tested through the transfection of a series of 5′ deletion constructs of GLUT-1promoter containing various lengths of the proximal and 5′ upstream sequence through to +134 fused to the CAT gene, into primary cultures of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes prepared from 1–2-day-old neonates (Fig. 3). These experiments showed that transcription was maintained to a high level in the constructs containing deletions from −812 to position −99 of the GLUT-1 promoter, but deletion of the region between −99 and −33 relative toGLUT-1 transcription initiation site resulted in an 80% decrease of CAT transcriptional activity relative to the −99/−33 CAT construct. As observed for the skeletal muscle cell lines, this region, which contains putative binding sites for known transcription factors, such as Sp1, AP2, and a CAAT box, ("

Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, the Netherlands1991: 119-148Google Scholar). These oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ are thought to arise from cyclical release and reuptake of Ca2+ by the SR stores and have been suggested to underlie a variety of disturbances of the rhythm of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias).Ryanodine, which is known to interfere with the function of the SR by an action at RyRs, suppresses oscillations of Ca2+ in cardiac myocytes, demonstrating the important role of the RyR and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in sustaining spontaneous activity (2Eisner D.A.

These observations are consistent with endogenous cADPR, acting to enhance the Ca2+ sensitivity of CICR, an action that may be antagonized by 8-amino-cADPR and 8-bromo-cADPR.In this study we have investigated (in guinea pig ventricular cells) the possible influence of 8-amino-cADPR and 8-bromo-cADPR on spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the SR under conditions of Ca2+ overload. The two maneuvers chosen to induce Ca2+ oscillations involved the use of isoproterenol and ouabain to generate Ca2+ overload. In addition, we have examined whether exogenous application of cADPR may itself be arrhythmogenic under certain conditions.RESULTSAlthough low doses of isoproterenol (5 nm) cause an approximate doubling of Ca2+ currents and contractions in guinea pig ventricular cells with no initiation of spontaneous activity, 2S. Rakovic, Y. Cui, S. Iino, A. Galione, G. A. Ashamu, B. V. L. Potter, and D. A. Terrar, unpublished data. high doses (20 nm and higher) provoke spontaneous electrical activity. Fig. 1 illustrates spontaneous electrical activity recorded from a representative cell exposed to 20 nm isoproterenol and stimulated to fire action potentials at a frequency of 1 Hz. In the absence of any drugs (Fig.1 A), only stimulated action potentials were recorded, and no spontaneous electrical activity was observed. However, subsequent exposure to isoproterenol resulted initially (1–2 min) in the appearance of small transient depolarizations between stimulated action potentials (after-depolarizations), which increased in magnitude until sufficiently large to elicit spontaneous action potentials (each associated with a spontaneous contraction). Examples of spontaneous action potentials recorded in this cell after a 3-min superfusion with isoproterenol are shown in Fig. 1 B. Fig. 1 C shows the effect of cytosolic infusion of 8-amino-cADPR (pipette concentration of 20 μm, dissolved in 20 mmHEPES buffer) in the continued presence of isoproterenol. Within 3 min of 8-amino-cADPR injection, spontaneous electrical activity was completely abolished in this cell, whereas the generation of stimulated action potentials was not affected. Similar experiments were carried out in a total of 8 cells. In 6 of these, isoproterenol-induced spontaneous electrical activity was completely (4 cells) or partially (2 cells) inhibited by 8-amino-cADPR within 5 min. No apparent influence of 8-amino-cADPR was observed in the remaining 2 cells. Overall, the number of spontaneous events recorded over a 5-s period was significantly reduced from 6.4 ± 0.7 to 2.8 ± 1.2 (p < 0.05; n = 8) within 5 min of 8-amino-cADPR infusion.In the cells in which 8-amino-cADPR suppressed spontaneous activity, these actions appeared to develop progressively with time; spontaneous action potentials were superceded by after-depolarizations, and after-depolarizations appeared to gradually decrease in magnitude and occur with progressively increasing delay after the preceding stimulated action potential. Such a progressive suppression of oscillatory activity may reflect a gradual increase of 8-amino-cADPR concentration within the cell.As a control for the above series of experiments, the effects of injection of HEPES buffer (20 mm) in the absence of 8-amino-cADPR were investigated. In 6 of 9 cells studied, little or no effect of HEPES was observed on isoproterenol-induced spontaneous electrical activity (data from a representative cell are shown in Fig.1, D, E, and F). In 2 cells, a slight increase in the frequency of occurrence of spontaneous activity was observed, whereas in 1 cell, a small decrease was noted. Overall, HEPES was without significant effect; the number of spontaneous events recorded before and 5 min after injection of HEPES was 6.4 ± 0.6 and 6.9 ± 0.7, respectively (p > 0.05;n = 9).In a further series of experiments, the effects of 8-amino-cADPR and HEPES on isoproterenol-induced oscillations were investigated under voltage clamp conditions to avoid any effects that might arise from changes in action potential duration. Cells were stimulated at a frequency of 1 Hz with 200-ms step depolarizations from a holding potential of −70 mV to +40 mV. In all cells studied, superfusion with 20–100 nm isoproterenol for 3 min resulted in the appearance of transient inward currents between depolarizing pulses; a representative example is presented in Fig.2. These transient inward currents are likely to be secondary to spontaneous Ca2+ release from an overloaded SR and are thought to be carried predominantly by sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange operating in the Ca2+ extrusion mode (20Fedida D. Noble D. Rankin A.C. Spindler A.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 392: 523-542Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Kimura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 407: 79PGoogle Scholar). In this cell, subsequent infusion of 20 μm 8-amino-cADPR (in the continued presence of isoproterenol) was associated with complete suppression of transient inward currents within 5 min (Fig. 2 B). In a total of 9 cells investigated, 5 showed complete suppression of transient inward currents within 5 min of 8-amino-cADPR infusion; in 2 cells, the magnitudes of transient inward currents were reduced, whereas in a further 2 cells, there was little or no change. Overall, 8-amino-cADPR (5 min) suppressed the frequency of occurrence of transient inward currents from 0.84 ± 0.08/step depolarization to 0.33 ± 0.07 (p < 0.05; n = 9) and reduced the magnitude of the first transient inward current to 42 ± 7%, that of the preinjection value (p < 0.05;n = 9).Figure 2Effects of 8-amino-cADPR on transient inward currents provoked by isoproterenol. A, records of spontaneous activity (initiated by isoproterenol) recorded under voltage clamp conditions (switched voltage clamp). The lower trace in this and later panels represents the membrane potential, clamp steps to +40 mV for 200 ms from a holding potential of −70 mV, frequency 1 Hz. Exposure of the cells to isoproterenol (20 nm) provoked spontaneous transient inward currents (upper trace) which can be seen as fluctuations in the current level between pulses (arrows). B, these spontaneous transient inward current fluctuations were suppressed by 8-amino-cADPR (records in same cell as for panel A, recorded 5 min after the addition of 20 μm 8-amino-cADPR to the application barrel of the microelectrode). C, spontaneous activity (arrows) in another cell under the same conditions as for panel A. D, failure of cytosolic application of 20 mm HEPES buffer to suppress spontaneous transient inward currents (traces in the same cell as for panel Cwere recorded 5 min after the addition of HEPES to the application barrel of the microelectrode).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast, infusion of HEPES did not reduce the frequency of occurrence and magnitudes of isoproterenol-induced transient inward currents in 5 cells studied. Results from a representative cell are presented in Fig. 2, C and D.To monitor more directly isoproterenol-induced Ca2+oscillations, experiments similar to those described above were repeated in cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+indicator fura-2, using a photomultiplier tube to collect emitted fluorescence. It was found that cells loaded with fura-2 were not as susceptible to exhibit spontaneous oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+, possibly because of the buffering action of the Ca2+ indicator, and hence more vigorous conditions were required to generate oscillatory changes in Ca2+ (see the Fig. 3 legend). In 5 of 7 cells studied, complete cessation of isoproterenol-provoked Ca2+oscillations occurred within 6 min of 8-amino-cADPR injection (20 μm) despite continuous superfusion with isoproterenol. Data from a typical cell are presented in Fig. 3. In the absence of isoproterenol, the fluorescence signal was stable between trains of voltage clamp pulses; in the presence of isoproterenol, transient deflections in the fluorescence signal were recorded between trains of voltage clamp pulses, representing spontaneous elevations of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3 A). These oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ were abolished within 6 min of 8-amino-cADPR infusion (Fig. 3 B). In the remaining 2 cells, 8-amino-cADPR infusion was associated with prolongation of the time to onset of the spontaneous event, with little change in the magnitude. In these 7 cells, injection of 8-amino-cADPR was associated with significant (p < 0.05) reductions both in the number of spontaneous oscillations per train of voltage clamp pulses (from 1.14 ± 0.14 to 0.29 ± 0.18) and in the peak magnitude of the first oscillation following a train of pulses, as determined from the fura-2 fluorescence signal (to 27 ± 18% that before 8-amino-cADPR injection). In six control experiments, HEPES was not effective in suppressing isoproterenol-induced oscillations under these conditions (data from a representative cell are shown in Fig. 3,C and D).Figure 3Effects of 8-amino-cADPR on isoproterenol-provoked Ca2+ oscillations, monitored from the fluorescence of fura-2. A, records of fura-2 fluorescence in a single ventricular cell. Excitation was delivered at 380 ± 5 nm, and emitted fluorescence was measured at 500 ± 40 nm by means of a photomultiplier tube; downward deflections represent increases in cytosolic Ca2+. The barrepresents application of a train of voltage clamp pulses from −70 to +40 mV, pulse duration 200 ms, frequency 3.3 Hz, which provoked increases in cytosolic Ca2+ with each pulse (downward deflections are coincident with the bar). Spontaneous Ca2+ release provoked by exposure to isoproterenol is shown by the downward deflection (arrow) without stimuli after the bar. B, spontaneous activity was suppressed by cytosolic application of 8-amino-cADPR (same cell as for panel Arecorded 5 min after the addition of 20 μm 8-amino-cADPR to the application barrel of the microelectrode). C, fura-2 signals showing cytosolic Ca2+ recorded in another cell under the same conditions as for panel A (spontaneous activity shown by the arrow). D, failure of cytosolic application of HEPES buffer alone to suppress spontaneous activity (arrow) in the same cell as for panel C(recorded 5 min after the addition to the application barrel of the microelectrode). In these experiments, myocytes were superfused with a higher concentration of isoproterenol (120 nm), and trains of high frequency voltage clamp pulses were employed to enhance the loading of the SR with Ca2+ (trains of 20 200-ms step depolarizations from −70 mV to +40 mV at a frequency of 3.3 Hz, with a 5-s interval between trains).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In another series of experiments, isoproterenol-provoked spontaneous Ca2+ waves propagating across the cell were recorded using an image-intensified CCD camera. An example of a spontaneous Ca2+ wave, initiated after superfusion with isoprenaline, is shown in Fig. 4 A; two waves begin near the center of the cell and propagate toward the edges in opposite directions. In this cell, cytosolic application of 8-amino-cADPR was associated with complete abolition of Ca2+ waves within 5 min (Fig. 4 B). In 12 of 17 cells studied in this way, Ca2+ waves were abolished or markedly suppressed by 8-amino-cADPR (20 μm) within 8 min.Figure 4Effects of 8-amino-cADPR on isoproterenol-provoked Ca2+ waves, recorded using an image-intensified CCD camera. A, records of fluo-3 fluorescence in a single ventricular cell, captured using an image-intensified CCD camera. Excitation was delivered at 485 ± 11 nm, and emitted fluorescence was collected at 530 ± 15 nm;dark colors represent low concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+, and light colors represent high concentrations. Images were captured every 20 ms. Calcium waves (red) are initiated near the center of the cell and propagate in opposite directions toward the edges. B,calcium waves were completely suppressed by the cytosolic application of 8-amino-cADPR (same cell as for panel A recorded 5 min after the addition of 20 μm 8-amino-cADPR to the application barrel of the microlectrode).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The spatial characteristics of spontaneous activity and its suppression by 8-amino-cADPR were studied in more detail using a laser-scanning confocal microscope operating in line-scan mode (cells loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3). In this configuration, the temporal resolution was maximized by repeatedly scanning at a rate of 2.6 ms/scan along a single line (66 μm in length) across the long axis of the heart cell. The lower panel of Fig.5 A illustrates the images obtained by this method. Each image (numbered 1–12) is composed of 512 sequential line scans with each line displayed in a vertical orientation. Thus, the horizontal direction in the image represents increasing time (2.6 ms/line, 1331 ms for each image), and the vertical direction represents the distance along the line scan (66 μm for each image).Figure 5Effects of 8-amino-cADPR on isoproterenol-provoked Ca2+ waves, imaged using a confocal microscope. A, the upper panel shows intracellular records of membrane potential recorded from a single ventricular myocyte superfused for 3 min with isoproterenol (50 nm). A series of 10 action potentials was evoked by electric current stimuli (2 ms duration) applied at the blue lines, and this was subsequently followed by a single after-depolarization (arrow). The lower paneldisplays line scan images obtained at the corresponding times. Each image is composed of 512 scanned lines (66 μm in length, scan rate 385 Hz) presented in a vertical orientation. Hence, each image has a vertical dimension of 66 μm and a horizontal dimension of 1331 ms. Each stimulated action potential is accompanied by a rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ (red), which occurred uniformly along the scanned line (images 1–6). Image 8 illustrates a Ca2+ wave that was associated with the after-depolarization; the wave was initiated near the lower end of the image and subsequently propagated along the scanned line (and hence cell). B, data from the same cell, recorded 3 min after infusion of 8-amino-cADPR (20 μm) in the continued presence of isoproterenol. No spontaneous activity was present, as illustrated by the lack of after-depolarizations and Ca2+waves.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In this series of experiments, myocytes were repeatedly stimulated to fire trains of 10 action potentials (at 1 Hz) with a 10-s interval between trains and were provoked to exhibit spontaneous Ca2+ waves by superfusion with 50 nmisoproterenol. The upper panel of Fig. 5 A shows data from a representative cell and illustrates 10 stimulated action potentials (stimuli applied at blue line) followed by an after-depolarization (arrow) that developed following superfusion with isoproterenol. The lower panel presents the line scan images obtained over this period; dark colorsrepresent low cytosolic Ca2+, whereas redrepresents high Ca2+. Images 1–6 illustrate elevations in intracellular Ca2+ accompanying each action potential, and it can be seen that the rise in Ca2+ is relatively uniform along the line scan, representing a synchronous global increase in Ca2+. In contrast, image 8shows a spontaneous Ca2+ wave associated with the after-depolarization; it can be seen that the rise in Ca2+is not uniform along the line but commences at a point near the lower end of the image before propagating along the length of the cell as time proceeds. Fig. 5 B shows data from the same cell 5 min after injection of 20 μm 8-amino-cADPR. 8-Amino-cADPR completely suppressed the generation of Ca2+ waves and after-depolarizations in this cell without abolishing stimulated action potentials or the calcium transients that accompany them. There was also an apparent reduction in the magnitude of the calcium elevations accompanying each action potential; this might be expected, as 8-amino-cADPR has previously been shown to reduce the magnitude of the calcium transient in guinea pig ventricular myocytes (13Rakovic S. Galione A. Ashamu G.A. Potter B.V.L. Terrar D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, a contribution of dye loss to the reduction in fluorescence intensity is likely also to contribute.Data from another cell are shown in Fig.6. In this cell, isoproterenol-provoked oscillations were more severe, consisting of spontaneous action potentials (Fig. 6 A, upper panel). The line scan images (lower panel) reveal that each spontaneous action potential was preceded by a calcium wave that commenced at a point near the center of the scanned line before propagating bidirectionally toward the edges of the cell. Subsequently a global increase in Ca2+ occurred along the line as the spontaneous action potential was initiated. Image 3 of Fig. 6 A has been enlarged for clarity: the white arrow indicates a Ca2+ wave preceding a spontaneous action potential. It is interesting to note that the global rise in Ca2+accompanying the spontaneous action potential was not uniform along the scanned line; instead, the region of the cell to which the wave had previously propagated showed a smaller increase in Ca2+than adjacent areas. This may be because of selective depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in this region of the cell or inactivation of the RyRs involved in the propagation of the wave. After injection of 8-amino-cADPR, the generation of spontaneous action potentials was completely suppressed, as shown in Fig. 6 B, although some oscillatory activity persisted in the form of a single after-depolarization (arrow) accompanied by a Ca2+ wave (image 3, enlarged for clarity). In total, 8 cells were imaged in this way; in 6 of these, 20 μm 8-amino-cADPR completely or partially suppressed isoproterenol-induced calcium waves within 8 min of injection.Figure 6Effects of 8-amino-cADPR on isoproterenol-provoked Ca2+ waves, imaged using a confocal microscope. A, membrane potential records (upper panel) and line scan images (lower panel) obtained from a single ventricular myocyte superfused for 3 min with isoproterenol (50 nm). Current stimuli were applied at the blue lines. In this cell, isoproterenol provoked the generation of spontaneous action potentials, each of which was associated with elevations of cytosolic Ca2+. Preceding the upstroke of each spontaneous action potential was a Ca2+ wave; image 3 has been enlarged to illustrate the nature of this wave more clearly. The wave (white arrow in enlarged image) was initiated at a locus near the center of the scanned line and subsequently spread in opposite directions along the scanned line toward both edges of the cell. The wave was terminated by a global increase in Ca2+that was associated with the upstroke of the spontaneous action potential. B, data from the same cell, recorded 5 min after infusion of 8-amino-cADPR (20 μm) in the continued presence of isoproterenol. Spontaneous action potential generation had been abolished, although some spontaneous activity persisted in the form of a single after-depolarization (arrow, upper panel) accompanied by a Ca2+ wave (image 3, also presented in enlarged form).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The actions of 8-amino-cADPR were also investigated using another method to provoke Ca2+ oscillations. In this series of experiments, spontaneous activity was initiated by exposure to the cardiac glycoside ouabain rather than isoproterenol. Ouabain has been employed in a number of studies as an experimental tool for the generation of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in heart cells (22Wier W.G. Hess P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 395-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Aronson R.S. Nordin C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 400: 113-134Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Its major mechanism of action is believed to involve binding to the K+ binding site of the sarcolemmal Na+/K+-ATPase and inhibition of its activity, resulting in a secondary rise in the level of intracellular Na+ (24Eisner D.A. Lederer W.J. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 355: 251-266Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Harrison S.M. McCall E. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol.

Lee C.O. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This in turn is thought to inhibit the extrusion of Ca2+ via sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange, leading to an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ and a secondary increase in the quantity of Ca2+ stored in the SR. The spontaneous oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ associated with ouabain toxicity are believed to be because of overloading of the SR with Ca2+; indeed, elevated levels of “luminal” Ca2+ have been reported to enhance the open probability of RyRs studied in planar lipid bilayers (28Sitsapesan R. Williams A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms may also be involved; certain glycosides have been reported to increase Ca2+entry via sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels (29Marban E. Tsien R.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 329: 589-614Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and increase the open probability of single RyRs incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers (30McGarry S.J. Williams A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been reported that ouabain may alter the ion selectivity of sarcolemmal Na+ channels to allow Ca2+ entry (“slip mode conductance”), which might contribute to increased cellular Ca2+ loading (31Santana L.F. Gomez A.M. Lederer W.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Cytosolic injection of 8-amino-cADPR, but not HEPES, was associated with a suppression of ouabain-induced transient inward currents; representative individual experiments are shown in Fig.7. In 7 cells studied, intracellular application of 8-amino-cADPR (20 μm) resulted in reductions both in the number of transient inward currents per train of voltage clamp pulses (from 1.85 ± 0.48 to 1.00 ± 0.10;p < 0.05) and in the magnitude of the first transient inward current fol"

Pseudoazurin (M r ∼ 14,000) is a type 1 blue copper protein (cupredoxin) found in denitrifying bacteria and methylotrophs. While in methylotrophs pseudoazurins were produced as electron transfer substituted to another blue copper protein named amicyanin at high copper concentration. The ternary complex among methylamine dehydrogenase, amicyanin, and cytochromec 551 shows that amicyanin accepts an electron from methylamine dehydrogenase (1Chen L. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S.

Harrison P. Topics in Molecular and Structural Biology, Metalloproteins. I. Macmillan Ltd., New York1985: 1-42Google Scholar). The copper atom is located below the protein surface at a depth of 5–10 Å, with two histidines (imidazole N), a cysteine (thiolate RS-), and methionine (thioether S) as ligands (18Adman E.T. Anfinsen C.B. Edsall J.T. Richards F.M. Eisenberg D.S. Advances in Protein Chemistry Copper Protein Structures. Academic Press, New York1991: 145-197Google Scholar). Nine of 13 lysine residues surrounded the hydrophobic face of the molecule through which the histidine ligand protrudes slightly. The effect of lysine residues for the electron transportation from pseudoazurin to nitrite reductase was well investigated by using mutant pseudoazurin from A. faecalis S-6 (19Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Ohnuki T. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The substitution of these basic lysine residues by amino acids with neutral/acidic side chains decreases the affinity of pseudoazurin for nitrite reductase, which suggests that pseudoazurin may interact with nitrite reductase through its hydrophobic patch. Moreover, the structure of pseudoazurin from T. pantotrophsrevealed that the proposed docking motifs based on the positive hydrophobic surface patch for cytochrome cd 1nitrite reductase (15Williams P.A. Fulop V. Leung Y.-C. Chan C. Moir J.W.B. Howlett G. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Hadju J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Small inorganic complexes such as [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+ (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) have been used as redox probes to identify potential binding sites on the surface of cupredoxins for electron-transfer partners (20Sykes A.G. Kyritsis P. Nordling M. Young S. Karlin K.D. Tyeklar Z. Bioinorganic Chemistry of Copper: Electron Transfer Reactivity of Mutants of the Blue Copper Protein Plastocyanin. 1. Chapman & Hall, New York1993: 78-99Google Scholar). Recent kinetic and theoretical studies on the blue copper protein plastocyanin have indicated the presence of two distinct electron-transfer sites: (i) the adjacent hydrophobic patch ∼6 Å from the copper through which one of the histidine ligands protrudes, and (ii) the remote site involving and acidic patch region ∼15 Å from the copper, with acidic residues on either side of the exposed Tyr83 (Tyr83 is next to the copper ligand Cys84). Kinetics studies with small inorganic complexes have been carried out on A. cycloclastespseudoazurin. The rate constant for the oxidation of the reduced molecule with [Fe(CN)6]3− is 103-fold bigger than that for the [Co(phen)3]3+ oxidation (21Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 3299-3305Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating a clear preference of the protein for anionic species. Moreover, the self-exchange rate constant for reduced molecule (about 3 × 103m−1 s−1) is much smaller than those of most other cupredoxins and is quite similar to that found in higher plant plastocyanins (22Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1994; : 437-443Crossref Google Scholar). A. cycloclastes nitrite reductase, which possesses many acidic amino acid residues, accepts an electron from a reduced pseudoazurin with a second-order rate constant of 7–9 × 105m−1 s−1 (5Kohzuma T. Takase S. Shidara S. Suzuki S. Chem. Lett. 1993; : 149-152Crossref Google Scholar, 23Kashem M.A. Dunford H.B. Liu M.-Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These findings are all probably due to the effect of a number of conserved lysine residues surround the hydrophobic patch of pseudoazurin. The effect of pH on the redox reactivity of A. cycloclastespseudoazurin is well documented (21Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 3299-3305Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1994; : 437-443Crossref Google Scholar, 45Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. J. Chem. Soc. Commun. 1994; : 581-582Crossref Google Scholar). The reduced protein has been shown to participate in an active site protonation/deprotonation equilibrium at His81, which gives an acid dissociation pK a of 5.2 from an NMR titration (21Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 3299-3305Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and 4.6 from kinetic studies with inorganic complexes as oxidants (45Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. J. Chem. Soc. Commun. 1994; : 581-582Crossref Google Scholar). The effect of protonation/deprotonation of uncoordinated His6 residue located near to the active site shows a pK a values of 7.2 (reduced form) and 6.5 (oxidized form) from NMR titration and 7.3 from kinetic studies of the oxidation of the reduced pseudoazurin with small complexes (21Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 3299-3305Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The structure of reduced pseudoazurin from A. faecalis at pH 4.4 has been solved and demonstrates that the ligand His81rotates away from the metal due to protonation of the N-δ1 atom (14Vakoufari E. Wilson K.S. Petratos K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Small changes were observed in the copper vicinity and on the protein surface at pH 7.8 upon reduction (14Vakoufari E. Wilson K.S. Petratos K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while distinct conformational changes occurred in response to reduction at pH 7.0: the copper position shifted, Met7 and Pro35 moved, and the position of solvent molecules changed (24Libeu C.A.P. Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13160-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Preliminary crystallographic studies of A. cycloclastes pseudoazurin were reported by Turley et al. (25Turley S. Adman E.T. Sieker L.C. Lie M.-Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 417-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but the crystals obtained were too thin for x-ray diffraction data to be obtained. We have previously reported the crystallization and preliminary x-ray studies on oxidized pseudoazurin from A. cycloclastes at pH 6.0 (26Inoue T. Nishio N. Kai Y. Harada S. Ohshiro Y. Suzuki S. Kohzuma T. Shidara S. Iwasaki H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 761-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this work single crystals of oxidized and reduced pseudoazurin with high resolutional diffraction spots were obtained at pH 6.0. During the last stage of structure refinement, the amino acid sequence was partially corrected (27Chen J.-Y. Chang W.-C. Chang T. Chang W.-C. Lie M.-Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 1R. P. Ambler and M. Daniel, private communication. We describe here the redox-induced conformational changes at the copper site, and the rearrangement of the hydrogen bonding pattern of the uncoordinated His6, which are quite similar, but not identical, to the pattern of changes found in A. faecalis pseudoazurin reduced at pH 7.0 (24Libeu C.A.P. Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13160-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The peptide flip induced by protonation at His6 is pH-induced conformational transition of His35 in azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28Nar H. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Kamp M. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The crystallization (0.1m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0)) and structural analysis of oxidized pseudoazurin from A. cycloclastes were performed as described previously (26Inoue T. Nishio N. Kai Y. Harada S. Ohshiro Y. Suzuki S. Kohzuma T. Shidara S. Iwasaki H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 761-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The data with high resolution was collected with synchrotron radiation at the BL6A2station of 2.5 GeV energy produced by the storage ring in the Photon Factory, the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan. Diffraction patterns were recorded on a Fuji Imaging Plate (200 × 400 mm, Fuji Photo Film) (29Miyahara J. Takahashi K. Amemiya Y. Kamiya N. Satow Y. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1986; 246: 572Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar) using Sakabe's Weissenberg camera for macromolecules (30Sakabe N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1991; 303: 448-463Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with an aperture collimator of 0.1-mm diameter and a cylindrical cassette of 286.5-mm radius filled with helium gas. The intensity data were processed usingDENZO and scaled with the program SCALEPACK (31Otwinowsk Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Among 222,685 accepted observations up to 1.35-Å resolution, 21,303 independent reflections were obtained, the completeness of which was 88.8% with an R merge value of 8.5%. The reduced crystals of pseudoazurin were obtained by soaking the oxidized crystals with the crystallization solution (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0) containing 10 mm sodiuml-(+)ascorbate. After 10 min the blue crystals became colorless. For more than 1 month the crystals remained colorless in the glass capillary with the mother liquor containing 10 mmsodium l-(+)ascorbate. The x-ray diffraction data up to 1.6-Å resolution were obtained using the imaging plate detector operated in the Rigaku RAXIS-IIc system. Among 58,870 accepted observations up to 1.60-Å resolution, 13,287 independent reflections were obtained, the completeness of which was 90.4% with aR merge values of 4.0%. Structure analysis has been carried out by the molecular replacement method using theMERLOT program package (32Fitzgerald P.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 273-278Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Calculations using the molecular structure of pseudoazurin from A. faecalis as a starting model were performed. The highest rotation peak was found atEulerian angles of α = 115.0°, β = 60.0°, and γ = 305.0° for 13–3.2-Å resolution data. The translation parameters were calculated in the RVAMAP function withMERLOT, and the highest peak (x = 0.45,y = 0.10, and z = 0.15 in fraction of unit cell) gave the minimum R-factor of 64.9% for 15–3.88-Å resolution data. After several cycles of theRMINIM function, the rotation parameters converged to α = 115.40°, β = 62.23°, and γ = 303.99°, and the translation parameters to × = 0.4537, y = 0.1330, and z = 0.1387. The R-factor calculated for the model structure was 47.5% for 15.0–3.88-Å data. Refinements for both oxidized and reduced structures have been carried out by using PROLSQ: (33Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 252-270Crossref Scopus (585) Google Scholar), X-PLOR version 3.0 (34Brünger A.T. Kurian J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar), and TURBO-FRODO (35Jones T.A. J. Appl. Cryst. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar, 36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The first step of the refinement for both forms was performed using X-PLOR. A simulated annealing calculation at 3000 K, further several steps of positional refinement were performed by X-PLOR using the stepwise increased data. Because of the ambiguity for the energy constraint parameters of metal atom used in the molecular dynamics refinement, somewhat unreliable copper geometries were obtained. In order to obtain exact copper geometry no restraint was imposed on the copper coordination through the final stage of refinement byREFMAC. Every stage includes model improvement followed by several cycles of refinement. Model improvements were carried out based on the Fourier maps calculated with the coefficients of (2F o −F c)exp(2πiαcalc) and (F o −F c)exp(2πiαcalc). The final structure model, further rebuilding, and cycles of refinement for the water structure of oxidized molecule finally decreased theR-factor to 17.6% for the data between 8.0- and 1.35-Å resolution with quite reasonable stereochemistry.R free (37Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) was 18.9% for 5% of total data within the same resolution range. On the other hand, the finalR- and R free-factors for the reduced structure by using the data between 8.0- and 1.6-Å resolution were 17.3 and 21.1%.

The model remained close to standard geometry throughout refinement. The final model of reduced structure includes 96 water molecules. The mean positional errors of the atoms estimated by Luzzati plots are 0.137 Å for the oxidized protein and 0.153 Å for reduced form, respectively (38Luzzati V. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar). For well defined parts of the structure, especially the β-strands, the internal side chains and the region around the metal site, the errors are likely to be lower. The quality of the final model is summarized in TableI. The program PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to analyze conformational variations from defined norms. A Ramachandran plot (40Ramachandra G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) shows that all non-glycine residues have dihedral angles falling in (or near to) energetically preferred regions. A ribbon drawing of A. cycloclastes pseudoazurin is presented in Fig.1. The approximately spherical pseudoazurin molecule has overall dimensions of 38 × 38 × 27 Å. The molecule possesses eight β-strands, forming two β-sheets, and two C-terminal α-helices. β-Sheet I consists of four β-strands: S1, residues 2–8; S2a, 17–19; S3, 30–34; S6, 64–67, and β-sheet II contains five β-strands: S2b, residues 22–25; S4, 42–44; S5, 56–58; S7, 72–77; S8, 87–92. These structural features are very similar to those of the other pseudoazurins (from A. faecalis, M. extorquens, and T. pantotropha) (11Petratos K. Banner D.W. Beppu T. Wilson K.S. Tsernoglou D.

Kasai N. Ohshiro Y. Suzuki S. Kohzuma T. Tobari J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The number of identical residues are 81/124 (65%) between pseudoazurins from A. cycloclastes and A. faecalis, 64/123 (52%) between pseudoazurins from A. cycloclastes and M. extorquens, and 54/123 (44%) between pseudoazurins from M. extorquens and A. faecalis. The three structures are so analogous, except at the C-terminal α-helices, that averaged r.m.s. 2The abbreviations used are: r.m.s., root mean square. deviations of the backbone structures among three pseudoazurins are less than 0.7 Å (0.66 Å, 0.55 Å, and 0.69 Å, respectively). A dramatic change at the copper center, from tetrahedral to trigonal, was observed at pH 4.4 in A. faecalis pseudoazurin upon reduction (14Vakoufari E. Wilson K.S. Petratos K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as in poplar plastocyanin at pH 3.8 (41Guss J.M. Harrowell P.R. Murata M. Norris V.A. Freeman H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 361-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, only small changes between oxidized and reduced pseudoazurins from A. faecalis were observed at pH 7.8 (14Vakoufari E. Wilson K.S. Petratos K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while shifts around the copper ion were observed upon reduction at pH 7.0 (24Libeu C.A.P. Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13160-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For A. cycloclastes pseudoazurin, the r.m.s. deviation of backbone structures between the two oxidation states of the protein is 0.14 Å (Fig. 2 a). The conformational differences of the copper geometries in the oxidized and reduced forms are shown in Fig. 2 b. The copper-His81 distance is significantly lengthened by the reduction of the copper center (0.19 Å) in contrast to the small lengthening of other bonds (copper-His40 (0.09 Å), copper-Cys78 (0.06 Å), and copper-Met86 (0.14 Å)). The cuprous center also has a distorted tetrahedral geometry.

The structure comparison between the oxidized form and the reduced form is performed by least square method with all backbone atoms. Despite the quite small r.m.s. deviation of 0.14 Å for the backbone, some significant differences are found. The striking finding is the rearrangement of hydrogen bonding interactions of the non-coordinated His6 and the peptide bond flip around Pro35 as shown in Fig. 3 c. The N-δ1(His6) forms a hydrogen bond to O-γ1(Thr36) with a distance of 2.73 Å in the oxidized pseudoazurin. Both the O-γ1(Thr36) and the N-δ1(His6) atoms possess relatively low temperature factors of 14.4 and 16.1 Å2, respectively. However, the imidazole ring of His6 moves through a distance of 1.00 Å and the dihedral angle between the hydrogen bond and the imidazole ring changes by 30.3° on reduction at pH 6.0. Accompanying this change the N-ε2 of His6 to O-ε2 of Glu4 distance decreases from 3.47 Å to 3.07 Å forming a new hydrogen bond (Fig.3 c). Apparently the hydrogen bonding between His6 and Thr36 is weakened. The rearrangement of hydrogen bond of His6 leads to a concomitant Ile34-Thr36 main chain peptide bond flip. The main chain conformational angles are also changed dramatically, particularly around Pro35 (TableIII). The Cα and Cγ atoms of Pro35 have moved by 0.93 and 2.16 Å, respectively.Figure 3The oxidized (a) and reduced (b) structures of pseudoazurin from A. cycloclastes with omit maps.

The copper coordination structure is changed from blue line to yellow line on reduction.

The dihedral angle between the hydrogen bond of N-δ1(His6)-O-γ1(Thr36) and the imidazole ring was changed from 0.24° to −30.1° upon reduction. Namely, the imidazole ring moved through a distance of 1.00 Å and rotated by 30.3° against the relative position of O-γ1(Thr36). On the contrary, the distance of O-ε2(Glu4)-N-ε2(His6) is changed from 3.47 Å to 3.07 Å and a new hydrogen bonding is formed. C-α(Pro35) and C-γ(Pro35) moved 0.93 Å and 2.16 Å, respectively, and the dihedral angle of Cα-Cβ and Cγ-Cδin Pro35 was changed by 30.9°. The water molecule (green color), which locates in the oxidized state with a temperature factor of 13.9 Å2 at distances of 2.92 and 2.83 Å from N(His40) and O(Asp37), respectively, was lost after reduction.

In plastocyanins and pseudoazurins the corresponding distance is longer than that in azurin, and the active site geometry is distorted tetrahedral. The O(Gly39) ofA. cycloclastes pseudoazurin, which corresponds to O(Gly45) in azurins, locates at a distance of 3.94 Å from the copper ion in the oxidized protein, and a water molecule with a temperature factor of 13.9 Å2 is found at distances of 2.92, 2.83, and 3.04 Å from N(His40), O(Asp37), and O(Asn61), respectively (Fig.3 c). Because the O(Gly39) is adjacent atom of N(His40), the water molecule forms a long range hydrogen-bonding network ranging from O(Gly39) to O(Asn61). However, upon reduction the distance between O(Gly39) and the copper ion is lengthened to 4.04 Å, which shows the extension of ionic radius of the copper center. Moreover, the water molecule is lost providing space for the peptide bond flip of Pro35. The conformations of the main chain around Gly39 is changed as shown in Table III. The extended ionic radius of copper and the reduction of the copper charge may influence the water molecule, which may facilitate the peptide bond flip and the rearrangement of the hydrogen bonding of His6. The oxidized and reduced pseudoazurins fromA. cycloclastes are superimposed on those from A. faecalis, respectively, with r.m.s. deviations for backbone atoms of 0.64 and 0.62 Å. The superimposition reveals the remarkable structural differences at the imidazole ring of His6 (Fig.4). The angles between the imidazole rings of His6 in A. cycloclastes and A. faecalis pseudoazurins are different by more than 70°. The imidazole ring rotates to the perpendicular position relative to that in A. faecalis, which enables it to form the strong hydrogen bond to Thr36 in the oxidized pseudoazurin from A. cycloclastes. The residue Glu4 is conserved in both pseudoazurin but the 36th amino acid residue is Val instead of Thr inA. faecalis pseudoazurin. Only one hydrogen bond is therefore possible between His6 and Glu4. The N-ε2(His6)-O-ε1(Glu4) distances are 2.76 Å (oxidized form) and 2.96 Å (reduced form) at pH 7.8 (14Vakoufari E. Wilson K.S. Petratos K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in A. faecalis pseudoazurin, while the distances are 2.81 Å (oxidized form) and 2.71 Å (reduced form) at pH 7.0 (24Libeu C.A.P. Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13160-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The rearrangement of hydrogen bond of His6 was not observed in pseudoazurin fromA. faecalis S-6. On the other hand, Thr36 fixes the position of His6 in the direction of O-γ1(Thr36) atom and the N-ε2(His6) is directed toward the side chain of Glu4 in the oxidized form of pseudoazurin from A. cycloclastes. Thus, whether threonine or valine at residue 36 is the clue to the appearance of redox-induced rearrangement of hydrogen bonding around His6. According to the detailed structural comparison between the oxidized and reduced pseudoazurin from A. cycloclastes, the difference in copper-His81 distance is bigger between two forms than other copper-ligand distances. The expansion of the ionic radius of the copper, 0.96 Å for Cu1+ and 0.69 Å for Cu2+, and the reduction of copper charge upon reduction results in the loss of a water molecule situated close to the active site. For this reason the peptide bond flip at Pro35 may occur more easily. The loss of a similar water molecule was found inA. faecalis pseudoazurin at both pH 7.8 and 7.0, while the peptide bond flip was found at only pH 7.0. Because the pK a values of the uncoordinated His6residue are 7.2 (reduce form) and 6.5 (oxidized form) (21Dennison C. Kohzuma T. McFarlane W. Suzuki S. Sykes A.G. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 3299-3305Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the protonation at His6 may be the cause of the peptide bond flip in Al. faecalis pseudoazurin. A similar peptide bond flip was observed in oxidized azurin from P. aeruginosa upon changing the pH from 9.0 to 5.5 (28Nar H. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Kamp M. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In this case the rearrangement of the hydrogen bonding pattern resulted from the protonation/deprotonation of His35 and induced the peptide bond flip. The vicinity of the copper site was not significantly affected by this conformational change. However, in this study all processes have been performed at pH 6.0, both forms have the protonated His6. The protonation may not be the direct trigger of the peptide bond flip in this study. Actually, the strong hydrogen bond between His6 and Thr36 is weakened, and a new hydrogen bond between His6 and Glu4 is formed on reduction. The N-ε2 atom of His6 should carry a proton on reduction because it can only be a proton donor to Glu4. On the other hand, N-δ1 may also be a protonated, but it depends if O-γ1(Thr36) acts as acceptor. Despite the small space between O-γ1(Thr36) and Nδ1(His6), it is available to add a proton on the N-δ1(His6) atom by a free rotation around Cβ-Oγ1 in Thr36 of the oxidized protein. Both the protonated nitrogen atom of His6 is consistent with the peptide bond flip. The geometrical changes at the copper center have been accompanied by both the peptide bond flip and the loss of water molecule. Because the metal site consists of the copper ion and three strong ligand atoms (two histidines and a cysteine), the water molecule may exist as a hydronium ion to compensate the excess minus charge at the copper site in the oxidized pseudoazurin. The loss of water molecule may occur for the reduction of copper plus charge. This may be the direct trigger of the concerted movement around His6. However, it may be said that both a loss of water molecule and a protonation at the remote histidine may need for the peptide bond flip, because the peptide bond flip was found only at pH 7.0 in the pseudoazurin from A. faecalis. The rearrangement of hydrogen bonding interactions of the uncoordinated His6 are observed in A. cycloclastespseudoazurin having Thr36, but not in A. faecalis pseudoazurin with Val36. An important difference between these pseudoazurins is that Thr36 fixes the position of the imidazole ring of His6 by forming the strong hydrogen bond to its N-δ1 atom. On the other hand, Val36 could not fix the nitrogen atom of His6and the hydrogen bond between N-ε2(His6) and O-ε1(Glu4) was already formed in the oxidized state. This is why a small peptide bond flip was observed in A. faecalispseudoazurin at pH 7.0 (24Libeu C.A.P. Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13160-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The protonated pseudoazurin at the His6 position indicated a relatively higher redox potential (42Kohzuma T. Yamada M. Deligeer Suzuki S. J. Elect. Anal. Chem. 1997; 438: 49-53Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The protonation at His6 is important to reduction of the protein, and then, the peptide bond flip occurs in the concomitant region from Ile34 to Thr36 upon reduction. Since the His6 residue is not so far from the copper site (12 Å), this fact might be associated with the the electron transfer mechanism.

The reduction of ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides is an essential reaction for all living cells and provides precursors for DNA synthesis. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). 1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; cw, continuous wave; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance; hfc, hyperfine coupling; hfs, hyperfine splitting; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; mW, milliwatt; mT, millitesla. 1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; cw, continuous wave; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance; hfc, hyperfine coupling; hfs, hyperfine splitting; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; mW, milliwatt; mT, millitesla. A number of RNRs of different species have been discovered and classified into three major classes (1Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). A common feature of all RNRs within these three classes is that they use radical mechanisms to reduce ribonucleotides. RNR of class Ia, found in mammals, plants, DNA viruses, and some procaryotes like Escherichia coli, consists of two components, proteins R1 and R2 (2Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar, 3Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of proteins R2 of E. coli(4Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and mouse (5Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Kjøller-Larsen I. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and of E. coli protein R1 (6Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) provide a basis for understanding the enzymatic reaction. A main step in ribonucleotide reduction, which takes place in the large subunit, protein R1, is the abstraction of the 3′-hydrogen from the ribose moiety of the substrate by a protein-linked radical (probably on Cys-439) (7Mao S.S. Holler T.P. Yu G.X. Bollinger J.M. Booker S. Johnston M.I. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9733-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 8Siegbahn P.E.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8417-8429Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since Tyr-122 in the small subunit, protein R2 ofE. coli (Tyr-177 in protein R2 of mouse RNR), is deeply buried inside the protein structure, it cannot take part directly in the substrate reduction in protein R1. A structure model of the enzyme (based on the known R1 and R2 structures) shows that Tyr-122 is connected to the substrate-binding site in protein R1 over a total length of about 35 Å via a network of conserved hydrogen-bonded amino acids, the so-called radical transfer pathway (2Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). It is believed that coupled electron/proton (H⋅ radical) transfer takes place via this pathway during the enzymatic reaction (9Siegbahn P.E.M. Blomberg M.R.A. Crabtree R.H. Theor. Chem. Acc. 1997; 97: 289-300Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The enzyme loses activity when this network is disturbed, e.g. by mutations (10Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Ekberg M. Sahlin M. Eriksson M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol.

The tyrosyl radical and its adjacent μ-oxo-bridged diferric iron center is formed in vitro in the so-called reconstitution reaction, when ferrous iron reacts with apoprotein R2 and molecular oxygen. This reaction, which results in the reduction of molecular oxygen to water, requires four reducing equivalents. Three are provided by the oxidation of the tyrosyl residue and the two ferrous irons. The fourth may come from an external ferrous iron ion via the radical transfer pathway. Schmidt et al. (12Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed recently that the radical transfer pathway in mouse protein R2 is involved in the generation of the tyrosyl radical/diferric iron site. In the E. coli protein R2 mutant Y122F, where the tyrosyl radical cannot be formed, other aromatic amino acids in the vicinity of the diferric iron center become oxidized, like tryptophans (13Sahlin M.

These radicals did not yield enzyme activity but show the existence of side pathways for the radical transfer in protein R2 when Tyr-122 is not available. The unique high stability of the protein-linked tyrosyl free radical on Tyr-122 in protein R2 of E. coli RNR has been discussed since its discovery and spectroscopic assignment in 1972 (2Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar, 16Ehrenberg A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3485-3488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by site-directed mutagenesis, the tyrosyl radical might be protected by a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids, like in E. coli protein R2; changing only one hydrophobic amino acid for a hydrophilic one leads to a drop in the lifetime of the radical by several orders of magnitude (17Ormö M.

In the present study we addressed the question whether another redox-active amino acid (for example tryptophan) may take over the role and enzymatic function of a tyrosine. In solution both tyrosine and tryptophan have similar redox potentials, 0.94 and 1.05 V, respectively (18DeFelippis M.R. Murthy C.P. Faraggi M. Klapper M.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4847-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We have constructed protein R2 mutants from mouse and E. coli RNR, 2S. Pötsch, F. Lendzian, R. Ingemarson, A.

Gräslund, manuscript in preparation. where the radical carrying Tyr-177 (122 in E. coli) is replaced by other oxidizable amino acids with side chains of different sizes, like tryptophan, cysteine, and histidine or a non-oxidizable amino acid like phenylalanine. The latter was constructed to look for side pathways or suppressed radicals as previously observed in E. coliprotein R2 Y122F (13Sahlin M. Lassmann G. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. J. Biol.

We have used EPR and ENDOR to study the paramagnetic species formed in the Fe2+/oxygen reconstitution reaction of the mouse protein R2 mutants Y177W, Y177C, and Y177F. The results underline the uniqueness of the tyrosyl radical in the catalytic reaction of the native enzyme. l-Tryptophan (indole-d 5, 98%) and 57Fe (95.2%) were purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals AB, Sweden; D2O, 99.97%, was obtained from Studsvik Energiteknik AB, Sweden. Tris buffer in D2O was prepared by freeze-drying a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.5, and dissolving it in D2O. This procedure was repeated twice. The mouse R2 protein is produced in E. coli by expression from its cDNA using the plasmid pETM2 (19Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,48Davydov A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A new modified plasmid was constructed expressing the mouse R2 mutants Y177W, Y177F, and Y177C. By using the R2-expressing pETM2 plasmid as a template, a 246-base pair DNA fragment was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with the mutated primer. The following upstream primers were used: for Y177W, 5′-CAA ATT GCC ATG GAA AAC ATA CAC TCT GAA ATG TGG AGT CTC CTTA-3′; for Y177F, 5′-CAA ATT GCC ATG GAA AAC ATA CAC TCT GAA ATG TTC AGT CTC CTTA-3′; and for Y177C, 5′-CAA ATT GCC ATG GAA AAC ATA CAC TCT GAA ATGTGC AGT CTC CTTA-3′. The downstream primer in each reaction was 5′-GAG CCA GAA TAT CGA TGC AA-3′. The changing amino acid codon 177 is underlined. The second downstream primer contained the restriction cleavage site of MluI. The resulting PCR fragment was cleaved with the restriction enzymes NcoI andMluI and introduced into the plasmid pETM2 cleaved in the same two unique restriction sites. The new constructions pETM2-Y177W, pETM2-Y177F, and pETM2-Y177C were verified with dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing. The plasmid pETM2-Y177W (pETM2-Y177F or pETM2-Y177C) was transfected intoE. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS that contains an IPTG-inducible chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene and a plasmid with the T7 lysozyme gene (20Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). LB medium (5 liters) containing carbenicillin 50 mg/ml and chloramphenicol 25 mg/ml was inoculated with 10 ml of overnight cultures, shaken (275 rpm) at 37 °C, and supplemented with IPTG (0.5 mm) atA 590 = 0.7. After a further 4 h at 37 °C, the cultures were chilled, centrifuged at 2,500 ×g for 20 min at 2 °C, and gently resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The suspensions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. For preparation of protein R2 Y177W with indole-d 5-Trp, the bacteria were grown in a minimal medium (21Åberg A. Ormö M. Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Biochemistry. 1993; 26: 5541-5548Google Scholar) including the antibiotics described above. At the time for induction with IPTG the medium was supplemented with a solution of indole-d 5-Trp to a final concentration of 0.003% (w/v). The time between induction with IPTG and harvest was prolonged to 6 h. Frozen bacteria were gently thawed at 25 °C in a water bath, and the viscous solution was cleared by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 1 h at 2 °C (Beckman l-90 ultracentrifuge, Ti70 rotor). The purification was performed as described earlier for the mouse R2 recombinant protein (19Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 48Davydov A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The R2 proteins were in the apo form (metal-free) after purification. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein R2 concentrations were measured by light absorbance and calculated using the molar extinction coefficient E 280–310 = 124,000m−1 cm−1 (19Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 48Davydov A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The proteins were kept and investigated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1m KCl, pH 7.5. The enzymatic activity of the native and mutated R2 proteins was measured in the presence of pure recombinant mouse protein R1 using the [3H]CDP reduction as described earlier (22Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In order to exchange the H2O to D2O buffer 200 μl of apoprotein was kept in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1m KCl in D2O, pH 7.5, at 5 °C. After 12 h incubation the diluted apoprotein was concentrated with a Centricon 10 (Amicon) (10-kDa exclusion size). When the volume was approximately 200 μl, an additional 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1m KCl in D2O, pH 7.5, were added to the apoprotein, and the solution was again concentrated to approximately 200 μl. The concentrating procedure was repeated twice. The reconstitution of the iron site in the mutant proteins R2 in H2O or D2O buffer at room temperature (22 °C) was carried out as follows: apoprotein R2 in oxygen-saturated 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.5, was mixed with an equal volume of an anaerobic (NH4)2Fe(SO4)24H2O solution (six times molar excess) dissolved in 50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.5. A rapid freeze quench technique (System 1000 from Update Instruments) was used to obtain time points from 8 ms to 2 s. Both the aerobic apoprotein R2 and anaerobic Fe2+ solutions were rapidly mixed and sprayed into a cold isopentane bath (−120 °C) to quench the reaction. The frozen spray was then tightly packed into an EPR tube (12Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For reaction times >2 s, the anaerobic ferrous iron solution was mixed with the apoprotein R2 in an EPR tube using a gas-tight Hamilton syringe. The reaction was stopped by immersing the EPR tube into coldn-pentane (−120 °C). Radical decay was monitored by measuring the amount of free radical versus the reaction time of the sample warmed up to room temperature and refrozen again. The amount of bound iron in protein R2 was colorimetrically determined after removing unspecifically bound iron by running the protein R2 through a Sephadex G-25 column (23Atkin C.L. Thelander L.

Commun. 1990; 167: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The apoproteins contained approximately 0.2 iron ions/protein R2 after purification. An acidic57Fe stock solution was prepared as described in Sturgeonet al. (25Sturgeon B.E. Burdi D. Chen S. Huynh B.-H. Edmondson D.-E. Stubbe J. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7551-7557Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of the protein with57Fe was done as described above except that the protein was dissolved in 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. X band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer using a standard rectangular Bruker EPR cavity (ER4102T) equipped with an Oxford helium flow cryostat or on a Bruker ESP 380E spectrometer using a Bruker dielectric ring flex line resonator (ER 4118-X-MD-5W2) equipped with an Oxford helium bath cryostat. Continuous wave (cw) ENDOR spectra were measured on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer using a self-built ENDOR accessory, which consists of a Rhode and Schwarz RF synthesizer (SMT02), anENI A200L solid state RF amplifier, and a self-built high-Q TM110 ENDOR cavity (26Zweygart W. Thanner R. Lubitz W. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 109: 172-177Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cavity was adapted to an Oxford helium flow cryostat (ESR 910). The measuredg values were calibrated using the known g value standard Li/LiF, with g = 2.002293 ± 0.000002 (27Stesmans A. Van Gorp G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2949-2952Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spin concentrations were determined by comparison of double integrals of EPR spectra with that of the tyrosyl radical in the mouse R2 wild type Tyr-177 which had been previously calibrated with a 1 mm Cu2+/EDTA standard. Evaluation of the microwave power saturation behavior of the radical was done by using the plot described in Ref. 28Brudvig G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 536-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar. The microwave saturation and the kinetic curves were fitted using the program Grafit 3.01. The correct incorporation of isotope-labeled tryptophan into protein R2 was proved by electrospray ionization or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Approximately 3 nmol of apoprotein R2 was dissolved in 1 ml of 1% acetic acid and injected into an liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-coupled electrospray single quadruple mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Sciex, Perkin-Elmer Corp., Canada). For determining the mass by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (Voyager; Perspective Biosystems Inc.), approximately 1 pmol of apoprotein R2 was crystallized in an excess of sinapinic acid as matrix. The following molecular masses of mouse R2 proteins in Da were determined (calculated polypeptide molecular mass in parentheses): native R2, 45,101.5 (45,099); Y177W R2 indole-h 5-Trp, 45,129 (45,122.6); Y177W R2 indole-d 5-Trp, 45155 (45,157.6). The EPR powder spectra have been analyzed using a program for simulation and fitting of EPR spectra with anisotropic g and hyperfine tensors based on the work of Rieger (29Rieger P.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 50: 485-489Google Scholar). Resonant field positions were calculated to second order for arbitrary orientations of the g and hyperfine tensor principal axes (14Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F. Bittl R. Fiege R. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Lubitz W. Lassmann G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8111-8120Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All three mutated R2 proteins, Y177W, Y177C, and Y177F, behaved like the native protein R2 during the growth and purification procedure; the final yield was approximately 4–6 mg of pure protein R2/liter of bacterial culture. The light absorption spectra of all three mutants after 6Fe2+/R2 reconstitution are shown in Fig. 1. The absorbance of the mutants is significantly increased in the 300–400-nm region after the reconstitution reaction. However, the two bands at 320 and 370 nm, which are characteristic for a μ-oxo-bridged diferric iron center like in the active form of the native mouse protein R2 dimer (Fig. 1 e), are not resolved in the mutant proteins. The Met form of native mouse protein R2 (19Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 48Davydov A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) shows similar badly resolved light absorption spectra in the iron absorption region as seen for the mutants in Fig. 1,b–d. Upon reconstitution of Y177W, a broad transient light absorption band in the range 500–600 nm with a maximum at 550 nm and a half-width about 60 nm appeared initially (Fig. 1, inset). This band is completely gone after 2 min reaction time, which corresponds approximately with the decay of the transient EPR doublet signal in Y177W R2 (Fig. 3, discussed below). In an earlier work (13Sahlin M. Lassmann G. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12361-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) the light absorption spectrum of a neutral tryptophan radical inE. coli Y122F R2 was described as a broad band centered at 545 nm. From the similar characteristics of the transient absorption bands centered at 550 nm in mouse Y177W R2 and E. coli R2 Y122F (13Sahlin M. Lassmann G. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12361-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we assigned the observed transient here to the tryptophan radical.Figure 3Decay of the tryptophan radical in protein R2 Y177W at 22 °C after 6Fe2+/R2 reconstitution. The data points were fitted with a single exponential decay equation (k decay = 0.015 s−1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further characterization of the amount of bound iron in the protein R2 mutants by spectrophotometric analysis showed that all three mutants were able to bind approximately 3.5–4 iron ions/protein R2. In holoenzyme studies the interaction between native protein R1 and mutant protein R2 was analyzed by BIAcore studies as described earlier (30Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The binding efficiency of Y177W, Y177C, and Y177F to protein R1 was about the same as found for native protein R2 (data not shown). The enzyme activity of the mutated R2 proteins was measured by the reduction of [3H]CDP in the presence of an excess of pure recombinant mouse R1 protein and ATP as a positive effector (22Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Neither of the mutated proteins showed any significant activity compared with native R2 protein (TableI). As demonstrated earlier and again clearly seen here for the native R2 protein, reactivation of apoR2 protein occurs continuously and with high efficiency during the assay in the presence of iron-dithiothreitol (31Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we should have been able to detect activity even from an R2 protein with a radical less stable than the normal tyrosyl radical.Table IRibonucleotide reductase activity of native and mutated protein R2Protein R2Total proteinFormation of dCDP/30 min at 37 °CμgnmolNative00.0190.53.71.08.02.09.35Y177W0.50.0341.00.0352.00.040Y177W, R1 omitted2.00.020Y177C00.0300.50.030Y177F00.0300.50.050Enzyme activity was measured in the presence of 14 μg of R1 protein (native and Y177W) or 10 μg of R1 protein (Y177C and Y177F).

After addition of ferrous iron to aerobic apoY177W and a reaction time of 3 s at room temperature, an EPR spectrum was observed at 40 K with g iso = 2.0029 (see Table II) and a dominating doublet hyperfine structure (hfs) (Fig. 2,top). The radical decays with a half-life time of 49 s at 22 °C (Fig. 3). Quantitation of this radical showed a maximum value of 0.34 unpaired spins/protein R2 dimer. The measured microwave power at half-saturation of the new radical at 30 K was at least 1 order of magnitude lower (P 50 = 0.2 mW) than that of the tyrosyl radical at Tyr-177 in native protein R2 (P 50 = 2–3 mW) at the same temperature, indicating a weaker magnetic interaction of the new radical with the diferric site in R2 Y177W.Table IIExperimental electronic g tensor (gi) and hyperfine tensor (Ai (mT)) principal components of the tryptophan radical Trp-177 in mouse R2 Y177W and Trp-111 in E. coli R2 Y122FProtein R2Tensor elementg iAi (14N)Ai (β1)Ai (β2)Ai (H5)aSigns in analogy to Trp-111· in Y122FE. coli, which have been obtained from density functional and dipolar hyperfine tensor calculations (14).Ai (H7)aSigns in analogy to Trp-111· in Y122FE. coli, which have been obtained from density functional and dipolar hyperfine tensor calculations (14).Ai (HB)aSigns in analogy to Trp-111· in Y122FE. coli, which have been obtained from density functional and dipolar hyperfine tensor calculations (14).,bPrincipal values of the hyperfine tensor assigned to a proton hydrogen-bonded to the indole-nitrogen (from ENDOR spectra; Fig.4 D).

Here we have examined their role in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These cells express ARF5 and ARF6. ARF5 was identified in the soluble protein and intracellular membranes; in response to insulin some ARF5 was observed to re-locate to the plasma membrane. In contrast, ARF6 was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane and did not redistribute in response to insulin. We employed myristoylated peptides corresponding to the NH2 termini of ARF5 and ARF6 to investigate the function of these proteins. Myr-ARF6 peptide inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation by ∼50% in permeabilized adipocytes. In contrast, myr-ARF1 and myr-ARF5 peptides were without effect. Myr-ARF5 peptide also inhibited the insulin stimulated increase in cell surface levels of GLUT1 and transferrin receptors. Myr-ARF6 peptide significantly decreased cell surface levels of these proteins in both basal and insulin-stimulated states, but did not inhibit the fold increase in response to insulin. These data suggest an important role for ARF6 in regulating cell surface levels of GLUT4 in adipocytes, and argue for a role for both ARF5 and ARF6 in the regulation of membrane trafficking to the plasma membrane.

Recent studies implicating vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation further strengthen the mechanistic parallels between regulated exocytosis of small synaptic vesicles and the insulin-stimulated movement of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the adipocyte cell surface (9Martin L.B.

Given the importance of ARF proteins in regulated membrane trafficking, we set out to identify which ARF isoforms were expressed in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes, how their distribution was modulated by insulin, and whether they played a role in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Here we show that adipocytes express ARF5 and ARF6, as determined by immunoblotting with ARF-specific antibodies. ARF5 was observed to exhibit modest re-distribution to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. In contrast, ARF6 was predominantly located within plasma membrane subcellular fractions, and its distribution was not altered by insulin treatment. Using myristoylated ARF NH2-terminal peptides to inhibit ARF action in permeabilized cells, we show that myristoylated ARF6 peptide partially inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation, whereas ARF1- and ARF5-myristoylated peptides were without effect. Insulin stimulates the movement of other proteins to the cell surface, including the transferrin receptor (TfR) and GLUT1 (26Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Strikingly, we observed marked inhibition of insulin-stimulated TfR and GLUT1 movement to the cell surface in the presence of myristoylated ARF5 peptide, implying an important role for ARF5 in the stimulated delivery of recycling membrane proteins to the cell surface. Myristoylated ARF6 peptide decreased the cell surface abundance of TfR and GLUT1 in both the basal and insulin-stimulated states, but did not inhibit the ability of insulin to increase cell surface levels of these proteins. These data argue for an important role for ARF6 in regulating cell surface levels of GLUT4 in adipocytes, and provide evidence for a role for both ARF5 and ARF6 in the regulation of membrane trafficking to the plasma membrane. α-Toxin was from Calbiochem, United Kingdom, wortmannin from Sigma, UK, and 125I-transferrin and [14C]sucrose were from NEN Life Science Products Inc. and Amersham International, respectively. All other reagents were as described (16Martin S. Tellman J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 28Martin S.

Prior to use, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. Adipocytes were subjected to a differential centrifugation procedure as described previously (28Martin S. Reaves B. Banting G. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped and homogenized in ice-cold HES (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, pH 7.4, 5 ml/10-cm plate) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 20 μml-transepoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-4-guanidiniobutane, and 50 μm aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet from this spin was resuspended in 2 ml HES, layered onto 1 ml of 1.12m sucrose in HES, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C in a swing-out rotor. Plasma membranes were collected from the interface by careful aspiration, resuspended in HES, and collected by centrifugation at 41,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from the 19,000 × g spin was re-centrifuged at 41,000 ×g to yield a high density microsomal pellet and the supernatant from this spin centrifuged at 180,000 × gfor 75 min at 4 °C to collect low density microsomes. All fractions were resuspended in equal volumes of HES buffer (cell equivalents), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C prior to use. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with IC buffer (10 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmK2HPO4, 90 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) at 37 °C, then incubated in 500 μl of ICR buffer (IC buffer plus 4 mm MgATP, 3 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing α-toxin at 250 hemolytic units/ml for 5 min to permeabilize the plasma membrane. The medium was removed and the cells covered with 500 μl of ICR buffer containing peptides, insulin, or vehicle as described in the figure legends. This methodology has been documented in Ref. 30Herbst J.J. Andrews G.C. Contillo L.G. Singleton D.H. Genereux P.E. Gibbs E.M. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

We therefore employed this experimental system to determine the role of ARF proteins on [3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose (deoxy-Glc) transport as has been described previously (30Herbst J.J. Andrews G.C.

After permeabilization and incubation with peptides and insulin as described in the figure legends, 50 μl of radioisotope solution was added to each well of adipocytes such that the final concentration of deoxy-Glc was 50 μm and 0.5 μCi/well. Also included in this 50-μl aliquot was [14C]sucrose (final concentration 50 μm, 0.05 μCi per well) so as to allow estimation of the nonspecific association of sugar with the cells. The transport rates presented have been corrected for this calculation. Uptake was carried out for 3 min, then the cells were rapidly washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and air-dried. Cell associated radioactivity was determined by solubilizing the cells in 1% Triton X-100. Nonspecific association of radioactivity with the cells amounted to less than 20% of the specific uptake under these conditions. After experimental manipulations, coverslips of adipocytes were rapidly washed in ice-cold buffer for the preparation of plasma membrane lawns exactly as described in Ref. 9Martin L.B. Shewan A.

After fixation in paraformaldehyde, plasma membrane lawns were incubated with anti-GLUT-4 (1:100 dilution) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (9Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W.

After washing, the coverslips were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, washed and mounted on glass coverslips. Coversips were viewed using a × 40 objective lens on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope operated in Laser Scanning Confocal mode. Samples were illuminated at 488 nm and the signal at 510 nm collected. Duplicate coverslips were prepared at each experimental condition, and 10 random images of plasma membrane lawns collected from each. These were quantified using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, CA) software on a DAN PC (Noran Instruments, Surrey, UK). Similar methods were employed to assay GLUT1 levels in plasma membranes. Transferrin receptors present at the cell surface were quantified as outlined in Refs. 27Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

After experimental manipulations, cells were rapidly chilled by three washes in ice-cold KRP buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Thereafter, cells were incubated in the same buffer containing ∼3 nm125I-transferrin for 2 h on ice. After this time, the media was aspirated and the monolayers washed three times with 1 ml of KRP/bovine serum albumin for 1 min. Cells were then solubilized in 1m NaOH and the radioactivity associated with each well determined by γ-counting. For each condition, duplicates plates were incubated exactly as above, but in the presence of 1 μmtransferrin; the radioactivity associated with each well under these conditions was the value of nonspecific binding at each condition, and was found to vary between 5 and 10% of the total counts per well.

The peptides used in this study are underlined, and in the case of ARF5 and ARF6 were synthesized with or without a myristoyl group at position Gly-2. We have used a panel of ARF-specific antibodies to examine the expression and subcellular distribution of ARFs 5 and 6 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). In the basal (non-stimulated) state, ARF5 was predominantly localized to the soluble protein fraction of adipocytes, with some association with intracellular membranes. In response to insulin treatment, ARF5 levels at the plasma membrane were observed to increase with a concomitant decrease chiefly from the soluble protein fraction of the cells. Similar results were obtained using two different anti-ARF5 antibodies. In the same experiments, GLUT4 was observed to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to insulin from intracellular membrane fractions as has been extensively reported (1Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 2Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zorzano A. Munoz P. Camps M. Mora C. Testar X. Palacin M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: S70-S81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, ARF6 was observed chiefly in the plasma membrane fraction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (34Yang C.-Z. Heimberg H. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mueckler M.M. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4006-4011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and did not exhibit appreciable alteration in subcellular distribution in response to insulin (Fig. 1). The plasma membrane localization of ARF6 is in agreement with studies in a range of cell types (34Yang C.-Z. Heimberg H. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mueckler M.M. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4006-4011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Q. Cox D. Tseng C.-C. Donaldson J.G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19977-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although insulin did not appear to modulate the subcellular distribution of ARF6, it is possible that insulin may modify the ARF6-GDP/ARF6-GTP ratio at the plasma membrane, indeed several studies have suggested that unlike other members of the ARF family, ARF6 remains membrane associated even in its GDP-bound state (34Yang C.-Z. Heimberg H. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mueckler M.M. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4006-4011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Q. Cox D. Tseng C.-C. Donaldson J.G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19977-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Alternatively, insulin may modulate the rate of turnover from membrane to cytosolic states of ARF6 without an apparent alteration in distribution between these fractions. Hence the apparent lack of altered subcellular distribution of ARF6 in response to insulin does not preclude an important role for this protein in insulin action. Myristoylated peptides corresponding to the amino terminus of ARF proteins have been widely used in many laboratories to probe the function of ARF proteins in intracellular trafficking, including endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport, intra-Golgi transport, and endocytic vesicle fusion (36Barr F.A. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 348: 65-70Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Donaldson J.G. Casse L.D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylated peptides corresponding to residues 2 through 13 of the NH2 terminus of ARF6 have also been shown to inhibit regulated exocytosis in permeabilized chromaffin cells (22Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and to inhibit stimulated phospholipase D activity in these cells in response to agents which stimulate secretion (39Caumont A.-S. Galas M.-C. Vitale N. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1373-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, a corresponding peptide lacking the myristoyl group at Gly-2, or the cognate myristoylated peptide from ARF1 were without effect (22Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We therefore chose to adopt similar methodology to examine the role of ARF5 or ARF6 in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in α-toxin-permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We synthesized peptides corresponding to residues 2 through 16 of murine ARF5 (with or without a myristoyl group at position Gly-2), and employed myristoylated ARF1 and ARF6 peptides described by one of us previously (22Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Permeabilized adipocytes were incubated with the peptides for 10 min, then stimulated with 1 μm insulin for a further 20 min. At the end of this time, deoxy-Glc uptake was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of a typical experiment are presented in Fig. 2 A. We consistently observed a diminution in the rate of insulin-stimulated deoxy-Glc uptake in cells incubated with myristoylated ARF6 peptide. In three experiments of this type, the extent of inhibition of insulin-stimulated deoxy-Glc transport was 47 ± 11%. In contrast, neither myristoylated ARF1 nor myristoylated ARF5 peptides inhibited insulin-stimulated deoxy-Glc uptake over the same concentration range. In control experiments (not shown) the addition of the peptide to intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes was without effect on either basal or insulin-stimulated deoxy-Glc uptake. This data argues that ARF6 may play a role in the regulation of plasma membrane GLUT4 levels in response to insulin, as GLUT4 is responsible for the majority of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. In order to address this directly, we measured insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface using the plasma membrane lawn technique. Permeabilized adipocytes were incubated with myristoylated ARF1, ARF5, and ARF6 peptides prior to insulin stimulation and assessment of plasma membrane GLUT4 levels. Data from a typical experiment are presented in Fig. 2 B, and the results of three experiments of this type presented in Fig. 2 C. We observed marked inhibition of GLUT4 translocation in the presence of 100 μm myristoylated ARF6 peptide (42 ± 3%;n = 3). A modest inhibition of GLUT4 translocation was also observed in the presence of 100 μm myristoylated ARF5 peptide, but the effect was considerably less than that induced by the ARF6 peptide and did not reach significance in every experiment. 100 μm Myristoylated ARF1 peptide was without effect in this assay. A dose-response curve for these peptides on GLUT4 translocation is presented in Fig. 2 D. No significant effect on basal (unstimulated) plasma membrane levels of GLUT4 were observed after incubation with the peptides (Fig. 2 B), but low signal precludes detailed quantification of the level of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane in the absence of insulin. Insulin treatment of adipocytes results in the movement of other proteins to the plasma membrane, including the TfR, the IGF-II/cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (27Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and GLUT1 (26Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13801-13808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), albeit to a much lesser extent than is observed for GLUT4 (typically ∼2-fold compared with 12–15-fold). This is probably due to movement of these proteins from the recycling endosomal system to the plasma membrane. We wished to determine whether the effect of the myristoylated ARF6 peptide to inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was specific for GLUT4, or whether other proteins which traffic between intracellular membranes and the cell surface in an insulin-regulated manner were also effected. We therefore examined the effect of insulin on cell surface levels of TfR and GLUT1 in permeabilized adipocytes incubated with myristoylated ARF peptides (Fig. 3). Insulin stimulation of permeabilized adipocytes results in a ∼2-fold increase in plasma membrane TfR levels, in agreement with published studies (27Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Prior incubation with myristoylated ARF1 peptide did not reduce the magnitude of this response (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, prior incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with myristoylated ARF5 peptide significantly inhibited the ability of insulin to stimulate TfR levels at the cell surface with no effect on the basal (unstimulated) TfR levels. In contrast, myristoylated ARF6 peptide reduced cell surface TfR levels in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells significantly compared with control cells, without significantly reducing the fold increase in cell surface TfR levels observed in response to insulin (Fig. 3 A). Similar data were also observed for GLUT1 (Fig. 3 B), with the exception that the reduction in plasma membrane GLUT1 levels in the presence of the ARF6 peptide were not as extensive as those observed for TfR (Fig.3 B). Consistent with this, we observed a diminution of basal (unstimulated) deoxy-Glc uptake in cells incubated with the ARF6 peptide (∼15% inhibition), but this effect did not reach statistical significance, presumably because the rate of basal transport is low (data not shown). Nevertheless, these data argue that both ARF5 and ARF6 are intimately involved in the trafficking of membrane proteins between the plasma membrane and the recycling endosomal system in this cell type. Here we have shown that insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in the redistribution of ARF5 from the soluble protein (cytosolic) fraction to the plasma membrane. We hypothesize that ARF5 recycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular (cytosolic) fractions presumably as a consequence of GDP/GTP exchange, and that insulin stimulates GTP loading of this protein. Despite this insulin-stimulated translocation of ARF5, our data is not consistent with a role for this protein in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Rather, we suggest that ARF5 plays a role in the insulin-stimulated trafficking of membrane proteins between the recycling endosomal system and the plasma membrane, as evidenced by the ability of myristoylated ARF5 peptides to inhibit insulin-stimulated TfR and GLUT1 movement to the cell surface (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a functional role for ARF5 in membrane trafficking. In contrast to the data relating to ARF5, we show that a myristoylated peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of ARF6 partially inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and deoxy-Glc transport in α-toxin permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2), implicating ARF6 as a key component of this response. Furthermore, we show that incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with myristoylated ARF6 peptide reduces TfR number at the cell surface both in the basal state and after insulin stimulation, without decreasing the fold increase in cell surface levels in response to insulin (Fig. 3 A); similar results were observed for GLUT1, except the reduction in plasma membrane GLUT1 levels were not as great (Fig. 3 B). Collectively, these data argue that ARF6 plays a fundamental role in trafficking between intracellular membranes and the cell surface, indeed ARF6 has been proposed to mediate the targeting of recycling vesicles to the plasma membrane, either from a perinuclear compartment (CHO cells (21D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)) or from a unique tubular-vesicular compartment (HeLa cells (33Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar)). With this in mind, several models may be proposed to explain the inhibitory effect of myristoylated ARF6 peptides on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. GLUT4 has been proposed to populate at least two distinct intracellular compartments, one of which corresponds to the recycling endosomal system, the other a specialized intracellular storage compartment referred to as GLUT4 storage vesicles (reviewed in Refs. 1Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 2Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 41Holman G.D. Leggio L.L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the partial inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by myristoylated ARF6 peptides may be explained by the selective inhibition of translocation of one of the proposed multiple intracellular GLUT4 pools. This is consistent with previous studies which implicate ARF6 in the exocytosis of secretory vesicles in other cell types (22Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A second model, however, should also be considered which may also explain the experimental data presented here. Previous studies of ARF6 function in other cell types have shown that mutants of ARF6 disrupt receptor-mediated endocytosis (42D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Columbo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ARF6 redistributed TfR to the cell surface, while a dominant negative mutant of ARF6 was shown to redistribute TfR to intracellular membranes and inhibit TfR recycling to the cell surface, suggesting that ARF6 is an integral component of the endocytic apparatus and that its GTP cycle/nucleotide status regulate progression through the endocytic pathway (42D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Columbo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, we have shown that myristoylated ARF6 peptide decreases the cell surface levels of TfR both in the presence and absence of insulin without affecting the magnitude of the insulin-dependent increase in TfR at the cell surface (Fig. 3 A), consistent with ARF6 regulating progression of TfRs through the endocytic pathway. Hence, an alternative explanation of the data presented here is that the myristoylated ARF6 peptide functions in a fashion similar to a dominant negative ARF6, resulting in a change in the steady-state distribution of TfR such that the intracellular/plasma membrane ratio is increased. It is possible that after insulin stimulation when cell surface GLUT4 levels are increased, ARF6 function regulates the internalization/recycling of GLUT4 in a similar manner to that of the TfR. When ARF6 function is disrupted by the myristoylated peptide, intracellular levels of GLUT4 and TfR are increased, resulting in decreased plasma membrane levels of both of these proteins. This effect is only manifest for GLUT4 in the insulin-stimulated state as plasma membrane levels of GLUT4 in the absence of insulin are already very low. Hence, in this model, the role of ARF6 is not specific for any particular GLUT4 compartment, but rather is manifest at the level of GLUT4 recycling between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, which is known to occur even in the presence of insulin (1Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 41Holman G.D. Leggio L.L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Distinguishing between these (or other) models for ARF6 action represents an important goal. These data also offer further insight into the ability of insulin to regulate membrane trafficking in adipocytes. We have shown that myristoylated ARF5 peptide inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT1 and TfR translocation to the plasma membrane without significantly inhibiting GLUT4 translocation. This result implies that the pathways by which these two proteins reach the plasma membrane after insulin stimulation are distinct. Several studies have identified a GLUT4 compartment which is relatively devoid of TfR in both adipocytes and muscle (4Ploug T. van Deurs B. Cushman S.W. Ralston E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1429-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 44Ralston E. Ploug T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2967-2978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Malide D. Dwyer N.K.

This (GLUT4 storage vesicles) compartment has been suggested to be a GLUT4 storage compartment which is rapidly mobilized in response to insulin (2Rea S. James D.E.

Although there is ample data implicating some overlap between GLUT4 and the TfR in endosomes, it is possible that this overlap is mainly a consequence of these proteins sharing the same components of the endocytic arm of the recycling pathway. Indeed studies using mutant dynamin molecules has suggested that the slowly recycling (GLUT1/TfR positive) GLUT4 compartment contributes minimally to insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (47Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25450-25457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In response to insulin when traffic through the recycling endosomal system is clearly increased, some GLUT4 will move to the cell surface from this location. We would suggest that this represents a modest proportion of the total insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, as evidenced here by the lack of significant inhibition of GLUT4 translocation under conditions when GLUT1 and TfR translocation are significantly compromised (i.e. in the presence of ARF5 peptide). Hence we suggest that the main effect of insulin is to recruit GLUT4 from the post-endosomal storage compartment (GLUT4 storage vesicless), and that unlike insulin-stimulated movement through the recycling endosomes, this is independent of ARF5 function. In conclusion, we suggest that both ARF5 and ARF6 regulate trafficking of membrane proteins to and from the cell surface, and show that ARF6 plays an important regulatory role in the steady-state levels of GLUT4 at the adipocyte cell surface after insulin stimulation. We speculate that the actions of ARF5 and ARF6 are chiefly mediated by effects on the recycling endosomal system, at least in this insulin-responsive cell type. We thank Drs. Donaldson, Holman, Kahn, and Moss for their generous provision of antibodies used in this study and Dr. Francis Barr for constructive comments on this manuscript."

Two off pathway intermediates, a five-coordinated state (5C) and a bis-histidine state (HH), were also identified during the folding reaction. In the present work, the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the unfolding reaction of cytochrome c were investigated with resonance Raman scattering, tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism. The objective of these experiments was to determine if the protein opens up and diverges into the differing heme ligation states through a many pathway mechanism or if it passes through intermediate states analogous to those observed during the folding reaction. Equilibrium unfolding results indicate that, in contrast to 5C, the stability of HH with respect to HW decreases as the concentration of GdnHCl increases. The difference in their response to the denaturant indicates that the polypeptide structure of 5C is relatively loose as compared with HH in which the polypeptide is misfolded. Time-resolved resonance Raman measurements show that strikingly similar ligand exchange reactions occur during unfolding as were observed during folding.

To perform its biological function, a nascent polypeptide produced at the ribosome needs to fold to its native structure accurately and efficiently. The “folding codon” encoded in its amino acid sequence and the mechanism by which the polypeptide folds to its native structure remain central problems in biology (1Laurents D.V. Baldwin R.L.

Recent advances have shed light on the nucleation condensation model in which the growth of the polypeptide architecture of a small single domain protein starts in a particular region of the molecule, the folding nucleus, and subsequently propagates throughout the rest of the molecule until the native conformation is reached (3Shakhnovich E.I.

To unify the kinetic studies from a large variety of proteins, a “new view” of protein folding has been postulated in which unique folding channels are replaced by a statistical distribution of many pathways (4Dill K.A.

View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to the folding reactions, the unfolding transition in single domain proteins usually appears to be a cooperative two-state process regardless of the size of the protein. It is generally considered as a “melting” of the protein crystal, because the closed packed interior of a protein resembles the ordered structure of molecular crystals. In this report, we use cytochrome c (cytc) as a model to unravel the statistical nature of the unfolding reaction. Cyt c is a convenient model for folding and unfolding studies, because the native structure is well known and the folding kinetics can be followed by various spectroscopic techniques (15Yeh S.R.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12892-12902Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, the protein contains a heme prosthetic group that can be used as a probe for the local structure of the protein during the folding reaction (21Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated in previous reports that the folding reaction of cyt c follows a two-step mechanism (15Yeh S.R. Han S. Rousseau D.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 727-736Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct.

Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the nascent phase of folding, cytc collapses from a random coil-like structure to a semi-compact form that involves little or none of the specific tertiary interactions present in the native structure. This collapsing process is kinetically controlled and thus happens very fast, in less than 100 μs (21Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 24Shastry M.C. Roder H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25Chan C.K. Hu Y. Takahashi S. Rousseau D.L. Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The size of the conformational space is dramatically reduced during this phase. It facilitates the searching of the native structure in the subsequent phase, which is a thermodynamically controlled heme ligand exchange phase that is regulated by random structural fluctuations biased to the native polypeptide fold. It is at this stage when the specific native contacts are established (15Yeh S.R. Han S. Rousseau D.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 727-736Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The productive folding pathway of cyt c, as described in Scheme 1, starts from the totally unstructured polypeptide state, U, and passes through an intermediate, HW, in which His-18 and a water molecule are coordinated to the heme, and then culminates in the native His-18–Met-80 heme-coordinated form (HM). Two off pathway intermediates with different heme coordination have been identified during the folding reaction, a five-coordinated species (5C) and a bis-histidine species (HH) in which the polypeptide chain is misfolded (23Yeh S.R. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast to the folding reaction that converges to the native HM state, the unfolding reaction of cytc starts from the native protein and diverges to form the conformationally heterogeneous unfolded polypeptide structures with differing heme ligation states as formulated in Equation 4. HM→HW+HH+5C(Eq. 4) Recent studies of cyt c unfolding by circular dichroism (CD) and tryptophan fluorescence demonstrated nonexponential kinetics indicating the existence of unfolding intermediates (26Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1996; 24: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 27Colon W. Elove G.A. Wakem L.P. Sherman F. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5538-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Bhuyan A.K. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9147-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, hydrogen exchange measurements have suggested that the partially unfolded forms of cyt c observed under equilibrium conditions represent kinetic unfolding intermediates (29Xu Y. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To obtain a coherent picture, the equilibrium unfolding reaction of cytc was studied as a function of the GdnHCl concentration at pH 3.0 and 5.9 with CD, tryptophan fluorescence, and resonance Raman scattering. The kinetics of the unfolding reaction at pH 3.8 and 5.8 were monitored by resonance Raman scattering and tryptophan fluorescence. The overall objective of these experiments was to determine if the protein simply opens up and diverges into the differing heme ligation states through a many pathway mechanism or if it passes through intermediate states analogous to those observed during the folding reaction. A direct comparison with the folding reaction under similar ambient conditions is discussed to enlighten the chemical and physical processes that underlie these reactions. Horse heart ferricytochrome c (type IV from Sigma) was treated with ferricyanide to oxidize the residual ferrous form and purified on a Sephadex G-25M column. For the equilibrium studies, the protein was diluted into pH 3.0 or 5.9 acetate buffer (0.1m) at the desired concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl, ultra pure grade from Pierce) a few hours prior to the experiments. The final protein concentration was 20 μm. The fluorescence measurements were recorded with a SLM Aminco fluorometer (Urbana, IL). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and both slits were set to 4 nm. The CD measurements were performed on a JASCO model J720 spectrometer (Easton, MD). For the kinetic studies, the unfolding of cyt c was initiated by a 6-fold dilution of the protein with 4.8 mGdnHCl in 0.1 m acetate buffer solution in a rapid solution mixer with a mixing dead time of ∼100 μs (21Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The final protein concentration was 10 μm. The two parent solutions were pressurized by a syringe pump and introduced into the T-shaped mixing nozzle, which is in direct contact with a quartz flow cell (250 × 250 μm). The details of the characterization of this mixer were described previously (21Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The time-resolved resonance Raman and fluorescence spectra were obtained by moving the quartz cell relative to the laser focusing point along the flow direction. The position of the flow cell was controlled by a micrometer on a translational stage, such that an accurate time domain could be calculated from the solution flow rate. The Raman measurements were made with previously described instrumentation (21Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The output at 407 nm from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics) was focused to an ∼30 μm spot (power ∼100 milliwatts) on the continuously flowing sample in the flow cell. The scattered light was collected and focused on the entrance slit of a 1.25-m polychromator (Spex) where it was dispersed and then detected by a charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments). The Raman spectrum at each time point was deconvoluted into contributions from HH, HW, 5C, and HM based on the procedure published elsewhere (21Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For the tryptophan fluorescence measurements, the output at 264 nm from a frequency-doubled argon ion laser (Coherent) was focused to an ∼30 μm spot on the continuously flowing sample in the observation cell. The fluorescence was collected and focused on the entrance slit of a 0.27-m polychromator (Spex) where it was dispersed and then detected by a charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics). GdnHCl-induced unfolding of cytc was monitored by far UV CD and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy as a function of denaturant concentration. Far UV CD monitors the α-helix content of the protein (30Johnson Jr., W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The tryptophan fluorescence (31Tsong T.Y. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5467-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Elove G.A. Chaffotte A.F. Roder H. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6876-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), on the other hand, probes the average distance between the fluorescent chromophore, Typ-59, and the intrinsic quencher, the heme prosthetic group, which is covalently linked to Cys-14 and Cys-17 through thioether linkages. At pH 5.9, the equilibrium titration curve from CD measurements coincides well with that from the fluorescence measurements with a midpoint of approximately 2.5 m as shown in Fig.1 A. To gain more structural information, the equilibrium unfolding curves were investigated with resonance Raman scattering. The native HM form converts to HH and HW as the concentration of GdnHCl increases with a preference of HH over HW (Fig. 1 B). Based on the populations of these three species, a representation of their free energy changes relative to HW as a function of the GdnHCl concentration was constructed and is shown in Fig. 1 C. In the absence of GdnHCl, the relative stabilities of the intermediates are HM > HH > HW (22Yeh S.R. Takahashi S. Fan B. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the presence of 2.4 m GdnHCl, the population of HM is equal to that of HH (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the free energies of HM and HH are identical. Furthermore, the energy level of HW lies above that of HM and HH, because the population of HW is less than that of HM and HH (Fig.1 B). Likewise, the free energies of HM and HW are identical at 2.7 m GdnHCl and that of HH lies below those of HM and HW. It is concluded from Fig. 1 C that both the native state, HM, and the off pathway intermediate, HH, are destabilized by GdnHCl with respect to HW. This result is consistent with the observation that the presence of GdnHCl in the refolding solution destabilizes HH and assists the conversion of HH back to the obligatory intermediate HW during the folding reaction (23Yeh S.R. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that the transition curve from the resonance Raman scattering measurements occurs slightly earlier (lower GdnHCl concentration) as compared with those from the CD and fluorescence measurements as shown in Fig. 1 A. This is most evident in the pre-transition region, where at 2 m GdnHCl the population of HM determined from the resonance Raman measurements has dropped by nearly 20% in contrast to no reduction of the native α-helical content and 8% reduction of the molecular size based on the CD and fluorescence measurements, respectively. The difference between these physical measurements suggests that under low GdnHCl concentrations, the polypeptide backbone structure changes, associated with the changes in heme ligation states, are localized and the thermodynamic intermediates are compact with most of the native secondary structure preserved. Similar conclusions were drawn from equilibrium hydrogen exchange experiments (29Xu Y. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The merger of the HM curve with those from CD and fluorescence measurements in the post-transition region implies that the residual secondary and tertiary structure in HH and HW is eventually lost in the presence of high concentrations of denaturant. At pH 3.0, the denaturation transition curves measured by CD and tryptophan fluorescence appear much broader than that of pH 5.9 with the transition midpoint shifted from 2.5 to 2.0 m (Fig.2 A). It is plausible that the positive charges distributed over the polypeptide chain resulting from the protonation of certain amino acid residues introduce electrostatic repulsion between polypeptide segments. They destabilize the molecule and loosen the structure. In contrast to the cooperative nature of the sharp transition observed at pH 5.9, the perturbation induced by GdnHCl in one part of the molecule is not readily transmitted to other parts of the molecule. This results in a broader transition with a midpoint shifted to a lower GdnHCl concentration as shown in Fig.2 A. The change of the ligation states in response to the GdnHCl concentration is much more complex under acidic conditions than that at the higher pH as shown in Fig. 2 B. The population of HM from the resonance Raman measurements deviates substantially from the CD and fluorescence titration curves in the pre-transition region. Only one unfolding intermediate, HW, was detected at a GdnHCl concentration of 1.5 m or less. The conversion from HM to HW is extremely efficient; approximately 20% of HM is converted to HW in the presence of only 0.1 m GdnHCl. The sensitivity of the iron-methionine bond to a small amount of GdnHCl cannot be attributed to a direct weakening of this bond under acid conditions. We postulate that the perturbation in the ω-loop structure, which holds Met-80 in a favorable position for ligation, introduced by protonation destabilizes the iron-methionine bond. At concentrations above 1.5 m GdnHCl, where the population of HW reaches a maximum, another folding intermediate, 5C, becomes visible at the expense of HW. The population of 5C levels off at 2.5m GdnHCl. As the GdnHCl concentration increases from 2.5 to 4.0 m, the ratio of HW/5C stays constant, whereas the amount of secondary structure and the compactness of the protein continue to decline (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that the structures of both HW and 5C are loosened steadily by the addition of denaturant. The polypeptide structures associated with HW and 5C are not totally unfolded until the concentration of GdnHCl is greater than 4.0 m at which point more conversion from HW to 5C is observed. Based on the populations of HM, HW and 5C shown in Fig. 2 B, a pictorial illustration of their free energy changes relative to HW as a function of the GdnHCl concentration, was constructed (Fig.2 C). In the absence of GdnHCl, HM is more stable than HW, and HW is more stable than 5C (23Yeh S.R. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1.2m GdnHCl, the population of HM is equal to that of HW (Fig.2 B), suggesting that the free energies of HM and HW are identical. In addition, the energy level of 5C lies above that of HM and HW, because the population of 5C is less than that of HM and HW. Analogously, the free energies of HM and 5C are identical in the presence of 2.0 m GdnHCl and that of HW lies below those of HM and 5C. The free energies of HW and 5C are identical in the presence of 2.3 m GdnHCl, and that of HM lies above those of HW and 5C. It can be concluded from Fig. 2 C that in contrast to the native HM state, 5C is stabilized by GdnHCl with respect to HW. Although both HH and 5C are off pathway intermediates, their response to denaturant is dramatically different as demonstrated in Figs.1 C and 2 C. This difference can be attributed to the nature of the peptide backbone conformations associated with the two species. HH is a misligated state with the native His-18 and non-native His-33 as the two axial ligands. His-26 is also a potential heme ligand, but it was shown recently that His-33 is the primary ligand in the misligated state (33Colon W. Wakem L.P. Sherman F. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12535-12541Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The coordination of His-33 to the heme stitches the wrong parts of the peptide fragments together and traps the protein in a misfolded structure. It has been demonstrated that small amounts of GdnHCl accelerate the conversion of HH to the productive folding intermediate, HW (23Yeh S.R. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the destabilization effect of GdnHCl on HH reported here. On the other hand, the peptide backbone structure of 5C is rather floppy as compared with that of HH, because the intramolecular cross-linking between both His-18 and Met-80 through the heme is broken. The 5C intermediate is more stable in the presence of higher GdnHCl concentrations. Fig. 3 shows the unfolding kinetics of cyt c at pH 3.8 and 5.8 monitored by resonance Raman scattering. The time-dependent populations of the various folding intermediates in these two reactions are strikingly similar to those observed in the folding reactions. At pH 3.8, HM steadily converts to HW with a half-life of just under a millisecond (Fig. 3 A). HW reaches a maximum (∼80%) at 5 ms and decays to ∼60% at 40 ms. 5C appears at about 1 ms and reaches steady state at approximately 40 ms. The transient population of HW suggests that HW may be the precursor of 5C. At pH 5.8, the unfolding reaction is much slower than that at pH 3.8. HM gradually converts to HH and HW (Fig. 3 B). The reaction reaches steady state at about 80 ms. To gain more insight into the unfolding mechanism, several kinetic models were tested to account for the time-dependent data shown in Fig. 3. The model, which best fits the data, is illustrated in Scheme 2, which surprisingly follows the reverse sequence of the folding reaction (Scheme 1). In this scenario, the unfolding reaction first produces the HW heme coordination state by replacing one of the two native ligands, Met-80, with a water molecule. It is then followed by either dissociation of His-18 to generate 5C (pH 3.8) or the coordination of a “wrong” histidine ligand, His-33, in the replacement of the water molecule to produce HH (pH 5.8). This model confirms the prediction that HW is the common precursor for 5C mentioned earlier. The solid lines in Fig. 3 are fits to the data with the kinetic model shown in Scheme 2. The resulting rate constants are listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab The rate constants were determined by fitting the time-resolved data for folding and unfolding reactions of cytochrome c under various pH conditions as indicated in the parentheses. The relaxation of the tertiary structure surrounding the heme during the unfolding of cyt c at pH 5.8 (Fig. 3 B) was monitored by the decrease in the 397-cm−1 line in the low frequency Raman spectrum. It has been shown that the heme prosthetic group in cyt c is highly distorted because of the local environment of the native polypeptide fold (34Bushnell G.W. Louie G.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 35Jordan T. Eads J.C. Spiro T.G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 716-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This tension is totally released as the polypeptide chain unfolds. The Raman line at 397 cm−1, assigned as a bending mode of the sulfur atom of Cys-14/17, the β-carbon atom of the heme, and the atom bridging these two (36Hu S. Morris I.K. Singh J.P. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12446-12458Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar), was established as a marker line for the formation of the native tertiary structure of the heme pocket, because the heme is covalently linked to the polypeptide backbone through these two cysteine residues (22Yeh S.R. Takahashi S. Fan B. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the time-dependent changes of the 397-cm−1 line coincide well with the decay of the native HM structure. This result suggests that the dissociation of Met-80 from the heme is concerted with the disruption of the heme pocket, the same type of behavior as has been observed during folding (22Yeh S.R. Takahashi S. Fan B. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The global structure changes associated with the ligand exchange reactions were investigated further with tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. In the native state, the fluorescence from Trp-59, the only tryptophan residue in cyt c, is totally quenched by the spatially nearby heme prosthetic group. The majority of the fluorescence intensity from Trp-59 can be recovered as cyt cunfolds because of the increase in the distance between Trp-59 and the heme that is anchored at residue positions 14 and 17. Tryptophan fluorescence therefore provides a qualitative estimate of the global size of the protein. The recovery of the fluorescence intensity during the unfolding reactions of cyt c at pH 3.8 and 5.8 agrees well with the disappearance of HM as shown in Fig. 3. Several conclusions can be drawn from these experiments. First, the fluorescence data shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the global molecular size of cyt c is not completely relaxed until the ligand exchange reaction reaches steady state. In the presence of GdnHCl, at concentrations of 4 m or more, the polypeptide chain of cytc is totally unfolded and is free from conformational constraints. The potential heme ligands (His-18 or His-33), covalently linked to the polypeptide chain, can freely exchange with one another or a solvent water molecule with rates >10,000 s−1evident from the pH jump experiments (data not shown). These rates are much faster than those observed for the unfolding reactions (Table I) suggesting that the polypeptide backbone is in a semi-compact form during the ligand exchange phase, such that the reactions are constrained by residual tertiary structure just as that observed during the folding of cyt c. Second, the Met-80 off rate (k 4) is much faster at low pH than that at high pH (800 versus 70 s−1). This is because of destabilization of the native polypeptide structure at low pH by the electrostatic repulsion resulting from the protonation of certain amino acid residues as discussed earlier. Third, the His-33 on rate (k 1) is 0 at pH 3.8 but 170 s−1 at pH 5.8. This contrast is because of the lack of unprotonated His-33 available for heme coordination at low pH as demonstrated in the folding reaction (22Yeh S.R. Takahashi S. Fan B. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the formation rate of 5C (k 5) is 0 at pH 5.8 because of the instability of 5C at this pH. Lastly, analogous to the folding reaction, as may be seen in Scheme 2, HW is an obligatory unfolding intermediate leading to the formation of the HH and 5C forms. For comparison, Fig.4 shows the folding reactions of cytc under similar conditions as those applied in Fig. 3. Thesolid lines are the fitted data with the model illustrated in Scheme 1 with the rate constants listed in Table I. The His-18 on rate (k 6) and the His-33 on rate (k 1) are faster than those observed under unfolding conditions because of the difference in the concentration of denaturant in the solution. It is important to point out that although the folding conditions are the same for both reactions shown in Fig. 4, the overall folding rate slows down by more than an order of magnitude when the pH of the unfolded protein is raised from 3.6 to 5.9. This is a result of the kinetic trapping effect of the misfolded HH state, which occupies more than 60% of the population during the nascent phase of folding as shown in Fig. 4 B. On the other hand, HH is only transiently populated at approximately 10 ms following the initiation of folding at pH 3.8. This comparison confirms the role of HH as an off pathway intermediate and a deep kinetic trap. It is intriguing that in contrast to the reaction observed during unfolding, the folding kinetics measured by tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy deviate significantly from those measured by the resonance Raman scattering as shown in Fig. 4. The loss of the fluorescence intensity appears much earlier than the formation of the native HM state. This is in good agreement with the model illustrated in Scheme 1, in which the protein collapsed to a semi-compact form during the nascent phase prior to the ligand exchange phase. The collapsing of the peptide backbone reduces the average size of the molecule before the ligand exchange equilibrium can take place; i.e. the native structure cannot be realized through ligand exchange reactions until the protein collapses to a semi-compact form. Conversely, the coincidence between the fluorescence and Raman data during unfolding (Fig. 3) suggests that the Met-80 heme linkage cannot be broken until the polypeptide architecture is loosened. The folding of cyt cfollows a biphasic mechanism as illustrated in Scheme 1. In the nascent phase of folding, the unfolded protein collapses to a semi-compact form in a kinetically controlled process within 100 μs (15Yeh S.R. Han S. Rousseau D.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 727-736Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is followed by a thermodynamically controlled heme ligand exchange phase culminating in the native conformation (15Yeh S.R. Han S. Rousseau D.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 727-736Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this work, an analogous biphasic mechanism with a reversed sequence was observed duringunfolding (Scheme 2). Unlike the fast ligand exchange rate (>10,000 s−1) for the totally unstructured polypeptide, the ligand exchange rates observed during the unfolding reactions are comparable to those observed during the folding reactions (Table I). These results suggest that the ligand exchange phase occurring during unfolding takes place while the polypeptide chain is still in a relatively compact state such that the conformations of the various intermediates are partially constrained by the residual intramolecular tertiary interactions. This proposal is confirmed by the results from tryptophan fluorescence measurements, which indicate that only at the termination of the ligand exchange phase does the protein expand fully into a random coil-like unfolded state. Based on this and prior studies (15Yeh S.R. Han S. Rousseau D.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 727-736Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Takahashi S. Yeh S.R. Das T.K. Chan C.K. Gottfried D.S.

Biol. 1998; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the free energy changes during the folding and unfolding reactions of cyt c can be illustrated pictorially in Fig. 5. In this cartoon, the free energy curves plotted against the global molecular size under native (0.0 m GdnHCl) and denaturing conditions (4.4 m GdnHCl) are shown as the dark blue curve and the red curve, respectively. Under native conditions, the energy of the unfolded protein (U′) is higher than that of the folded form (F) because of the exposure of the hydrophobic residues to the solvent and the loss of the stabilization energy gained from inter amino acid contacts (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions, etc.). As the unstructured polypeptide chain reduces its molecular size, the associated free energy is reduced accordingly (dark blue curve). It reaches an energy minimum when the polypeptide chain assumes its native conformation. When the size of the polypeptide molecule is further reduced, the energy starts to climb because of the repulsion imposed by steric interactions between the spatially neighboring amino acid residues. This free energy curve is analogous to the attractive potential energy curve of a typical diatomic molecule, in which the energy minimum of the potential curve is located at the natural bond length of the given molecule. For simplicity, in this energy diagram, the roughness of the potential energy surface is ignored. On the other hand, under denaturing conditions, the unfolded polypeptide molecule (U) is more stable than its “folded” counterpart (F′) because of the high entropy of the unstructured polypeptide backbone and the stabilization energy gained from denaturant-amino acid interactions. Unlike the unique folded state (F) observed under native conditions, there is no well defined folded state (F′) under these conditions. As the size of the polypeptide chain is reduced, the energy increases because of the loss of entropy by the exclusion of the denaturant from the protein molecules. As the size of the molecule is further reduced, additional reduction of the stabilization energy is introduced by the repulsion between amino acid residues. The potential energy curve of cyt c under denaturing conditions therefore is analogous to the repulsive potential energy curve of a diatomic molecule. When the unfolding reaction is initiated, shown as the green arrow (1Laurents D.V. Baldwin R.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in Fig. 5, the protein is rapidly promoted from the F to the F′ state. If the initiation of the reaction is fast enough with respect to the conformational changes of the protein molecule, the entire course of the unfolding reaction can be followed from the F′ to the U state (red curve). Likewise, the folding reaction from the U′ to the F state (dark blue curve) can be initiated in a similar fashion indicated as the green arrow (2Brooks III, C.L. Gruebele M. Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11037-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) in Fig.5. The unfolding kinetics reported here demonstrate that the ligand exchange phase appears when the protein molecule is still in a semi-compact form, and it is followed by further relaxation of the polypeptide chain into a random coil-like structure. In contrast, the folding reaction follows a reversed biphasic process, in which molecular collapse occurs prior to the ligand exchange phase, again located in the shaded area. One appealing feature in Fig. 5is the presence of a crossing point between the dark blue curve and the red curve, in which the energies of the polypeptide molecules are the same in the absence and in the presence of denaturant. In other words, the folding and refolding reactions must share a common intermediate with a characteristic molecular size, which could exhibit a molten globule-like structure."

It has been proposed that one mechanism by which this is achieved is through temporally regulated myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation (Satterwhite, L. L., and Pollard, T. D. (1992) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 4, 43–52). A variety of evidence is consistent with this model. A direct test of the importance of RLC phosphorylation in vivo has been done only inDictyostelium and Drosophila; phosphorylation of the RLC is essential in Drosophila (Jordan, P., and Karess, R. (1997) J. Cell Biol. 139, 1805–1819) but not essential in Dictyostelium (Ostrow, B. D., Chen, P., and Chisholm, R. L. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 127, 1945–1955). The Schizosaccharomyces pombe myosin light chain Cdc4p is essential for cytokinesis, but it was unknown whether phosphorylation played a role in its regulation. Here we show that theS. pombe myosin light chain Cdc4p is phosphorylatedin vivo on either serine 2 or 6 but not both. Mutation of either or both of these sites to alanine did not effect the ability of Cdc4p to bind the type II myosin Myo2p, and cells expressing only these mutated versions of Cdc4p grew and divided normally. Similarly, mutation of Ser-2, Ser-6, or both residues to aspartic acid did not affect growth or division of cells. Thus we conclude that phosphorylation of Cdc4p is not essential in vivo for the function of the protein.

Cytokinesis in diverse eukaryotes is accomplished by constriction of an actin contractile ring. This ring is composed not only of actin but of many other proteins including myosin, which supplies the force needed for its constriction (1Satterwhite L.L. Pollard T.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Generally myosin consists of two heavy chains complexed with a regulatory and an essential light chain (5Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). By genetic analysis, it has been established that these conventional myosin heavy and light chains are required for cytokinesis inDictyostelium discoideum (6De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A.

Cell. 1991; 65: 1177-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It can be inferred that they are essential for cytokinesis in most eukaryotic species, with Saccharomyces cerevisiae being an exception. Even in this organism, however, cell division is impaired in the absence of myosin II (11Bi E. Maddox P. Lew D.J. Salmon E.D. McMillan J.N. Yeh E. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Watts F.Z. Shiels G. Orr E. EMBO. J. 1987; 6: 3499-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Like many other eukaryotes, the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe divides by medial fission through the use of a medially placed actin contractile ring (13Marks J. Hyams J.S. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 27-32Google Scholar, 14Gould K.L. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Analysis of mutants defective in medial ring formation led to the identification of a putative myosin light chain encoded by the cdc4 + gene (4McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and a type II myosin heavy chain. Cdc4p is an essential EF hand protein that bears significant sequence similarity to both regulatory and essential myosin light chains from diverse eukaryotes. Cdc4p localizes diffusely throughout the cell during interphase. However, during mitosis it co-localizes with actin to a medial ring that constricts following nuclear division. Myo2p, a type II myosin heavy chain, also localizes to the medial contractile ring during mitosis, and the Myo2p ring constricts during cell division (16Kitayama C. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17May K.M. Watts F.Z. Jones N. Hyams J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been established that Cdc4p directly binds Myo2p (15Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Deletion of the single IQ domain within Myo2p disrupts binding to Cdc4p (15Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of a single IQ domain within Myo2p, it does not appear that a second light chain binds to Myo2p, and it is likely that Cdc4p is the sole light chain for this myosin II (4McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In diverse eukaryotes, both heavy and light chains of myosin are phosphorylated in vivo, and in vitro biochemical experiments have shown that the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain regulates the actin-activated ATPase of myosin (reviewed in Ref.5Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Several phosphorylation sites have been mapped on regulatory myosin light chains. Phosphorylation of residues at 18–21 regulates myosin activity positively, whereas phosphorylation of more N-terminal residues (1, 2, and 9) inhibits myosin activity (reviewed in Ref. 5Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Both protein kinase C and cdc2/cyclinB kinases phosphorylate the inhibitory N-terminal sites. It has been proposed that cdc2/cyclinB phosphorylation at these sites might serve to inhibit myosin activity at the contractile ring until nuclear division is complete (1Satterwhite L.L. Pollard T.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Both the timing of cdc2/cyclinB inactivation at the end of anaphase and the timing of myosin light chain phosphorylation at different sitesin vivo (18Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) are consistent with such a model. To determine whether phosphorylation of the single myosin light chain plays a role in the timing of cytokinesis in fission yeast, we have examined the phosphorylation state of Cdc4p in vivo. We have shown that it is a phosphoprotein, and we have identified its phosphorylation sites. When these were mutated to nonphosphorylatable residues, Cdc4p function and cell division were unaltered. Hence, the timing of cytokinesis in fission yeast is not regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in TableI. Media used to grow S. pombecells and general genetic manipulation of S. pombe were as described elsewhere (19Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P.

Blots were probed sequentially with a 1:200 dilution of anti-Cdc4p serum (4McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J.

Reactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation of Cdc4p, lysates were prepared as above and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with 4 μl of antiserum. Protein A-Sepharose was added for a further 30 min, and the immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation and washed extensively. 32P-Labeled Cdc4p was subjected to partial acid hydrolysis while bound to the PVDF membrane (22Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and the phosphoamino acids were separated in two dimensions by thin-layer electrophoresis at pH 1.9 and 3.5 (23Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). For tryptic digestion, pieces of the PVDF membrane containing 32P-labeled Cdc4p were pretreated with methanol for 30 s and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.1% Tween 20 in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. After three short washes with 50 mmammonium bicarbonate, phosphopeptides were released from the membrane with 2 2.5-h incubations at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, with 10 μg ofN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-trypsin added for each incubation. After lyophilization, the phosphopeptides were separated in two dimensions with electrophoresis at pH 1.9 as detailed previously (23Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids and tryptic phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography or with the use of a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The Ser to Ala substitutions and the Ser to Asp substitutions were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into a ∼2.0-kilobase cdc4 + genomic fragment in pSK (pDM111) that had NdeI and BamHI sites inserted at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding region. The mutagenesis was performed using the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit according to manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotides were used: Ser-2 to S2A, 5′-AGCATATGGCGACAGACG-3′; Ser-6 to S6A, 5′-CAGACGATGCACCTTATA-3′; Ser-2 to S2D, 5′-GAATAGTCACATATGGATACAGACGATTCACC-3′; Ser-6 to S6D, 5′-CCATTTAGAATAGTCACATATGTCGACAGACGATGATCCTTATAAACAAG-3′; and Ser-2—Ser-6 to S2D/S6D, 5′-CCATTTAGAATAGTCACATATGGATACAGACGATGATCCTTATAAACAAG-3′. The S2A/S6A and S2A/T3A/S6A mutations were made by polymerase chain reaction with using the S6A clone as a template followed by cloning into pDM111. The 5′ oligonucleotides used were 5′-GGCATATGGCGGCAGACGATGCACCT-3′ and 5′-GGCATATGGCGACAGACGATGCA-3′ respectively, and the 3′ oligonucleotide was cdc4stp (4McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The gene fragment was removed from pDM111 usingXbaI and Acc651 and subcloned into the yeast expression vector pIRT2 (24Russell P. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast.

Leu+ diploids were allowed to sporulate, and Leu+ Ura+ haploid progeny were isolated. These were grown in minimal media containing uracil and leucine overnight. The following day, 3 × 107 cells were plated on minimal media containing uracil, leucine, and 1 mg/ml 5-fluroorotic acid. Ura− Leu− colonies were then selected. To confirm that the correct gene replacement was present within these cells, genomic DNA was prepared from the colonies, and the relevant piece of cdc4 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides cdc4seq1 (5′-GACCAGTTCCATGGCGGTC-3′) and cdc4PCR1 (5′-GTAAATTGAAGGTTGAGCG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced directly using the cdc4seq1 oligonucleotide. S. pombe Cdc4p was predicted to be a phosphoprotein based on its mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (4McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To firmly establish whether Cdc4p was indeed a phosphoprotein,S. pombe cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and a total cell protein lysate was prepared. A single 32P-labeled protein of the expected size was immunoprecipitated from the lysate by immune but not preimmune Cdc4p serum (Fig. 1 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32P-labeled Cdc4p indicated that it was phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues (Fig.1 B). Phosphopeptide mapping showed that Cdc4p was phosphorylated on a single tryptic peptide (Fig. 2,left panel). There are seven serine residues in Cdc4p located within six tryptic peptides (TableII). Based on the predicted electrophoretic and chromatographic mobility of the six possible peptides, we hypothesized that peptide 1 contained the phosphorylation site(s). This hypothesis was reinforced by the tryptic phosphopeptide map derived from 32P-labeled HA epitope-tagged Cdc4p. This tagged version of Cdc4p contains a single copy of the influenza hemagglutinin HA1 epitope fused at the N terminus of Cdc4p. HA epitope-tagged cdc4 cDNA under control of the thiamine repressible attenuated nmt1-T4 promoter (25Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene. 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 26Maundrell K. Gene. 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) is fully functional as judged by its ability to rescue growth of acdc4 null mutant. The tryptic phosphopeptide map of HAcdc4p contained different phosphopeptides than the map of untagged Cdc4p (Fig. 2, middle and right panels). This result is explained most easily if the phosphorylation occurred on a serine(s) within the first tryptic peptide, because the addition of the HA epitope would lengthen the peptide and, therefore, alter its mobility (Fig. 2).Table IICdc4p serine-containing tryptic peptidesResiduesSequence2–9STDDSPYK10–17QAFSLFDR26–33TSIGDLLR34–66ACGQNPTLAEITEIESTLPAEVDMEQFLQVLNR101–109YVLTSLGEK110–120LSNEEMDELLKThe seven serine residues are underlined. Open table in a new tab The seven serine residues are underlined. In peptide 1, there are two serine residues and hence two possible sites of phosphorylation. To determine which serine or whether both were phosphorylated, the cdc4 + genomic clone was altered by site-directed mutagenesis to encode three mutant proteins (S2A, S6A, and S2AS6A). Each of the mutants expressed episomally was capable of rescuing both temperature-sensitive and null cdc4mutants. To examine the phosphorylation state of the mutant proteins, each was produced in the cdc4 null mutant, and the cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Like wild-type Cdc4p, the S2A and S6A mutants became labeled with32P exclusively on serine residues (Fig.3, A and B). In contrast, the S2AS6A mutant protein did not become labeled detectably with 32P (Fig. 3 C). Thus, S2A and S6A represent the phosphorylation sites of Cdc4p. Although we had no evidence that threonine ever became phosphorylated on Cdc4p either in the wild-type protein or in the serine substitutions, we constructed a triple mutant, S2AT3AS6A, to ensure that phosphorylation in this region of the protein was prevented. This triple mutant also was capable of rescuing temperature-sensitive and null mutants of cdc4. In fact, the physiological experiments described below were performed with a mutant strain in which the wild-type copy of cdc4 + was replaced with the cDNA encoding S2AT3AS6A. In this strain, the triple mutant protein was produced at levels equivalent to wild-type Cdc4p and was not phosphorylated (Fig.4).Figure 4The S2AT3AS6A protein is not phosphorylated and is functional. A strain was constructed in which sequences encoding the S2AT3AS6A mutant replaced the wild-typecdc4 + coding region (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cdc4p was immunoprecipitated from a wild-type strain and from the S2AT3AS6A strain that were either unlabeled (A) or labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (B). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Cdc4 proteins from the unlabeled strains were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Cdc4p serum (A). Labeled immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by autoradiography (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As mentioned above, we were able to construct a gene replacement strain in which cdc4 + was replaced with a construct encoding S2AT3AS6A. A priori, we could conclude that the phosphorylation of Cdc4p was not required for its essential function. This strain not only produced wild-type levels of the mutant protein, but its doubling time, growth on different media, and growth on media containing the microtubule-destabilizing drug, thiabendazole, were all indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells (data not shown). We also tested whether the binding of Cdc4p to Myo2p was affected by the lack of phosphorylation. The same level of Myo2p co-immunoprecipitated with mutant Cdc4p as with wild-type Cdc4p (Fig.5 A). Because we did not detect an alteration in cell growth or division when Cdc4p was not phosphorylated, we considered the possibility that dephosphorylation rather than phosphorylation of Cdc4p might serve some essential regulatory role. To test this potentiality, we altered thecdc4 + cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis to encode proteins in which the serine phosphorylation sites were replaced with aspartic acid residues (S2D, S6D, and S2D/S6D). In some instances, the negative charge of aspartic acid can mimic, at least partially, the consequence of phosphorylation. Each aspartic acid mutant was assayed for its ability to complement both temperature-sensitive and nullcdc4 mutants when expressed from the repressednmt1 promoter. All three mutants were able to do so (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that multiple copies of these genes might obscure a phenotype, they were each integrated into the genome in single copy by replacing the cdc4 null mutation. All three mutant strains were viable and grew with wild-type kinetics on plates (Fig. 6) and in liquid medium (data not shown). Additionally, they were not sensitive to changes in media composition, temperature, or the microtubule-destabilizing drug, thiabendazole (data not shown). Numerous previous biochemical studies have indicated that myosin RLC phosphorylation may play a key role in regulating myosin function (for review see Ref. 27Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1779-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase has been shown to increase the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin II. Although myosin light chain kinase phosphorylation of the RLC (on serine 19 in vertebrate cells) is also required for assembly of vertebrate smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosins into filaments (28Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of the DictyosteliumRLC does not seem to be required for filament assembly (5Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 29Griffith L.M. Downs S.M. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Additionally the vertebrate RLC has been shown to be phos-phorylatedin vivo on serine 1 and 2 (18Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These sites have been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by both Cdc2 and protein kinase C, which results in inhibition of the actin activated ATPase activity of myosin (see Ref. 1Satterwhite L.L. Pollard T.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and references therein). These results led Satterwhite and Pollard (1Satterwhite L.L. Pollard T.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) to propose an elegant model where, early in mitosis, phosphorylation by CDC2 would inhibit assembly of active myosin at the cortex, then inactivation of CDC2 would allow dephosphorylation of these sites, and subsequent phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase would trigger myosin assembly and cleavage furrow formation. This model was further supported by a study showing that Ser-1 and Ser-2 phosphorylation was maximal in mitotic cells, and then during cytokinesis Ser-1 and Ser-2 phosphorylation decreased, and Ser-19 phosphorylation increased (18Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These results have been further supported by cytological examination of cells proceeding through mitosis using Ser-19 phosphoepitope-specific antibodies (30Matsumura F. Ono S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although the experiments described above make a compelling case for the importance of RLC phosphorylation in the regulation of cytokinesis, the results are only correlative and do not demonstrate whether these events are essential in vivo. A direct test of the importance of these phosphorylation events in vivo using genetic systems has provided mixed results. InDictyostelium, RLC null cells are unable do undergo cytokinesis in liquid culture (8Chen P. Ostrow B.D. Tafuri S.R. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1933-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) just like cells that are null for the myosin heavy chain (6De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 7Knecht D.A. Loomis W.F. Science. 1987; 236: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, mutant RLCs that have had the activating phosphorylation site (Ser-13) mutated to alanine are able to fully complement the defects of the RLC null alleles even though the myosin isolated from these cells displayed reduced actin-activated ATPase activity (3Ostrow B.D. Chen P. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These experiments argue that although the RLC phosphorylation is conserved and may be important for the long term fitness of the organism, it is not essential. In contrast, experiments in Drosophila have shown that RLCs with alanine substitution mutations in the activating phosphorylation sites are unable to rescue RLC null alleles (2Jordan P. Karess R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1805-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). One explanation for these different results may that in Dictyostelium, RLC phosphorylation only modulates the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin, whereas inDrosophila, both activity and assembly are affected. To date no genetic studies have investigated the importance of the RLC inhibitory phosphorylation sites in vivo. As has been observed in other systems, type II myosin and its associated light chain play essential roles in fission yeast cytokinesis (4McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M.

Genetics. 1998; 149: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the studies presented here, we demonstrated that like vertebrate RLCs, Cdc4p is phosphorylated on two sites near the N terminus of the protein (Ser-2 and Ser-6). Also like vertebrate cells, we do not observe both phosphorylation events at once. Cells seem to have one site or the other phosphorylated, but not both, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Cdc4p is regulated and that perhaps phosphorylation of one site inhibits phosphorylation of the other. The fact that the phosphorylation site at Ser-6 is a consensus Cdc2p phosphorylation site further suggests that Cdc4p phosphorylation may be cell cycle-regulated. Unfortunately, we were unable to determine whether either of these sites was phosphorylated in a cell cycle-specific manner, and we did not observe any changes in the total phosphorylation levels of the protein throughout the cell cycle (data not shown). The lack of a phenotype when these sites are mutated either singly or in combination shows that these sites are not essential for cells to carry out cytokinesis and that yeast myosin II may function more like theDictyostelium myosin. It is also possible that, like inDictyostelium, heavy chain phosphorylation may be important for regulation of myosin function, because we have observed that Myo2p is a phosphoprotein in vivo. 2K. Gould, unpublished observations. It will be important in the future to develop procedures for purifying yeast myosin so that biochemical effects of the phosphorylation site mutations can be determined, as has been done inDictyostelium. Some caution should be used in drawing the comparison between S. pombe myosin II and myosin II from Dictyostelium and vertebrates. The two type II myosin genes that have been identified inS. pombe have both been termed unconventional type II myosins largely because the tails have numerous proline residues that could potentially disrupt coiled coil-mediated oligomerization (for review see Ref. 34May K.M. Win T.Z. Hyams J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study showed that Myo2p contains a single functional IQ site that binds Cdc4p, and thus, Cdc4p may be the only light chain for this myosin (15Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At present it is unclear whether these myosins represent primordial type II myosins, the first members of a new family, or diverged yeast forms of myosin II. For this reason, regulatory effects of phosphorylation may be somewhat different from other myosins. Still, it is striking that the similar pattern of two N-terminal phosphorylation sites is conserved, and the simple fact that this phosphorylation has been maintained throughout evolution indicates it that must be doing something beneficial for the cell, which may not be readily observed under our laboratory growth conditions. If Cdc4p phosphorylation serves a somewhat redundant function, as our results suggest, it may be of future interest to look for mutations that are synthetically lethal in combination with Cdc4p phosphorylation site mutants, to identify genes that are essential in the absence of proper regulation of Cdc4p by phosphorylation. We thank Dr. M. Balasubramanian for critical reading of the manuscript and for antibodies to Myo2p."

The same clonal cells seeded at high density targeted these proteins to the reverse location. Furthermore, high density cells had vigorous apical endocytosis, and low density cells had none. The extracellular matrix of high density cells was capable of inducing apical endocytosis and relocation of band 3 to the basolateral membrane in low density cells. A 230-kDa extracellular matrix (ECM) protein termed hensin, when purified to near-homogeneity, was able to reverse the phenotype of the low density cells. Antibodies to hensin prevented this effect, indicating that hensin is necessary for conversion of polarity. We show here that hensin was synthesized by both low density and high density cells. Whereas both phenotypes secreted soluble hensin into their media, only high density cells localized it in their ECM. Analysis of soluble hensin by sucrose density gradients showed that low density cells secreted monomeric hensin, and high density cells secreted higher order multimers. When 35S-labeled monomeric hensin was added to high density cells, they induced its aggregation suggesting that the multimerization was catalyzed by surface events in the high density cells. Soluble monomeric or multimeric hensin did not induce apical endocytosis in low density cells, whereas the more polymerized hensin isolated from insoluble ECM readily induced it. These multimers could be disaggregated by sulfhydryl reagents and by dimethylmaleic anhydride, and treatment of high density ECM by these reagents prevented the induction of endocytosis. These results demonstrate that hensin, like several ECM proteins, needs to be precipitated in the ECM to be functional.

These results demonstrate that hensin, like several ECM proteins, needs to be precipitated in the ECM to be functional. The plasma membrane of epithelial cells is polarized into two domains; apical and basolateral, each of which has characteristic protein and lipid composition (1Eaton S. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 82: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 3Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Although targeting sequences were found in the structure of several polarized proteins, recent studies have shown that some proteins are polarized in a cell type-specific manner; for instance the Na,K-ATPase is targeted to the apical membrane of retinal pigment epithelium but to the basolateral membrane of most other epithelia (4Gundersen D. Orlowski J. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Several other proteins exhibit this flexibility in targeting; the most dramatic example is the targeting of the proton-translocating ATPase and the Cl:HCO3 exchanger of the intercalated cell of the renal tubule (reviewed in Ref. 5Al-Awqati Q. Vijayakumar S. Hikita C. Chen J. Takito J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F183-F190PubMed Google Scholar). These cells exist in a spectrum of forms. One extreme, the α type, has an apical H+-ATPase and a basolateral anion exchanger that is an alternately spliced form of the erythroid band 3 (kAE1) 1The abbreviations used are: kAE1, the kidney-specific alternately spliced form of the anion exchanger 1; DMMA, dimethylmaleic anhydride; DTT, dithiothreitol; ECM, extracellular matrix; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CUB, Complement subcomponents Clr/Cls, Uegf,Bmpl; SRCR, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich; ZP, zona pellucida domain. and hence is capable of trans-epithelial secretion of H+. In contrast, the β form secretes HCO3 by a basolateral H+-ATPase and an apical kAE1 (6van Adelsberg J.S. Edwards J.C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11283-11289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (However, one study did not find kAE1 by immunoblot analysis but confirmed the presence of its mRNA (7Fejes-Toth G. Chen W.R. Rusvai E. Moser T. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26717-26721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) In an immortalized clonal cell line (8Edwards J.C. van Adelsberg J. Rater M. Herzlinger D. Lebowitz J. Al-Awqati Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C521-C529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that β cells can be converted to an α form by changes in the seeding density (9van Adelsberg J. Edwards J.C. Takito J. Kiss B. Al-Awqati Q. Cell. 1994; 76: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reproducing a previous demonstration in vivo induced by changes in the acid content of the diet (10Schwartz G.J. Barasch J. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1985; 318: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The development of the clonal cell line allowed us to begin to uncover the biochemical basis of this plasticity. When the immortalized cells were seeded on filters at subconfluent density, they eventually formed epithelial monolayers capable of secreting HCO3 into the apical medium. These cells did not exhibit any apical endocytic activity; they had apical kAE1 and a basolateral H+-ATPase (9van Adelsberg J. Edwards J.C. Takito J. Kiss B. Al-Awqati Q. Cell. 1994; 76: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Remarkably, when the same cells were seeded at confluent density, their phenotype was that of the α cells; i.e. they had vigorous apical endocytosis, apical H+-ATPase, and basolateral kAE1, changes that occurred within 24 h of seeding. Both phenotypes were stable in culture for as long as the cells were observed. Hence, it was not the assumption of cell to cell contact but rather the initial seeding density that rapidly induced a binary switch in phenotype. More recently, we discovered that low density cells were flat, and high density cells were columnar. Furthermore, the apical cytoskeleton was dramatically different in the two phenotypes; low density cells had sparse microvilli, no apical actin, villin, or cytokeratin 19, whereas high density cells had exuberant microvilli, abundant sub-apical actin, villin, and cytokeratin 19 (11Vijayakumar S. Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies show that the transition from β to α phenotype was remarkably similar to terminal differentiation of epithelia, especially as seen in the intestine during the transition from crypt to villus (12Louvard D. Kedinger M. Hauri H.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 157-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). When low density cells were seeded on the extracellular matrix (ECM) of high density cells, they assumed all the characteristics of high density cells. By using the induction of apical endocytosis as an assay, we purified a protein from high density ECM that was capable of converting the polarity of the low density cells (9van Adelsberg J. Edwards J.C. Takito J. Kiss B. Al-Awqati Q. Cell. 1994; 76: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This protein, now termed hensin (for change in body in Japanese, see Ref. 13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), is composed of three types of domains, SRCR (14Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), CUB (15Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and Zp domains (16Bork P. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Hensin is a protein widely expressed in epithelial organs and brain. During the purification of hensin, it became clear that the protein traveled on gel filtration at a mobility suggestive of a size much higher than that predicted by its molecular mass of 230 kDa. To purify hensin to homogeneity required treatment with SDS and 4m urea (13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but this denatured, if pure, hensin did not induce apical endocytosis in low density cells. However, a polyclonal antibody generated against a fusion protein composed of two SRCR domains prevented the induction of endocytosis in high density cells (13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that hensin is necessary for activity, but whether it is also sufficient by itself is at present unknown. In the present paper, we demonstrate that hensin is secreted as a soluble protein into the basolateral medium by the two phenotypes. Low density cells secrete only monomeric hensin, whereas high density cells secrete a soluble form of hensin that is multimeric. In addition, high density cells (but not low density cells) secrete a form of hensin that is retained in the ECM as a higher order multimer. We refer to this insoluble ECM form of hensin as precipitated hensin pending further analysis of its structure. Many ECM proteins such as collagen and fibronectin are retained in the ECM because they form fibrils composed of a large number of monomers associated in a specific architectural pattern as fibers or networks. Procedures that disaggregate the ECM type of multimer prevent hensin from inducing apical endocytosis in low density cells. These results demonstrate that only multimeric insoluble hensin is capable of inducing endocytosis, reversing the polarity, and inducing terminal differentiation of intercalated cells. Clone C of β-intercalated cells were maintained at 32 °C as described (8Edwards J.C. van Adelsberg J. Rater M. Herzlinger D. Lebowitz J. Al-Awqati Q. Am. J.

The cells were seeded on 0.45-μm polycarbonate filter (Transwell, Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 2 × 104/cm2 (low density) or 4 × 105 cells/cm2 (high density) and cultured at 40 °C to inactivate T antigen. Cells were seeded at high density on polycarbonate filters and grown for 24 h at 40 °C. Media were changed to minimum Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine (Sigma) for 2 h and pulse-labeled with 100 μCi/ml35S (NEN Life Science Products Express35S-protein labeling mix) for 10 min at 40 °C followed by chase with regular medium supplemented with 10 mml-methionine. Cells were lysed in 1% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and boiled for 3 min. Insoluble materials were removed by a brief centrifugation (14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature), and the protein concentration of the supernatants was determined by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein was taken from each sample, diluted 10-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and used for immunoprecipitation. Alternatively, cells and ECM were extracted separately and used for immunoprecipitation as described below. Tunicamycin (Sigma) (0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm NaOH) was freshly prepared and added to media of high density cells to a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml; an equal volume of 10 mm NaOH was added to the control media. Cells were preincubated for 5 h and then pulse-labeled with 35S for 10 min followed by chase up to 2 h in the continuous presence of tunicamycin. Filter-grown high density cells were labeled with 35S for 12 h and extracted with buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm calcium chloride) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. Cell extracts were removed, and filters were scraped in this solution with a cell scraper to remove loosely attached materials and washed thoroughly with the same solution for another hour at 4 °C. Insoluble materials remaining on these filters were extracted with 4m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS at 4 °C overnight, and this was referred as the ECM fraction (9van Adelsberg J. Edwards J.C. Takito J. Kiss B. Al-Awqati Q. Cell. 1994; 76: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both cell and ECM extracts were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight. To these samples, one-tenth volume of buffer B (1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmcalcium chloride) was added, and they were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Conditioned media were collected and spun at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the top two-thirds of the supernatants were saved and mixed with one-tenth volume of buffer A before immunoprecipitation. To materials ready for immunoprecipitation, guinea pig anti-hensin serum (13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was added to a dilution of 1:500 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for another 1 h. Beads were washed three times with a buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and boiled in sample buffer for 3 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol, soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C. Densitometric scanning was performed by a Computing Densitometer model 300A (Molecular Dynamics). Monolayers plated at various densities were exposed to HCO3−/CO2-free medium containing 2–5 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase and 10% fetal bovine serum on the apical side of the monolayer only. The cells were incubated on a rotary shaker for 10 min at 40 or 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, the cells were transferred to ice-cold medium, washed 10 times at 4 °C on a shaker, and solubilized in 1% Triton. The activity of horseradish peroxidase was measured as the initial rate of hydrolysis of o-dianisidine (Sigma) in a Beckman DU-2 spectrophotometer. The volume of endocytosis was calculated by constructing a standard curve of horseradish peroxidase activity in dilutions of the starting material. Apical endocytosis was taken to be the difference between uptake at 40 °C minus that at 4 °C. High density cells seeded on transwells were extracted with buffer A, and filters were pre-equilibrated with a solution containing 50 mmHepes-KOH (pH 8.5). 5 mm dimethylmaleic anhydride (DMMA, Sigma), dissolved in the same buffer was added to the filters and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotary shaker. The filters were washed thoroughly with 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.5) to remove excess DMMA and then incubated with 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 6.7) at 4 °C overnight. These filters were first equilibrated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 4 °C overnight before cells were seeded on them at low density. Conditioned media were collected from low density or high density cells and concentrated 10-fold using Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and divided into Eppendorf tubes. Each tube received 5 mm DTT or 5 mm EDTA. For the DMMA (5 mm) studies, the samples were incubated at 4 °C for an hour and then dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.5) at 4 °C overnight, and one-half of the sample was further dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 6.7). All samples were loaded on 12 ml of 5–30% sucrose gradient in 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5, 8.5, or 6.7) and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Proteins in each fraction (1 ml) were precipitated by 6% trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in a sample buffer, subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-hensin serum. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the molecular weight of hensin increased after its synthesis, and the intensity of the band eventually decreased with prolonged periods of chase (Fig. 1 A). Hensin was secreted into the basolateral medium, partially explaining the reduced intensity during the chase period (Fig. 1 C). The molecular weight shift was abolished when the cells were pretreated with tunicamycin indicating that hensin is N-glycosylated (Fig.1 B). Surprisingly, hensin was synthesized not only in high density cells but also in low density cells; indeed low density cells consistently synthesized it at a higher rate (Fig. 2) (11Vijayakumar S. Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and hensin was chased into the cell lysate, ECM, and medium in both low density and high density cells. (ECM is here defined as the guanidine-extractable material remaining on the filter after Triton solubilization.) While hensin accumulated in the ECM of high density cells, very little was seen in low density cells (Fig. 2). These results confirmed our original finding that high density ECM, but not that of low density, contained hensin (9van Adelsberg J. Edwards J.C. Takito J. Kiss B. Al-Awqati Q. Cell. 1994; 76: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Basolateral secretion was seen in both phenotypes, but the degree of polarization was not high since these cells were examined only 2 days after seeding, a time before the development of impermeable monolayers as assayed by the trans-epithelial flux of [14C]inulin (data not shown). Recent immunocytochemical studies documented that hensin is indeed an ECM protein in high density; it was accessible to externally added antibodies without the necessity for permeabilizing the cells, and it co-localized in confocal images with an authentic ECM protein, collagen IV (11Vijayakumar S. Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that hensin began to accumulate in the ECM within 3 h of seeding the cells at high density. In low density cells, there was a large amount of hensin, but it was restricted to intracellular vesicles (Fig. 3).Figure 3Distribution of hensin in intercalated cells seeded at high and low densities for different times.Magnification, × 400.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Hensin was present in high density cells in both soluble (i.e. secreted into the media) and insoluble forms (i.e. present in the ECM). However, low density cells seemed to produce only the soluble form raising the possibility that hensin was degraded in ECM of low density but not that of high density cells. However, detailed experiments on the rate of proteolysis of hensin, the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, and the effect of protease inhibitors on the half-life of hensin failed to reveal any difference between the two phenotypes (data not shown). To examine whether even the soluble hensin might exist in different forms in the two phenotypes, we separated secreted hensin by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. We found that hensin secreted by low density cells was recovered in fractions 3 and 4, as would be predicted from monomeric hensin (Fig. 4). However, as much as 30% of hensin secreted into the media of high density cells was recovered in fractions 7 and 8 and in the pellet (Fig. 4). Fraction 7 corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 700,000, double (or perhaps even quadruple) the apparent molecular weight of hensin. Because hensin is a cysteine-rich protein, we treated the high density media with dithiothreitol (DTT), a reagent that reduces di-sulfide bonds; all multimeric hensin was reduced to the monomeric form (Fig. 4,lane DTT). These results, however, cannot distinguish whether the multimerization was produced by inter-molecular or by intra-molecular disulfide bonds. Recent studies on the structure of SRCR domains demonstrated that intra-molecular disulfide bonds are critical for formation of the native structure of the domain (17Resnick D. Chatterton J.E. Schwartz K. Slayter H. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26924-26930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DMMA is a useful reagent that reacts with the ε-amino group of lysine to produce a maleyl lysine, thereby converting it from a cation to an anion. This large change in electrostatic potential frequently results in disaggregation of subunits or large conformational changes (18Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, San Francisco1971: 76-77Google Scholar). Maleyl lysine is stable at neutral or alkaline pH but is rapidly hydrolyzed in acidic media resulting in the regeneration of the cationic group of lysine. We used DMMA treatment to probe the association and dissociation of hensin. When the conditioned medium of high density cells was pretreated with DMMA at pH 8.0, hensin was substantially reduced in fractions 7 and 12 indicating that hensin unfolded to assume the monomeric form (Fig. 4, DMMA pH 8). These results demonstrate that hensin does not form multimers by inter-molecular disulfide bonds. When this sample was further dialyzed against a buffer of pH 6.7, 25% of the total amount of hensin appeared in fraction 7 demonstrating that when high density hensin is disassembled, it could spontaneously form back into multimers given the right conditions, i.e. conversion of maleyl lysine back to lysine. Furthermore, that the association of multimeric hensin is reversible suggested that the conformation of hensin has been altered in some permanent way by the high density state. Soluble multimeric hensin of high density cells must undergo additional multimerization, fibril formation, or association with other ECM proteins before being able to localize in the ECM. Because divalent ions are often critical for stabilization of tertiary structure, we tested their effect on hensin extraction. High density ECM when treated with calcium (or other divalent ions) contained more hensin than those exposed to the chelators EDTA or EGTA (Fig. 5), suggesting that the localization of hensin in the ECM likely involves a calcium-mediated aggregation or a change in conformation. However, EDTA and EGTA did not change the multimeric state of soluble hensin secreted into the media (Fig. 4), suggesting that the effect of calcium in retaining hensin in the ECM might involve mechanisms other than multimerization; perhaps it had an effect on association with other ECM proteins. When the ECM of high density cells was isolated (using deoxycholate extraction rather than guanidine to avoid excessive denaturation) and separated on sucrose density gradients, hensin remained in the pellet. Treatment of ECM by DTT resulted in a partial solubilization, where some hensin was now present in fractions as light as a tetramer, although the majority of hensin remained at a higher order (Fig.6). These results demonstrate that ECM hensin precipitates in a very high density fraction suggesting that it is a multimer of much higher order than a tetramer. Induction of apical endocytosis is an early and consistent marker for the change in polarity; high density cells have a vigorous rate, whereas low density cells have no apical endocytosis (Fig. 7 A). Low density cells seeded on high density matrix develop apical endocytosis (Fig. 7 A). Incubation of high density cells in media containing a polyclonal antibody to hensin inhibited the development of apical endocytosis (Fig. 7 A) (13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that hensin in the ECM of high density cells is necessary for induction of apical endocytosis and, by extension, reversal of the polarity of several proteins in the low density cells. What is the form of hensin that can induce the reversal of polarity? Soluble monomeric hensin, in fractions 3 and 4, was concentrated and applied to low density cells; it was unable to induce apical endocytosis in low density cells (Fig. 7 A). To examine the extent of multimerization needed to induce the change in phenotype, we concentrated the soluble fractions 7 and 8 and fraction 12 and exposed low density cells to these multimeric fractions for 5 days and assayed for apical endocytosis. These concentrated fractions did not induce apical endocytosis (Fig. 7 A) implying that such multimers were either not polymeric enough, of different conformation, or else required another protein to exert their effect. We point out that these multimers were still soluble since they were identified in the media of high density cells making it likely that only the polymeric form of hensin is functionally active. Pretreatment of high density ECM by DTT or N-ethylmaleimide or both sequentially to alkylate all reducible disulfide bonds (and therefore to convert hensin to a monomeric form) abolished the ability of high density ECM to induce apical endocytosis (Fig. 7 B). When high density ECM-containing filters were pretreated with DTT or NEM, hensin was extracted to the same extent as from untreated filters. Hence, the lack of effect on endocytosis was not due to loss of hensin from these filters. Similarly, treatment of high density ECM by DMMA also abolished its ability to induce apical endocytosis (Fig.7 B). These results demonstrate that only precipitated ECM hensin is capable of inducing the change in phenotype. The mechanism by which different forms of hensin exist in the two phenotypes could be due to a biosynthetic intracellular event, similar to what occurs during the initial stages of collagen biosynthesis (19Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a cell-surface event in the high density phenotype occurs which will lead to polymerization and precipitation, a phenomenon described with fibronectin fibril formation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we labeled low density cells with [35S]methionine and concentrated the labeled hensin (i.e. fractions 3 and 4). This was then added to unlabeled low and high density cells. After a 24-h incubation, the media were removed, concentrated, and separated on sucrose density gradients. Hensin in all gradient fractions was immunoprecipitated and separated on SDS-PAGE, and 35S-labeled hensin was subjected to autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry. It is clear from Fig.8 that high density cells were able to induce polymerization of hensin, whereas low density cells did not. The functional assay used in this study, induction of apical endocytosis, is one of the cardinal events that occurs during the conversion of polarity in vitro and in vivo (9van Adelsberg J. Edwards J.C. Takito J. Kiss B. Al-Awqati Q. Cell. 1994; 76: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,10Schwartz G.J. Barasch J. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1985; 318: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). As an assay for this plasticity, it is more quantitative than the immunocytochemical localization of proteins, and the fact that low density cells had no apical endocytosis provides an excellent signal to noise ratio. High density cells (and α cells in situ) have vigorous apical endocytosis, and this process occurs early after seeding at high density and remains during the 2 weeks of observation. Since the vacuolar H+-ATPase is packaged in sub-apical endocytic vesicles which continuously form and then fuse with the apical membrane, the induction of apical endocytosis is an excellent surrogate marker for the presence of the H+-ATPase in the apical membrane (20Gluck S. Cannon C. Al-Awqati Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 21Gluck S. Kelly S. Al-Awqati Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9230-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cannon C. van Adelsberg J. Kelly S. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1985; 314: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently found that high density cells have dramatically different apical cytoskeleton, such as the appearance of a sub-apical actin network and the induction of apical villin and cytokeratin 19 (11Vijayakumar S. Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that the induction of apical endocytosis, an important phenomenon in its own right, is also a legitimate marker for the reversal of polarity of the H+-ATPase and the anion exchanger kAE1. We initially found that the ECM of high density cells (defined as the 4m guanidine extract after solubilizing cells with 1% Triton) contained an activity that retargeted kAE1 to the basolateral membrane and induced apical endocytosis in low density cells; the latter experiments were confirmed in the new studies shown in Fig.7 A. Purification using standard chromatographic methods resulted in a highly active fraction whose major protein component was hensin (9van Adelsberg J. Edwards J.C. Takito J. Kiss B. Al-Awqati Q. Cell. 1994; 76: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, further purification of hensin required denaturation with 4 m urea and 0.1% SDS, a procedure that resulted in a homogenously pure protein but that lacked the ability to induce apical endocytosis (13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whether the loss of activity was due to denaturation of hensin, to a loss of an associated protein, or whether hensin is unrelated to the polarity reversal required additional information. A fusion protein composed of two of the SRCR domains of hensin was used to generate polyclonal antibodies. These sera inhibited the ability of unfractionated high density ECM to induce apical endocytosis (results that are also recapitulated in Fig.7 A), whereas preimmune sera had no effect (13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Extensive morphological studies also show that anti-hensin antibodies also prevented the development of the above mentioned changes in apical cytoskeleton (11Vijayakumar S. Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, seeding cells on purified ECM components (fibronectin, laminin, or collagen IV) or on complex ECM preparations (matrigel) did not induce the changes in apical cytoskeleton, nor did specific antibodies against ECM proteins prevent the change in phenotype (11Vijayakumar S. Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that hensin is necessary for the reversal of polarity, but whether it is sufficient by itself to perform this activity or needs an additional protein will require more studies. The surprising finding of the current study is that hensin was abundantly synthesized and secreted by low density cells, but it was not retained in the ECM. Because this soluble hensin appeared to be a monomer, it is likely that retention in the ECM requires oligomerization and or association with other ECM proteins. High density cells secreted soluble hensin into the medium and insoluble hensin that was localized in the ECM. The apparent molecular mass of the soluble hensin was as high as a tetramer. However, ECM hensin is much larger than a tetramer, and it precipitates in the ECM either alone or in association with other ECM proteins (Fig. 6). That it could not be purified to homogeneity without harsh conditions suggests that it is likely enmeshed in a network of other ECM proteins. Importantly, procedures that disrupted the multimeric formation inhibited the activity of hensin (Figs. 6 and 7). Furthermore, it appeared that multimerization to a lower order such as that which occurs in soluble hensin failed to induce the activity. Hence, these results demonstrate that only precipitated hensin can induce the change in phenotype. What causes precipitation of hensin? We believe that studies on other ECM proteins might suggest an answer. Fibronectin and collagen are synthesized as soluble monomers, but their deposition in the ECM requires oligomerization and fibril formation, a process that is “catalyzed” by other proteins such as activated integrin receptors or proteases (19Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 23Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 24Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The case of fibronectin is particularly instructive. Soluble fibronectin is unable to activate its receptor. However, “activation” of the receptor by a variety of procedures induces a high affinity state. This high affinity integrin receptor is capable of binding fibronectin and inducing it to form fibrils (23Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar,24Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Can high density seeding perform the same function on the putative hensin receptor? Although this must await the identification of such a receptor, the studies of Fig. 8 demonstrate that addition of monomeric hensin produced by low density cells to cells seeded at high density causes hensin to form multimers, even precipitates. Of course, these studies do not exclude the role of other ECM proteins in helping to precipitate hensin. However, they demonstrate that oligomerization of hensin and its precipitation is not a biosynthetic event that occurs only in high density cells, similar to what occurs in collagen trimer formation (19Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Rather, the high density cells act from the outside to multimerize it. We recently found that the change in phenotype induced by high seeding density includes the formation of exuberant microvilli, the localization of villin and cytokeratin 19 to the apical cytoplasm, and the assumption of a columnar shape by these epithelial cells (11Vijayakumar S. Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings are remarkably similar to what occurs in the intestinal epithelial cell when it differentiates from the crypt stem cell to a villus absorptive cell (12Louvard D. Kedinger M. Hauri H.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 157-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that some ECM component is involved in this terminal differentiation (26Sanderson I.R. Ezzell R.M. Kedinger M. Erlanger M. Xu Z.X. Pringault E. Leon-Robine S. Louvard D. Walker W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7717-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hensin is expressed in most epithelia, but its expression in the intestine is especially robust (13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We recently found that hensin is distributed in crypt cells in a pattern identical to that of low density intercalated cells, whereas in the villus cells its expression was like that of high density cells (13Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2325-2331Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results suggest that hensin might be involved in terminal differentiation of other epithelia. Terminal differentiation is a critical step in epithelial biology whose interruption often leads to the development of malignancies. It was recently reported that chromosome 10q25-26 contains a region often deleted in malignant brain tumors, and a cDNA encoded by that region, DMBT1, was found to be deleted in 20% of malignant gliomas (27Mollenhauer J. Wiemann S. Schurlen W. Korn B. Hayashi Y. Wilgenbus K.K. Deimling A.V. Poustka A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We recently discovered that DMBT1 and hensin are alternately spliced forms of the same gene raising the possibility that hensin might be a tumor suppressor (28Takito J. Hikita C. Vijayakumar S. Warburton D. Al-Awqati Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We are grateful to Theresa Swayne for expert assistance in confocal microscopy.

The subsequent translocation of the polypeptide into the ER lumen and the integration of transmembrane segments into the ER membrane are mediated by a protein channel that forms the translocon (8Andrews D.W.

Calnexin is part of a multimeric protein complex, including calreticulin, BiP, GRP94, and Erp57, that “proofreads” the protein folding process in the ER (7Tatu U. Helenius A. J.

N-Glycosylation is a co-translational event involving theen bloc transfer of a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide from a dolichol donor to a lumenal acceptor site (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in the nascent chain by the ER oligosaccharyl transferase (12Kaplan H.A.

Inhibition of α-glucosidase I and II with castanospermine (CST) prevents calnexin binding (27Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of a single oligosaccaride moiety on a protein is sufficient for the interaction with calnexin; however, the interaction is enhanced when multipleN-glycosylated sites are present (30Hebert D.N.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the interaction of calnexin with glycoproteins may proceed in two stages; the first involves lectin binding to the oligosaccharide, and the second involves a protein-protein interaction (23Ware F.E.

This oligosaccharide-independent interaction may, however, be the result of calnexin binding to aggregated protein (38Cannon K.S. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14280-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Most studies of calnexin interactions have focused on secreted proteins or membrane proteins that contain a single transmembrane (TM) segment. Calnexin and calreticulin can interact with both soluble lumenal glycoproteins and intrinsic membrane glycoproteins, although some glycoproteins show a preferential interaction (10Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Goedken M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7107-7111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol.

Ou W.J. Doherty III, J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol.

Nilsson I. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Calnexin is known to bind to newly synthesized, single-span membrane glycoproteins, such as MHC class I and II (23Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Calnexin is also involved in the folding and maturation of polytopic membrane glycoproteins, such as P-glycoprotein (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator (44Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the T cell receptor (39Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the acetylcholine receptor (45Keller S.H. Lindstrom J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22871-22877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 46Chang W. Gelman M.S. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because most polytopic membrane proteins are N-glycosylated on a single EC loop, greater than 30 residues in size (47Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), these proteins are likely to interact with calnexin. However, the position and number ofN-glycosylated sites in polytopic membrane proteins vary. We therefore determined whether calnexin was able to interact with oligosaccharide chains located at different positions in a polytopic membrane protein and whether this interaction occurred while the protein was held within the translocation machinery. In this study, the interaction of calnexin withN-glycosylated mutants of the human erythrocyte anion exchanger, AE1 (band 3) was studied using an in vitrotranslation system and in transfected cells. AE1 contains two structural domains: a large amino-terminal domain located in the cytoplasm and a carboxyl-terminal, membrane-spanning domain responsible for the anion exchange function (Fig. 1) (48Reithmeier R.A.F. Chan S.L. Popov M. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. 2. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam1996: 281-309Google Scholar). Our recent topology model of AE1 predicts 12 TM segments, with a single site ofN-linked glycosylation at Asn-642, located in the fourth EC loop (Fig. 1) (49Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We show that calnexin interacts with AE1 in a glycosylation-dependent fashion and that this interaction is not dependent on the position of the oligosaccharide within this polytopic membrane protein. Truncated constructs of AE1 that retain tRNA on their nascent chain were tested for co-translational interaction with calnexin. The calnexin interaction was detected by co-immunoprecipitation when the translationally arrested polypeptide was released by puromycin. This shows that the predominant calnexin-AE1 interaction occurs posttranslationally. The following is a list of products and their sources: ModulisTM in vitro transcription system and canine pancreatic microsomes (MBI Fermentas), Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate and RNasin (Promega), [35S]Met and [α-35S]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), TransformerTM mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH), T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), digitonin and Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), Brij 96 (Sigma), dropping bottle with 20–30 μm filter unit (Wheaton). Polyclonal rabbit anti-calnexin antibodies directed against a carboxyl-terminal peptide (antibody C) corresponding to the last 14 residues of canine calnexin (5Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or against ER lumenal region of calnexin (antibody N) expressed and purified from Sf9 cells (residues 1–461) as described in Ref. 26Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar were kind gifts from Dr. David Williams (University of Toronto). Polyclonal rabbit anti-AE1 antibody directed against a carboxyl-terminal peptide corresponding to the last 12 residues of human AE1 (50Popov M. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was employed to detect AE1. The cDNA of human Band 3 in Bluescript vector BSSK+ was a kind gift from Drs. A. M. Garcia and H. Lodish (Whitehead Institute). The endogenousN-glycosylation site at Asn-642 was mutated to Asp (N642D) in the membrane domain construct of AE1-AE1md (residues 386–911), as described (51Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Full-length AE1 and the AE1md were subcloned into pcDNA3 vector as described (50Popov M. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A series of uniqueN-glycosylation acceptor sites were created in the AE1md or in the N642D construct (Fig. 1) using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and the double-stranded mutagenesis system fromCLONTECH. A series of mutants were made containing unique restriction enzyme sites that cut at amino acid positions 696 (NcoI), 714 (NotI), 754 (XbaI), 785 (XbaI), and 820 (XbaI) in the AE1md construct. Short EC loops in TM were expanded by insertion of a 35-amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 626–659 of EC loop 4, containing the endogenous or mutated (N642D) N-glycosylation acceptor site, as described (49Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 52Tam L.Y. Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The insertion mutants are illustrated in Fig. 1. In insertion mutants ins.EC1 and ins.EC7, the sequence of EC loop 4 containing the endogenous acceptor site, Asn-642, was inserted into EC loop 1 and EC loop 7, respectively, whereas the endogenous site was mutated to N642D. Insertion construct ins.EC2a contained an EC loop 4 insertion in EC loop 2 with both N-glycosylation acceptor sites mutated. Insertion construct ins.EC2b contained oneN-glycosylation acceptor site in the inserted sequence only, whereas ins.EC2c had the endogenous acceptor site only. The ins.EC2d construct contained two N-glycosylation acceptor sites, one endogenous and one in the insert. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (53Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar). ModulisTM in vitrotranscription system and plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) in a final volume of 10 μl were used to synthesize mRNA. The transcription mixture (3 μl) was used for in vitro translation using Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described by the supplier; the lysate was supplemented with 2 units of canine pancreatic microsomes in a final volume of 30 μl. Membrane integration of the translation products was determined by extracting samples (10 μl) with 100 μl of ice-cold 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, followed by recovery of the stripped microsomes by centrifugation (16,000 ×g for 20 min). Alternatively, 35 μmAc-NYT-NH2 (to block the N-glycosylation of AE1) or CST (to inhibit α-glucosidase I and II) was included in the translation mixture when indicated. For co-translational interaction, the cDNA corresponding to the AE1md was linearized within the coding region at amino acid positions 696 (NcoI), 714 (NotI), 754 (XbaI), 785 (XbaI), 820 (XbaI), and 854 (NaeI, the endogenous unique restriction site). The insertion mutant ins.EC1 (Fig. 1) was linearized at position 854 (NaeI). The translation reaction was performed at 27 °C for 30 min. Following the translation reaction, two separate additions were made: (i) 1.5 mm puromycin, followed by an additional 10-min incubation at 27 °C, or (ii) 35 μm Ac-NYT-NH2, 1 mm CST, followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. The stability of attached ribosomes was time- and temperature-dependent. Lower temperatures (25 °C) and shorter translation times (30 min) favored the stability of the complex but significantly reduced protein biosynthesis (54Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation, 20 μl of the translation reaction was solubilized in 600 μl of PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) digitonin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmaprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A. Alternatively, 1% Triton X-100, Brij 96, or CHAPS was used as indicated. After 3–4 h of incubation at 4 °C with anti-calnexin antibody (5 μl), 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads in PBS buffer (1:1) was added, followed by a 2 h incubation at 4 °C. Beads were washed with PBS buffer containing 0.2% digitonin and bound proteins were solubilized in 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (4% SDS), at room temperature. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected with 5 μg of DNA/10-cm dish, using the DEAE-dextran method as described in Ref. 50Popov M. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar. 20–24 h following transfection, cells were labeled with [35S]Met (0.1 mCi/ml) for 20–25 min. Labeled cells were washed once with PBS buffer, and cells were solubilized in PBS containing 1% (w/v) digitonin and protease inhibitors (as described above). Samples were filtered through a large pore filter unit, divided into three equal aliquots (700 μl), and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-calnexin antibody (3 μl) or anti-AE1 antibody (3 μl). In the case of double immunoprecipitation, lysates were first immunoprecipitated using anti-calnexin antibody, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed, followed by incubation with 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 30 min, and then diluted with 10 volumes of PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was used for anti-AE1 immunoprecipitation. The radiolabeled proteins were examined by SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The efficiency ofN-glycosylation was determined by scanning autoradiographs of SDS gels using a ScanMaker IIHR (Microtec) scanner and the Adobe Photoshop™ program, version 3.0. The pixel density was determined using NIH Image software. The percentage of N-glycosylation was calculated from the areas under the two peaks corresponding to theN-glycosylated and nonglycosylated products. The fraction of protein that co-immunoprecipitated with calnexin was estimated by determining the intensity of the band interacting with calnexin in the immunoprecipitation fraction divided by the total protein integrated into the microsomes. The interaction of calnexin with human AE1 was studied in a cell-free translation system, using rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. This in vitro system has been used extensively to study the biosynthesis of polytopic membrane proteins, including AE1 (49Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol.

Due to its lower protein mass, the AE1md construct (51Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to more readily distinguish theN-glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of the protein on SDS gels. The AE1md construct contains the entire transmembrane domain of AE1, encompassing residues 386–911 (Fig.1). AE1md is sufficient to carry out the anion exchange function (56Lepke S. Fashold H. Pring M. Passow H. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 29: 147-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 57Grinstein S. Ship S. Rothstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 507: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and it has been functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes (58Lepke S. Becker A. Passow H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The AE1md can be synthesized and glycosylated at Asn-642 in an in vitro translation system in the presence of microsomal membranes (Fig. 2, lane 1). The position of the full-length AE1md protein (48 kDa) is indicated by theopen circle in Fig. 2, and the glycosylated, higher molecular mass band (50 kDa) is indicated by the closed circle. The efficiency of N-glycosylation in this particular experiment was 60%. The glycosylated form was previously shown to be sensitive to endoglycosidase H, andN-glycosylation can be inhibited by the presence of the Ac-NYT-NH2 tripeptide (49Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 51Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both theN-glycosylated and nonglycosylated bands were resistant to alkaline extraction (Fig. 2, lane 1) and therefore had been integrated into the microsomal membrane. The N642D mutant, with the mutated endogenous N-glycosylation acceptor site, was not glycosylated but was also integrated into the membrane (Fig. 2,lane 4). The association of AE1md with calnexin was determined by solubilization of microsomes with digitonin and immunoprecipitation with the anti-carboxyl-terminal calnexin antibody. The presence of bothN-glycosylated and nonglycosylated products in the translation mixture allowed us to determine the glycosylation dependence of the interaction with calnexin in the same sample. The results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments are shown in Fig. 2,lanes 7–14. The N-glycosylated form of the AE1md (Fig. 2, lane 1 versus lane 7, closed circle) was readily co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-calnexin antibody. In contrast, the lower, nonglycosylated form (Fig. 2, lane 7, open circle) that was present in the same translation mixture was poorly immunoprecipitated. In a second immunoprecipitation of the same sample, only minor amounts of either form were present, indicating a quantitative recovery of calnexin in the initial immunoprecipitation. Very little of the nonglycosylated construct, N642D, was co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-calnexin antibody (Fig. 2,lane 4 versus lane 11). The interaction of N-glycosylated AE1md with calnexin could be inhibited if translation was carried out in the presence of 1 mm CST, an inhibitor of α-glucosidases I and II (Fig. 2,lane 9), whereas posttranslational addition of CST did not prevent the interaction (Fig. 2, lane 10). It has been shown that low concentrations of deoxynojirimycin stabilizes the calnexin-protein complex by slowing down the trimming of the glucose residues (59Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We were not able to detect any increase in the number of calnexin/AE1md complexes in the presence of 1 μm CST (Fig. 2, lane 8). Dose dependence experiments showed that 50 μm CST was sufficient to inhibit the interaction of calnexin with AE1 (data not shown). The weak calnexin interaction with the nonglycosylated form of the protein was unaffected by the presence of CST (Fig. 2, lane 9 versus lane 13). In addition to the full-length AE1md, lower molecular weight products were observed in cell-free translations of the AE1md (Fig. 2,diamonds). We have shown that these products are the result of nonspecific translation initiation at a cluster of Met residues positioned at the end of putative TM segment 6 (51Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M.

In the present studies, we have examined the structural basis for the ability of GAIP to discriminate among members of the Gαi family. Gαi1, Gαi3, and Gαo interacted strongly with GAIP, whereas Gαi2 interacted weakly and Gαs did not interact at all. A chimeric G protein composed of a Gαi2N terminus and a Gαi1 C terminus interacted as strongly with GAIP as native Gαi1, whereas a chimeric N-terminal Gαi1 with a Gαi2 C terminus did not interact. These results suggest that the determinants responsible for GAIP selectivity between these two Gαis reside within the C-terminal GTPase domain of the G protein. To further localize residues contributing to G protein-GAIP selectivity, a panel of 15 site-directed Gαi1 and Gαi2 mutants were assayed. Of the Gαi1 mutants tested, only that containing a mutation at aspartate 229 located at the N terminus of Switch 3 did not interact with GAIP. Furthermore, the only Gαi2 variant that interacted strongly with GAIP contained a replacement of the corresponding Gαi2 Switch 3 residue (Ala230) with aspartate. To determine whether GAIP showed functional preferences for Gα subunits that correlate with the binding data, the ability of GAIP to enhance the GTPase activity of purified α subunits was tested. GAIP catalyzed a 3–5-fold increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαi1 and Gαi2(A230D) but no increase in the rate of Gαi2 and less than a 2-fold increase in the rate of Gαi1(D229A) under the same conditions. Thus, GAIP was able to discriminate between Gαi1 and Gαi2 in both binding and functional assays, and in both cases residue 229/230 played a critical role in selective recognition.

Heterotrimeric G proteins associate with the cytoplasmic surfaces of 7-transmembrane spanning receptors and function to transduce signals from receptors activated by extracellular ligands to intracellular effectors (1Stadel J.M. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 11: 190-194Google Scholar). One of the most recent developments in the study of G protein regulation is the identification of a novel family of proteins known as regulators of G protein signaling or RGS proteins (2Koelle M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). RGS proteins are characterized by the presence of an RGS domain that is structurally conserved across evolution (3Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). These molecules function to desensitize G protein-coupled responses in organisms from yeast to man by directly interacting with the α subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and increasing their rate of GTP hydrolysis (5Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between G protein α subunits and RGS molecules was first demonstrated by DeVries et al. (6DeVries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), who isolated the cDNA for the RGS GAIP (Galphainteracting protein) using a yeast two-hybrid screen for Gαi3-interacting proteins. A number of studies quickly followed revealing GAP (GTPase-activating protein) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). activity to be the mechanism by which RGSs turned off G protein activation (7Berman D.M.

Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both the structural interaction between RGS and Gα subunits and the mechanism of RGS GAP activity were further elucidated by the co-crystallization of RGS4 with Gαi1 (11Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). However, much remains to be revealed about the function of individual members of the RGS family, their specificities for interacting proteins, and the structural determinants that define these interactions. Most of the initially described RGS proteins showed both binding and functional selectivity for the Gαi family of G proteins (7Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 8Watson N. Liner M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J.

More recently, a number of RGS molecules have demonstrated binding or functional interactions with Gαq and/or Gαs signaling pathways (13Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, there has been little information about the ability of any RGS to discriminate among the closely related members of the Gαi family. Evidence for some specificity of RGS binding to distinct Gαi family members was demonstrated by DeVries et al. (6DeVries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), who showed strong interaction of GAIP with Gαi1, Gαi3, and Gαo but weak interaction with Gαi2 and no interaction with Gαs. The differential binding characteristics of Gαi1 and Gαi2 are particularly intriguing because these two G proteins are highly homologous, having an amino acid sequence identity of 88%. Differences in RGS binding may reveal structural differences in these two G proteins that have implications for their ability to differentially activate divergent downstream signaling pathways. To evaluate the structural basis for the selectivity of the RGS GAIP for individual members of the Gαi family, we have expressed native, chimeric, and mutant Gα proteins and compared their abilities to bind GAIP and act as substrates for GAIP GAP activity. The results show a preference of GAIP for Gαi1 over Gαi2 in both binding assays and GAP assays. This preference was reversed by mutating residue Asp229 in Gαi2 to alanine and making the reciprocal mutation (A230D) in Gαi1. Interestingly, the selectivity of GAIP for Gαi1 over Gαi2 was lost when GTPase-deficient mutants of these two Gαis were tested for GAIP binding. Thus, the structural preference of GAIP for Gαi1 versus Gαi2 in their ground (presumably GDP-bound) states has functional consequences in their respective GAP activities. Rat G protein α subunits were PCR amplified with oligonucleotides containing 5′ EcoRI restriction sites and 3′ SalI restriction sites. PCR products were then subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced to ensure fidelity to the template. Inserts were excised with EcoRI andSalI and subcloned into the pGBT9 Gal 4 DNA-binding domain fusion vector (CLONTECH). Human GAIP was PCR amplified from a human heart cDNA library using oligonucleotides containing a 5′ NarI restriction site and a 3′ SalI restriction site. PCR products were subcloned and sequenced as above, then removed from pCRII with Nar I andSalI, and subcloned into the pGAD Gal 4 activation domain fusion vector (CLONTECH). The Gαs/i3 chimera was generated by removing the N-terminalBamHI site in the Gαs cDNA via site-directed mutagenesis (see below) and then ligating theBamHI-digested N-terminal 700-bp fragment of Gαs to the 430-bp C-terminal fragment ofBamHI-digested Gαi3 cDNA. The Gαi3/s chimera was generated by ligating the N-terminal 630-bp Gαi3 fragment to the C-terminal 516-bp Gαs fragment of the same digestions. Both chimeras were subcloned into the pGBT9 vector and characterized with BamHI and EcoRI as well as with BamHI andSalI digestions to ensure correct constructions. Gαi1/i2 and Gαi2/i1 chimeras were made by engineering a BamHI site into the Gαi1cDNA at the same site as a naturally occurring BamHI in Gαi2. Gαi2 and mutant Gαi1cDNAs were digested with BamHI, and the N-terminal 635-bp fragment of Gαi1 was ligated to the C-terminal 433-bp fragment of Gαi2 to generate Gαi1/i2. Similarly, Gαi2/i1 consists of the N-terminal BamHI fragment of Gαi2 ligated to the C-terminal BamHI fragment of Gαi1. Site-directed mutants of Gαi1 and Gαi2 were made using Stratagene QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. Template pGBT9-Gαi1 or pGBT9-Gαi2 was amplified for 14 cycles of 12-min extensions, each using overlapping forward and reverse primers encoding the applicable mutation. All mutants were sequenced throughout the entire coding region to ensure desired mutagenesis as well as to screen against unwanted PCR-induced mutations. Saccharomyces cerevisiae of strain HF7cα were co-transformed with pGBT9 (containing Trp marker) and pGAD (containing Leu marker) vector constructions by standard lithium acetate procedures (CLONTECH Matchmaker two-hybrid system). Briefly, single yeast colonies were grown overnight at 30 °C with continuous shaking to an A 600 of 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 rpm, washed once in sterile H20, and resuspended in 2 ml of cold 100 mmlithium acetate. After shaking at 30 °C for 1 h, 100 μl of competent cells was added to 1–2 μg of transforming DNA in the presence of 5 μg of carrier salmon sperm DNA and 0.7 ml of 40% polyethylene glycol. Cells were heat shocked at 42 °C for 15 min, then collected with a quick spin, and plated on -Leu-Trp selective dropout agar medium to grow for 3 days at 30 °C. Four colonies of each construct were streaked on -Leu-Trp agar to propagate for assay. Yeast transformants were grown overnight to high density in 4-ml cultures, harvested, and resuspended in binding buffer (0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were lysed by vortexing three times for 1 min in the presence of glass beads at 4 °C and spun for 10 min at 12,000 × g to remove cell debris. 50 μg of lysate was loaded per lane onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit antibody common to G protein α subunits (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) at 1:500 dilution in Tris-buffered saline/5% milk. Immunoreactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) and developed using ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Single colonies of transformed cells were innoculated into 5 ml of SC-Leu-Trp agar and grown overnight to an A 600 of 0.8. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once in Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2P04, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4), resuspended in 300 μl of the same, and lysed by four freeze/thaw cycles. To start the assay, 100 μl of this cell lysate was suspended in 0.7 ml of Z buffer containing 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol and then added to 0.16 ml of Z buffer containing 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside substrate. Suspensions were vortexed and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Color reactions were stopped with 0.4 ml of Na2CO3 and read at A 420after spinning out cell debris. β-Galactosidase units (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) were calculated according to the manufacturer's protocols (CLONTECH), as follows: β-galactosidase units = 1000 ×A 420/(t × v ×A 600), where t is 120 min of incubation, v is 0.1 ml of reaction volume·concentration factor, and A 600 was 0.8 for the culture. 5-ml cultures of yeast transformants were grown to an A 600 of 1.0 and then 3 μl of 1:10 serial dilutions of confluent growths were spotted on either SC-Leu-Trp or SC-Leu-Trp-His agar plates and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3 days. Full-length G protein α subunits Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi1(D229A), and Gαi2(A230D) and full-length GAIP were expressed as GST fusion proteins by subcloning cDNAs downstream of the GST tag usingEcoRI/SalI sites of the vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each plasmid construct was transformed into bacterial strain BL21, grown overnight, and induced to express protein with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, sonicated in TE containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were applied to pre-washed glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Columns were washed with TE containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and β-mercaptoethanol and GST fusion proteins eluted with 10 mm glutathione. Purified proteins were buffer exchanged into TED buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), concentrated to 1 mg/ml in Nanosep spin columns (Pall Filtron Corp.), and stored at −80 °C. Size and homogeneity of purified proteins were verified via Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and in-frame translation of G proteins was verified via immunoblot using a Gαi1/Gαi2-selective antibody (kind gift of Dr. David Manning, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). 100 nm purified GST-tagged G protein α subunits were shaken for 4 h at 30 °C in the presence of 100 nm [35S]GTPγS and serial dilutions of 1–100 μm competing unlabeled GTPγS in 50 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 30% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (22Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Reactions were filtered over BA85 nitrocellulose filters and washed three times with 2 ml of cold GTPγS STOP buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 25 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). Filters were immersed overnight in scintillation fluid before counting to determine amount of [35S]GTPγS bound. 100 nm purified GST-tagged G protein α subunits were loaded with 1 μm[γ-32P]GTP (8000 cpm/pmol) for 20 min at 30 °C in 600 μl of GTPase buffer (0.1% lubrol PX, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA). Reactions were chilled at 4 °C for 10 min, and assays were conducted at 6 °C. A 50-μl aliquot was removed immediately before initiating the reaction and quenched with 750 μl of 5% Norit activated charcoal in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 3. To initiate the reaction, 100 μm cold GTP and 15 mm MgSO4(final concentrations) in the presence versus absence of 500 nm GST-tagged GAIP were added to reaction mixtures, and 50-μl aliquots were removed after 10 s, 20 s, 40 s, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 4 min, and 5 min and stopped as just described. Charcoal was precipitated by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and 400-μl free phosphate-containing supernatants were counted to determine the amount of Pi released per reaction. To explore the structural basis for the differences in GAIP binding by the different members of the Gαi family, we engineered a panel of Gα protein chimeras and mutants. As a first step, native and engineered G proteins were assayed for the ability to bind GAIP using the yeast two-hybrid system. To make use of this system, Gα protein cDNA constructs were subcloned downstream of a Gal 4-binding domain cDNA and coexpressed with a GAIP-Gal 4 activation domain fusion in theS. cerevisiae strain HF7Cα. All fusions were immunoblotted to control for relative expression levels. An anti-G protein α subunit antibody raised against the internal GTP-binding sequence common to all heterotrimeric G protein α subunits recognized a protein of the appropriate molecular mass (about 65 kDa) for a G protein α subunit fused to the Gal 4-binding domain in each of the clones transformed with a G protein fusion (data not shown). All of the clones expressed comparable levels of G protein fusion, and no protein of the same size was seen in clones transformed with pGBT9-binding domain alone. Given such a similar background of G protein fusion expression, a measure of the strength of interaction between various G proteins and GAIP can be estimated from the relative activation of Gal 4-dependent reporters. The yeast strain HF7Cα was stably transformed with cDNAs encoding both β-galactosidase and histidine reporters downstream of a Gal 4 promotor. In this system, the promotor is activated in proportion to the degree of interaction between the Gal 4-binding domain and activation domain fusions (23Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, two different reporters were used to measure the relative strength of the interaction between the G protein-binding domain fusion and the GAIP activation domain fusion. According to both histidine and β-galactosidase reporter systems, robust interaction of GAIP was seen with Gαi1, Gαi3, and Gαo, whereas the interaction with Gαi2 was weak, and the interaction with Gαswas undetectable (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with those obtained by DeVries et al. (6DeVries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Due to the quantitative nature of the assays, liquid β-galactosidase assays were used for interaction comparisons henceforth. Because Gαi1 gave a strong interaction with GAIP in its native conformation, which was statistically indistinguishable from that of Gαi3 and Gαo, and because this G protein was tested in every assay conducted, this level of interaction was designated as 100% for comparison with all other G protein constructs. 100% interaction in these assays corresponds to 1.4 β-galactosidase units (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity generated by GAIP co-transfected with pGBT9 vector alone (0.12 β-galactosidase units) was considered background and was subtracted from all values for G protein-GAIP interactions before normalization. Because Gαi3 interacted strongly with GAIP, whereas Gαs did not interact at all, chimeras of Gαi3 with Gαs were generated in an attempt to localize the regions of Gαi required for GAIP binding. A BamHI site that cuts both cDNAs roughly two-thirds into the length of the coding region was used to generate both chimeras (Fig. 2). This BamHI site conveniently separates all of the N-terminal α-helical domain from most of the GTPase domain (a small part of which is encoded at the very N terminus of the cDNA). The binding characteristics of these chimeras could thus substantiate the relative importance of these two domains in GAIP binding. However, neither chimera bound to GAIP (Fig.2 A). These results potentially indicate that both domains of Gαi3 contribute important determinants for RGS binding, but the divergence in αs sequence from that of the αi family presents a number of other possible interpretations. To discriminate among these possibilities, chimeras composed of the initial two-thirds of αi1 fused to the distal one-third of αi2 and the reciprocal Gαi2/i1 chimera were prepared using an engineered BamHI site (Fig.2 B). Gαi2 is highly homologous to Gαi1, yet its interaction with GAIP is negligible compared with Gαi1. The Gαi2/i1 chimera interacted with GAIP just as strongly as native Gαi1, whereas the reverse Gαi1/i2 chimera, like wild type Gαi2, showed little binding to GAIP (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the Gαi1 C terminus is required for GAIP interaction. The results may also imply that the determinants contributing to GAIP binding are entirely contained within the GTPase domain of the G protein, but there may be additional determinants that are conserved between the N termini of Gαi1 and Gαi2 that remain to be identified. As a next step, site-directed mutagenesis of Gαi1 and Gαi2 was used to further localize determinants contributing to the selectivity of GAIP interaction. Because Gαi1 and Gαi2 are 88% identical at the amino acid level but show vastly different GAIP binding capacities in the yeast two-hybrid system, the primary sequences of the two proteins were compared with identify candidate residues that might contribute to differential GAIP binding. Of the amino acids that differed between Gαi1 and Gαi2, reciprocal mutants were generated at eight different positions in the primary sequence based on the likelihood that a given position would affect RGS binding given its location in the three-dimensional crystal structure of Gαi1 bound to RGS4 (11Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The effects of C-terminal mutants were of particular interest due to the results of the chimeras, but a number of N-terminal mutants were also studied because they appeared to be close to potential RGS contact sites in the crystal structure (11Tesmer J.J.G.

Of the five Gαi1 mutants C-terminal to the BamHI site that were tested, several impaired binding to GAIP, but only D229A abolished it (Fig. 3 A). Even more significantly, the reciprocal mutation in the corresponding residue in Gαi2(Gαi2(A230D)) 2A one-residue insertion at amino acid 117 in the primary sequence of Gαi2 with respect to Gαi1 is responsible for the difference in numbering between these two α subunits. produced a variant Gαi2 that bound to GAIP as strongly as Gαi1 (Fig. 3 A). Thus, Gαi1(D229) appears to be particularly important for GAIP interaction. In addition to the C-terminal mutants shown in Fig. 3 A, three N-terminal Gαi1 mutants and the corresponding reciprocal Gαi2 mutants were also assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Consistent with the results of the Gαi1/i2 chimeras, all of the N-terminal Gαi1 mutants bound to GAIP, and none of the corresponding Gαi2 mutants bound GAIP as strongly as Gαi1(Fig. 3 B). Thus, none of these residues appears to be a necessary determinant for GAIP binding. To determine whether different nucleotide-dependent conformations of these G proteins affected their relative GAIP affinities, GTPase-deficient mutants of Gαi1 and Gαi2 were generated to “trap” the α subunits in their GTP-bound forms and assayed for binding to GAIP. In contrast to the wild type proteins, the “activated” forms of both Gαi1 and Gαi2 interacted at least as strongly with GAIP as wild type Gαi1 (Fig.4). Both Gαi1(Q204L) and Gαi2(Q205L) generated about a 4-fold increase in GAIP binding activity relative to that seen with wild type (nonactivated) Gαi1, so that the selectivity of GAIP for Gαi1 over Gαi2 appears to be restricted to the interaction with their ground state (presumably GDP-bound) conformations. Two additional GTPase-deficient mutants, Gαi1(R178C) and Gαi2(R179C), were also tested and interacted very strongly with GAIP although less strongly than the Q204L/Q205L mutants. To explore the mechanism of the selectivity of GAIP for Gαi1 over Gαi2 in their GDP-bound states, the position of Gαi1 aspartate 229 in relation to the bound RGS4 molecule in the published crystal structure was examined (Fig. 5). In the AlF4-activated state in which this G protein was crystallized, Asp229 appears closer to the nucleotide-binding site than to the RGS-binding site of this G protein. Therefore, we examined the relative GTPγS affinities of both Gαi1 and Gαi2 to determine whether there were differences in nucleotide binding affinity that in turn might affect their affinities for GAIP. Recombinant full-length Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi1(D229A), and Gαi2(A230D) were GST-tagged, expressed in bacteria, and purified to homogeneity over glutathione affinity columns. The ability of unlabeled GTPγS to displace [35S]GTPγS from each of the proteins was measured over a range of GTPγS concentrations. The IC50 for [35S]GTPγS displacement was the same for all four proteins (Fig. 6), so differences in GAIP binding are not reflective of differences in nucleotide binding affinities.Figure 6Competition between GTPγS and35S-GTPγS for binding to native and mutant G protein α subunits. Purified GST-tagged G protein α subunits (100 nm) were incubated with 100 nm [35S]GTPγS (200,000 cpm/50 μl assay volume) and indicated concentrations of unlabeled GTPγS and filtered as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the mean ± S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, to determine whether any functional differences might correlate with selective binding capacity, we tested the ability of GAIP to catalyze the GTPase activities of Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi1(D229A), and Gαi2(A230D). GAIP catalyzed a 5-fold increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαi1 (Fig.7 A) but caused no increase in the GTPase rate of Gαi2 (Fig. 7 B) under the same conditions. In addition, GAIP only slightly increased the GTPase activity of Gαi1(D229A) (from K obsof 2.1 in the absence of GAIP to K obs of 3.7 in the presence of GAIP) (Fig. 7 C). Of particular interest, the rate of GTP hydrolysis seen for this mutant form of Gαi1in the presence of GAIP is similar to the GTPase rate of Gαi2 in the presence of GAIP (K obs= 4.2). Similarly, Gαi2(A230D) now behaves more like Gαi1 in that there is a significant increase in GAIP activation, and the GTPase rate seen in the presence of GAIP is similar to that seen for Gαi1 in the presence of GAIP (K obs = 5.2 for the former and 5.6 for the latter) (Fig. 7 D). Therefore, the ability of GAIP to act as a GAP for these two Gαi proteins and their reciprocal mutants correlates with its affinities for these proteins in their “ground states” as measured in the yeast two-hybrid assay. RGS proteins are a family of G protein regulators that down-regulate G protein-coupled responses by stimulating the GTPase activity of the Gα subunits to which they bind (3Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J.

The mechanisms that regulate splicing and the physiological significance of TnTf isoforms are poorly understood. To investigate these questions, we have determined the complete sequence structure of the quail TnTf gene, and we have characterized the developmental expression of alternatively spliced TnTf mRNAs in quail embryonic muscles. We report the following: 1) the quail TnTf gene is significantly larger than the rat TnTf gene and has 8 non-homologous exons, including a pectoral muscle-specific set of alternatively spliced exons; 2) specific sequences are implicated in regulated exon splicing; 3) a 900-base pair sequence element, composed primarily of intron sequence flanking the pectoral muscle-specific exons, is tandemly repeated 4 times and once partially, providing direct evidence that the pectoral-specific TnT exon domain arose by intragenic duplications; 4) a chicken repeat 1 retrotransposon element resides upstream of this repeated intronic/pectoral exon sequence domain and is implicated in transposition of this element into an ancestral genome; and 5) a large set of novel isoforms, produced by regulated exon splicing, is expressed in quail muscles, providing insights into the developmental regulation, physiological function, and evolution of the vertebrate TnTf isoforms."

Most strikingly, a mutation in one of the boxes, box 4, abolished replication activity and eliminated stable DnaA protein binding to all four boxes. Unlike DnaA binding to the E. coli origin, oriC, DnaA binding to two of the boxes (boxes 4 and 3) in the RK2 origin, oriV, is cooperative with box 4 acting as the “organizer” for the formation of the DnaA-oriV nucleoprotein complex. Interestingly, the inversion of box 4 also abolished replication activity, but did not result in a loss of binding to the other boxes. However, DnaA binding to this mutant origin was no longer cooperative. These results demonstrate that the sequence, position, and orientation of box 4 are crucial for cooperative DnaA binding and the formation of a nucleoprotein structure that is functional for the initiation of replication.

Unlike the more disperse arrangement of DnaA boxes at oriC and replication origins of other bacteria, the DnaA boxes at plasmid replication origins in general are closely associated forming one or more clusters. In addition, the DnaA protein must work in concert with a plasmid-encoded initiation protein (for reviews, see Refs. 18Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A.E. Novick R.P. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed.

These observations likely reflect fundamental differences in the structure of the nucleoprotein complexes formed by the DnaA protein at the replication origin of plasmids and the bacterial chromosome. The broad host range plasmid RK2 exhibits the remarkable ability to replicate and maintain itself in a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria (23Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Thomas C.M. Promiscuous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 1-25Google Scholar) and, thus, is a particularly interesting system for studying fundamental questions about the interactions between plasmid- and host-encoded factors at a replication origin. The DnaA protein has been shown to be required for RK2 replication (24Gaylo P. Turjman N. Bastia D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but its exact role has been less well studied. Only recently, it was demonstrated that there are two DnaA boxes in addition to two previously described boxes located in the leftward part of the RK2 origin, oriV,and that all four boxes bind the E. coli DnaA protein (11Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The four DnaA boxes arranged as two pairs in an indirect orientation can potentially form a cruciform structure (see Fig. 1). Boxes 2, 3, and 4 contain one mismatch from the stringent DnaA box consensus sequence, whereas box 1 contains two mismatches. Replication initiation of RK2 requires both DnaA and the plasmid-encoded initiation protein, TrfA. The TrfA protein binds to the iteron sequences in oriV (10Stalker D.M. Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Thomas C.M. Meyer R. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 213-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Thomas C.M.

Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The DnaA protein also has the indispensable role of recruiting the DnaB-DnaC complex to the RK2 origin through a protein-protein (DnaA-DnaB) interaction (29Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The loading and activation of the DnaB helicase at the open region requires both the DnaA and TrfA proteins (29Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the correct positioning of the DnaA boxes on the helical axis with respect to the rest of the origin (30Doran K.S.

How the DnaA protein and the TrfA protein cooperate to achieve DnaB loading in not known. Do the requirements for DnaA protein binding and function in plasmid systems differ from that of bacterial chromosomes, specificallyoriC? In this paper, we present the molecular and biochemical characterization of the structural requirements for functional binding of DnaA protein during plasmid replication initiation, specifically plasmid RK2. Our results demonstrate that one of the four DnaA boxes, box 4, directs the cooperative binding of DnaA to the other DnaA boxes, essentially acting as the “organizer” in the formation of a functional DnaA-oriV nucleoprotein structure. These features of DnaA protein binding to a plasmid replication origin may be important in understanding the differences between plasmid and chromosomal replication initiation and, in the case of RK2, its broad host range properties.

Unincorporated ATP was removed using nucleotide removal spin columns (Qiagen). Binding of DnaA protein to origin DNA containing mutated DnaA box sequences was performed essentially as described previously (11Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol.

For footprinting of specific nucleoprotein complexes, reactions were assembled as for gel mobility shift assays described below except that the amount of probe used was increased. After incubating the reaction containing labeled DNA template and DnaA protein for 15 min at 37 °C, DNase I was added (6.7 units/reaction) for 2 min at the same temperature. Reactions were then run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, specific complexes were identified and isolated from the gel and eluted overnight at 30 °C in 1 m LiCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2% SDS, 0.2 mm EDTA. Eluant was collected over a spin column (Bio-Rad), extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in loading buffer. Complexes between oriVDNA and DnaA protein were formed and analyzed essentially as described previously (11Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except that the reaction mixture, based on standard conditions used for RK2 in vitro replication (29Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), contained 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% sucrose, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 11 mm magnesium acetate. Reactions also contained 25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim) and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Incubation was at 34–37 °C for 20 min. To address the importance of each DnaA box present in the RK2 origin (Fig.1), individual box sequences were replaced with the scramble sequence 5′-GATATCCTG, which is similar to a sequence shown previously not to bind DnaA protein (35Langer U. Richter S. Roth A. Weigel C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, mutantsoriV A1, A2, A3, and A4 contain the scramble sequence (5′-GATATCCTG) in place of the wild-type DnaA box sequence for boxes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (see Fig. 1). Mutated origins were also constructed that contained deletions of two, three, or all four DnaA boxes. Mutagenesis was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (see under “Experimental Procedures”) and the resulting origins were subcloned in plasmid pKD19L1 (30Doran K.S. Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8447-8453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis (data not shown). Plasmid pKD19L1 is a dual origin (RK2-R6Kγ) plasmid that replicates by the R6Kγ origin in E. coli strain CC118 (λpir) because this strain encodes the R6K initiator protein. In the parental strain, CC118, only the RK2 origin may be utilized. Thus, the ratio of transformation frequencies obtained in CC118 versus CC118(λpir) was used to quantitateoriV function in vivo. Ratios obtained for altered origin constructs were normalized to those obtained for pKD19L1 (wild-type oriV) (Table I). Origins that contained a scrambled sequence in DnaA box 1 (oriV A1) or box 2 (oriV A2) or a deletion of both boxes 1 and 2 (oriV AΔ1-2) did not negatively effect origin function and actually resulted in a somewhat higher level of plasmid transformation frequencies. However, a scrambled sequence in DnaA box 3 (oriV A3) or box 4 (oriV A4) reduced or completely abolished plasmid transformation, respectively. Similarly, an origin containing a deletion of all four DnaA boxes (oriV AΔ1-4) rendered the plasmid inactive. An origin containing only DnaA box 4 (oriV AΔ1-3) was only 74% active compared with wild-type (Table I). The oriV AΔ1-3 mutant is highly variable; in another set of experiments, replication activity was as low as 32% of the activity of a wild-type origin (data not shown). Additionally, the transformants that were obtained with theoriV AΔ1-3 mutant were lost fairly rapidly compared with the wild-type plasmid in the absence of antibiotic selection. 1Doran, K.

Thus, whereas both DnaA boxes 3 and 4 are required for replication activity in vivo, the requirement for DnaA box 4 is the more stringent.Table ITransformation frequencies with RK2 replication origins containing DnaA box mutationsOriginaBoth wild-type and mutant origins are contained on plasmid pKD19L1.CC118CC118λpirCC118/CC118λpirbRatio of transformants obtained in CC118 (pir−) and CC118λpir (pir+) was normalized to that obtained for wild-type.Relative %oriVwt1.6 × 1052.1 × 105100oriV A12.9 × 1053.5 × 105109oriV A22 × 1051.9 × 105138oriVA32.8 × 104cTransformants were detected only after 2 nights of incubation.2.6 × 10514oriV A402.1 × 1050oriV A Δ1–21.4 × 1051.4 × 105134oriV A Δ1–39.7 × 104cTransformants were detected only after 2 nights of incubation.2.8 × 10574oriV A Δ1–49.6 × 100cTransformants were detected only after 2 nights of incubation.2.3 × 1050a Both wild-type and mutant origins are contained on plasmid pKD19L1.b Ratio of transformants obtained in CC118 (pir−) and CC118λpir (pir+) was normalized to that obtained for wild-type.c Transformants were detected only after 2 nights of incubation. Open table in a new tab The mutated origins were also analyzed for replication activityin vitro using an in vitro replication assay for RK2 that has been described previously (33Kittell B.L. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This assay utilizes a 40% (NH4)2SO4 fraction from a solubleE. coli extract to replicate supercoiled DNA containing an RK2 origin in the presence of the initiator protein, TrfA. Fig.2 shows DNA synthesis for wild-type and altered origin templates. In vitro replication activity with the scrambled DnaA box origin templates was relatively similar to the activity that was observed in vivo (Fig. 2 A). Scramble mutations in DnaA boxes 1 and 2 had no inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis, whereas mutations in DnaA boxes 3 and 4 resulted in a lower level of replication activity, with mutant oriV A4 displaying only 50% of wild-type levels. Replication activity of origin templates with deletion mutations (Fig. 2 B) again showed that DnaA boxes 1and 2 can be deleted with out affecting replication levels, whereas deleting all four DnaA boxes abolished DNA synthesis. Replication of an origin template with only DnaA box 4 (oriV AΔ1-3) was slightly less than wild-type except at the highest amount of TrfA protein. We analyzed the binding of DnaA protein tooriV fragments containing the DnaA box scramble mutations using DNase I footprinting and a gel mobility shift assay. The DNase I pattern of DnaA protection for wild-type oriV (Fig.3, lanes 1–3) was as has been previously shown for both linear and supercoiled oriVtemplates (11Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When a DnaA box contained the scrambled sequence, full DNase I protection was not observed in that box. Thus, the replacement of the wild-type sequence with the scramble sequence had altered DnaA binding to the respective box. Interestingly, the scramble mutation in DnaA box 4 (oriV A4) greatly reduced the amount of protection observed for box 3 (Fig. 3, lanes 13–15). We further analyzed DnaA binding to mutants oriV A3 andoriV A4 using a gel mobility shift assay (Fig.4). As expected for wild-typeoriV, increasing DnaA concentration led to four specific nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 4, lanes 1–5); however, on the basis of the relative intensity of the various retarded bands, their formation did not proceed sequentially. Even with smaller amounts of DnaA protein, the appearance of complex I never occurred in the absence of complex II, and usually there was much less of complex I (data not shown and Ref. 11Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of DnaA protein to linearoriV DNA appears to be more stable when in the form of complex II, suggesting the possibility of cooperative binding by DnaA. DnaA binding to scramble mutants oriV A3 and A4 support this idea. When DnaA box 3 was scrambled, only complex II and, to a lesser extent, complex I was seen (Fig. 4, lanes 6–10). When DnaA box 4 was scrambled, no nucleoprotein complexes were observed (Fig. 4,lanes 11–15). This is consistent with the lack of replication activity observed for mutant oriV A4 in vivo (Table I) and the substantially reduced activity in vitro (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the function of DnaA box 4 is to initiate DnaA binding to oriV.Figure 4DnaA binding to oriVfragments using gel mobility shift assay. Restriction fragments (0.15 ng) containing wild-type oriV(A), a scramble mutation in box 3 (B), and a scramble mutation in box 4 (C) were incubated with increasing amounts of DnaA protein for 20 min at 34 °C. Thefirst lane in each template set (−) is without protein, followed by 31, 62, 124, and 248 ng of DnaA protein (lanes fromleft to right). The positions of the four complexes (I–IV) previously described (11Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) are indicated. Theshaded arrows indicate that a strong or weak band is present, and the open arrows indicate that no band is present at the expected position.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We further analyzed DnaA binding by carrying out footprint analysis on specific DnaA-oriV nucleoprotein complexes. DnaA was incubated with wild-type oriV probe, treated with DNaseI, and run on a native gel in order to isolate specific complexes. DnaA protein concentrations were adjusted in order to obtain only complexes I and II (see Fig. 4). DnaA-oriV complexes I and II were isolated, gel purified, and run on a denaturing gel in order to visualize DNaseI protection patterns (Fig. 5). The analysis of nucleoprotein complexes I and II showed that both DnaA boxes 4 and 3 were protected from the DNaseI treatment. These results demonstrate that upon the binding of DnaA to oriV, the first boxes to be filled are boxes 4 and 3. The fact that the protection pattern for complex I (which may be expected to represent DnaA binding to a single DnaA box) shows that both boxes 4 and 3 are bound by DnaA (Fig. 5, middle lane) suggests that the binding by DnaA to one box is immediately followed by the binding to a second box. We should note that similar results were obtained at even lower DnaA protein concentrations (data not shown). This supports the idea that DnaA binding to either box 4 or 3 alone is unstable compared with the binding of both boxes. Because the treatment with DNase I is done prior to separation by gel electrophoresis, any subsequent disassociation of DnaA protein from either box 4 or 3 would result in the isolation of complex I, which contains a footprint of both boxes 4 and 3. We investigated whether the appearance of complex I was simply a result of the disassociation of DnaA protein from complex II in solution or during gel electrophoresis by looking at the rate of complex I formation; however, neither the incubation time nor the amount of gel running time had any effect on the formation of complex I (data not shown). It is possible that complex I contains DnaA bound to both boxes 4 and 3 but is structurally different than complex II and thus exhibits an altered mobility during gel electrophoresis. Because DnaA box 4 appears to be critical in initiating binding to the other DnaA boxes, we investigated whether it is the actual DnaA box sequence and/or the position of box 4 that is crucial. Mutations were constructed as described above and analyzed forin vivo activity (Table II) and ability to bind DnaA protein using the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 6). When the sequence of box 4 was replaced with the sequence of box 1 (oriV 4-1), in vivo activity was abolished and DnaA binding was greatly reduced (Fig. 6 A). The results were the same if box 4 sequence was reintroduced into this mutant construct in the box 3 position (oriV 3-4, see Table II and Fig. 6 B). If box 4 was flipped (oriV 4-Flip) so that it faced away from the other boxes, the effect was even more dramatic in that complexes were not formed at all with DnaA protein (Fig. 6 C), and the origin was completely inactive in vivo (Table II). Because the sequences surrounding DnaA boxes in oriC have been shown to effect DnaA binding (36Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), it was possible that DnaA could not bind to box 4 in the oriV 4-Flip mutant because the adjoining sequences were not also placed in the flipped position. Therefore, a mutant was constructed that flipped box 4 and the adjoining sequences (3 base pairs on either side of the box, oriV 4-FlipX). This construct was also inactive in vivo (Table II), but nucleoprotein complexes were observed with DnaA protein (Fig.6 D), suggesting that now DnaA could bind to box 4 as well as the other boxes. However, the binding of DnaA to the boxes in this mutant template proceeded in a stepwise, noncooperative fashion, which is not what is observed for a wild-type oriV template (see Fig. 4, lanes 1–5). Thus, the orientation of DnaA box 4 and its adjoining sequences, relative to box 3, is critical for cooperative binding and it is this binding that is required for replication activity of oriV.Table IITransformation frequencies of additional DnaA box mutantsOriginDnaA boxesRelative transformation activityaRatio of transformants was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown here normalized to that of wild-type.%oriVwild-type→→←←1001234oriV 4-1→→←←0.071231oriV3-4→→←←0.021241oriV 4-Flip→→←→01234oriV4-FlipX→→←→0.061234a Ratio of transformants was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown here normalized to that of wild-type. Open table in a new tab We have investigated the binding of the DnaA protein to the RK2 replication origin and the DnaA box requirement for plasmid RK2 replication. Our results clearly showed that in E. coli,boxes 3 and 4 are essential for optimal replication activity, whereas boxes 1 and 2 are dispensable. The DnaA-oriV interaction is dependent upon one critical box, box 4, as mutations in box 4 abolished stable DnaA binding to all four boxes. DNaseI footprinting of specific DnaA-oriV complexes demonstrated that the first boxes to be filled are boxes 4 and 3. These results, along with the nonlinear progression of DnaA-oriV complex formation observed in the gel mobility shift assay, indicate that DnaA binds cooperatively to the boxes at the RK2 origin. This is in contrast to what has been observed at oriC, where several approaches failed to detect cooperative DnaA binding (37Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Weigel C. Schmidt A. Ruckert B. Lurz R. Messer W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6574-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DnaA was shown to bind preferentially to box R4, but the binding preference of DnaA to the other sites was not altered when box R4 was mutated (38Weigel C. Schmidt A. Ruckert B. Lurz R. Messer W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6574-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The DNase I footprinting experiments performed here do not reveal which box in oriV, 4 or 3, actually binds DnaA first. We cannot exclude the possibility that DnaA binds initially to either box 4 or box 3 without a preference. This could account for the observed footprint by DnaA in complex I (Fig. 5, middle lane), which indicates a mixture of both boxes. However, we propose that because a mutation in box 4 abolishes replication activity and the stable binding of DnaA to the other boxes, DnaA probably binds first to box 4 and then cooperatively, possibly via a conformational change in the DNA, to box 3. What is clear is that a fully functional origin requires the formation of a complex II that contains DnaA protein bound to both boxes 4 and 3. Further analysis of DnaA box 4 argues that there are specific requirements for both its sequence and position for oriVfunctionality. If box 4 is replaced with the sequence of box 1 (mutantoriV 4-1) the origin is inactive (Table II) and DnaA binding is greatly reduced as judged by gel retardation analysis (Fig.6 A). The sequence of box 1 has less homology to the DnaA box consensus than box 4, and in footprinting experiments more DnaA protein is required to see protection in box 1 than in box 4 (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Thus, the data suggest that box 4 has a higher affinity for DnaA or forms a more stable complex with DnaA than the other DnaA boxes and, in this capacity, acts to recruit DnaA protein to oriV. However, the critical role of box 4 is also dependent upon its relative position within the origin. In mutant oriV 3-4, the box 4 sequence replaces DnaA box 3 of the oriV 4-1 mutant (see Table II); this mutant was also inactive and displayed reduced DnaA binding, arguing for the importance of the location of box 4. It should be emphasized that the gel mobility shift assay used in these experiments is a measure of both protein affinity to the individual boxes and the stability of the nucleoprotein complexes. It is, therefore, possible that DnaA protein is still able to bind to the boxes in these mutant templates but requires contact with box 4 in its “correct” position to form stable complexes observable during gel electrophoresis. It has been shown for oriC that the preference for DnaA box R4 depended on it being in the correct orientation (38Weigel C. Schmidt A. Ruckert B. Lurz R. Messer W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6574-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We found fororiV that if box 4 was inverted (mutant oriV4-Flip), DnaA protein did not form stable complexes with any of the DnaA boxes unless adjoining sequences were also inverted (mutantoriV 4-FlipX) (Fig. 6). Thus, with the oriV4-FlipX mutant, DnaA did bind to all four boxes, but this binding no longer exhibited cooperativity. Possibly, in this case the binding of DnaA to the high affinity but inverted box 4 increased the local concentration of DnaA protein and, thus, enhanced the probability of other DnaA-DnaA box contacts. Interestingly, the oriV4-FlipX mutant was not active in vivo. Presumably when DnaA is bound to the inverted box 4, it is now on the opposite face of the DNA helix with respect to box 3, thus disrupting the structure and/or critical protein contacts required for cooperative binding. These results demonstrate that the correct orientation of box 4 is crucial for directing not only the cooperative binding of DnaA but the formation of a nucleoprotein structure that is required for a functional initiation complex. More than likely, this specific structure is critical for the loading of DnaB helicase. We have previously demonstrated that when all four DnaA boxes are on the opposite side of the DNA helix with respect to the rest of the origin, DnaB helicase activity at oriV is reduced even though the origin is fully open (30Doran K.S. Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8447-8453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Unlike replication initiation atoriC, where origin opening and helicase loading occur as the result of a single initiator protein (DnaA), which is responsible for both steps, initiation at a plasmid origin usually requires two initiator proteins (DnaA and a plasmid-encoded replication initiation protein) and, therefore, may involve a fundamentally different nucleoprotein structure for facilitating each step of replication initiation. Most plasmid replication origins contain more than one DnaA box or cluster of DnaA boxes. In the case of the narrow host range plasmids P1 (39Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Austin S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and R6K (40Wu F. Goldberg I. Filutowicz M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), one box is sufficient for a functional origin. Evidence for cooperative DnaA binding to the DnaA boxes at the origin of pSC101 has been demonstrated to occur at a distance (DNA looping) with the combined action of the RepA initiator protein and IHF (41Stenzel T.T. Patel P. Bastia D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, for RK2, the cooperative binding exhibited by the DnaA protein occurs at boxes that are separated by only three to five base pairs and is not dependent on the binding of additional proteins, including the initiator protein, TrfA. Recently it was shown for plasmid R6K that the DnaA protein physically interacts with the R6K plasmid specific initiator protein and that this interaction is required for origin opening (22Lu Y.-B. Datta H.J. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5192-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There is no evidence for an interaction between DnaA and the RK2 initiator protein, TrfA. Preliminary results using ELISA to detect protein-protein interactions suggest that if an interaction does occur, it is a relatively weak interaction. 2K. S. Doran and D. R. Helinski, unpublished observations. An interaction between the DnaA and TrfA proteins clearly is not required for binding of the two proteins to their respective sites, DnaA boxes or iteron sequences (11Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), or for the cooperative DnaA-oriV interaction presented here. It is possible that these differences in molecular interactions at the replication origin observed between the narrow host range plasmids, P1 and R6K, and RK2 at least partially account for their different host range. It was surprising to us that DnaA boxes 1 and 2 can be deleted without affecting the efficiency of transformation of E. coli (TableI) or in vitro replication activity (Fig. 2), especially because the four boxes potentially can form a cruciform structure (11Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, in view of the broad host range replicating activity of RK2, the experiments performed here with E. coli do not rule out the possibility that a cruciform structure and/or all four DnaA boxes are required in bacterial hosts other than E. coli for optimal replication. Prior to the discovery of all four DnaA boxes, mutagenesis studies of the RK2 origin region demonstrated a differential requirement of DnaA boxes between E. coli andP. aeruginosa (42Cowan P. Krishnapillai V. Plasmid. 1982; 8: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 43Cross M.A. Warne S.R. Thomas C.M. Plasmid. 1986; 15: 132-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 44Shah D.S. Cross M.A. Porter D. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 608-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of interest to test the DnaA box mutants constructed in this study in other bacterial hosts, as different DnaA and other host replication proteins may act differently at the RK2 origin. The finding that boxes 4 and 3 are sufficient for oriVactivity indicates that the DnaA-oriV complex is a much more compact structure than is found for oriC, where the nucleoprotein complex extends over approximately 200 base pairs. Do the structural differences reflect the differences in DnaA function for the two replicons? In the case of oriC, the DnaA protein does not bind cooperatively to the five boxes, yet it directs the wrapping of DNA around a core of DnaA protein monomers and is subsequently responsible for both the opening of the 13-mer region and the recruitment of the DnaB-DnaC complex. For oriV, the DnaA protein plays a more limited role in that although it recruits the DnaB-DnaC complex to the origin region, it cannot by itself form an open complex. Our results have further demonstrated through mutational analysis and protein binding experiments that one box, box 4, effectively acts as the organizer for DnaA cooperative binding atoriV. This binding then initiates a nucleoprotein structure that is functional for the formation of a prepriming complex. This may represent a novel type of DnaA binding at a prokaryotic origin. It will be of interest to determine whether this type of DnaA interaction is found for other plasmid systems and whether it is a critical factor for the broad host range properties of the RK2 plasmid. We thank Dr. A. Blasina for the generous gift of purified DnaA protein and Drs. E. P. Geiduschek and A. Grove for helpful advice during the course of these experiments."

To understand the molecular basis for the inhibitory effects of cardiotoxin on the action of these enzymes, the nucleotide triphosphate binding ability of cardiotoxin analogue II (CTX II) from the Taiwan cobra (Naja naja atra) venom is investigated using a variety of spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence, circular dichroism, and two-dimensional NMR. CTX II is found to bind to all the four nucleotide triphosphates (ATP, UTP, GTP, and CTP) with similar affinity.

Snake venom cardiotoxins are small molecular mass (∼7 kDa), highly basic proteins cross-linked by four disulfide bridges (1Harvey A.L. J. Toxicol.

These toxins exhibit a wide variety of biological activities such as contraction of cardiac muscle cells, lysis of erythrocytes, and selective toxicity to certain types of tumor cells (4Kumar T.K.S.

Although the general molecular mechanism underlying the enzyme inhibitory action of cardiotoxins is still an enigma, it is contemplated that cardiotoxin could effectively block the enzymatic activities of Na+,K+-ATPase and phospholipid-sensitive protein kinase by competitively binding (in the present study) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is a key substrate for the functioning of these enzymes. However, to date, the evidence for the binding of a nucleotide triphosphate to cardiotoxin has not been reported. In the present study, for the first time, we demonstrate that the cardiotoxin analogue II (CTX II) 1The abbreviations used are: CTX II, cardiotoxin analogue II; NTP, nucleotide triphosphate. isolated from the Taiwan cobra venom (Naja naja atra) bind to nucleotide triphosphates. Herein, we also propose a molecular model of the CTX II·dATP complex and suggest a reasonable molecular mechanism to explain the reported inhibitory action of snake venom cardiotoxin on phospholipid-sensitive protein kinase and Na+,K+- ATPase. CTX II was purified as described by Yang et al. (9Yang C.C. King K. Sun T.P. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein was estimated from its absorbance at 280 nm (ε1 mm = 4.08). The nucleotides were purchased from Sigma. The concentration of the nucleotides was estimated (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) from their extinction coefficient values (ε259 = 15,400 for AMP, ADP, ATP, and dATP; ε271 = 9,000 for CTP; ε253 = 13,700 for GTP; and ε260 = 1,000 for UTP). All other chemicals used were of high quality analytical grade. All the experiments were performed at pH 3.0 and 25 °C unless otherwise mentioned. Fluorescence experiments were conducted on a Jasco HP 777 spectrofluorimeter. For tyrosine fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was set at 275 nm and the fluorescence was monitored at 310 nm. Both the excitation and emission slit widths were set at 5 nm in all the experiments. Circular dichroism measurements were made on a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter. Cylindrical quartz cells of path length 0.1 and 1 mm were used for the measurements in the far (190∼240 nm) and near (250∼320 nm) UV regions. For thermal denaturation experiments, water-jacketed quartz cells were used and the temperature of the sample was controlled using a Neslab water bath. The NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer. For all 1H NMR titrations, the protein concentration used was 0.5 mm and for two-dimensional experiments 3 mm protein was used. The protein solutions were made using 50 mmglycine-d 5 (pH 3.0). For the purpose of assignment of individual proton resonances of the CTX II·dATP complex, TOCSY (11Bax A. Davies D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) and water-gated NOESY (12Piotto M. Sandek V. Skelnar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3525) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded for appropriate molar ratio (as indicated under “Results and Discussion”) of the CTX II-nucleotide in 95% H2O, 5% D2O. All spectra were obtained with 2048 complex data points in t 2 (detection period) and 512 points in t 1 (evolution period) with a spectral width of 7500 Hz. For hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, magnitude COSY spectra (2048 × 256 points) were recorded for the sample in 100% D2O. Chemical shifts were calibrated against 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate, sodium salt. The data were processed on an Indigo II workstation using the UXNMR software. The dissociation constants (k d) of the dATP and CTX II were calculated from the fluorescence intensity changes using the linear relation (13De Macro A. Petros A.M. Laursen R.A. Llinas M. Eur. Biophys.

The slope of the plot, 1/ΔF versus 1/(L o − ΔF(C o)), yielded the dissociation constant value. The modeling of the CTX II·dATP complex was carried out in different steps. Minimizations were performed using the CHARMm (14Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson S.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput.

The dATP molecule was built using the CHEMNOTE model building facility that is available within QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The conformation of the adenine ring with respect to the deoxy sugar was set to be “anti.” The molecule was then subjected to Powell energy minimization (500 steps) with the inclusion of the intramolecular NOE restraints that was available between the deoxyribose unit and the adenine moiety of dATP. The energy-minimized dATP molecule was then placed on the convex side of the CTX II (average solution structure; PDB entry code 1CRE). Both the dATP and the CTX II molecules were subjected to Adopted-Basis-Newton-Raphson energy minimization with the inclusion of the available intermolecular NOEs. Finally, with the inclusion of both intermolecular and the intramolecular NOEs (for CTX II and dATP), the entire complex was subjected to another few cycles of Adopted-Basis-Newton-Raphson energy minimization so as to obtain the lowest energy structure and avoid unnecessary bad contacts in the molecule. During this process the atomic restraints that had been imposed on the CTX II molecule were relaxed. CTX II is a three-finger shaped (15Bhaskaran R. Huang C.C. Tsai Y.C. Jayaraman G. Chang D.K. Yu C.

The solution structure of the protein shows that the secondary structural elements in this toxin analogue include antiparallel double- and triple-stranded β-sheet segments (15Bhaskaran R. Huang C.C.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14635-14641Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, CTX II is a class A protein as it lacks tryptophan residues and the aromatic amino acids in the toxin include three tyrosine residues (2Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Lee C.S. Arunkumar A.I. Sivaraman T. Samuel D. Yu C. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 431-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of the various nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) to CTX II was investigated by monitoring the changes in the tyrosine fluorescence emission intensity at 310 nm as a function of the increasing concentrations of the various nucleotide triphosphates. The data presented in Fig.2 depicts that all four nucleotide triphosphates (used in this study) cause a decrease in the emission intensity of CTX II, implying that all the four NTPs used could bind to protein (CTX II). The decrease in the 310 nm emission intensity might be due to the quenching effects of the NTPs bound to CTX II, at site(s) proximal to the tyrosine residues in the toxin molecule. The binding constants estimated from the tyrosine fluorescence decay curves are listed in Table I. Evaluation of the binding affinities (of different NTPs) to the protein from the calculated binding constant values (Table I) reveal that the binding affinity of all the four NTPs are in a similar range (16–32 μm). Thus, these results show that CTX II is a general NTP-binding protein.Figure 2Changes in the tyrosine fluorescence intensity at 310 nm [λex = 275 nm] shown as a function of nucleotide triphosphate(s) concentration. The concentration of CTX II was 20 μm.

Addition of inorganic phosphate to the protein did not cause any significant change (data not shown) in the 310-nm emission even up to a concentration of 70 mm (10 times the concentration of the protein), implying that the changes in the emission intensity at 310 nm upon addition of the NTPs are due to the binding to the nucleoside portion of the NTPs used. Interestingly, the changes in the emission intensity at 310 nm upon addition of ATP, ADP, and AMP to CTX II reveal that all nucleotide derivatives usedper se bind to the protein, but the binding avidity appears to be dependent on the length of the phosphate tail attached to the nucleoside. Thus, ATP with three phosphate groups shows the strongest binding (k d = 15.69 μm, Fig. 2 and Table I) and AMP which possess one phosphate group shows the weakest (k d = 87.36 μm, Fig. 2 and Table I) binding to CTX II. Hence, from the results of the experiments discussed above it is clear that CTX II binds to NTPs and the strength of the binding is strongly correlated to the length of the phosphate tail tethered to the nucleoside moiety. It should be mentioned that although CTX II appears to bind to all the four nucleotide triphosphates with similar affinity, for reasons of stability, we have used dATP as a model NTP to understand the NTP-CTX II structural interactions in greater detail. To probe if binding of NTP to CTX II is accompanied by conformational changes in the protein, the far and near UV-CD experiments were performed. Comparison of the far UV-CD spectra of the free CTX II and CTX II bound to dATP (in the molar ratio of 3:1 for dATP:CTX II) revealed no significant change in the 215 nm ellipticity values (representing the β-sheet secondary structural elements in the protein) was observed. These results thus indicate that binding of dATP to CTX II does not bring about any major change in the backbone folding of the protein but only causes minor perturbations in its side chain packing. To investigate the effect(s) of binding of dATP on the stability of the protein (CTX II), we compared the thermal stabilities of the CTX II in the free form and the dATP bound state by monitoring the change(s) in the 275-nm ellipticity as a function of increasing temperature. It was observed that the tertiary structural interactions in the protein (represented by the 275 nm ellipticity) show no change up to 60 °C but begins to melt rapidly beyond this temperature (Fig.3). The unfolding process is complete at about 80 °C. Interestingly, the CTX II sample bound to dATP is resistant to denaturation even up to 75 °C (Fig. 3). It could be observed that the unfolding process is not complete even at a temperature of 95 °C (which is technically the maximum possible temperature we could perform the experiment). It is amply clear from the results of these experiments that binding of dATP to CTX II confers conformational stability to the protein. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange detected by two-dimensional NMR technique is a facile and a sensitive technique to detect even subtle change(s) in the backbone of the protein, which sometimes could not be tracked by circular dichroism. Hence, we performed the hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments to investigate for possible conformational alterations in CTX II upon binding to dATP (molar ratio 1:1). Magnitude COSY spectrum of free CTX II dissolved in D2O (pD 3.4) showed that 27 cross-peaks (NH, CαH) are protected from exchange in the native state of the protein (data not shown). This probably implies that these 27 amide protons are either involved in hydrogen bonding or the corresponding amide protons are located in the protein interior. In comparison, magnitude COSY spectrum (data not shown) of CTX II bound to dATP also showed the same number of 27 cross-peaks (NH, CαH) in the fingerprint region. Thus, it appears that there is/are no drastic conformational change(s) in the backbone of the protein upon binding to dATP. Although the number of (NH, CαH) cross-peaks of the free and the bound forms are the same, it is also important to compare the relative cross-peak (NH, CαH) intensities in the magnitude COSY spectra representing the free and the dATP bound form of CTX II (Fig.4). Comparison of the relative cross-peak intensities of the 27 protected amide protons in the native and dATP bound forms of CTX II (Fig. 4) reveal that several residues in the dATP bound form show higher protection against exchange than when the protein is not bound to dATP. The residues showing relatively higher protection against exchange include Lys2, Cys3, Lys18, Cys21, Tyr22, Met24, Val34, Tyr51, Val52, Arg58, and Asn60. Interestingly, most of these residues depicting higher protection (in the dATP bound state of CTX II) are located in the β-strands III, IV, and V and in the N- and C-terminal ends of the CTX II molecule. Thus, the results of the hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments not only give useful clues regarding the dATP-binding site on the protein but also unambiguously demonstrate that binding of dATP to the protein (CTX II) stabilizes the structure of the protein. As the results of the experiments described thus far demonstrate that dATP binds to CTX II, it would be interesting to probe the location of the dATP-binding site on the three-dimensional structure of the protein. In this context, we employed one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. One-dimensional NMR experiments provide an idea of the site(s) of interaction(s) of the ligand on the protein. These experiments provide clear information on the chemical environment at the ligand interaction site(s) on the protein. In general, protein-ligand interactions using one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy could be discerned from the changes in the 1) broadening effects in the line width of the individual proton resonance(s) and/or from 2) the relative chemical shift difference(s) between the free and bound form of the protein. In this context, a series of one-dimensional NMR spectra (Fig. 5) were recorded (at 25 °C) at varying dATP:CTX II ratios (0–1.5). The chemical shift values of many proton resonances, in the presence of dATP showed significant differences as compared with the free form of the protein. Only the changes accompanying a few selected non-overlapping resonances could be unambiguously followed at increasing molar ratios of dATP:CTX II. The titration curves evaluated as a function of the molar ratio(s) of dATP:CTX II are hyperbolic and tend to saturate when the dATP:CTX II molar ratio reaches a value close to one (Fig.6). This aspect apparently suggests a 1:1 binding of the nucleotide triphosphate to the protein (Fig. 6). A close examination of the chemical shift values of the various proton resonances (which could be unambiguously monitored in one-dimensional spectrum) reveals that the amide proton resonances of Ile39, Asn4, and Arg58 undergo the most pronounced drift in the chemical shift values (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that Asn4 and Arg58 are located at the terminal ends of the cardiotoxin molecule. Incidentally, the solution structure of the free-form of CTX II reveals that the N- and C-terminal ends of the CTX II molecule are in close proximity tethered together by hydrogen bonds among their backbone atoms (15Bhaskaran R. Huang C.C. Tsai Y.C. Jayaraman G. Chang D.K. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23500-23508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Jang J.Y. Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Yang P.W. Yu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14635-14641Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this context, it is probable that dATP binds to CTX II at region(s) where the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecule are bridged together. In addition to the amide proton of Ile39, the side chain methyl proton (Ile39CδH3) also exhibited reasonably significant upfield shift (Fig. 6). Ile39, which is a part of the triple-stranded β-sheet segment is located at a site which is spatially 10 Å from the N and C termini of the CTX II molecule. Although this residue (Ile39) is located at a position well separated from the putative dATP-binding site, the observed large magnitude drift could be possibly due to the small local destabilization of the native structural interactions at the dATP-binding site. Such a subtle molecular reorganization in the protein molecule, upon binding to dATP, possibly brings the isoleucine terminal methyl group spatially closer to the conserved phenolic ring of Tyr22 (whose aromatic ring is spatially close to Ile39 in the native three-dimensional structure of CTX II). In such an event, the terminal methyl group is expected to experience larger ring current effects (compared with native) leading to the observed change in the chemical shift values for the methyl group protons. In addition, to the amide protons and the side chain methyl group(s), the α-proton (CαH) resonances of a few residues (which could be monitored) also showed significant differences in the chemical shift values upon binding to the nucleotide (Fig. 6). The changes in the CαH chemical shift values of Tyr11, Tyr22, and Lys2 are remarkable. Lys2 is located in the double-stranded β-sheet segment and as stated earlier plays a key role in bridging the N and C termini (16Jang J.Y. Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Yang P.W. Yu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14635-14641Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Tyrosine residues located at positions 11 and 22 are lodged in the double- and triple-stranded β-sheet segments, respectively. Tyr22 is one of the most well conserved residue found in all the cardiotoxin isoforms (17Lee C.S. Kumar T.K.S. Lian L.-Y. Cheng J.W. Yu C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Sivaraman T. Kumar T.K.S. Chang D.K. Lin W.Y. Yu C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 235: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This residue (Tyr22) is the locus of a prominent hydrophobic core that plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the three-dimensional structure of cardiotoxins. Chemical modification of Tyr22has been reported to result in drastic disruption of tertiary structural interactions, rendering the toxin molecule inactive (20Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Tremeau O. Gatineau E. Mouawad L. Menez A. Toma F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 719-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, a comparison of the three-dimensional solution structures of various cardiotoxin isoforms isolated from Taiwan cobra (Naja naja atra) venom shows that the aromatic rings of Tyr22 and Tyr51 lie parallel to one another (2Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Lee C.S. Arunkumar A.I. Sivaraman T. Samuel D. Yu C. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 431-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It appears that local destabilization effects at the dATP-binding site (upon binding to dATP) in the protein are effectively transmitted to residues which are spatially far away from the putative binding site accounting for the observed change(s) in the chemical shift values of some of the protons of residues (spatially separated from the dATP-binding site). The local perturbation occurring upon binding to dATP (at the contemplated dATP binding site) appears to force the Ile39 side chain atoms to move closer to the aromatic ring of Tyr22. It appears that the mobility of a bulky hydrophobic side chain (Ile39) further influences the native molecular interactions stabilizing the phenolic ring of Tyr22. Since the aromatic rings of Tyr22 and Tyr51 are spatially juxtaposed, the subtle destabilization effects are probably further transmitted to Tyr51. Our proposal of this molecular “destabilization relay” is supported by the observed chemical shift changes of the amide protons of the residues involved in the above mentioned destabilization relay. The slight decrease in the ellipticity value at 270 nm in the near UV-CD experiment, upon protein binding to dATP supports our contention that the native aromatic interactions (contributing to the CD signal) are affected upon the protein molecule binding to dATP. Ubbink and Bendall (21Ubbink M. Bendall D.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) recently characterized the plastocyanic-cytochrome ccomplex. The authors observed changes in chemical shifts of those protons, which are spatially far away from the binding site. This phenomenon is attributed to arise from the “secondary effects” resulting from the complex formation. Similarly, the chemical shifts observed in the present study could be due to such secondary effects (by destabilization relay). Estimation of the association constant values from the proton chemical shifts reveal that dATP binds to the CTX II molecule with a binding constant value in the micromolar range which is in par with those obtained from the fluorescence experiment(s). Thus, from the results obtained from the one-dimensional NMR experiments, it appears that dATP binds specifically with CTX II and the interacting site is contemplated to be located in the cleft formed between the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecule.Figure 6Changes in the chemical shift of selected, isolated proton resonances as detected from the one-dimensional proton NMR spectra, as a function of molar ratio of dATP to CTX II. The changes in the observed chemical shift values are found to saturate at a dATP to CTX II molar ratio of 1:1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To obtain complete insight of the structural interactions stabilizing the dATP·CTX II complex, two-dimensional NMR experiments (22Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) were carried out (at 1:1 molar ratio of dATP:CTX II). Most of the proton resonances pertaining to dATP, free CTX II, and dATP bound to CTX II were assigned unambiguously using the TOCSY and NOESY spectra. Analysis of the spectral data of the two-dimensional NMR experiments revealed that the chemical shift values of many protons in the protein (in the free form) had significantly changed upon interaction with dATP. Some of these changes could be monitored only from the two-dimensional NMR data because of the overlap of the resonances in the one-dimensional1H NMR spectra discussed earlier. There are several protons of the protein backbone which show significant differences (>0.02 ppm) in the chemical shift upon complexation. These include the amide and/or α-protons of Lys2, Asn4, Lys5, Val7, Tyr11, Tyr22, Lys23, Met24, Arg36, Cys38, Ile39, Val41, Lys44, Ser46, Tyr51, Cys53, and Arg58 (data not shown). Interestingly, most of the residues showing appreciable change(s) in their chemical shift values after binding to dATP are located in the N- and C-terminal ends and β-strands III and IV of the CTX II molecule. It should be mentioned that the differences observed in the amide and the α-protons of few residues that are situated topologically at site(s) far away from the contemplated nucleotide-binding site could possibly be due to minor secondary conformational effects. It should be of interest to note that the backbone amide protons (of tyrosine residues) show significant differences in their chemical shift values upon binding to dATP (data not shown). This feature strongly suggests that the three tyrosine residues are located near or in the nucleotide-binding site on the protein. Similar conclusions were reached from the results of the tyrosine fluorescence experiments and the one-dimensional NMR experiments as discussed earlier. Clinching evidence for protein-ligand interaction(s) based on two-dimensional NMR experiments comes from the observation of intermolecular NOEs between the protons of the ligand and that of the protein. Analysis of the NOEs obtained in the NOESY spectrum of the dATP·CTX II complex shows that there are at least 11 unambiguous intermolecular NOEs characterizing the complex between the nucleotide and the protein (TableII). Several of the observed intermolecular NOEs are with the sugar moiety of dATP. Prominent among the intermolecular NOEs signifying the protein-dATP interaction include Lys2NH-H2′, Ile39CδH3-H2′, Ile39CδH3-H2′′, and Asp57NH-H4′ (Fig. 7). The Leu1Hα-H8 symbolizes the sole intermolecular NOE characterizing the protein-adenine ring interaction(s). In addition, several other NOEs are observed for the protein-sugar interaction (Table II).Table IIList of intermolecular NOEs observed in the NOESY spectrum (250 ms) of the CTX II·dATP (1:1) complex (50 mm glycine, pH 3.0, 25 °C)CTX IIdATPNOE intensityLeu1-HαH8Very weakLeu1-HαH4′Medium weakLys2-HNH2′Medium weakLys2-HNH2′Medium weakCys3-Hβ′H4′Very weakIle39-HδH2′MediumIle39-HδH2“MediumThr56-CγH3H4′MediumAsp57-HNH4′MediumCys59-Hβ′H4′WeakCys59-Hβ“H4′Weak Open table in a new tab It is important to address the question as to why only one intermolecular NOE represents the protein-adenine ring interaction. In this context, it is important to compare the amino acid sequences of well known nucleotide-binding proteins and that of CTX II. Kabsch and Holmes (23Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) upon detailed search for the consensus nucleotide binding motif among the proteins in the data bank, reported that the amino acid sequence, (Ile/Leu/Val)-X-(Ile/Leu/Val/Cys)-Asp-X-Gly-(Thr/Ser/Gly)-(Thr/Ser/Gly)-X-X-(Arg/Lys/Cys), represents the nucleotide binding motif. The amino acid sequence of CTX II interestingly revealed the presence of a nucleotide binding sequence, Val32-Pro33-Val34-Lys35-Arg36-Gly37-Cys38-Ile39-Asp40-Val41-Cys42. It could be discerned that the CTX II shares more than 80% amino acid sequence homology with the reported consensus nucleotide binding motif. A closer look at the nucleotide binding motif in CTX II shows the absence of a crucial, non-variant aspartic acid present in the amino acid sequences of all the nucleotide-binding proteins known so far (23Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The charged carboxylate group of aspartic acid is believed to stabilize the adenine ring through a hydrogen bond with the amino group located in the purine ring (23Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A positively charged lysine residue in CTX II replaces the conserved aspartic acid. It is possible that the positive charge on lysine does not produce similar stabilization (due to charge incompatibility or electrostatic repulsion(s)) of the dATP molecule. This renders greater mobility for the adenine ring accounting for the absence of the expected intermolecular NOEs with the protein molecule. It is pertinent to address the question of the spatial orientation of the adenine ring with respect to the deoxyribose sugar in the dATP molecule bound to the protein. It is well known that the nucleotides in the unbound or free form adopt asyn conformation (24Garin J. Vignais P.V. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Gao Z. Bauerlein E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 172-182Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Upon binding to macromolecules, the nucleotides exist in either anti or synconformation (25Grishan C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 353-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The conformation of the bound nucleotide is considered to be syn, if the intramolecular NOEs (in the dATP molecule) between the H2 proton in the adenine ring and H2′, H2′′, H3′, and H5′ protons in sugar moiety (24Garin J. Vignais P.V. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Gao Z. Bauerlein E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 172-182Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) are observed. On the contrary, if one detects NOEs between the H8 proton (of the adenine ring) and H1′, H2′, H4′, and H5′ of the sugar ring, the conformation of the bound nucleotide could be termed to be anti. A critical examination of the observed intramolecular NOEs between the sugar and the adenine ring (in the dATP molecule bound to CTX II) shows that intramolecular NOEs (between H8 proton of the adenine ring and the H1′, H2′, H2′′, H4′ of the deoxy ribose sugar) are quite similar to that expected for the anti conformation (of the nucleotide). Therefore, dATP adopts anti conformation upon binding to the CTX II molecule. Molecular modeling of the CTX II-dATP interaction was attempted to obtain a visual concept of the topology of the dATP-binding site and the structural interactions in operation at the nucleotide triphosphate-CTX II interface. The proposed model of the CTX II·dATP complex is in good agreement with the experimental NMR data. Interestingly, the total CHARMm energy of the free form of CTX II (−675 kcal mol−1) was lower than that of the dATP bound form of the protein (−781 kcal mol−1). This further implies that CTX II gains extra stabilization upon binding to the nucleotide triphosphate. This result is in conformity with the conclusions drawn from the results of the thermal denaturation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments. The structure of the dATP·CTX II complex depicts the dATP molecule lodged in the groove enclosed by the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecule (Fig. 8). The energy minimized structure reveals that the protein-dATP complex is stabilized by a variety of electrostatic interactions. The negatively charged triphosphate moiety of the dATP molecule is found to strongly interact with the “cationic cluster” at the terminal ends (N and C termini). The residues in the cationic cluster interacting with the triphosphate moiety are Lys2, Asn4, Arg36, and Arg58 (Fig.9). It is interesting to note that among the three phosphate groups in dATP, the oxygen atoms of the α- and β-phosphate groups are spatially closer to the residues comprising the cationic cluster. The negatively charged oxygen atom of the γ-phosphate group, interestingly, does not possess any significant interaction(s) with the cationic residues in the protein. It appears that the phosphate groups in the α and β positions of the nucleotide triphosphate dictates the binding efficiency of the ligand molecule to the cationic cluster spread on the cardiotoxin molecule. The negatively charged phosphate groups of the dATP molecule are placed across the middle of Loop II of the CTX II molecule (Fig. 9). Such a topological location brings the negatively charged phosphate groups of dATP spatially closer to some of the residues located in Loop I. For example, the aromatic residue, Tyr11, located in Loop I is found to be located at a spatial distance of 6 Å from the β-phosphate group of dATP. Due to the proximity of the phenolic ring (of Tyr11) to the negatively charged β-phosphate, it is possible that the aromatic ring experiences an electrostatic repulsion leading to minor perturbations in the native interactions in this portion of the molecule. Interestingly, the change in the chemical shift values of the amide protons of Tyr11 appears to support our contention. In addition to the phosphate group(s)-mediated interactions, the energy minimized CTX II·dATP complex structure also reveals additional interactions between dATP and the protein. The hydroxyl groups of the deoxy sugar are found to interact with the protein through the amide groups (of the backbone) contributed by the amino acid residues located at the N- and C-terminal ends such as Lys2, Cys3, Asp57, and Cys59.Figure 9Molecular model of the CTX II·dATP complex. The nucleotide could be seen to lodge in between the the N- and C-terminal end of the CTX II molecule. It is also evident that the negatively charged pyrophosphate group of the dATP segment is stabilized by the electrostatic interactions with the positively charged lysines and arginines of CTX II. The dATP molecule is shown ingreen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Go and co-workers (27Kobayashi N. Go N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 6-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) recently analyzed the structural features of the nucleotide-binding site in various proteins, which have strong propensity to bind to nucleotides. Based on a thorough search, it was found that the nucleotide-binding site is normally located in the “charged sockets” comprising of cationic residues. In general these charged sockets are found to be located at a topological site wherein the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein come close to one another. In addition, this study revealed that at the site(s) closer to the nucleotide-binding site, the backbone of the protein to have strong propensity to adopt β-sheet conformation. Interestingly, the ATP-binding site in CTX II exhibits structural features quite similar to that of the consensus nucleotide-binding site. Cardiotoxins as stated earlier are bestowed with a broad range of biological properties (2Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Lee C.S. Arunkumar A.I. Sivaraman T. Samuel D. Yu C. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 431-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, cardiotoxins isolated from various snake venom sources have been demonstrated in vitro to competitively inhibit the enzymatic activity of phospholipid-sensitive (Ca2+dependent) protein kinase and activated Na+,K+-ATPase bound to the erythrocyte membrane and muscle cells (6Kuo J.F.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2062-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that both these enzymes are membrane bound and binding to ATP is obligatory for their enzymatic activity. Cardiotoxins are membrane active proteins (2Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Lee C.S. Arunkumar A.I. Sivaraman T. Samuel D. Yu C. J. Biomol. Struct.

Thus, it appears that CTX II due to its nucleotide triphosphate binding ability, probably competes with these ATP-dependent enzymes for binding to ATP leading to the effective inhibition of the catalytic action of these enzymes. It is interesting to note that the binding constant of dATP to CTX II is in the same range as that of phospholipid-sensitive protein kinase (∼30 μm) (28Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Na+,K+-ATPase (124 μm) (29Lin Shiau S.Y. Huang M.C. Lee C.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976; 196: 758-770PubMed Google Scholar). This supports our viewpoint that the snake venom cardiotoxin block the enzymatic action of these two enzymes by sequestering the ATP and inhibit the biological activities of protein kinase and Na+,K+-ATPase. The present study is the first report wherein the binding of nucleotide triphosphates, including ATP, has been presented for a snake venom cardiotoxin. This finding, in our opinion, implicates the role of cardiotoxins in the control of many cellular processes. It is believed that more detailed studies exploring the significance of binding of the nucleotide triphosphates to snake venom cardiotoxins would be conducted in the near future.

Translation of <i>repY</i> enables<i>repZ</i> translation by inducing formation of a pseudoknot containing stem-loop I, which base pairs with the sequence preceding the <i>repZ</i> start codon. Inc RNA inhibits both<i>repY</i> translation and formation of the pseudoknot by binding to the loop I. To investigate control of <i>repY</i> expression by Inc RNA, we isolated a number of mutations that express<i>repY</i> in the presence of Inc RNA. One class of mutations delete a part of another stem-loop (II), which derepresses<i>repY</i> expression by initiating translation at codon 10 (GUG), located within this structure. Point mutations in stem-loop II can also derepress <i>repY</i> translation, and the introduction of compensatory base-changes restores control of <i>repY</i>translation. These results not only indicate that suppressing a cryptic start codon by secondary structure is important for maintaining the translational control of <i>repZ</i> but also demonstrate that the position of start site for <i>repY</i> translation is critical for its control by Inc RNA.

These data suggest that the de-differentiation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, seen in many pathological states, may be independently regulated. In the T-antigen transgenic mice the increased smooth muscle cell proliferation results in thickening of the distal colon.

A similar increase in nonmuscle myosin has been reported in smooth muscle cells during restenosis (20De Leon H. Scott N.A. Martin F. Simonet L. Bernstein K.E. Wilcox J.N. Circ.

In contrast, in intimal cells from human coronary arteries, it has been reported that there is reduced expression of SM2 smooth muscle myosin heavy chain without any detectable increase in non-muscle myosin heavy chain B (5Aikawa M. Sivan P.N. Kuro-o M. Kimura K. Nakahara K.-I. Takewaki S.-I. Ueda M. Yamaguchi H. Yazaki Y. Periasamy M. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 1002-1012Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These examples illustrate that smooth muscle cells can exhibit a plethora of phenotypes ranging from fully differentiated quiescent contractile cells to cells expressing low levels of contractile proteins and proliferating rapidly (22Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). In most in vivo models of vascular, airway, and intestinal injury, smooth muscle cells are subject to mechanical and/or cytological trauma resulting in exposure to growth factors and re-entry into the cell cycle. Together these agents increase smooth muscle cell proliferation and cause phenotypic modulation altering the contractile properties of the muscle (22Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 23Gabella G. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 182: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As both proliferation and phenotypic modulation occur at the same time, it is difficult to assess the effect of either process alone on the contractility of the muscle. To examine carefully the relationships between smooth muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and contractility, we have generated a transgenic mouse model in which visceral smooth muscle cells are induced to proliferate in vivo following expression of an SV40 large T-antigen oncogene. SV40 large T-antigen was specifically targeted to smooth muscle cells using the smooth muscle-specific rabbit telokin promoter. 2.4-Kilobase pair and 310-base pair fragments of the rabbit telokin promoter have been shown to direct high levels of transgene expression in smooth muscles of the gut, airways, reproductive and urinary tract, and low levels of expression in vascular smooth muscle (4Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Smith A.F. Bigsby R.M. Word R.A. Herring B.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1188-C1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study we show that expression of T-antigen in visceral smooth muscle cells induced cell proliferation without significantly altering the contractile properties of the muscle. In this transgenic model, smooth muscle cell proliferation was accompanied by an increase in the non-muscle B myosin heavy chain isoform without any significant down-regulation of smooth muscle contractile protein isoforms. The increased smooth muscle cell proliferation did not significantly effect the contractile properties of the muscle. These findings show that contractile smooth muscle cells can proliferate without down-regulating contractile protein expression. This suggests that the phenotypic modulation normally associated with proliferating smooth muscle cells following vascular or airway injury in vivo or following in vitro culture of smooth muscle cells occurs independently of proliferation. The telokin promoter T2.4-SV40 large T-antigen and T310-SV40 large T-antigen mice were described previously (4Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J.

Transgenic mice were generated in C3HeB/FeQ inbred embryos by the Indiana University Transgenic Mouse Facility using standard protocols.

Cryoprotected tissues were embedded in tissue-freezing media (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC) and frozen at −70 °. 8-μm cryosections were cut, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2–6 h at 37 °C. Following extensive washing in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl sections were incubated with fluorescein conjugated to donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G for 1 h. Animals were given a subcutaneous bolus injection of 200 μCi of [3H]thymidine. 6 h after injection mice were sacrificed, and tissues were rapidly dissected and treated for immunohistochemical staining as described above. Following immunostaining, sections were air-dried and dipped in photographic emulsion (NTB2, Eastman Kodak Co.). Sections were exposed for 3–5 days at 4 °C and developed according to the manufacturer's directions (Kodak). Silver grains were visualized under bright field illumination. Isolated rings (3–5 mm in length) were cut from the proximal or distal colon of transgenic and wild type mice. Rings were placed in a muscle bath and attached to an isometric force transducer. Tissues were incubated at 37 °C, in bicarbonate-buffered physiological saline solution bubbled with 5% CO2, 95% O2. A resting tension of 1 g was applied to each ring, and the rings were equilibrated for 1 h prior to contractile measurements. Prior to NADPH diaphorase staining, sections were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then washed in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, for 5 min. NADPH diaphorase staining was then performed by incubating sections with 0.5 mm NADPH, 0.1 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 37 °C. Following staining, sections were washed in 10 mm sodium phosphate, air-dried, and mounted in Permount (Sigma). The most prevalent phenotype observed in mice expressing SV40 large T-antigen in visceral smooth muscle was a gross enlargement of the colon either alone or in conjunction with enlargement of the entire intestinal tract (TableI). The enlarged colon was impacted with digesta and in all cases resulted in premature death. Most animals died soon after weening with the exception of one female (T310-T-antigen) transgenic animal from which a line was established. The onset of the intestinal pathology was delayed in the animals from this founder, potentially due to the effect of the transgene integration site on the timing of transgene expression. The transgene integrated into the X chromosome in this line and telokin-T-antigen transgene expression is not detectable until the animals are approximately 4 weeks old. Mice from this transgenic line all develop megacolon after 4–6 months; the phenotype is 100% penetrant for both male and females and persistent through greater than 10 generations. Although the extent of the enlarged portion of the colon is variable from animal to animal, within the line, the greatest enlargement is always seen in the proximal colon closest to the cecum (Fig. 1).Table IPhenotypes of telokin-T-antigen transgenic miceTelokin 2.4 T-antigenTelokin 310 T-antigenNo. micePhenotypeNo. micePhenotype2Died at birth, no overt pathology3Megacolon3Megacolon1Megacolon + enlarged thymus1Abdominal tumor3Megagut1Abdominal tumorThe phenotypes of founder animals in which smooth muscle-specific expression of SV40 large T-antigen driven by either 2.4-kilobase pair (Telokin 2.4 T-Antigen) or 310-base pair (Telokin 310 T-antigen) fragments of the telokin promoter are shown.

Analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained cross-sections revealed that the enlarged proximal colon of transgenic animals had a much larger diameter than the proximal colon of wild type mice (Fig.2 A). Analysis of cross-sections of the colon revealed that the thickness of the enlarged proximal colon wall was grossly similar in transgenic and wild type animals (Fig. 2 B.). In contrast, the density of smooth muscle cells in the transgenic colon was significantly higher in transgenic animals as compared with wild type animals. In human megacolon resulting from Hirschsprung's disease and in several mouse models of megacolon, the lack of intramural ganglia in the distal colon results in constriction of this region causing megacolon (27Wartiovaara K. Salo M. Sariola H. Ann. Med. 1998; 30: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine if a similar disruption of innervation could account for the phenotype of the telokin-T-antigen transgenic mice, enteric ganglia were visualized by NADPH diaphorase staining of tissue sections (Fig.3). This analysis demonstrated that unlike other mouse models of megacolon the telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals exhibited enteric ganglia in both the proximal and distal colon. No agangliosis was evident in these animals. Similar results were seen when ganglia were visualized by neurofilament staining (data not shown). Although the wall of the proximal colon was not overtly thickened, the circular and longitudinal muscle layers displayed hypercellularity (Fig. 2 B). There was a 4–5-fold greater nuclear density in the muscle layers of transgenic animals as compared with wild type animal, suggesting that the smooth muscle cells within these layers were proliferating. To determine directly if expression of T-antigen in visceral smooth muscle cells induces cell proliferation, animals were labeled with [3H]thymidine for 6 h prior to sacrifice. Analysis of sections obtained from these animals demonstrated that the telokin-T-antigen transgene induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into the nuclei of smooth muscle cells (identified by smooth muscle myosin staining) of the circular, and longitudinal muscle layers throughout the intestinal tract, indicating that these cells were proliferating (Fig. 4). In contrast, wild type animals exhibited very low levels of smooth muscle cell proliferation as evidenced by no [3H]thymidine-positive smooth muscle cells in many sections. Most of the [3H]thymidine-positive nuclei were confined to the epithelial cells in the crypts of the colon of wild type animals (Fig.4).Figure 4Visceral smooth muscle targeted expression of SV40 large T-antigen induces smooth muscle cell proliferation.Animals were labeled with tritiated thymidine for 6 h prior to sacrifice. The digestive tract was dissected from the animals, and segments were processed for immunofluorescent analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cross-sections of gut were stained with antibodies specific for either smooth muscle myosin (SM2) or T-antigen (TAG), both of which are only expressed in smooth muscle cells. Some sections were also stained with antibodies to non-muscle myosin heavy chain B (NMHCB; a generous gift form Dr. Robert Wysolmerski) as indicated. Stained sections were then dipped in photographic emulsion to identify nuclei that had incorporated tritiated thymidine. Staining was visualized under epifluorescence with additional back light illumination to visualize both the antibody staining (green) and the tritiated thymidine-positive nuclei (black granules). Sections shown are from distal colon (DISTAL), proximal colon (PROX), ileum, jejunum (JEJ), and stomach, as indicated. Scale bars represent 50 μm. Representative sections are shown from a 6-month-old telokin-T-antigen transgenic mouse that displayed overt megacolon, from a 6-month-old wild type mouse, and from a 2-month-old telokin-T-antigen transgenic animal that displayed no overt pathology, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if the increase in smooth muscle cell proliferation observed in the animals with megacolon was a secondary consequence of the pathology, proliferation was examined in 2-month-old transgenic animals prior to the development of the intestinal pathology. Proliferation was determined by tritiated thymidine uptake into the nuclei of smooth muscle cells. This analysis revealed that visceral smooth muscle cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract exhibited high rates of proliferation prior to the development of megacolon (Fig. 4). Despite increased rates of smooth muscle cell proliferation in all regions of the gut, no major histological changes were consistently observed in any region except for the colon. The amount of smooth muscle cell proliferation in the circular muscle layer of proximal and distal colon of wild type and 2-month-old telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals was quantitated by determining the ratio of 3H-positive nuclei to total nuclei in this layer. The muscle layers were identified by counterstaining for smooth muscle myosin. This analysis demonstrated that in transgenic animals there was a large increase (10–60-fold) in proliferation in the smooth muscle cells in both the proximal and distal colon as compared with wild type animals (TableII). Calculation of the proliferative index obtained from analysis of several sections from four 2-month-old transgenic animals also revealed that there was no significant difference in the rate of proliferation in the proximal as compared with distal colon (6.35 ± 3.3% in proximal as compared with 6.5 ± 1.9% in distal; Table II).Table IIProliferative index of colonic smooth muscle cellsProximalDistal3H/totalPercent3H/totalPercentTG-189/12806.95118/14208.3TG-2147/136710.7567/12965.2TG-313/3004.324/2968TG-49/2373.426/5744.5TG-Total258/31846.35 ± 3.3%235/35866.5 ± 1.9%WT-15/15790.327/6061.16WT-20/350<0.293/3380.89WT-31/10190.0980/208<0.48WT-40/83<1.25/8030.62WT-Total6/3031<0.48%15/1955<0.79%Tissues were obtained from animals that were labeled with tritiated thymidine 6 h prior to sacrifice.

In all known models of megacolon the pathological enlargement of the colon occurs subsequent to blockage of the distal colon and reflects the stretch imposed on the wall of the colon by the continued movement of digesta into the obstructed region. There is no obvious physical obstruction in the colon of telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals, suggesting that, similar to other animal models of megacolon, it is likely that altered contractility results in the obstruction. However, in contrast to other mouse models of megacolon, the impaired contractility is not a result of agangliosis of the distal colon (Fig. 3). To investigate possible mechanisms that cause the megacolon in the telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals, transgenic mice were examined at 2 months of age prior to the development of any gross intestinal pathology. Two possible models can be envisioned by which the contractility of the colon could be altered such that digesta accumulates in the proximal colon. Either the contractility of the distal colon is increased resulting in a constriction that prevents the movement of digesta out of the proximal colon or the contractility of the proximal colon could be decreased such that it is unable to move digesta to the distal colon. Several physiological parameters were examined in order to identify the cause of the motility defect that results in the obstruction of the colon. To determine the effect of increased smooth muscle cell proliferation on the physiological function of the muscle, colonic muscle rings were isolated and their contractile properties examined. Three rings of proximal and 3 rings of distal colon were analyzed from each of 6 animals. Maximal contractions in response to KCl (80 mm), electrical (20 Hz, 80 V), and carbachol (10−4m) stimulation, normalized to the cross-sectional area of the circular muscle layer in each sample, were not significantly different between wild type and transgenic animals (Fig.5, A–C). In contrast, both wild type and transgenic distal colon exhibited higher maximal contractions to electric and carbachol stimulation as compared with proximal colon (p < 0.05; Fig. 5, B andC). The contractile responses to carbachol were further evaluated to determine if the sensitivity to agonist stimulation was altered in the transgenic animals. In both proximal and distal colon the carbachol dose-response curves of transgenic animals were shifted to the right as compared with wild type animals, indicating that muscle from transgenic animals was less sensitive to agonists compared with muscle from wild type animals (Fig. 5, E and F). The concentration of carbachol required to produce a half-maximal contraction increased from 4.4 × 10−7 to 9 × 10−7m in distal colon and from 8 × 10−7 to 1.7 × 10−6m in proximal colon. The thickness of the circular muscle layer of the proximal and distal colon of 2-month-old transgenic and wild type mice was determined by morphological analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of the colon, using Metamorph Image analysis software (Fig. 5 D). Results from this analysis demonstrated that in both wild type and transgenic animals the circular muscle layer in the proximal colon is significantly thicker than in the distal colon (p < 0.01, Fig. 5 D). In addition, the circular muscle layer of the distal colon of transgenic animals was significantly thicker than the wild type animals (p < 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the proximal colon between transgenic and wild type animals. The data shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that the maximal contractile responses of transgenic and wild type colon are similar when normalized to the cross-sectional area of circular muscle. However, the circular muscle in the distal colon of transgenic mice was significantly thicker than in wild type animals (Fig. 5 D). Together these data suggest that per unit length the transgenic distal colon is more contractile than wild type. When the maximal forces obtained from colonic rings are expressed per unit length, it is apparent that although there is little change in the contractility of wild type and transgenic proximal colon, the transgenic distal colon is significantly greater than wild type distal colon. In addition, the contractility of wild type proximal colon is greater than the contractility of wild type distal colon (TableIII). This pattern is generally reversed in telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals in which the distal colon is more contractile in response to electrical and KCl stimulation than the proximal colon.Table IIIMaximal contractility of colonic rings normalized per unit lengthMean force per unit lengthProximal WTProximal TGDistal WTDistal TGKCl1174104810471565Electrical1311116611642208Carbachol181315858001488The maximal contractile responses to KCl, electrical, and 10−4m carbachol stimulation, normalized to cross-sectional area, are shown in Fig. 5, A–C.

To determine the amount of force per unit length of colon, the mean values shown in Fig. 5,A–C were multiplied by the mean thickness of the circular muscle layer, shown in Fig.5 D. Phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle, resulting in alteration of the expression of contractile protein isoforms, is a common feature associated with smooth muscle cell proliferation. To examine the expression of smooth muscle contractile proteins in telokin-T-antigen transgenic mice, Western blot analysis was performed on extracts obtained from 4 transgenic and 4 wild type mice (Fig. 6,A and B). Autoradiographs were scanned, and the density of each band was quantitated. This analysis revealed that expression of the non-muscle B myosin heavy chain isoform in proximal and distal colon of telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals was increased approximately 10-fold (proximal, p < 0.05; distal,p < 0.001) as compared with expression in colon from wild type animals (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, a small (15%) although statistically significant decrease (proximal,p < 0.01; distal, p = 0.04) of the SM2 smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoform was observed in colon from transgenic as compared with wild type animals. The expression level of other contractile proteins was not significantly different between wild type and transgenic animals. Comparison of telokin and T-antigen protein expression between proximal and distal colon of transgenic animals revealed no statistical differences (data not shown). Specific, targeted expression of SV40 large T-antigen to visceral smooth muscle cells stimulates the cells to re-enter the cell cycle and results in proliferation of contractile smooth muscle cells, without inducing de-differentiation. This leads to an increase in the contractility of the distal colon and results in the development of megacolon. It is likely that the hyper-contractile distal colon creates a restriction to the passage of digesta through the colon, causing the proximal colon, oral to the restriction, to enlarge producing the megacolon phenotype. Visceral smooth muscle hypertrophy is a common pathology of many human diseases (23Gabella G. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 182: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Diseases that result in partial obstruction of the gut, such as Hirschsprung's disease, cause a marked smooth muscle cell hypertrophy in cells oral to the obstruction, leading to megacolon. Hypertrophy of the gut following partial obstruction is accompanied by a large increase in the circumference of the intestine oral to the obstruction; this results from increased smooth muscle cell proliferation, in addition to cellular hypertrophy (23Gabella G. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 182: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based on ultrastructural investigations it was shown that the proliferating cells maintained a full complement of myofilaments and specialized structures suggesting that they remained fully differentiated. Similarly, hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells in the urinary bladder occurs following partial obstruction of the outflow tract, and hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells in the trachea and bronchi are seen in chronic asthmatic patients. The hypertrophy of the gut in telokin-T-antigen transgenic mice, although superficially similar to the hypertrophy resulting from experimental constriction of the gut, is morphologically distinct in that most of the increase in muscle volume results from hyperplasia rather than hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Although the size of the smooth muscle cells has not been directly determined in the T-antigen transgenic mice, there is a dramatic 4–5-fold increase in the nuclear density of the circular muscle layer, with a relatively small increase in its thickness (less than 2-fold). These physical constraints imply that the smooth muscle cells in the telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals are likely to be smaller than cells from wild type animals. Although the contribution of smooth muscle cell hyperplasia to the phenotype of the muscle in experimentally induced gut hypertrophy is not well understood, several investigators have shown that proliferating smooth muscle cells can be found in the hypertrophic gut (reviewed in Ref. 23Gabella G. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 182: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar to other experimental and genetic models of gut hypertrophy, the telokin-T-antigen transgenic mice model also results in a large increase in muscle volume without altering the stratified architecture of the gut. This demonstrates the remarkable ability of the intestine to maintain the normal organization of the external muscle, mucosal, or submucosal layers even in the presence of a dramatic increase in smooth muscle cell proliferation directed by a viral oncogene. In previous animal models of visceral smooth muscle hypertrophy, a partial obstruction of the colon placed a mechanical strain on the wall of the gut triggering the hypertrophic response. In the telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals, mechanical strain also results from a constriction of the colon. The subsequent remodeling and enlargement of the gut is likely to occur as a result of this mechanical strain. Unique to the telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals an increase in smooth muscle cell proliferation is likely to cause the initial constriction. Morphological measurements of the distal colon in transgenic animals show that the circular muscle layer is significantly thicker than in wild type animals. This results in the increased contractility of the distal colon, and it is likely that it is this increased contractility that presents a constriction to the flow of digesta throughout the colon. The increased pressure of the luminal contents on the oral side of the constriction will then provide the mechanical strain needed to induce remodeling and hypertrophy of the gut. Thus, in addition to loss of relaxing innervation of the colon, as seen in aganglionic megacolon, smooth muscle cell hyperplasia leading to muscle hyper-contractility can also lead to megacolon. These results suggest that an increase in the rate of smooth muscle cell proliferation in the wall of the gut may play a role in the etiology of diseases, such as idiopathic megacolon, that result in megacolon without loss of neuronal innervation (28Gattuso J.M. Kamm M.A. Talbot J.C. Gut. 1997; 41: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The telokin T-antigen transgenic model provides a novel system in which to study the effects of smooth muscle cell proliferation on the contractile properties of muscle in vivo. In young transgenic animals prior to the intestinal remodeling, smooth muscle cells in the wall of the intestine are proliferating rapidly with a proliferative index of 6% as compared with <0.8% in wild type animals (Table II). Analysis of intestinal contractility in these animals provides a novel system to investigate the effects of increased smooth muscle cell proliferation alone, in the absence of overt mechanical stimuli, on contractility. Results from this analysis clearly show that, although the colonic smooth muscle cells from telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals are proliferating, this does not effect the maximal contractile response of the muscle to agonists. Neither receptor-independent (KCl) nor receptor-dependent (carbachol, electric stimulation) responses were significantly different between wild type and transgenic animals (Fig. 5). The only difference observed was a small rightward shift in the dose-response curve to carbachol in the transgenic animals (Fig. 5, E andF). Together with these physiological findings, biochemical analysis of contractile protein expression revealed that there was no significant down-regulation of contractile protein expression in the proliferating colon (Fig. 6). These findings are consistent with previous studies on the lethal spotted mouse model of megacolon, in which no decrease in contractile protein expression was observed in the hypertrophic colon (29Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Narayan S. Adam L. Chacko S. Haase H. Morano I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1571-G1580PubMed Google Scholar). The most significant change in contractile protein expression observed in telokin-T-antigen transgenic animals was an increase in the non-muscle B myosin heavy chain isoform. In contrast, no increase in the expression of the non-muscle or embryonic isoforms of l-caldesmon, myosin light chain kinase, or nonmuscle myosin heavy chain A was observed. This suggests that the proliferating muscle has not simply reverted to an earlier embryonic state. A similar increase in non-muscle myosin B has been observed in many different models of smooth muscle cell proliferation (6Chiavegato A. Scatena M. Roelofs M. Ferrarese P. Pauletto P. Passerini-Glazel G. Pagano F. Sartore S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 207: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Sartore S. Chiavegato A. Franch R. Faggin E. Pauletto P. Arterioscler. Thromb.

Biol. 1993; 8: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that this embryonic myosin isoform may be necessary for smooth muscle cell proliferation (32Simons M. Rosenberg R.D. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 835-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results presented provide direct evidence that visceral smooth muscle cells can proliferate in vivo without down-regulating contractile protein expression or without affecting the contractile properties of the muscle. These results imply that the phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells that occurs following vascular or airway injury or when cells are cultured in vitro is likely to be regulated independently of changes in cell proliferation. In support of this concept, it has been shown that protein kinase G promotes differentiation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells without altering their ability to proliferate (33Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These observations support a growing body of evidence suggesting that the proliferative potential of a vascular or visceral smooth muscle cell is not obligatorily linked to its' state of differentiation."

Maire P. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 61: 279-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). DBP mRNA is detected in most tissues, although the protein accumulates to high levels only in the nuclei of adult liver, suggesting that it is posttranscriptionally regulated. This 43-kDa protein is also known to undergo a robust circadian rhythm, with its expression highest at approximately 8 p.m. (2Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 63: 1257-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This characteristic leads to the identification of one of its most likely target genes, the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene (C7αH), which can be transactivated by DBP and which also exhibits a significant diurnal regulation (3Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Other genes that appear to be regulated by DBP include PEPCK (4Roesler W.J. McFie P.J. Dauvin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21235-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alcohol dehydrogenase (5van Ooij C. Snyder R.C. Paeper B.W. Duester G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2847-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DBP may also be involved in the regulation of the clotting factor IX gene and recovery of the Leyden phenotype form of hemophilia B (8Picketts D.J. Lillicrap D.P. Mueller C.R. Nat.

Blood. 1994; 84: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to the b/ZIP domain, DBP also contains a distinct region termed the proline- and acid-rich (PAR) domain, which consists of a large number (16%) of proline, glutamate, and aspartate residues. This unique region, found immediately amino-terminal to the basic domain, shares 83% identity with two other b/ZIP transcriptional regulators, thyrothropic embryonic factor (TEF) (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) (11Inaba T.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and together they form the subfamily of PAR proteins. TEF is expressed in the rat anterior pituitary gland and is one of the key factors in transactivating the thyroid-stimulating hormone β promoter (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). HLF was discovered through studies of the human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia bearing 17:19 chromosomal translocations where the b/ZIP domain of HLF was found fused to the E2Agene (11Inaba T. Roberts W.M. Shapiro L.H. Jolly K.W. Raimondi S.C. Smith S.D. Look A.T. Science. 1992; 257: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12Hunger S.P. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). HLF expression has been detected in the liver, though little is known about the roles of TEF and HLF in this tissue. All three members of the PAR subfamily recognize related sequences and are able to heterodimerize (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Inaba T. Shapiro L.H. Funabiki T. Sinclair A. Jones B. Ashmun R. Look T. Mol. Cell.

Despite the highly conserved nature of the PAR domain, no unique function has been associated with it. Mutational analysis of the TEF PAR domain identified a cluster of six basic amino acids, referred to as the “basic extension,” that is thought to be important for DNA binding specificity (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).In this study we have been able to define a role for the PAR domain of DBP in the transactivation potential of this protein. Through the use of deletion mutants within the context of the whole DBP protein, we have demonstrated that sequences within the central 28 amino acids of the PAR domain are essential for DBP to transactivate a site from the C7αH promoter. Using GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins, we have shown that the PAR domain must act in conjunction with sequences within the amino terminus of DBP to mediate transactivation. Interestingly, cotransfection of full-length DBP or HLF was able to dramatically increase the transactivation potential of these GAL4-DBP fusion constructs. Cotransfection of an E1A vector was able to inhibit DBP-mediated transactivation. Introduction of a p300 expression vector was able to overcome the E1A-mediated inhibition. These results indicate that DBP transactivation is a p300-dependent process.DISCUSSIONThe members of the PAR domain family of proteins are unique among the b/ZIP class of factors in having an extended region of homology outside of the b/ZIP domain itself. Previous studies have implicated a relatively restricted part of the PAR domain, called the basic extension, in site-specific recognition (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, a role for the relatively large remaining portion of this domain has not previously been defined. We have been able to demonstrate a requirement for this domain in transactivation mediated by DBP. Deletions that remove amino-terminal parts of the PAR domain but that do not effect DNA binding activity are severely debilitated in their ability to activate transcription via a high affinity DBP binding site. These same sequences are required for activity of the GAL4 fusion proteins, and again this region functions in conjunction with other sequences present in the amino-terminal part of DBP, as either domain alone is inactive. The amino-terminal domains of all three PAR proteins have a 28-amino acid region of high similarity that may comprise the functional part of the amino-terminal region of DBP (17Shutler G. Glassco T. Kang X. Korneluk R. Mueller C.R. Genomics. 1996; 34: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It has been shown that this isolated segment from TEF acts as a transcriptional activator when assayed outside the context of the whole protein (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We have found similar results with this amino-terminal region of DBP (data not shown). It may be that other sequences in these proteins inhibit the amino-terminal activation domain, which the PAR domain overcomes. Alternatively, the isolated amino-terminal activation domain may interact with a different part of the transcriptional machinery compared with the intact protein. The amino-terminal and PAR domains may represent separate contact points for the same protein or may contact two different proteins where both are required for function. The conserved nature of both the amino-terminal and PAR domains of all three known PAR domain proteins, coupled with their similar tissue distribution, suggests that they interact with the same protein or a closely related factor.Transcriptional activation occurs either through the direct recruitment of parts of the transcriptional machinery such as TFIID or in conjunction with coactivators. The coactivator p300 is known to interact with a wide variety of b/ZIP factors including CREB (18Lee J.-S. Zhang X. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17666-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), c-Jun (19Lee J.S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (20Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It functions as a histone acetyltransferase (21Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar) and may act to create a chromatin environment favorable for transcription (22Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The p300 protein has been implicated in the regulation of differentiation in a variety of systems (23Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to undergo increased phosphorylation in response to differentiation (24Kitabayashi I. Eckner R. Arany Z. Chiu R. Gachelin G. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ability of p300 to overcome E1A-mediated inhibition of DBP transactivation strongly suggests that this coactivator is required for the transcriptional activity of DBP. The inability of CBP to complement the E1A-mediated repression of DBP clearly differentiates the functions of p300 and CBP in this context. The dependence of DBP transactivation on a coactivator, rather than directly recruiting the transcriptional machinery, implies a requirement for regulation of this activity. This may be linked to changes in gene expression associated with terminal differentiation of the liver when DBP is exclusively expressed (1Mueller C.R. Maire P. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 61: 279-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The ability of DBP and HLF expression to increase DBP transactivation and to up-regulate the DBP promoter (25Newcombe K. Glassco T. Mueller C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) suggests that some form of autoregulation of PAR protein activity involving p300 may occur in liver cells.

All three members of the PAR subfamily recognize related sequences and are able to heterodimerize (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Inaba T. Shapiro L.H. Funabiki T. Sinclair A. Jones B. Ashmun R. Look T. Mol. Cell.

Despite the highly conserved nature of the PAR domain, no unique function has been associated with it. Mutational analysis of the TEF PAR domain identified a cluster of six basic amino acids, referred to as the “basic extension,” that is thought to be important for DNA binding specificity (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this study we have been able to define a role for the PAR domain of DBP in the transactivation potential of this protein. Through the use of deletion mutants within the context of the whole DBP protein, we have demonstrated that sequences within the central 28 amino acids of the PAR domain are essential for DBP to transactivate a site from the C7αH promoter. Using GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins, we have shown that the PAR domain must act in conjunction with sequences within the amino terminus of DBP to mediate transactivation. Interestingly, cotransfection of full-length DBP or HLF was able to dramatically increase the transactivation potential of these GAL4-DBP fusion constructs. Cotransfection of an E1A vector was able to inhibit DBP-mediated transactivation. Introduction of a p300 expression vector was able to overcome the E1A-mediated inhibition. These results indicate that DBP transactivation is a p300-dependent process. DISCUSSIONThe members of the PAR domain family of proteins are unique among the b/ZIP class of factors in having an extended region of homology outside of the b/ZIP domain itself. Previous studies have implicated a relatively restricted part of the PAR domain, called the basic extension, in site-specific recognition (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, a role for the relatively large remaining portion of this domain has not previously been defined. We have been able to demonstrate a requirement for this domain in transactivation mediated by DBP. Deletions that remove amino-terminal parts of the PAR domain but that do not effect DNA binding activity are severely debilitated in their ability to activate transcription via a high affinity DBP binding site. These same sequences are required for activity of the GAL4 fusion proteins, and again this region functions in conjunction with other sequences present in the amino-terminal part of DBP, as either domain alone is inactive. The amino-terminal domains of all three PAR proteins have a 28-amino acid region of high similarity that may comprise the functional part of the amino-terminal region of DBP (17Shutler G. Glassco T. Kang X. Korneluk R. Mueller C.R. Genomics. 1996; 34: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It has been shown that this isolated segment from TEF acts as a transcriptional activator when assayed outside the context of the whole protein (10Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K.T. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We have found similar results with this amino-terminal region of DBP (data not shown). It may be that other sequences in these proteins inhibit the amino-terminal activation domain, which the PAR domain overcomes. Alternatively, the isolated amino-terminal activation domain may interact with a different part of the transcriptional machinery compared with the intact protein. The amino-terminal and PAR domains may represent separate contact points for the same protein or may contact two different proteins where both are required for function. The conserved nature of both the amino-terminal and PAR domains of all three known PAR domain proteins, coupled with their similar tissue distribution, suggests that they interact with the same protein or a closely related factor.Transcriptional activation occurs either through the direct recruitment of parts of the transcriptional machinery such as TFIID or in conjunction with coactivators. The coactivator p300 is known to interact with a wide variety of b/ZIP factors including CREB (18Lee J.-S. Zhang X. Shi Y. J. Biol.

Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The p300 protein has been implicated in the regulation of differentiation in a variety of systems (23Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to undergo increased phosphorylation in response to differentiation (24Kitabayashi I. Eckner R. Arany Z. Chiu R. Gachelin G. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ability of p300 to overcome E1A-mediated inhibition of DBP transactivation strongly suggests that this coactivator is required for the transcriptional activity of DBP. The inability of CBP to complement the E1A-mediated repression of DBP clearly differentiates the functions of p300 and CBP in this context. The dependence of DBP transactivation on a coactivator, rather than directly recruiting the transcriptional machinery, implies a requirement for regulation of this activity. This may be linked to changes in gene expression associated with terminal differentiation of the liver when DBP is exclusively expressed (1Mueller C.R. Maire P. Schibler U. Cell. 1990; 61: 279-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The ability of DBP and HLF expression to increase DBP transactivation and to up-regulate the DBP promoter (25Newcombe K. Glassco T. Mueller C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) suggests that some form of autoregulation of PAR protein activity involving p300 may occur in liver cells.

Formation of E*I* involves large changes in the conformation of the reactive center loop (residues P17 to P9′) and of the serpin molecule in general. The “hinge” region of the reactive center loop, including residues P10–P14, shows facile movement in and out of β-sheet A, and this movement appears to be crucial in determining whether E*I* is formed (the inhibitor pathway) or whether I is rapidly hydrolyzed to I* (the substrate pathway).

Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 250-257Google Scholar) and is the primary interaction site between the inhibitor and the target proteinase. Following standard nomenclature (19Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In released I*, residues P1–P14 are inserted into β-sheet A, the dominant structural element in ACT, as strand 4A (s4A). The C-terminal portion of I, designated the postcomplex fragment (residues 359–398), is retained in a noncovalent complex with the remainder of I, in which the P1 and P1′ residues are separated by 70 Å (20Baumann U. Huber R. Bode W. Grosse D. Laurell C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fluorescence energy transfer studies suggest substantial or even complete s4A insertion within E*I* for several serpin:serine proteinase pairs (7Wright H.T.

Cancer (Phila.). 1995; 75 (suppl.): 2021-2026Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results, which parallel results obtained with other serpins, indicate a partitioning between substrate and inhibitor pathways when serpins interact with serine proteinases, in a mechanism akin to that of a suicide substrate (8Stone S.R.

In this scheme, which provides a general, albeit minimal, description of the serpin-serine proteinase interaction, (a) formation of EI′ from the encounter complex E·I is at least partly rate-determining in overall E*I* formation; (b) the P1–P1′ linkage is preserved in EI′; (c) formation of EI′ involves substantial RCL insertion into β-sheet A, which therefore occurs prior to acyl enzyme formation; and (d) partitioning between substrate and inhibitor pathways occurs prior to E*I* formation. Evidence for an intermediate between E·I and E*I* has also been obtained for the interaction of α-1-protease inhibitor with Chtr (27Futamara A. Stratikos E. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13110-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the interaction of plasminogen activator inhibitor with plasminogen activator (28Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I.

E+I⇌k−1k1E·I⇌k−2k2EI′⇌k−3k3E*I*↓k4E+I*SCHEME I Here, in order to explore further the mechanism of E*I* formation, we extend our studies by investigating the interaction with Chtr of two derivatives of rACT in which a fluorescent group, 7-[4-(aminosulfonyl)-2,1,3,benzoxadiazole)] (ABD) has been placed at residues P11 and P13 within the RCL. These residues are of special interest because they fall within the so-called “hinge” region of the RCL (residues P10–P14) that plays a key role in the partitioning between the substrate and inhibitor pathways. Thus, as recently reviewed (7Wright H.T. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Lukacs C. Zhong J.Q. Plotnick M. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), mutations at residues P14 and P12, particularly those in which Arg or Pro replaces a smaller residue, such as Ala or Ser, convert serpin inhibitors into substrates, presumably because they affect the rate at which the RCL inserts into β-sheet A during E*I* formation. In addition, annealing the peptide corresponding to residues P8–P14 to intact α1-protease inhibitor converts this serpin from an inhibitor of trypsin to a trypsin substrate by preventing RCL insertion (30Schulze A.J. Frohnert P.W. Engh R.A. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7560-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONEarlier, we showed that at pH 7.0 and 40 °C, the spectral change resulting from MCM-A352C-rACT interaction with Chtr proceeded more rapidly than E*I* formation, allowing the inference that an intermediate formed between the encounter complex E·I and the acyl enzyme E*I* (26O'Malley K.M. Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The major result of the current study is the direct demonstration that there are at least three identifiable intermediates, EIa, EIb, and EIc, between the encounter complex formed between ABD-E346C-rACT and Chtr and E*I*. It might be argued that ABD-E346C-rACT interaction with Chtr reflects a peculiarity due to the presence of a bulky group in the hinge region and is not a good model for WT-rACT interaction. Strong evidence that this is not so comes from the similarities of the two molecules as Chtr inhibitors, as judged by their k i and SI values (Table I) and their values for k 3 andk 4 at pH 5 (Table III and Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, even though the complexity of Scheme III introduces ambiguity into comparisons of overall first-order rate constants for E*I* formation, it is worth noting the similar magnitudes of the single rate constants observed for WT at pH 7.5 (7 ± 1 and 17 ± 2 s−1 at 25 and 40 °C, respectively) andk II for ABD-E346C-rACT at pH 7.0 (4.6 ± 0.5 and 22 ± 2 s−1 at 25 and 40 °C, respectively) (Table II). In addition, at pH 7 and 40 °C, values ofk I and k II for ABD-E346C-rACT (53 ± 10 and 22 ± 2 s−1) are similar to those estimated for MCM-A352C-rACT (30–45 and 20–25 s−1) (Table II), in which the bulky fluorescent group is at P7, far from the hinge region.Below, using the results of this study, especially Figs. 6 and 7, we propose a model relating the structures of intermediates EIa, EIb, and EIc to conformational changes within the RCL that are known to be crucial for the inhibitory activity of a serpin and consider the question of from which of these intermediates, if any, does partitioning occur between the inhibitor and substrate pathways (Scheme I)?A Proposed Model for Conformational Changes in the RCL on Conversion of E.I to E*I* via EIa, EIb, and EIcIn formation of E*I* from E and I we know, or can safely assume on the basis of prior work (7Wright H.T.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6375-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with formation of the postcomplex fragment, a reaction that proceeds via a tetrahedral intermediate.We propose that in Scheme III, E·I conversion to EIa(step 1) principally involves rearrangement of the RCL to the required canonical conformation, which is followed by a conformational change within Chtr to give EIb (step 2). In both EIaand EIb, the P13 residue moves in and out of an inserted position within sheet A, in a process modulated by the ionization state of His-57. Formation of EIc (step 3) involves a closer fitting of the RCL to the catalytic machinery of Chtr (EIc), as well as insertion of a major portion of the RCL within β-sheet A. Finally, conversion of EIc to E*I* (step 4) involves covalent reaction between Chtr residue Ser-195 and the P1 residue of ACT to give the tetrahedral intermediate and ultimately acyl enzyme. Evidence for this proposal is discussed further below.Relevance of Chtr Hydrolysis of a Simple Substrate to Steps 2–4 in Scheme IIIEarlier, Fink (41Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) identified three intermediates intervening between the encounter complex E·S and the acylated enzyme on reaction ofN-acetyl-l-Phe-p-nitroanilide and Chtr at pH 7.6 in 65% aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (Scheme V). E+S↔k1*E·S↔k2*ES′↔k3*ES″↔k4*In↔k5*acyl­ESCHEME V At −56 °C, k 2* >k 3* > k 4* ≫k 5*, but on extrapolation to 25 °C, this order changed to k 2* ∼k 3* ∼ k 4* ≫k 5*. Moreover, over the pH range 4.2–7.8,k 2* and k 3* were insensitive to pH, whereas both k 4* andk 5* increased with pH, with kinetically determined pK a values of 5.9 and 7.6, respectively (both measured at 0 °C). When Chtr was replaced with its N-Me His-57 derivative, which has very low enzymatic activity,k 2* and k 3* were unaffected, but reaction 4* could not be detected. Fink (41Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) concluded that reactions 2* and 3* represented conformational changes within Chtr following substrate binding, but that both reactions 4* and 5* involved the Chtr catalytic apparatus. He assigned reaction 4* to the formation of a pre-tetrahedral intermediate (In) that requires His-57 to be in the basic form, and reaction 5* to the formation of acyl enzyme via a tetrahedral intermediate that does not accumulate, arguing that In could not itself correspond to a tetrahedral intermediate, because its rate of breakdown increases as pH is increased. (In contrast, tetrahedral intermediate does accumulate at high pH (9.4) during acyl-elastase formation from elastase and p-nitroanilide substrates (42Fink A.L. Meehan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1566-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).)There is a striking degree of similarity in the properties of several of the steps seen by Fink (41Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and ourselves. The conversion of EIa to EIb (step 2) in Scheme III parallels steps 2* and 3* in Scheme V in taking place comparatively rapidly and in showing little pH dependence. Similarly, k 3and k 4, the rate constants for EIbconversion to EIc and EIc conversion to E*I*, respectively, depend on basic groups of apparent pK avalues of 6.1 and ≥7.8 (Fig. 6), closely paralleling what Fink (41Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reports for k 4* and k 5*in Scheme V. These similarities lead us to speculate that reactions 2, 3, and 4 in Scheme III parallel reactions 2* and 3*, 4*, and 5* in Scheme V, respectively, such that the intermediates that accumulate between E·I and E*I* do not involve covalent bond formation between ACT and Chtr. Such a model agrees with conclusions reached by Stone and Le Bonniec (43Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 344-362Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for the reaction of the heparin complex of antithrombin with thrombin, but run counter to the model of Olson et al.(44Olson S.T. Bock P.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30007-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) for the reaction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 with trypsin. This apparent disagreement may simply reflect real differences in the relative free energies of intermediates formed in the reactions of different proteinases, as noted above in connection with tetrahedral intermediate accumulation in Chtr versus elastase.Step 1 in Scheme IIIIn contrast to steps 2–4, step 1, the formation of EIa, which is both rapid and has strong pH dependence, has no clear analogue in Scheme V, allowing the inference that step 1 represents a transformation unique to the interaction of serpins with Chtr, the conversion of the RCL to the canonical conformation. The necessity of such a conformational change is suggested by the structure of an intact variant of rACT retaining inhibitory activity, in which the RCL is present as a distorted α-helix (18Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 250-257Google Scholar). It would be reasonable for the rate of formation of the canonical conformation to depend on the charge relay system being in the catalytically active form (neutral His-57), accounting for the ascending limb of the pH rate profile for k 1with apparent pK a 7.0 (Fig. 6 A). Accounting for the descending limb (pK a 7.1) is less obvious. A requirement for the protonated form of one of the eight remaining His residues in the E·I complex (His-40 in Chtr and seven His residues in rACT) is a possibility. Based on proximity within a model of the docked rACT·Chtr complex (45Katz D.S. Christianson D.W. Prot. Engineering. 1993; 6: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to either His-57 or Ser-195 in Chtr, or to P13, the most likely candidates are His-40 in Chtr and His-204, -224, or -225 in ACT.The Magnitudes and Directions of Fluorescence Intensity Changes (Fig. 7) Support the Proposed Conformational ChangesAccording to our model, motions within the active site would be coupled to the hinge region of ACT on formation of EIa, so that the changes in fluorescence intensity on conversion of E·I to E*I*, although directly reflecting changes in the local environment of the ABD group attached to Cys-346, could also detect changes occurring within the active site of Chtr. We interpret increases and decreases in fluorescence intensity in Fig. 7 as reflecting either further insertion of the ABD group into β-sheet A or movement toward a more solvent-exposed environment, respectively, based on the increase in fluorescence we observe on E*I* formation (Fig. 2), which parallels increases seen for fluorescent probes placed at residues P7 (26O'Malley K.M. Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and P9 (46Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). According to this interpretation, the fluorescence changes seen in EIa and EIb as a function of pH reflect small movements of the RCL that are modulated by the protonation state of His-57, with the inactive, protonated form corresponding to more insertion within the A-sheet and the neutral, active form corresponding to less. The movement is more pronounced for EIb, indicating a stronger coupling of the hinge region to the active site following the presumed conformational change in Chtr in step 2. Full exposure of the RCL when bound to the catalytically active form of Chtr is consistent with the hypothesis that a fully exposed RCL is ideal for binding residues P3–P3′ in the canonical conformation required for productive interaction with a serine proteinase active site (47Skinner R. Abrahams J.P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 48Carrell R.W. Skinner R. Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Thromb.

Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Facile movement of the hinge region of rACT in and out of β-sheet A is also suggested by the contrast between the Wei et al.(18Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 250-257Google Scholar) structure of intact rACT, in which the hinge region is fully exposed, and the difficulty we find in derivatizing T345C-rACT, an indication that, in solution, the P14 residue is at least partially inserted within β-sheet A. In addition, structural and fluorescence spectroscopy studies show that the binding of heparin to antithrombin induces a conformational change that results in the expulsion of an inserted P14 residue into a solvent-exposed position (48Carrell R.W. Skinner R. Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 50Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and model building studies of several intact serpin-proteinase complexes show that it is possible to insert the RCL only as far as P12 while maintaining residues P3–P3′ in the canonical conformation (40Whisstock J. Lesk A.M. Carrell R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 26: 288-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This latter result offers a rationale for the failure of ABD-S348C-rACT, the P11 derivative, to show a change in fluorescence on a time scale appropriate for EIb formation on interaction with Chtr at pH 7, because an ABD group at P11 would be expected to remain exposed on conversion of I to EIb.In contrast to the pH-dependent changes seen with EIa and EIb, the ABD-group in EIcshows a large increase in fluorescence intensity versusE·I over the entire pH range investigated. The magnitude of this change, its relative insensitivity to pH, and the fact that no further fluorescence change is detectable on conversion of EIc to E*I* suggest that it reflects the major insertion of the RCL within β-sheet A that accompanies overall E*I* formation. Thus, contrary to an earlier suggestion (29Lukacs C. Zhong J.Q. Plotnick M. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), RCL insertion appears not to be directly coupled to the inactivation of the Chtr catalytic apparatus, resulting in E*I* formation, because such inactivation would be expected to block the conversion of EIc to tetrahedral intermediate and acyl enzyme.From Which Intermediate Does Partitioning Occur?Earlier (11Nair S.A. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17459-17462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) we presented evidence that in the interaction of rACT with Chtr, partitioning between the inhibitor and substrate pathways, leading to formation of the inhibited complex E*I* or the cleaved inhibitor Is, respectively, proceeds from a common intermediate formed in or following a step that is largely rate-determining. The current result showing that the rate of formation of the minor product, cleaved ABD-E346C-rACT, is essentially the same as the rate of formation of the major product, E*I* (Fig. 3) supports this notion. As step 3 in Scheme III is largely or completely rate-determining for E*I* formation over the whole pH range investigated (Table III), the possible candidates for the partitioning intermediate are EIc and an as yet unobserved intermediate that occurs between EIc and E*I*: e.g. the tetrahedral intermediate, or a putative “active” form of acyl enzyme that either isomerizes to E*I* or hydrolyzes to E and I*. Although we consider the latter possibility most likely, because it preserves the catalytic apparatus necessary for the relatively rapid covalent reactions in E*I* formation (which occur at essentially the same rate as in substrate turnover; see Ref. 11Nair S.A. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17459-17462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a clear challenge for future work will be to convincingly distinguish among these possibilities. α1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) 1The abbreviations used are: ACT, α1-antichymotrypsin; ABD, 7-[4-(aminosulfonyl)-2,1,3,benzoxadiazole]; Chtr, α-chymotrypsin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RCL, reactive center loop; SI, stoichiometry of inhibition; rACT, recombinant ACT; WT, wild type; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ACT, α1-antichymotrypsin; ABD, 7-[4-(aminosulfonyl)-2,1,3,benzoxadiazole]; Chtr, α-chymotrypsin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RCL, reactive center loop; SI, stoichiometry of inhibition; rACT, recombinant ACT; WT, wild type; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

The 5′-nucleases catalyze the exonucleolytic hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds in a variety of nucleic acid substrates, including single-stranded and double-stranded DNA and DNA-RNA hybrids (RNase H activity). In addition, the 5′-nucleases also exhibit structure-specific endonucleolytic activity, resulting in the cleavage of DNA flap and pseudo-Y structures (Fig.1 a) (2Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

To explain substrate processing, a threading mechanism in which the single-stranded 5′ terminus enters the arch has been proposed (9Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D.

The putative active sites of the enzymes are located in front of the holes and contain a number of conserved acidic residues that coordinate two metal ions. Divalent metal ions are an essential co-factor in the reaction. In the crystal structure of T5 exonuclease (Fig. 2) and T4 RNase H, the metal binding sites are separated by distances of 7–8 Å.

However, the FEN-1 enzymes appear to lack similarly conserved basic residues adjacent to the metal binding sites, and it has been suggested that DNA interactions may be mediated in a different way in these enzymes (8Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B.H. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,11Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A tyrosine residue (Tyr-82 in the T5 enzyme, Fig. 2) is also conserved throughout all the eubacterial polymerases and phage 5′-nucleases (13Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 331-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) although, surprisingly, mutation of the corresponding amino acid in T4 RNase H to phenylalanine appears to have little effect on enzyme activity (15Bhagwat M. Meara D. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28531-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this group of enzymes remains unknown although various proposals have been made. A two-metal ion mechanism was proposed by Steitz and co-workers (10Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J.M. Lee D.S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), similar to that of 3′-5′-exonuclease domain of the Klenow fragment (17Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves one metal ion acting as a Lewis acid to generate magnesium-bound hydroxide that attacks the scissile phosphodiester bond. The other metal ion coordinates the 3′-oxygen to activate the leaving group and acts as a Lewis acid coordinating one of the nonbridging oxygens to lower the energy of the penta-coordinate transition state. The structure of 5′-nuclease domain of Taq polymerase contains two magnesium ions and a zinc ion, and the distance between one magnesium and the zinc ion are close to the distance between magnesium ions in 3′-5′-exonuclease domain of the Klenow fragment (10Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J.M. Lee D.S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Although the distance between the metal ions in the four other x-ray structures is variable, in each case it is beyond the typical separation of 4 Å required in two-metal ion mechanisms, appearing to make this mechanistic suggestion less plausible unless gross conformational change accompanies substrate binding (8Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B.H. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 9Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D.

Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanistic proposal is that the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of this group of enzymes may operate via different mechanisms (16Garforth S. Ceska T. Suck D. Sayers J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the exonucleolytic reaction, it has been suggested that a lysine residue located in the active site of the enzyme (Lys-83 in the T5 exonuclease structure) acts as a general base/acid-activating water to attack the scissile bond and protonating the leaving group oxygen (16Garforth S. Ceska T. Suck D. Sayers J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Further biochemical studies are clearly required if the mechanism of this family of enzymes is to be fully elucidated. Insights into enzyme catalysis can be provided by analysis of the pH-rate profiles of enzymatic reactions. Previous studies of T5 5′-3′-exonuclease determined the pH optimum of this enzyme to be 9.3, using a nonstructure-specific spectrophotometric assay based on the release of acid-soluble nucleotides from high molecular weight DNA (6Paul A.V. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3441-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay primarily detects the products of exonucleolytic cleavage. Treatment of the radiolabeled pseudo-Y structure shown in Fig.1 a with T5 5′-3′-exonuclease at pH 9.3 results in the formation of labeled 19-, 21-, and 14-mer oligonucleotide endonucleolytic products along with exonucleolytic products of approximately 3 and 5 nucleotides in length (3Garforth S.J. Sayers J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3801-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the product distribution after exposure of the pseudo-Y structure to enzyme has been quantified (16Garforth S. Ceska T. Suck D. Sayers J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the total amount of products obtained was found to be invariant, high pH favored the formation of exonucleolytic products, whereas lower pH favored the production of endonucleolytic products. The crossover point where the amount of exonucleolytic products first appeared to exceed endonucleolytic products was about pH 7. Recently we reported a single-cleavage assay for T5 5′-3′-exonuclease using a 5′-overhanging hairpin substrate, HP1 (Fig. 1 b), which enabled the catalytic parameters of this enzyme to be determined for the first time (7Pickering T.J. Garforth S.J. Thorpe S.J. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). T5 5′-3′-exonuclease catalyzes the structure-specific endonucleolytic hydrolysis of the 5′-overhanging hairpin substrate HP1 (Fig. 1 b) with a rate enhancement of at least 1015 (7Pickering T.J. Garforth S.J. Thorpe S.J. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To further aid our understanding of the mechanistic features of the T5 5′-3′-exonuclease-catalyzed reaction, we studied the variation of the catalytic parameters of the enzyme and a K83A mutant with pH. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed analysis of the pH-rate profile of any of the 5′-nuclease family. HP1 (d(CGCTGTCGAACACACGCTTGCGTGTGTTC) Fig. 1 b) was synthesized and purified according to Pickering et al. (7Pickering T.J. Garforth S.J. Thorpe S.J. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). K83A was prepared and purified as previously described (3Garforth S.J. Sayers J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3801-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Garforth S. Ceska T. Suck D. Sayers J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The concentration of protein was determined using the assay of Bradford (18Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar). Separate reaction mixtures of appropriate concentrations of 5′-32P-labeled substrate HP1 (Fig. 1 b) in 25 mm buffer, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA were prepared. These reaction mixtures were incubated at 90 °C for 2 min and then allowed to cool to 37 °C. The enzyme stock solution was dissolved in 25 mm buffer, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA and kept on ice until use. The buffers employed to maintain pH were pH 5.6–6.0 MES, pH 6.5–7.0 MOPS, pH 7.0–8.0 HEPES, pH 8.0–8.4 EPPS, pH 9.0–10.00 CHES, pH 9.3 potassium glycinate, and pH 10.5 CAPS. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme (final concentrations: 25 mm buffer, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA) and brief vortexing. The final concentrations of the substrate and enzyme were 0.001–1 μm and 3–30 pm,respectively. The progress of the reactions was followed by taking aliquots at five appropriate time intervals. Individual samples were quenched by immediate addition to 10 μl of denaturing “stop” mix (95% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by phosphoimaging. Initial rates of reaction at the various substrate concentrations were determined. This allowed the kinetic parameters to be calculated by nonlinear regression fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1). All curve fitting was carried out using KaleidaGraph Software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), v[E]=kcat[S]Km+[S](Eq. 1) where v = initial rate, [S] = substrate concentration, and [E] = total enzyme concentration. The pH dependence of (k cat)obs was fitted to a single ionization using Equation 2 (19Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechansim. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 155-175Google Scholar), (kcat)obs=(kcat)0KES1KES1+[H+](Eq. 2) where K ES1 is the acid dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex, (k cat)obs is the turnover number at a given pH, and (k cat)0 is the maximal turnover number of the deprotonated catalytically competent form of the ES complex. The pH dependence of (1/K m)obs was fitted to a single ionization using Equation 3 (19Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechansim. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 155-175Google Scholar), (1Km)obs=(1Km)0{[H+][H+]+(KE1)0}(Eq. 3) where K E1 is an acid dissociation constant of the free enzyme, (1/K m)obsis the association constant of free enzyme and substrate at a given pH, and (1/K m)0 is the maximal association constant for a singly protonated catalytically competent form of the enzyme. The pH dependence of (k cat /K m)obswas fitted to a double ionization using Equation 4 (19Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechansim. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 155-175Google Scholar), (kcatKm)obs=[H+]KE1(kcatKm)0KE1KE2+[H+]KE1+[H+]2(Eq. 4) where K E1 and K E2are acid dissociation constants of the free enzyme, (k cat/K m)obs is the second order rate of reaction at a given pH, and (k cat/K m)0 is the maximal second order rate constant of the singly protonated catalytically competent form of the enzyme. Reactions were carried out as above with a final concentration of 10 μm K83A, 1 nm5′-32P-labeled HP1, 25 mm buffer (pH 7.5–8.0 HEPES, pH 8.4 EPPS, pH 9.0–10.5 CHES), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA. The pseudo first order rate of reaction (k cat/K m) [E] was determined by plotting the percentage of product against time and fitting Equation 5 by nonlinear regression analysis, Percentage product=1001−expkcatKm[E]t(Eq. 5) where [E] = total enzyme concentration. The pH dependence of (k cat/K m)obs was fitted to a single ionization using Equation 6 (19Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechansim. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 155-175Google Scholar), kcatKmobs=kcatKm0KE1KE1+[H+](Eq. 6) where K E1 is the acid dissociation constant of the free enzyme, (k cat/K m)obs is the second order rate of reaction at a given pH, and (k cat/K m)0 is the maximal second order rate constant of the singly deprotonated catalytically competent form of the enzyme. The catalytic parameters, k cat and K m, have been determined for wild type T5 5′-3′-exonuclease at twelve different pH values. The 32P-labeled 29-mer 5′-overhanging hairpin, HP1 (Fig. 1 b), was used as a substrate as it has been previously demonstrated to undergo a single structure-specific enzyme-catalyzed hydrolytic cleavage to generate 8- and 21-mer products (7Pickering T.J. Garforth S.J. Thorpe S.J. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, rates recorded in these experiments refer to hydrolysis of a single phosphodiester bond. The concentration of KCl and MgCl2 employed have previously been determined as optimum for the reaction (6Paul A.V. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3441-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sayers J.R. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18311-18317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At each pH, initial rates of reaction were determined at twelve substrate concentrations ranging from one-fourth- to 10-fold K m. Data were then fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) using nonlinear regression analysis. For each pH studied, at least three independent experiments have been conducted. At several pH values (pH 7.0 MOPS and HEPES, pH 8.0 HEPES and EEPS, and pH 9.3 CHES and potassium glycinate), independent experiments have varied the buffer component. This was undertaken to control for specific buffer effects. No such effects were observed. The pH dependences of the individual kinetic parameters logk cat and log 1/K m are illustrated in Fig. 3, a andb, respectively. The log of the turnover number,k cat, increases with increasing pH until a pH-independent plateau is reached at about pH 9. The slope of the curve between pH 5.5–8.4 is equal to 0.9 ± 0.01 indicating a direct dependence of k cat on the concentration of hydroxide ions in this pH range. The log of association constant of free enzyme and free substrate, 1/K m, is pH-independent in the range pH 5–7, but decreases with increasing pH. The slope of the curve in the region pH 10.5–8.4 is −0.91 ± 0.1, indicating that K m is inversely proportional to hydroxide ion concentration in this pH range. The data shown in Fig. 3,a and b, have been fitted to Equations 2 and 3which are derived from single ionizations shown in Fig. 4, a and b. Equation 2 assumes that two ionization states of the enzyme-substrate complex are possible, a protonated and deprotonated form, but that only the deprotonated form is catalytically competent (Fig. 4 a). Fitting the k cat data (Fig. 3 b) reveals a value of (k cat)0, the rate constant which describes conversion of the deprotonated catalytically competent form of the enzyme-substrate complex to enzyme and products, to be 100 ± 16 min−1, and a pK aof 8.3 ± 0.10 for the enzyme-substrate complex. The R factor for this curve fit is 0.99. Equation 3 assumes that two ionization states of the free enzyme are possible but only a singly protonated form is capable of binding substrate (Fig. 4 b). Fitting the 1/K m data yields a value of (K m)0, the dissociation constant of a protonated catalytically competent form of the enzyme, to be 11 ± 2 nm and a pK a of 8.3 ± 0.14 for the free enzyme. The R factor for this curve fit is 0.96. Thus, association of the enzyme and the DNA substrate depends on the protonation of a group in the free enzyme with a pK aof 8.3, whereas k cat depends on the deprotonation of a group in the enzyme-substrate complex with a pK a of 8.3.Figure 4Kinetic schemes including the possible ionization states of enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex used to derive equations for curve-fitting the pH dependence of the catalytic parameters of wild type and K83A mutant T5 5′-3′-exonuclease. a, the enzyme-substrate complex exists in two ionization states described by the acid dissociation constantK ES1. Only the deprotonated form of the enzyme-substrate complex is catalytically proficient and catalyzes conversion of enzyme-substrate complex to free enzyme and products with a rate constant of (k cat)0. The relationship of observed k cat at a particular pH to the rate and equilibrium constants is described by Equation 2 under “Experimental Procedures.” b, the enzyme exists in two ionization states with an acid dissociation constant ofK E1. Only the protonated form of the enzyme can bind substrate with a maximal dissociation constant for the protonated enzyme-substrate complex of (K m)0. The relationship of observed 1/K m at a particular pH to the equilibrium constants is described by Equation 3 under “Experimental Procedures.” c, the enzyme exists in three ionization states described by the acid dissociation constantsK E1 and K E2. Only the singly protonated form of the enzyme is catalytically competent and promotes the reaction with a maximal second order rate constant of (k cat/K m)0. The relationship of observedk cat/K m at a particular pH to the rate and equilibrium constants is described by Equation 4 under “Experimental Procedures.” d, the mutant enzyme, K83A, exists in only two ionization states with the acid dissociation constants K E1. Only the deprotonated form of the enzyme can undergo the reaction with a maximal second order rate constant of (k cat/K m)0. The relationship of observedk cat/K m at a particular pH to the rate and equilibrium constants is described by Equation 6 under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The pH dependence of log (k cat/K m) is illustrated in Fig. 3 c. The second order rate constant first increases and then decreases with increasing pH, demonstrating that the rate of conversion of free enzyme and substrate to free enzyme and products is dependent on both a deprotonation and protonation event. The bell-shaped curve fits, with an R factor of 0.95, to the double ionization described by Equation 4 derived from the scheme illustrated in Fig. 4 c. Equation 2 is derived by considering that the enzyme is present in three ionization states but that reaction only proceeds when the enzyme is in a singly protonated form and the second order rate constant, which describes the conversion of free enzyme and substrate to free enzyme and products, is (k cat/K m)0 (19Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechansim. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 155-175Google Scholar). One of the acid dissociation constants of the free enzyme (K E1 or K E2) is experimentally determined as pK a 8.3 by the pH dependence of 1/K m, thus K E1was defined during curve fitting. This yields (k cat/K m)0 = (7.8 ± 1.6) × 109m−1min−1 and a second ionization of the free enzyme with a pK a value of 8.4 ± 0.1. DefiningK E2 during curve fitting yields, within experimental error, the same second pK a value of 8.3 ± 0.1. Kinetic parameters of the K83A mutant have been previously determined to be K m= 28 μm and k cat = 9.9 × 10−2 min−1 at pH 9.3 with HP1 as the substrate (7Pickering T.J. Garforth S.J. Thorpe S.J. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The very high K m of this mutant prohibited full analysis of the catalytic parameters at a range of pH values. Instead, rate constants were determined at eight different conditions of pH under pseudo first order reaction conditions whereK m>[E]>[S]. Under these conditions, the normalized first order rate constant is equal tok cat/K m (Equation 5). A plot of the variation of log (k cat/K m) versuspH is shown in Fig. 5 a. In contrast to the pH dependence of the second order rate constant for the wild type enzyme, the data describe a single, rather than a double, ionization. The second order rate constant for K83A increases with pH until a pH-independent plateau is reached. Between pH 7.5 and 8.5, the curve has a slope of 1.01 ± 0.01, indicating thatk cat/K m is directly proportional to hydroxide ion concentration in this pH range. The most notable feature of this data is the strong resemblance to the pH rate profile for k cat for the wild type enzyme as shown in Fig. 5 b. These data have been fitted to a single ionization using Equation 6, which is derived from the scheme illustrated in Fig. 4 d in which the free enzyme exists in two ionization states, but only the deprotonated form is catalytically competent. This yields an optimum (k cat/K m)0 value as (4.0 ± 1.0) × 10−3m−1min−1 and a pK a of 8.7 ± 0.1 for the free K83A mutant enzyme. The data reported here demonstrate that the second order rate constant of the wild type enzyme-catalyzed reaction varies with pH, with two groups titrating, one being protonated the other being deprotonated. The slope of the pH dependence of log (1/K m) and log k cat are both integral, suggesting a discreet ionization of a single functional group, with the former parameter reaching a maximum upon protonation and the later on deprotonation. The residues titrated have pK a value"
