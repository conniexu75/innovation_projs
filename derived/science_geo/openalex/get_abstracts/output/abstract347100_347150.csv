https://openalex.org/W2076655264,"Realizing the extraordinary potential of unactivated sp3 C-H bond oxidation in organic synthesis requires the discovery of catalysts that are both highly reactive and predictably selective. We report an iron (Fe)-based small molecule catalyst that uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to oxidize a broad range of substrates. Predictable selectivity is achieved solely on the basis of the electronic and steric properties of the C-H bonds, without the need for directing groups. Additionally, carboxylate directing groups may be used to furnish five-membered ring lactone products. We demonstrate that these three modes of selectivity enable the predictable oxidation of complex natural products and their derivatives at specific C-H bonds with preparatively useful yields. This type of general and predictable reactivity stands to enable aliphatic C-H oxidation as a method for streamlining complex molecule synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1965852692,"Manipulation of single spins is essential for spin-based quantum information processing. Electrical control instead of magnetic control is particularly appealing for this purpose, because electric fields are easy to generate locally on-chip. We experimentally realized coherent control of a single-electron spin in a quantum dot using an oscillating electric field generated by a local gate. The electric field induced coherent transitions (Rabi oscillations) between spin-up and spin-down with 90° rotations as fast as ∼55 nanoseconds. Our analysis indicated that the electrically induced spin transitions were mediated by the spin-orbit interaction. Taken together with the recently demonstrated coherent exchange of two neighboring spins, our results establish the feasibility of fully electrical manipulation of spin qubits."

This quantity, called first-passage time (FPT), is important because of its role in real situations such as transport in disordered media, neuron firing, spread of diseases and target search processes. Previous methods of determining FPT properties were effectively limited to one-dimensional geometries or to homogeneous media. Condamin et al. have developed a general theory that allows the accurate evaluation of the mean FPT in complex media. The predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of several models of disordered media, fractals, anomalous diffusion and scale-free networks, including a yeast protein interaction network. How long does it take a random walker to reach a given target point? This quantity, known as a first passage time, is important because of its crucial role in various situations such as spreading of diseases or target search processes. This paper develops a general theory that allows the accurate evaluation of the mean first passage time in complex media. The predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of several representative models of disordered media, fractals, anomalous diffusion and scale free networks. How long does it take a random walker to reach a given target point? This quantity, known as a first-passage time (FPT), has led to a growing number of theoretical investigations over the past decade1. The importance of FPTs originates from the crucial role played by first encounter properties in various real situations, including transport in disordered media2,3, neuron firing dynamics4, spreading of diseases5 or target search processes6,7,8,9. Most methods of determining FPT properties in confining domains have been limited to effectively one-dimensional geometries, or to higher spatial dimensions only in homogeneous media1. Here we develop a general theory that allows accurate evaluation of the mean FPT in complex media. Our analytical approach provides a universal scaling dependence of the mean FPT on both the volume of the confining domain and the source–target distance. The analysis is applicable to a broad range of stochastic processes characterized by length-scale-invariant properties. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations for several representative models of disordered media10, fractals3, anomalous diffusion11 and scale-free networks12."

https://openalex.org/W2102100267,"Complex systems in condensed phases involve a multidimensional energy landscape, and knowledge of transitional structures and separation of time scales for atomic movements is critical to understanding their dynamical behavior. Here, we report, using four-dimensional (4D) femtosecond electron diffraction, the visualization of transitional structures from the initial monoclinic to the final tetragonal phase in crystalline vanadium dioxide; the change was initiated by a near-infrared excitation. By revealing the spatiotemporal behavior from all observed Bragg diffractions in 3D, the femtosecond primary vanadium-vanadium bond dilation, the displacements of atoms in picoseconds, and the sound wave shear motion on hundreds of picoseconds were resolved, elucidating the nature of the structural pathways and the nonconcerted mechanism of the transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2120231073,"The limb blastemal cells of an adult salamander regenerate the structures distal to the level of amputation, and the surface protein Prod 1 is a critical determinant of their proximodistal identity. The anterior gradient protein family member nAG is a secreted ligand for Prod 1 and a growth factor for cultured newt blastemal cells. nAG is sequentially expressed after amputation in the regenerating nerve and the wound epidermis—the key tissues of the stem cell niche—and its expression in both locations is abrogated by denervation. The local expression of nAG after electroporation is sufficient to rescue a denervated blastema and regenerate the distal structures. Our analysis brings together the positional identity of the blastema and the classical nerve dependence of limb regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2029217879,"In underdoped high-TC superconducting copper oxides a pseudogap develops well above TC. Whether the pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the superconducting gap above TC is one of the central questions in high- TC research. A direct and unambiguous observation of a single-particle gap tied to the superconducting transition as function of temperature is discovered in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ. The superconducting gap—an energy scale tied to the superconducting phenomena—opens on the Fermi surface at the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in conventional BCS superconductors. In underdoped high-Tc superconducting copper oxides, a pseudogap (whose relation to the superconducting gap remains a mystery) develops well above Tc (refs 1, 2). Whether the pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the superconducting gap above Tc is one of the central questions in high-Tc research3,4,5,6,7,8. Although some experimental evidence suggests that the two gaps are distinct9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, this issue is still under intense debate. A crucial piece of evidence to firmly establish this two-gap picture is still missing: a direct and unambiguous observation of a single-particle gap tied to the superconducting transition as function of temperature. Here we report the discovery of such an energy gap in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ in the momentum space region overlooked in previous measurements. Near the diagonal of Cu–O bond direction (nodal direction), we found a gap that opens at Tc and has a canonical (BCS-like) temperature dependence accompanied by the appearance of the so-called Bogoliubov quasi-particles, a classical signature of superconductivity. This is in sharp contrast to the pseudogap near the Cu–O bond direction (antinodal region) measured in earlier experiments19,20,21."
https://openalex.org/W1968830099,"A full understanding of primate morphological and genomic evolution requires the identification of their closest living relative. In order to resolve the ancestral relationships among primates and their closest relatives, we searched multispecies genome alignments for phylogenetically informative rare genomic changes within the superordinal group Euarchonta, which includes the orders Primates, Dermoptera (colugos), and Scandentia (treeshrews). We also constructed phylogenetic trees from 14 kilobases of nuclear genes for representatives from most major primate lineages, both extant colugos, and multiple treeshrews, including the pentail treeshrew, Ptilocercus lowii , the only living member of the family Ptilocercidae. A relaxed molecular clock analysis including Ptilocercus suggests that treeshrews arose approximately 63 million years ago. Our data show that colugos are the closest living relatives of primates and indicate that their divergence occurred in the Cretaceous."

https://openalex.org/W2145550546,"Thioredoxins are enzymes that catalyse disulphide bond reduction in all living organisms. Although catalysis is thought to proceed through a substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (S(N)2) reaction, the role of the enzyme in modulating this chemical reaction is unknown. Here, using single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy, we investigate the catalytic mechanism of Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx). We applied mechanical force in the range of 25-600 pN to a disulphide bond substrate and monitored the reduction of these bonds by individual enzymes. We detected two alternative forms of the catalytic reaction, the first requiring a reorientation of the substrate disulphide bond, causing a shortening of the substrate polypeptide by 0.79 +/- 0.09 A (+/- s.e.m.), and the second elongating the substrate disulphide bond by 0.17 +/- 0.02 A (+/- s.e.m.). These results support the view that the Trx active site regulates the geometry of the participating sulphur atoms with sub-ångström precision to achieve efficient catalysis. Our results indicate that substrate conformational changes may be important in the regulation of Trx activity under conditions of oxidative stress and mechanical injury, such as those experienced in cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, single-molecule atomic force microscopy techniques, as shown here, can probe dynamic rearrangements within an enzyme's active site during catalysis that cannot be resolved with any other current structural biological technique."
https://openalex.org/W1971474366,"The evolution of insect resistance threatens the effectiveness of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins that are widely used in sprays and transgenic crops. Resistance to Bt toxins in some insects is linked with mutations that disrupt a toxin-binding cadherin protein. We show that susceptibility to the Bt toxin Cry1Ab was reduced by cadherin gene silencing with RNA interference in Manduca sexta , confirming cadherin's role in Bt toxicity. Native Cry1A toxins required cadherin to form oligomers, but modified Cry1A toxins lacking one α-helix did not. The modified toxins killed cadherin-silenced M. sexta and Bt-resistant Pectinophora gossypiella that had cadherin deletion mutations. Our findings suggest that cadherin promotes Bt toxicity by facilitating toxin oligomerization and demonstrate that the modified Bt toxins may be useful against pests resistant to standard Bt toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2140903449,"Background The majority of Staphylococcus aureus isolates that are recovered from either serious infections in humans or from mastitis in cattle represent genetically distinct sets of clonal groups. Moreover, population genetic analyses have provided strong evidence of host specialization among S. aureus clonal groups associated with human and ruminant infection. However, the molecular basis of host specialization in S. aureus is not understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We sequenced the genome of strain ET3-1, a representative isolate of a common bovine mastitis-causing S. aureus clone. Strain ET3-1 encodes several genomic elements that have not been previously identified in S. aureus, including homologs of virulence factors from other Gram-positive pathogens. Relative to the other sequenced S. aureus associated with human infection, allelic variation in ET3-1 was high among virulence and surface-associated genes involved in host colonization, toxin production, iron metabolism, antibiotic resistance, and gene regulation. Interestingly, a number of well-characterized S. aureus virulence factors, including protein A and clumping factor A, exist as pseudogenes in ET3-1. Whole-genome DNA microarray hybridization revealed considerable similarity in the gene content of highly successful S. aureus clones associated with bovine mastitis, but not among those clones that are only infrequently recovered from bovine hosts. Conclusions/Significance Whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analyses revealed a set of molecular genetic features that distinguish clones of highly successful bovine-associated S. aureus optimized for mastitis pathogenesis in cattle from those that infect human hosts or are only infrequently recovered from bovine sources. Further, the results suggest that modern bovine specialist clones diverged from a common ancestor resembling human-associated S. aureus clones through a combination of foreign DNA acquisition and gene decay."

https://openalex.org/W2000821552,"We address the fundamental question of crossover from the localized to the itinerant state of a paradigmatic heavy fermion material: CeIrIn 5 . The temperature evolution of the one-electron spectra and the optical conductivity are predicted from first-principles calculation. The buildup of coherence in the form of a dispersive many-body feature is followed in detail, and its effects on the conduction electrons of the material are revealed. We find multiple hybridization gaps and link them to the crystal structure of the material. Our theoretical approach explains the multiple peak structures observed in optical experiments and the sensitivity of CeIrIn 5 to substitutions of the transition metal element and may provide a microscopic basis for the more phenomenological descriptions currently used to interpret experiments in heavy fermion systems."

https://openalex.org/W1993211626,"Conservation of marine ecosystems will require a holistic understanding of fisheries with concurrent spatial patterns of biodiversity.Using data from the UK Government Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) deployed on UK-registered large fishing vessels we investigate patterns of fisheries activity on annual and seasonal scales. Analysis of VMS data shows that regions of the UK European continental shelf (i.e. Western Channel and Celtic Sea, Northern North Sea and the Goban Spur) receive consistently greater fisheries pressure than the rest of the UK continental shelf fishing zone.VMS provides a unique and independent method from which to derive patterns of spatially and temporally explicit fisheries activity. Such information may feed into ecosystem management plans seeking to achieve sustainable fisheries while minimising putative risk to non-target species (e.g. cetaceans, seabirds and elasmobranchs) and habitats of conservation concern. With multilateral collaboration VMS technologies may offer an important solution to quantifying and managing ecosystem disturbance, particularly on the high-seas."
https://openalex.org/W1974336070,"The equatorial Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) is enigmatic and perhaps among the youngest geologic deposits on Mars. They are thought to be composed of volcanic ash, eolian sediments, or an ice-rich material analogous to polar layered deposits. The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) instrument aboard the Mars Express Spacecraft has detected nadir echoes offset in time-delay from the surface return in orbits over MFF material. These echoes are interpreted to be from the subsurface interface between the MFF material and the underlying terrain. The delay time between the MFF surface and subsurface echoes is consistent with massive deposits emplaced on generally planar lowlands materials with a real dielectric constant of approximately 2.9 +/- 0.4. The real dielectric constant and the estimated dielectric losses are consistent with a substantial component of water ice. However, an anomalously low-density, ice-poor material cannot be ruled out. If ice-rich, the MFF must have a higher percentage of dust and sand than polar layered deposits. The volume of water in an ice-rich MFF deposit would be comparable to that of the south polar layered deposits."

For this report, we analyzed the function of Mim1 and surprisingly found that Mim1 is required for the assembly pathway of the signal-anchored receptors. Mim1 promotes insertion of the precursors of Tom20 and Tom70 into the outer membrane while tail-anchored Tom22 does not require Mim1. Mim1 associates with a fraction of SAMcore complexes to a larger SAM complex, explaining its function in the assembly pathway of both Tom40 and signal-anchored receptors.

The mim1Δ strain was isolated by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid, ensuring loss of the MIM1 containing URA3 plasmid, and maintained on non-fermentable glycerol medium. The strain ProtA-Mim1 (background BY4741, N-terminal protein A tag fused to Mim1) was generated by homologous recombination utilizing a PCR product from an affinity tag replacement cassette (29Kozjak V.

Yeast cells lacking Mim1 were grown at 20 °C in YPG medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone and 3% (w/v) glycerol). Yeast cells expressing protein A-tagged Mim1 were grown at 24 °C in YPS medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, and 2% (w/v) sucrose). The isolation of mitochondria was performed by differential centrifugation (50Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Truscott K.N. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of mitochondria, adjusted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) were stored in aliquots at –80 °C. In Vitro Protein Import—PCR-based constructs for in vitro translation were transcribed using SP6 polymerase (Ambion). Radiolabeled proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (GE Healthcare) (51Stojanovski D. Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Meth. Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 783-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Import into isolated mitochondria was started by addition of the translation product (5–10% (v/v) reticulocyte lysate in the total import reaction) and performed in BSA buffer (3% (w/v) fatty acid free BSA, 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm methionine, 2 mm KH2PO4) in the presence of 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 mm creatine phosphate. After the indicated time points, the import of precursor proteins was stopped by transfer on ice. The import of precursor proteins destined for the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix was stopped by addition of 1 μm valinomycin to dissipate the membrane potential. In control reactions, 1 μm valinomycin was added before the import reaction. Mitochondria were re-isolated and washed with SEM buffer. Samples to be treated for alkaline extraction were incubated with freshly prepared 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) for 30 min on ice (51Stojanovski D. Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Meth.

Blue Native Electrophoresis—Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in ice-cold digitonin-containing buffer (0.5–1.5% (w/v) digitonin, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol) to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated for 15 min on ice (13Meisinger C.

Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and 1 volume of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 100 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 500 mm ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid) was added to nine volumes of supernatant. Samples were separated on a 4–16% polyacrylamide gradient gel at 4 °C. The mobility of molecular weight markers was determined on parallel lanes under identical conditions. The radiolabeled proteins were detected by digital autoradiography. Antibody shift blue native electrophoresis was performed as described (51Stojanovski D. Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Meth. Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 783-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purification of Protein Complexes—Mitochondria isolated from yeast cells expressing Mim1 fused to an N-terminal protein A tag were solubilized in digitonin buffer, including 1% digitonin and 250 mm NaCl, to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml for 15 min on ice. After a clarifying spin (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was incubated with pre-equilibrated IgG-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the column material was washed with an excess volume of digitonin buffer, including 0.1% digitonin and 250 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted by incubation with TEV-protease for 12 h at 4 °C. For purification of protein complexes via Mdm10-His tag, mitochondria were solubilized in digitonin buffer, including 1% digitonin and 250 mm NaCl, at a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml for 15 min on ice. After a clarifying spin (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was incubated with pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4°C. Subsequently, the column material was washed in two steps with an excess volume of digitonin buffer, including 0.1% digitonin, 250 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole in the first step and 40 mm imidazole in the second washing step. Bound proteins were eluted by incubation by digitonin buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Miscellaneous—Western transfers were performed onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunodecoration was performed according to standard techniques. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection (GE Healthcare). Antibodies against Mim1 were raised against a peptide covering the C-terminal 18 residues of Mim1. Yeast Cells Lacking Mim1 Have Reduced Levels of TOM Complex but Retain the Respiratory Chain—We developed a mild procedure to delete the MIM1 gene in yeast. The reason is that so far the function of Mim1 in assembly of mitochondrial proteins has been studied by the use of galactose-inducible promoters to deplete the levels of Mim1 after shift of the cells to galactose-free medium (32Ishikawa D. Yamamoto H. Tamura Y. Moritoh K. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Waizenegger T. Schmitt S. Zivkovic J. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As the gene for Mim1 is still retained under these conditions, it is possible that residual Mim1 is left in the analysis. Ishikawa et al. (32Ishikawa D. Yamamoto H. Tamura Y. Moritoh K. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) obtained yeast cells lacking MIM1 by a sporulation approach, however, the cells became respiratory-deficient. Since a loss of mtDNA can frequently happen as a secondary effect during handling of yeast mutants of mitochondrial proteins (54Contamine V. Picard M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 281-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 55Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Guiard B. Rissler M. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. van der Laan M. Lohaus C. Marcus K. Meyer H.E. Chazinska A.

Biol. 2005; 351: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and in consequence leads to many pleiotropic defects of mitochondria, we used mild conditions to delete the chromosomal copy of MIM1 while the wild-type protein was still expressed from a plasmid. Subsequently the plasmid was removed and we obtained mim1Δ cells that were respiratory-competent. The mutant cells stopped growth at elevated temperature (37 °C) on non-fermentable medium (Fig. 1A). To minimize potential indirect effects in the mim1Δ strain, the cells were grown at low temperature (20 °C) and mitochondria were isolated. Previous studies with deletion mutants of components of the β-barrel assembly pathway (Sam37, Mdm10, Mdm12, and Mmm1) showed that growth of the mutant cells at low temperature only moderately affected the steady-state levels of critical import components and thus prevented indirect inhibitory effects on the different mitochondrial sorting pathways, but allowed a specific functional analysis by monitoring the kinetics of assembly with radiolabeled precursor proteins (25Wiedemann N.

The levels of Tom40, Tom20, and Tom70 were moderately reduced in mim1Δ mitochondria while the levels of Tom22, Tom5, and the controls proteins Tim23 of the translocase of the inner membrane and the matrix heat shock protein Hsp60 were similar to that of wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 1B). We used blue native electrophoresis to analyze protein complexes upon lysis of mitochondria with digitonin. The mature TOM complex forms a complex of ∼450 kDa that was present in reduced amount in mim1Δ mitochondria whereas porin (56Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K.

The respiratory chain of S. cerevisiae mitochondria contains two proton-pumping complexes, the bc1-complex (complex III) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), that assemble into supercomplexes (57Schägger H.

As several subunits of these complexes are encoded by mtDNA, a lack of mtDNA would lead to a loss of the supercomplexes. mim1Δ mitochondria contained the supercomplexes in the same amount as wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8) in line with the respiratory competence of the cells.

Further, cnidarian jellyfish comprise an important component of modern marine planktonic ecosystems. Here we report on exceptionally preserved cnidarian jellyfish fossils from the Middle Cambrian (approximately 505 million years old) Marjum Formation of Utah. These are the first described Cambrian jellyfish fossils to display exquisite preservation of soft part anatomy including detailed features of structures interpreted as trailing tentacles and subumbrellar and exumbrellar surfaces. If the interpretation of these preserved characters is correct, their presence is diagnostic of modern jellyfish taxa. These new discoveries may provide insight into the scope of cnidarian diversity shortly after the Cambrian radiation, and would reinforce the notion that important taxonomic components of the modern planktonic realm were in place by the Cambrian period."

Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that changing the mass of the terminating atoms on a surface, and thus their vibrational frequencies, affects nanoscale friction substantially. We compared hydrogen- and deuterium-terminated single-crystal diamond and silicon surfaces, and in all cases the hydrogenated surface exhibited higher friction. This result implies that the lower natural frequency of chemisorbed deuterium reduces the rate at which the tip's kinetic energy is dissipated. This discovery is consistent with a model describing energy transfer to adsorbates from a moving surface."
https://openalex.org/W2135860653,"Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1) is a major redox regulator in mammalian cells. As an important antioxidant selenoprotein, TR1 is thought to participate in cancer prevention, but is also known to be over-expressed in many cancer cells. Numerous cancer drugs inhibit TR1, and this protein has been proposed as a target for cancer therapy. We previously reported that reduction of TR1 levels in cancer cells reversed many malignant characteristics suggesting that deficiency in TR1 function is antitumorigenic. The molecular basis for TR1's role in cancer development, however, is not understood. Herein, we found that, among selenoproteins, TR1 is uniquely overexpressed in cancer cells and its knockdown in a mouse cancer cell line driven by oncogenic k-ras resulted in morphological changes characteristic of parental (normal) cells, without significant effect on cell growth under normal growth conditions. When grown in serum-deficient medium, TR1 deficient cancer cells lose self-sufficiency of growth, manifest a defective progression in their S phase and a decreased expression of DNA polymerase α, an enzyme important in DNA replication. These observations provide evidence that TR1 is critical for self-sufficiency in growth signals of malignant cells, that TR1 acts largely as a pro-cancer protein and it is indeed a primary target in cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2059845506,"CXCL12alpha, a chemokine that importantly promotes the oriented cell migration and tissue homing of many cell types, regulates key homeostatic functions and pathological processes through interactions with its cognate receptor (CXCR4) and heparan sulfate (HS). The alternative splicing of the cxcl12 gene generates a recently identified isoform, CXCL12gamma, which structure/function relationships remain unexplored. The high occurrence of basic residues that characterize this isoform suggests however that it could feature specific regulation by HS.Using surface plasmon resonance and NMR spectroscopy, as well as chemically and recombinantly produced chemokines, we show here that CXCL12gamma first 68 amino acids adopt a structure closely related to the well described alpha isoform, followed by an unfolded C-terminal extension of 30 amino acids. Remarkably, 60% of these residues are either lysine or arginine, and most of them are clustered in typical HS binding sites. This provides the chemokine with the highest affinity for HP ever observed (Kd = 0.9 nM), and ensures a strong retention of the chemokine at the cell surface. This was due to the unique combination of two cooperative binding sites, one strictly required, found in the structured domain of the protein, the other one being the C-terminus which essentially functions by enhancing the half life of the complexes. Importantly, this peculiar C-terminus also regulates the balance between HS and CXCR4 binding, and consequently the biological activity of the chemokine.Together these data describe an unusual binding process that gives rise to an unprecedented high affinity between a chemokine and HS. This shows that the gamma isoform of CXCL12, which features unique structural and functional properties, is optimized to ensure its strong retention at the cell surface. Thus, depending on the chemokine isoform to which it binds, HS could differentially orchestrate the CXCL12 mediated directional cell kinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2033441651,"Developing T cells encounter peripheral self-antigens in the thymus in order to delete autoreactive clones. It is now known that the autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE), which is expressed in thymic medullary epithelial cells, plays a key role in regulating the thymic transcription of these peripheral tissue-specific antigens. Mutations in the AIRE gene are associated with a severe multiorgan autoimmune syndrome (APECED), and autoimmune reactivities are manifest in AIRE-deficient mice. Functional AIRE protein is expressed as distinct nuclear puncta, although no structural basis existed to explain their relevance to disease. In addressing the cell biologic basis for APECED, we made the unexpected discovery that an AIRE mutation hot spot lies in a caspase recruitment domain. Combined homology modeling and in vitro data now show how APECED mutations influence the activity of this transcriptional regulator. We also provide novel in vivo evidence for AIRE's association with a global transcription cofactor, which may underlie AIRE's focal, genome-wide, alteration of the transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2046307995,"Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a virulence factor secreted by Bacillus anthracis, is selectively toxic to human melanomas with the BRAF V600E activating mutation because of its proteolytic activities toward the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEKs). To develop LT variants with lower in vivo toxicity and high tumor specificity, and therefore greater potential for clinical use, we generated a mutated LT that requires activation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This engineered toxin was less toxic than wild-type LT to mice because of the limited expression of MMPs by normal cells. Moreover, the systemically administered toxin produced greater anti-tumor effects than wild-type LT toward human xenografted tumors. This was shown to result from its greater bioavailability, a consequence of the limited uptake and clearance of the modified toxin by normal cells. Furthermore, the MMP-activated LT had very potent anti-tumor activity not only to human melanomas containing the BRAF mutation but also to other tumor types, including lung and colon carcinomas regardless of their BRAF status. Tumor histology and in vivo angiogenesis assays showed that this anti-tumor activity is due largely to the indirect targeting of tumor vasculature and angiogenic processes. Thus, even tumors genetically deficient in anthrax toxin receptors were still susceptible to the toxin therapy in vivo. Moreover, the modified toxin also displayed lower immunogenicity compared with the wild-type toxin. All these properties suggest that this MMP-activated anti-tumor toxin has potential for use in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2073937912,"Rat heme-binding protein 23 (HBP23)/peroxiredoxin (Prx I) belongs to the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin type I family and exhibits peroxidase activity coupled with reduced thioredoxin (Trx) as an electron donor. We analyzed the dimer-oligomer interconversion of wild-type and mutant HBP23/Prx I by gel filtration and found that the C52S and C173S mutants existed mostly as decamers, whereas the wild type was a mixture of various forms, favoring the decamer at higher protein concentration and lower ionic salt concentration and in the presence of dithiothreitol. The C83S mutant was predominantly dimeric, in agreement with a previous crystallographic analysis (Hirotsu, S., Abe, Y., Okada, K., Nagahara, N., Hori, H., Nishino, T., and Hakoshima, T. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 12333–12338). X-ray diffraction analysis of the decameric C52S mutant revealed a toroidal structure (diameter, ∼130Å; inside diameter, ∼55Å; thickness, ∼45Å). In contrast to human Prx I, which was recently reported to exist predominantly as the decamer with Cys83-Cys83 disulfide bonds at all dimer-dimer interfaces, rat HBP23/Prx I has a Cys83-Cys83 disulfide bond at only one dimer-dimer interface (S–S separation of ∼2.1Å), whereas the interactions at the other interfaces (mean S–S separation of 3.6Å) appear to involve hydrophobic and van der Waals forces. This finding is consistent with gel filtration analyses showing that the protein readily interconverts between dimer and oligomeric forms. The C83S mutant exhibited similar peroxidase activity to the wild type, which is exclusively dimeric, in the Trx/Trx reductase system. At higher concentrations, where the protein was mostly decameric, less efficient attack of reduced Trx was observed in a [14C]iodoacetamide incorporation experiment. We suggest that the dimerdecamer interconversion may have a regulatory role. Rat heme-binding protein 23 (HBP23)/peroxiredoxin (Prx I) belongs to the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin type I family and exhibits peroxidase activity coupled with reduced thioredoxin (Trx) as an electron donor. We analyzed the dimer-oligomer interconversion of wild-type and mutant HBP23/Prx I by gel filtration and found that the C52S and C173S mutants existed mostly as decamers, whereas the wild type was a mixture of various forms, favoring the decamer at higher protein concentration and lower ionic salt concentration and in the presence of dithiothreitol. The C83S mutant was predominantly dimeric, in agreement with a previous crystallographic analysis (Hirotsu, S., Abe, Y., Okada, K., Nagahara, N., Hori, H., Nishino, T., and Hakoshima, T. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 12333–12338). X-ray diffraction analysis of the decameric C52S mutant revealed a toroidal structure (diameter, ∼130Å; inside diameter, ∼55Å; thickness, ∼45Å). In contrast to human Prx I, which was recently reported to exist predominantly as the decamer with Cys83-Cys83 disulfide bonds at all dimer-dimer interfaces, rat HBP23/Prx I has a Cys83-Cys83 disulfide bond at only one dimer-dimer interface (S–S separation of ∼2.1Å), whereas the interactions at the other interfaces (mean S–S separation of 3.6Å) appear to involve hydrophobic and van der Waals forces. This finding is consistent with gel filtration analyses showing that the protein readily interconverts between dimer and oligomeric forms. The C83S mutant exhibited similar peroxidase activity to the wild type, which is exclusively dimeric, in the Trx/Trx reductase system. At higher concentrations, where the protein was mostly decameric, less efficient attack of reduced Trx was observed in a [14C]iodoacetamide incorporation experiment. We suggest that the dimerdecamer interconversion may have a regulatory role.

The 2-Cys Prxs exhibit thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent peroxidase activity, reducing hydrogen peroxide, peroxinitrite, and organic peroxides to water, nitrite, and the corresponding alcohols, respectively. During the reaction cycle, the active site Cys52 of the homodimeric form (the minimal catalytic unit) is oxidized to an intermediate sulfenic acid (Cys52-SOH) and regenerated by Trx with the assistance of Cys173 from another subunit. We previously reported the crystal structure of the oxidized dimeric form of the rat HBP23/Prx I C83S mutant (PDB entry 1QQ2), in which the active site Cys52 forms a disulfide bridge with Cys173 from another subunit by C-terminal swapping in the dimer (24Hirotsu S.

In the intermolecularly disulfide-bridged form, Cys52 is completely buried and Cys173 is partially exposed to the solvent region, suggesting that reduced Trx attacks Cys173 in the reductive half-reaction. When compared with the decameric structures of reduced bacterial and overoxidized human Prx II enzymes, a significant conformational change in the vicinity of the active site region appears to be required for interaction with the Trx molecule to generate Trx-dependent peroxidase activity (24Hirotsu S.

In the reduced form, Cys52 forms a salt bridge with the conserved Arg128, and the distance from Cys52 to Cys173 is ∼13 Å. In the oxidized dimeric structure, however, Cys52 is separated from Arg128 by about 7.4 Å (24Hirotsu S. Abe Y. Okada K. Nagahara N. Hori H. Nishino T. Hakoshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the basis of biological and structural findings with Trx, it has been suggested that a mixed disulfide bond between Trx Cys33 and Prx Cys173, formed during the catalysis, is attacked by Trx Cys36, generating reduced Prx and oxidized Trx (numbering in Escherichia coli, Refs. 29Holmgren A.

Trx, which is a small protein (molecular mass ∼12 kDa), plays an important role in cellular processes via redox regulation by undergoing reversible oxidation/reduction reaction of two cysteine residues, Cys33 and Cys36. The 2-Cys Prxs are abundantly expressed in mammalian cells, and their content is estimated to be >20-fold higher than that of Trx (1Iwahara S. Satoh H. Song D.X. Webb J. Burlingame A.L. Nagae Y.

It seems reasonable to suppose that the interaction between Prx and Trx is in part regulated through their quaternary structures. Oligomers larger than the dimer have been observed in solution for 2-Cys Prxs from bacteria, plants, and humans (27Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A.

Redox state, protein concentration, pH, and ionic strength are reported to influence the oligomeric state but differ in their effects upon different 2-Cys Prxs. Furthermore, the state of amino acid residues at the dimer-dimer interface also influences oligomerization and peroxidase activity (20Jang H.H. Kim S.Y. Park S.K. Jeon H.S. Lee Y.M. Jung J.H.

Further, human Prx I and Prx II have distinct quaternary structures; Prx I was recently reported to exist predominantly as the decamer with a Cys83-Cys83 disulfide bridge at the dimer-dimer interface, whereas Prx II exists as a dimer, because the corresponding Cys residue is replaced with Thr in Prx II (40Lee W. Choi K.S. Riddell J. Ip C. Ghosh D. Park J.H. Park Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22011-22022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Based on this feature, it was proposed that the function of Prx I is distinct from that of Prx II. Here, to address the relationship between the oligomeric properties and peroxidase activity of mammalian 2-Cys Prx, we prepared HBP23/Prx I variants by using site-directed mutagenesis, and we also performed an x-ray structure analysis of decameric Prx I. In contrast to the recently reported result for human Prx I (40Lee W. Choi K.S. Riddell J. Ip C. Ghosh D. Park J.H. Park Y.M. J. Biol.

Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The coding region of HBP23/Prx I was amplified by PCR using the forward primer, 5′-AGC CAT ATG TCT TCA GGA AAT GCA A-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TCG GAT CCT CAC TTC TGC TTA GAG AAA TAC TC-3′. The PCR product was digested with NdeI/BamHI and cloned into the corresponding site of pET3c vector. This expression vector was named pET3c-HBP23. Mutants of HBP23/Prx I were prepared at Cys52, Cys83, Cys173, Arg128, and Arg151, which were replaced with Ser, Lys, Ala, Glu, and Asp, respectively, using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the site-directed mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The E. coli strain BL21/DE3 was transformed with pET3c-HBP23 for overexpression of HBP23/Prx I and cultured as described previously (41Hirotsu S. Abe Y. Nagahara N. Hori H. Nishino T. Okada K. Hakaoshima T. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Each HBP23/Prx I recombinant protein was purified by the methods described previously (41Hirotsu S. Abe Y. Nagahara N. Hori H. Nishino T. Okada K. Hakaoshima T. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Trx gene of E. coli (E-TrxA) was prepared from pTrx plasmid (Invitrogen). The NedI/SalI DNA fragment from pTrx was cloned into pET30a or pET28a and designated pET30-ETrxA or pET28-HisETrxA, respectively. pET30-ETrxA plasmid is the expression vector for the wild-type Trx, and pET28-HisETrxA is the expression vector for modified Trx containing a His tag sequence (six histidine residues) at the N-terminal region. Site-directed mutation of E-TrxA, changing Cys33 or Cys36 to Ser, was carried out using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the variant genes for Trx and His-tagged Trx were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The E. coli strain BL21/DE3 was transformed with pET30-ETrxA or pET28-HisETrxA, cultured in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.7 at 600 nm, and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h before being harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (buffer A) and disrupted by sonication. The soluble fraction recovered by centrifugation was treated at 65 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and applied to a DE-52 ion-exchange column (2.5 × 5.0 cm). Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl. His-tagged Trx was purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate column according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The Trx reductase (TrxR) gene was prepared from genomic DNA of E. coli strain JM109 by PCR (DNA Data Bank in Japan/European Molecular Biology Laboratory (DDBJ/EMBL) accession number J03762). The primers using for PCR were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GGG ATC CCA TGG CAG CAC CAA ACA C-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACC CAT AGT CGC ATG GTG TC-3′. The PCR fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC119 vector, and the cloned gene was sequenced. The direction of the TrxR gene was the same as that of the lacZ gene of pUC119, and the plasmid was designated pUC-TrxR. The E. coli strain JM109 was transformed with pUC-TrxR, and the transformant constitutively overproduced the Trx reductase protein. To prepare Trx reductase, the transformant was cultured in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 12–18 h. The cell pellets were suspended in buffer A and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate (40–80% saturation). After dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the fraction was applied to a DE-52 ion-exchange column (2.5 × 5.0 cm), and proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl. Fractions containing the protein were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column (0.6 × 7.5 cm). Trx reductase was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH, 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 10 mm NADP. Examination of Coomassie Blue-stained bands after gel electrophoresis indicated that each isolated recombinant protein was >90% pure. The concentration of purified proteins, HBP23/PrxI, Trx, and Trx reductase, was determined with a Coomassie® Blue protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Determination of Peroxidase Activity—The peroxidase activity was measured with two systems, the Trx- and DTT-based systems (42Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

The peroxidase activity in the presence of Trx was assayed in 0.7 ml of reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 60 μg of Trx, 2 μg of Trx reductase, 0.1 mm H2O2, 150 μm NADPH, and the appropriate amount of HBP23/PrxI at 25 °C. Reaction was initiated by the addition of H2O2, and consumption of NADPH was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The peroxidase activity in the presence of DTT was assayed as described previously, with a slight modification. The reaction mixture (0.7 ml) contained 150 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 50 mm DTT, 30 mmt-butyl hydroperoxide and the appropriate amount of HBP23/PrxI at 25 °C. The activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 310 nm. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size-exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) with a Sephacryl S-200 column. Ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa) were used as molecular mass standard markers for calibration of the column. Elution of liver extract or molecular mass standards was monitored at 280 nm. Absorbance at 280 nm was measured with a Hitachi U-3200 spectrophotometer to monitor elution of protein from the column. Protein-containing fractions of liver extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% gel) according to the method of Laemmli (44Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Antibody against HBP23/Prx I was prepared as described previously (45Abe Y. Okazaki T. Arch. Biochem.

[14C]IAA Labeling of Sulfhydryl Groups of HBP23/Prx I in the Presence of Trx for Determination of Reductive Reaction of Cysteine Disulfide Bond by Reduced Trx—HBP23/Prx I wild type and the C83S mutant were incubated for 30 min on ice with sufficient iodoacetamide (IAA) to alkylate free cysteine residues and then passed through a NAP™ column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reaction mixture (0.2 ml), containing the indicated amounts of the treated HBP23/Prx I and reduced Trx in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 4 μl of 4 mm IAA, 0.2 μCi of [14C]IAA, was incubated for various periods on ice. The reaction was initiated by the addition of reduced Trx. At the indicated times, an aliquot (20 μl) was removed, the reaction was immediately stopped by adding 50 mm cysteine, and the mixture was separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The incorporation of [14C]IAA into protein was estimated by using a BAS 2000 instrument. X-ray Crystallography of HBP23/Prx I—The C52S mutant was crystallized by the hanging drop method at 20 °C by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution (5 mg/ml in 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm CHAPS) with 2 μl of reservoir solution (0.17 m ammonium acetate, 20% glycerol, 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 84 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0). Plate crystals appeared within 2 or 3 days and grew to their full size in 2 weeks. The crystals were soaked with a precipitant solution containing 30% glycerol and then plunged into liquid nitrogen. The data set was collected at the BL-5 beamline of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) using a Quantum 315 area detector. The data set was obtained at 2.9 Å resolution. The data were processed and scaled with HKL2000. Molecular replacement was performed with EPMR using the coordinates of the crystal structure of human decameric 2-Cys Prx II purified from erythrocytes (Protein Data Bank entry 1QMV; Ref. 22Jeong W.

Molecular Mass of HBP23/PrxI—Although we previously determined the crystal structure of the C83S mutant of rat liver HBP23/Prx I as a dimer (PDB entry 1QQ2), oligomerized forms other than the dimer are observed in solution for many 2-Cys Prxs from bacteria, plants, and humans (27Wood Z.A.

To examine the molecular species of HBP23/Prx I in rat liver, the homogenate was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting showed that protein was eluted in at least two different positions. Comparison with molecular mass standards showed that HBP23/Prx I in the 20% homogenate was predominantly eluted at the position of molecular mass 44 kDa, but HBP23/Prx I in the 33% homogenate was also eluted at the position of molecular mass 230 kDa, thus being present as both dimer and decamer. HBP23/Prx I seems to form dimeric and decameric structures depending on the protein concentration or ionic strength, similarly to other 2-Cys Prxs. Therefore, we further studied the quaternary structure of the recombinant HBP23/Prx I by means of chromatographic analysis under various conditions of protein concentration/ionic strength, as well as in the absence or presence of DTT. When 0.5 mg of freshly purified wild-type protein (1 ml) was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column at 0.2 m NaCl, the elution profile was more complex in the absence of DTT than in its presence (Fig. 2). In the absence of DTT, the wild-type protein tended to form the decamer at high protein concentration, but the decamer tended to dissociate into tetramer or dimer as the solution was diluted (Fig. 2, A and C) or when the ionic strength was increas"
https://openalex.org/W2063245036,"Background Annexin A2 is a peripheral membrane protein that belongs to the annexin family of Ca2+ and phospholipid-binding proteins. This protein, which plays a role in membrane organization and dynamics in particular along the endocytic pathway, exists as a heterotetrameric complex, consisting of two annexin A2 molecules bound via their N-termini to a dimer of p11/S100A10 light chains. The light chain, and thus presumably formation of the heterotetramer, was reported to control annexin A2 association to the plasma membrane and to cortical actin, as well as the distribution of recycling endosomes. However, the specific role of the light chain and the functions of monomeric versus heterotetrameric annexin A2 have remained elusive in the endocytic pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we have investigated whether p11 plays a role in the endosomal functions of annexin A2. Using morphological and biochemical approaches, we found that p11, unlike annexin A2, was not present on early endosomes. Neither was the heterotetramer detected on purified early endosomes, while it was clearly present in total cell lysates. Moreover, knockdown of p11 with siRNAs did not affect annexin A2 targeting to early endosomes, and, conversely, binding of annexin A2 to purified endosomes or liposomes occurred without p11 in vitro. Finally, while we could confirm that annexin A2 knockdown inhibits transport beyond early endosomes, p11 knockdown had no such effects on early-to-late endosome transport. Conclusions/Significance Our data show that the binding of annexin A2 to endosomal membranes and its role in endosomal trafficking are independent of the p11/S100A10 light chain. We thus conclude that annexin A2 functions are fully supported by the monomeric form of the protein, at least the endocytic pathway leading to lysosomes."

It is recruited to the 40 S subunit in a multifactor complex with Met-tRNAiMet, eIF2, eIF3, and eIF5 and binds near the P-site. eIF1 release in response to start codon recognition is an important signal to produce an 80 S initiation complex. Although the ribosome-binding face of eIF1 was identified, interfaces to other preinitiation complex components and their relevance to eIF1 function have not been determined. Exploiting the solution structure of yeast eIF1, here we locate the binding site for eIF5 in its N-terminal tail and at a basic/hydrophobic surface area termed KH, distinct from the ribosome-binding face. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the eIF1 N-terminal tail plays a stimulatory role in cooperative multifactor assembly. A mutation altering the basic part of eIF1-KH is lethal and shows a dominant phenotype indicating relaxed start codon selection. Cheung et al. recently demonstrated that the alteration of hydrophobic residues of eIF1 disrupts a critical link to the preinitiation complex that suppresses eIF1 release before start codon selection (Cheung, Y.-N., Maag, D., Mitchell, S.

Interestingly, eIF1-KH includes the altered hydrophobic residues. Thus, eIF5 is an excellent candidate for the direct partner of eIF1-KH that mediates the critical link.

They assist binding of Met-tRNAiMet and 5′-capped mRNA to the 40 S subunit to form 43 S and 48 S preinitiation complexes, respectively (for a review, see Refs. 1Pestova T.V. Lorsch J.R. Hellen C.U.T.

The 43 S complex contains eIF1A, eIF1, eIF5, eIF3, and the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex (TC). The eIF4E subunit of eIF4F binds the 5′ cap of mRNA, whereas its eIF4G subunit binds eIF3 in mammals and eIF5 in yeast to recruit the latter factors to the mRNA. The RNA helicase eIF4A and its cofactor eIF4B are required for unwinding the 5′-terminal region of the capped mRNA. The resulting preinitiation complex termed 48 S is believed to undergo the scanning process to position the preinitiation complex onto the first AUG codon of the mRNA.Prior to AUG recognition, GTP bound to eIF2 appears to be hydrolyzed by the action of the N-terminal residues of eIF5 through a mechanism stimulated by 48 S complex formation. Upon Met-tRNAiMet anticodon pairing with the start codon, the Pi resulting from the GTP hydrolysis is released (3Algire M.A. Maag D. Lorsch J.R. Mol.

The GTPase switch eIF5B promotes joining of the resulting 40 S initiation complex with the 60 S subunit to produce the 80 S initiation complex, an immediate precursor for protein synthesis elongation. The GDP-bound eIF2 is recycled to eIF2·GTP by the action of the pentameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B.eIF1, encoded by SUI1 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plays a central role in ensuring the fidelity of translation initiation by destabilizing ribosomal complexes assembled on non-cognate and poorly contexted start codons (6Pestova T.V.

Yeast eIF1 binds concurrently to eIF5-CTD as well as to the eIF2β and eIF3c subunits, thereby being recruited to the 40 S subunit in the multifactor complex (MFC) formed with eIF2 TC, eIF3, and eIF5 (8Asano K.

Except for the small eIF1 (12 kDa), minimal binding domains of yeast MFC constituents were identified to be eIF2β-(1-140), eIF3c-(1-156), and eIF5-(241-405) (8Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, eIF2β-(1-140) and eIF3c-(1-156) are charged hydrophilic polypeptides. eIF2β-(1-140) regulates the affinity of eIF5-CTD-(241-405) for eIF3c-(1-156), thereby promoting MFC assembly (11Singh C.R.

Wagner G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl-radical footprinting studies identified a surface of its globular core as facing the rRNA helix 24 close to but separated from the P-site (16Lomakin I.B. Kolupaeva V.G. Marintchev A. Wagner G. Pestova T.V. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2786-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). N-terminal FLAG tagging of yeast eIF1 impairs its interaction with eIF2β and eIF5 and reduces TC binding to the ribosome in vivo, suggesting that the eIF1-NTT is important for MFC formation. Chueng et al. (17Cheung Y.-N. Maag D. Mitchell S.F. Fekete C.A. Algire M.A. Takacs J.E. Shirokikh N. Pestova T. Lorsch J.R. Hinnebusch A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) recently confirmed this idea by finding that the alteration of Phe9 and Phe12 residues of eIF1-NTT to alanines impairs partial 43 S complex assembly in vitro. However, the direct physical evidence that eIF1-NTT binds eIF5 or eIF2β has been lacking. Here we report the solution structure of yeast eIF1 and its binding sites for eIF5-(241-405) as determined with NMR spectroscopy. These studies identify NTT and a basic/hydrophobic surface of the globular core termed KH as binding sites for eIF5-CTD. Remarkably, the above mentioned report by Cheung et al. (17Cheung Y.-N.

To create the SUI1-M5 mutant segment, oligonucleotides eIF1-Nde and eIF1-M5-RV were used for PCR.To create YCpL-SUI1-M4, we first produced two DNA fragments from separate PCR, one using oligonucleotides eIF1-Nde and eIF1-M4-RV and the other using eIF1-M4-FW and UFW. In both reactions, YCpL-SUI1 was used as a template. Following DpnI digestion (to remove contamination of bacterially produced and hence methylated YCpL-SUI1), these two segments (0.3 and 0.4 kb in size, respectively) were gel-purified and combined to perform the second PCR using primers eIF1-Nde and UFW.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Besides the plasmids listed in Table 1, the following plasmids were constructed in this study. YEpL-SUI1-M4 and -M5 were prepared by transferring the SacI-HindIII 1.2-kb SUI1 fragment of the corresponding single copy (sc) mutant plasmid derivatives (Table 1) to YEplac181 (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). YCpU-SUI1-M4 and -M5 were likewise constructed by transferring the same segment of sc mutant derivatives to YCplac33 (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). To better express unmodified eIF1 in bacteria, we created pET-SUI1 by subcloning the 0.7-kb NdeI-HindIII wild-type SUI1 fragment from PCR with oligonucleotides eIF1-Nde and eIF1-Hd into pET23a. pET-SUI1-1-His, encoding the sui1-1 (D83G) mutant form of eIF1-His, was constructed by subcloning into pET23a the 0.35-kb NdeI-SalI SUI1-1-His ORF segment from PCR using oligonucleotides eIF1-Nde and eIF1-His-RV and a sui1-1 plasmid as template. The 0.7-kb NdeI-HindIII fragments of YCpL-SUI1-M1 to -M5 were subcloned into pET23a to create pET-His-SUI1-M1 to -M5. The products of these plasmids were used to analyze the folding of the corresponding mutant forms of eIF1 (Fig. 3).pGB-TIF5-B6 was constructed by subcloning the PCR-amplified BamHI fragment of eIF5 (aa 241-405) ORF into pGBfusion1 (22Zhou P. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). pGB1-TIF5-B5.5-BN1 encoding the GB1 fusion form of BN1 mutant eIF5-(220-405) will be described elsewhere. 5B. Lee and K. Asano, manuscript in preparation. The GCN2 allele in KAY146 (Table 1) was deleted using pHQ414 (gcn2::hisG::URA3::hisG) as described (23Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2697-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to generate KAY230 (Table 1). The LEU2 SUI1 plasmid in this strain was replaced with the URA3 SUI1 plasmid by naturally segregating the former from a KAY230 transformant carrying the latter to select KAY231. KAY231 was then used for plasmid shuffling using the drug 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) (24Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) to create all of the SUI1 mutant strains listed in column 6 of Table 1. Briefly, the Ura3p enzyme converts FOA into a toxic compound. Thus, the growth of a KAY231 transformant carrying a YCpL-SUI1 (LEU2) derivative (Table 1, column 5) on the FOA medium selects for a sui1Δ strain lacking p(URA3 SUI1) but still containing the mutant YCpL-SUI1 derivative (Table 1, column 6) if the mutant SUI1 allele is not lethal.NMR Spectroscopy—Sample preparation and spectra measurement for NMR spectroscopy were done as described in Ref. 25Marintchev A.

NMR experiments for eIF1 backbone assignment and structure determination have been carried out with the sample of 0.9 mm15N-, 13C-labeled eIF1 in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2. Binding NMR experiments have been carried out in 20 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2, buffer with 0.075 mm15N eIF1 and 0.075-1.5 mm unlabeled GB1-eIF5-(241-405). Structural figures were produced with MolMol and PyMOL (available on the World Wide Web). To investigate whether the eIF1 mutants described here are folded, we expressed 15N-labeled M1-M5 mutant forms of His-eIF1 and the D83G form of eIF1-His and recorded 1H-15N correlated HSQC spectra.Biochemical Techniques—Protein interactions in vitro (11Singh C.R.

In vivo assessment of the function of eIF1-His and His-eIF1 is described in the supplemental materials. Both eIF1 constructs exhibited excellent two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra, indicating that the protein is well behaved and folded with His6 tags on either termini. Fig. 1A displays the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of eIF1-His in black. The resonances were assigned, using standard multiple-resonance experiments, and the structure was determined as described previously for human eIF1 (15Fletcher C.M. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Wagner G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), except that CYANA was used for structure calculation instead of XPLOR. The resulting structure of the globular core (residues 24-108) is shown in Fig. 1, B and C (Table 2). As expected from the high sequence homology (87% similarity and 63% identity), the structure is very similar to that of human eIF1 (15Fletcher C.M. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Wagner G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the human protein, yeast eIF1 contains a segment (residues 87-106) that adopts two distinct but similar conformations as manifested with two sets of backbone resonances for 13 of the 20 residues, and the resonances of both forms could be assigned unambiguously (Fig. 1A). The two conformations are in slow exchange, since two sets of signals are observed. The relative populations are salt-dependent, and the minor conformation at high salt becomes the major conformation at low salt. The dependence of relative signal intensities on the salt concentration identifies this effect as two interconverting conformations rather than a heterogeneity of the covalent structure. The small differences of chemical shifts show that the two structures must be very similar and would be difficult to individually determine with NMR spectroscopy.FIGURE 1Solution structure of yeast eIF1 and identification of the eIF5-binding site using chemical shift mapping.A, superposition of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 75 μm eIF1-His alone (black) and in the presence of 750 μm GB1-eIF5-(241-405) (red). Residues affected are identified with blue labels. Cross-peaks from the NTT show simple chemical shift changes dependent on the concentration of GB1-eIF5-(241-405). An expansion of the cross-peak for S8 shows this effect for three ligand concentrations (0-, 5-, and 10-fold excess in black, blue, and red). Ellipses and arrows identify residues with two conformations, for which the minor conformation disappears upon the addition of GB1-eIF5-(241-405). As an example, the expansion of the signals for Lys104 and His106 shows that the intensity of the signals of the minor form decreases in dependence on the GB1-eIF5-(241-405) concentration. Nearly identical results were obtained in titration experiments with 0.2 m eIF1. All spectra were recorded at 1 m NaCl, pH 7.2.

Since previous evidence suggested that the eIF1-binding activity of eIF5 resides in its C-terminal domain (9Singh C.R. Hui H. Ii M. Yamamoto Y. Asano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31910-31920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we expressed C-terminal fragments with different sizes. Among these, an eIF5-(241-405) fragment behaved best in terms of solubility and NMR spectral appearance. However, even this segment aggregated and exhibited poor NMR spectra. Thus, we used a N-terminal fusion with the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1) as a solubility enhancement tag (22Zhou P. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This fusion protein behaved well and exhibited good NMR spectra but required high salt concentrations to remain monomeric. At high salt, the eIF1/eIF5 interaction is rather weak but clearly identifiable in the NMR experiments (see below). Lower salt increases the affinity but causes broadening of both the eIF1 and eIF5 spectra so that spectral changes cannot be monitored.Thus, all NMR titrations had to be carried out at 1 m NaCl. We added unlabeled GB1-eIF5-(241-405)-His to the two differently tagged forms of eIF1. Only eIF1-His was affected by the addition of GB1-eIF5-(241-405)-His, consistent with in vitro binding studies showing that an N-terminal His tag prevents binding, as mentioned above. Of 108 yeast eIF1 amino acids, 17 were affected by eIF5-(241-405) (Fig. 1A). Among these, residues Ser8, Asp10, Phe12, and Ala13 are located in the unstructured NTT and experience ligand-dependent chemical shift changes (fast exchange limit). The second group consists of Arg85, Lys87, Val88, Cys89, Phe91, Ile93, Ser94, Gln95, Gly97, Leu98, Lys100, Lys101, Lys104, Ile105, and His106. These residues adopted two conformations in free eIF1 (see above); the addition of GB1-eIF5-(241-405)-His caused the minor conformation to disappear in a manner proportional to the ligand concentration. This indicates that eIF5 binding competes with the intramolecular interactions that stabilize the minor conformation. All affected residues cluster in two separate regions of eIF1 (Fig. 1D) defining potential binding sites for eIF5-(241-405), one at the NTT (aa 1-23) and the other at a basic surface area of the globular core (Fig. 1D). We call this site the KH area after the characteristic lysine (K) and hydrophobic residues.To confirm that the basic surface of eIF5-(241-405) is the primary eIF1-binding face (14Yamamoto Y. Singh C.R. Marintchev A. Hall N.S. Hannig E.M. Wagner G. Asano K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16164-16169Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we mixed 15N-labeled eIF1-His with the BN1 mutant form of GB1-eIF5-(220-405)-His, altering six basic amino acids (Lys367, Lys360, Lys372, Lys375, Lys379, and Arg382) to Gln (see Fig. 7a for the basic area II) involved in eIF1 binding. As expected, the BN1 mutant form of the GB1-eIF5 segment did not change the HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled eIF1-His (data not shown). The NMR spectrum of GB1-eIF5-(220-405)-HisBN1 sample displayed well dispersed chemical shifts, confirming that the BN1 mutant eIF5-CTD is folded (data not shown). Thus, the BN1 mutation impaired the eIF1/eIF5-(220-405) interaction by altering the surface resid"

https://openalex.org/W1972594415,"Magnetic fields are believed to have a vital role in regulating and shaping the flow of material onto and away from protostars during their initial mass accretion phase. It is becoming increasingly accepted that bipolar outflows are generated and collimated as material is driven along magnetic field lines and centrifugally accelerated off a rotating accretion disk. However, the precise role of the magnetic field is poorly understood and evidence for its shape and structure has not been forthcoming. Here we report imaging circular polarimetry in the near-infrared and Monte Carlo modelling showing that the magnetic field along the bipolar outflow of the HH 135-136 young stellar object is helical. The field retains this shape for large distances along the outflow, so the field structure can also provide the necessary magnetic pressure for collimation of the outflow. This result lends further weight to the hypothesis--central to any theory of star formation--that the outflow is an important instrument for the removal of high-angular-momentum material from the accretion disk, thereby allowing the central protostar to increase its mass."

Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) encodes a functional GMD, which is unique among characterized GMDs because it also has a strong stereospecific NADPH-dependent reductase activity leading to GDP-d-rhamnose formation (Tonetti, M., Zanardi, D., Gurnon, J., Fruscione, F., Armirotti, A., Damonte, G., Sturla, L., De Flora, A., and Van Etten, J.L.

In the present study we characterized a recombinant GMD encoded by another chlorella virus, Acanthocystis turfacea chlorella virus 1 (ATCV-1), demonstrating that it has the expected dehydratase activity. However, it also displayed significant differences when compared with PBCV-1 GMD. In particular, ATCV-1 GMD lacks the reductase activity present in the PBCV-1 enzyme. Using recombinant PBCV-1 and ATCV-1 GMDs, we determined that the enzymatically active proteins contain tightly bound NADPH and that NADPH is essential for maintaining the oligomerization status as well as for the stabilization and function of both enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that PBCV-1 GMD is the most evolutionary diverged of the GMDs. We conclude that this high degree of divergence was the result of the selection pressures that led to the acquisition of new reductase activity to synthesize GDP-d-rhamnose while maintaining the dehydratase activity in order to continue to synthesize GDP-l-fucose.

PBCV-1 is the prototype of a group (family Phycodnaviridae) of large, icosahedral, plaque-forming, double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate in certain unicellular, eukaryotic chlorella-like green algae (10Van Etten J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In nature, the chlorella host is a hereditary endosymbiont in the ciliated protozoan P. bursaria. PBCV-1 has ∼365 protein-encoding genes, including genes that encode several proteins that resemble enzymes involved in the metabolism and processing of sugars; these proteins include five putative glycosyltransferases believed to be involved in the glycosylation of the virus major capsid protein (11Graves M.V. Bernadt C.V. Cerny R. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 2001; 285: 332-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PBCV-1 also encodes the two enzymes involved in GDP-l-fucose biosynthesis, GMD and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose epimerase/reductase (GMER) (Fig. 1) (9Tonetti M. Zanardi D. Gurnon J. Fruscione F.

Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B.

GMD sequences are well conserved among organisms; they all contain three conserved amino acids, Ser/Thr, Tyr, and Lys, involved in catalysis and a glycine-rich motif at the N terminus that is involved in cofactor binding. GMD three-dimensional structures have been reported from several organisms (14Somoza J.R. Menon S. Schimdt H. Joseph-McCarthy D. Dessen A. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Sullivan F.X.

GMD binds its coenzyme NADP(H) in the N-terminal domain, which consists of a seven-stranded Rossman fold, whereas the C-terminal domain is involved in substrate binding. The PBCV-1 GMD crystal structure was determined at 3.8 Å resolution (17Rosano C. Zuccotti S. Sturla L. Fruscione F. Tonetti M. Bolognesi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and its tertiary structure resembles other GMDs. However, the low resolution of the PBCV-1 crystals did not provide definitive information on the structure of the active site nor did it allow the identification of the redox state of the coenzyme.The catalytic mechanism proposed for GMD is similar to that reported for other nucleotide sugars dehydratases, such as dTDP-d-glucose dehydratase and CDP-d-glucose dehydratase (18Hegeman A.D. Gross J.W. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6598-6610Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19He X. Thorson J.S. Liu H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The presence of an oxidized coenzyme (NADP+ in the case of GMD) is required for the beginning of the catalytic cycle. Initially, a hydride is transferred from C-4 of the mannose moiety to NADP+, which is accordingly reduced to NADPH, with the formation of a 4-keto-intermediate (14Somoza J.R. Menon S. Schimdt H. Joseph-McCarthy D. Dessen A. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Sullivan F.X. Structure. 2000; 8: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At this stage two different mechanisms have been proposed; a proton is removed from C-5 by a base on the enzyme followed by dehydration of the 4-keto-intermediate between C-5 and C-6 yielding a 4-keto-5,6-ene species. In the second mechanism a 4-enediol/enolate species is formed in the second step of the reaction. In both cases a conserved acid residue (Glu-135 in Escherichia coli sequence) has been proposed to act as a base that removes a proton from C-6 (14Somoza J.R. Menon S. Schimdt H. Joseph-McCarthy D.

The final step in the reaction involves a hydride transfer from bound NADPH to C-6 of the sugar, leading to the product GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose and regeneration of NADP+. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose is the substrate for GMER; however, it is not a very stable compound. Thus, the presence of an oxidized coenzyme is an absolute requirement for initiating GMD activity. However, structural data obtained by x-ray crystallography indicated that both Arabidopsis thaliana and Pseudomonas aeruginosa GMD contain only tightly bound NADPH instead of NADP+ (15Mulichak A.M. Bonin C.P. Reiter W.-D. Garavito R.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15578-15589Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Webb N.A. Mulichack A.M. Lam J.S. Rocchetta H.L. Garavito R.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preliminary data obtained in our laboratory also indicate that NADPH is present in recombinant GMD from virus PBCV-1. 3M. Tonetti, E. Di Zanni, L. Sturla, and F. Fruscione, unpublished results. 3M. Tonetti, E. Di Zanni, L. Sturla, and F. Fruscione, unpublished results.The PBCV-1 recombinant GMD differs from other currently characterized GMDs because, in addition to the dehydratase activity, the protein also has a strong stereospecific NADPH-dependent reductase activity that produces GDP-d-rhamnose (9Tonetti M. Zanardi D. Gurnon J. Fruscione F. Armirotti A. Damonte G. Sturla L. De Flora A. Van Etten J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21559-21565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The low resolution of the active site in the PBCV-1 GMD crystals (17Rosano C. Zuccotti S. Sturla L. Fruscione F. Tonetti M. Bolognesi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) did not provide any information that would explain the high reductase activity of the enzyme. However, a reductase activity implies an exchange between the oxidized form of the bound coenzyme and the exogenous NADPH added to the reaction mixture.Recently, the genome of another virus (Acanthocystis turfacea chlorella virus (ATCV-1)) that infects Chlorella SAG 3.83 was sequenced (20Fitzgerald L.A. Graves M.V. Li X. Hartigan J. Pfitzner A.J. Hoffart E. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 2007; 362: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ATCV-1 also contains genes encoding putative GMD and GMER enzymes. However, the GMD amino acid sequences from ATCV-1 and PBCV-1 only have 53% identity, suggesting the two enzymes have undergone significant divergence and that they might have different properties.To address the presence and possible role of NADPH in the structural and catalytic properties of GMD, we expressed GMD from both PBCV-1 and ATCV-1 viruses and analyzed their kinetic and structural properties, their coenzyme content, and their coenzyme binding affinities. The results described here indicate that the ATCV-1 protein has dehydratase activity on GDP-d-mannose, but that it lacks the reductase activity present in PBCV-1 GMD. Moreover, we demonstrate that the catalytically active forms of both proteins contain NADPH, which is essential for stabilizing the enzyme structure. We propose that the presence of NADPH in these two dehydratases, even if not involved in the catalytic process, is not incidental but that it serves an important role in enzyme function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant GMD Proteins—GMD proteins were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins as previously described (9Tonetti M. Zanardi D. Gurnon J. Fruscione F. Armirotti A. Damonte G. Sturla L. De Flora A. Van Etten J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21559-21565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using pGEX-6P1 vector (GE Healthcare). The ATCV-1 GMD sequence corresponds to open reading frame Z804L in ATCV-1 genome (GenBank™ accession number EF101928). Purification to homogeneity was achieved by chromatography on a GSH-Sepharose 4B column followed by in situ proteolytic cleavage of the tag by Prescission Protease (GE Healthcare). The proteins were concentrated to about 4–6 mg/ml using a Centricon YM-10 system (Amicon-Millipore) and stored at 4°C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 (TBSE) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). ApoGMDs were prepared after preincubation of the proteins with GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose followed by dialysis against 1000 volumes of TBSE/DTT. This treatment resulted in complete removal of bound coenzymes (see below).Protein concentrations were determined by UV280 absorbance of the purified proteins in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.02 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, using a calculated extinction coefficient of 47,330 m–1 cm–1 for PBCV-1 GMD and 51,340 m–1 cm–1 for ATCV-1 GMD (21Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). Because the holoenzyme contains bound NADP(H), which can interfere with the UV280 assay, protein concentrations were also determined by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad) using apoGMD as a standard. GMD concentration was expressed as molarity of the monomer form of the protein. Protein purity, monitored by SDS-PAGE, exceeded 95% in all preparations.Determination of GMD-bound NADP+/NADPH—The amounts of protein-bound NADP+ and NADPH were determined by reverse phase HPLC on either untreated purified GMD or after preincubation of the proteins (100 μm) with a molar excess of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose (150 μm). This latter treatment converts all bound NADPH to the oxidized form (see below). Aliquots of both the untreated and treated proteins were dialyzed to verify coenzyme release from GMD. The concentrated protein (100 μm) was then dialyzed against 1000 volumes of TBSE/DTT for 24 h at 4 °C.To discriminate between NADP+ and NADPH, the proteins were subjected to treatments that selectively destroy the oxidized and reduced forms of NADP before analysis (22Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. Rock M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2756-2759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For NADP+ determination, 100 μl of protein solution (50 μm, expressed as the monomer) or NADP+/NADPH standards in TBSE buffer were first treated with 10 μl of 3.7 m HClO4. Samples were then neutralized with 3 m K2CO3, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation; 100 μl of supernatant were diluted 1:1 with TBSE and subjected to HPLC analysis. For NADPH determination, 5 μl of 4 n NaOH were added to 100 μl of proteins or standards in TBSE; samples were heated at 70 °C for 10 min and immediately chilled in ice. These solutions were then neutralized by adding 4 n HCl and centrifuged. The supernatants were diluted as described above.HPLC analysis was performed with an HP 1090 apparatus (Agilent) equipped with a Diode Array Detector and fitted with a reverse phase C18 column (25 × 300 cm, 5-μm particle size, Waters) as described (23McCracken J.A. Wang L. Kohen A. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The eluate was monitored at 260 and 340 nm. Concentrations of NADP(H) (obtained from Sigma) were determined using an extinction coefficient of 17,800 m–1 cm–1 at 260 nm for NADP+ and an extinction coefficient of 6,220 m–1 cm–1 at 340 nm for NADPH. HPLC analysis of standard NADPH revealed no contamination by the oxidized form. Coenzyme concentrations in the samples were obtained by linear regression using the Prism 5.0 program (Graphpad).Fluorescence Analyses—All fluorescence measurements were performed at 22 °C using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorimeter in a 0.5 × 0.5-cm quartz cuvette. Emission spectra were recorded with freshly diluted protein to a 1 μm concentration in PBS, pH 7.3, from a 100 μm either untreated or GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose-treated GMD solution. After dilution, protein solutions were allowed to equilibrate until reaching stable fluorescence intensities. Enzyme-bound NADPH was determined using the excitation wavelength at 350 nm (5-nm slit width) and recording fluorescence emission from 370 to 600 nm (10-nm slit width). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and fluorescence energy transfer were measured with an excitation of 295 nm (5-nm slit width) while monitoring emission from 310 to 500 nm (10-nm slit width). Sample spectra were corrected for background and Raman scattering by subtracting buffer spectra.Fluorescence titration experiments were used to determine the binding affinities of the cofactors to the apoenzymes. Protein concentrations in PBS were 500 nm for both NADP+ and NADPH titrations. Solutions were prepared immediately before use, and the concentrations were determined as described above. NADP+ binding to protein was monitored by quenching of tryptophan fluorescence at 340 nm after excitation at 295 nm; quenching indicates cofactor binding to the apoenzyme. NADPH binding to the apoprotein was monitored by enhancement of fluorescence emission at 440 nm (excitation 350 nm). Each fluorescence value measured in the presence of the protein was corrected by subtracting the contribution of unbound NADPH to the fluorescence. Inner filtering effects were determined to be negligible at the enzyme and NADPH concentrations used. For experiments involving higher concentrations of NADP+ the following correction was applied as described (24Lakowics J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 44Google Scholar), Fc=Fobs×10((Aex+Aem)/2)(Eq. 1) where Fc is the corrected intensity, Fobs is the observed intensity, and Aex and Aem are the absorbance of sample at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively.Dissociation constants (KD) were determined by plotting the corrected change in emission (ΔF) against the concentration of the titrant. The Prism 5.0 program (GraphPad) was used to fit the data by nonlinear regression. For NADP+ titration, data best fit a single binding site equation (Equation 2), where ΔF is the change in fluorescence, ΔFmax is the maximal change in fluorescence, and X is the concentration of the titrant, ΔF=(ΔFmax×X)/(KD+X)(Eq. 2) Conversely, data obtained after NADPH titration of both PBCV-1 and ATCV-1 apoenzymes best fit one-site binding by the Hill equation (Equation 3), where ΔF is the change in fluorescence, ΔFmax is the maximal change in fluorescence, × is the concentration of the titrant, and h is the Hill slope, ΔF=(ΔFmax×Xh)/(KD+Xh)(Eq. 3) Size-exclusion Chromatography—The molecular mass of GMD proteins was determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a TSKgel G3000SWXL column, 7.8 × 300 mm, 5-μm particle size (Tosoh Biosciences). The mobile phase was 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, containing 0.1 m Na2SO4. The eluate was monitored at 220 nm. The following proteins were used as standards: cytochrome C (12 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), γ-globulin (157 kDa), and tyroglobulin (670 kDa). All protein standards were obtained from Sigma. Blue dextran and DTT were used to determine the void and total column volumes, respectively, to enable calculation of the distribution coefficient Kav according to the following equation (25Welling G.W. Welling-Wester S. Oliver R.W. HPLC of Macromolecules: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 77-89Google Scholar), Kav=(Ve-Vo)/(Vt-Vo)(Eq. 4) where Ve is the elution volume of the protein, Vo the column void volume, and Vt is the total bed volume. The Kav for each protein standard was plotted against the logarithm of the corresponding molecular mass. Kav of samples was used to calculate the molecular mass by linear regression analysis.Analysis of Enzyme Activities—GMD dehydratase activity was assayed in TBSE containing 1 mm DTT. A mixture of GDP-d-[U-14C]mannose (GE Healthcare; specific activity 11.1 GBq/mmol) and unlabeled GDP-d-mannose (Sigma) was used as substrate at a final specific activity of 1.4 GBq/mmol. Assays were conducted at 37 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn at various times. Reactions were stopped by adding 10-μl samples to 90 μl of ice-cold water followed by extraction with sodium perchlorate/potassium acetate as previously described (26Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The conversion of GDP-d-[14C]mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-[14C]mannose was used to measure ATCV-1 GMD dehydratase activity; the two sugar nucleotides were detected by reverse phase HPLC followed by continuous flow scintillation counting as described previously (9Tonetti M. Zanardi D. Gurnon J. Fruscione F. Armirotti A. Damonte G. Sturla L. De Flora A. Van Etten J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21559-21565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the experiments with PBCV-1 proteins in the presence of NADPH, where both GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose and GDP-d-rhamnose are formed, activity was determined by following GDP-d-mannose consumption. GMD reductase activity was carried out in the same conditions using different concentrations of NADPH and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-[14C]mannose as substrate. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-[14C]mannose was produced from GDP-d-mannose using the GMD dehydratase activity in the absence of added NADPH. Complete conversion of GDP-d-mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose was followed by HPLC. The sugar nucleotide was separated from GMD by ultrafiltration using the Microcon YM-10 system (Amicon-Millipore). Heat-inactivation of GMD was avoided, as we observed a significant degradation of the product.Phylogenetic Analyses—BLASTP searches for PBCV-1 GMD (AAO67555) and PBCV-1 GMER (AAC96663) were conducted to construct two phylogenetic trees. Twenty taxa, including prokaryotes, eukaryotes, Archaea, as well as one virus were selected. The 20 taxa, which included PBCV-1 and ATCV-1, were aligned with ClustalW using the default setting in the Biology Workbench. The alignments were converted to NEXUS format and imported into PAUP 4.0b10 (27Swafford D.L. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis with Parsimony (*and Other Methods) Version 4.10. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2000Google Scholar) for phylogenetic analysis. Trees were constructed using the following three methods: maximum parsimony heuristic, neighbor joining, and maximum parsimony bootstrap (1000 replicates). Because the PBCV-1 GMD and GMER proteins have sequence homology to one another, they were used as the out-groups to root the two trees; i.e. PBCV-1 GMER was used to root the GMD tree, whereas PBCV-1 GMD was used to root the GMER tree. The GMD tree shown in Fig. 7 is a summary of the very similar tree topologies from the three tree-building methods. The values on the branches are the percentage of bootstrap support (1000 replicates). Only bootstrap values >50% are reported.FIGURE 7Rooted phylogram of GMD. A BLAST search was conducted using the virus PBCV-1 GMD protein (PBCV-1: AAC96486). The sequence for ATCV-1 (A. turfacea chlorella virus) GMD is open reading frame Z804L in accession number EF101928. The sequence for PBCV-1) (AAC96663) was used as the out-group in the phylogenetic analyses. ClustalW was used to align the sequences. Bootstrap analysis (heuristic using parsimony) was used to construct the tree. Similar tree topologies were produced by neighbor joining and maximum parsimony analyses.

However, several observations indicate that NADPH is also tightly bound to the enzyme (15Mulichak A.M. Bonin C.P. Reiter W.-D. Garavito R.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15578-15589Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Webb N.A. Mulichack A.M. Lam J.S. Rocchetta H.L. Garavito R.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Likewise, incubating GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose with equimolar amounts of purified recombinant PBCV-1 and ATCV-1 GMDs results in the appearance of GDP-d-rhamnose without adding exogenous NADPH (results not shown). These results suggest that NADPH is present and catalytically competent in the two recombinant viral GMDs. To address the presence and the possible role of NADPH in GMD activity, we measured the coenzyme content in the two proteins by HPLC (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). To discriminate between NADPH and NADP+, the recombinant proteins were isolated under conditions that selectively destroy either the oxidized or the reduced form of the coenzyme. The HPLC analysis also revealed another substance(s) bound to the purified proteins that has a spectrum suggestive of a guanylate moiety (supplemental Figs. 1, A and B, and 2, A and B). For ATCV-1 GMD, variable amounts of NADP+ and NADPH were detected with different enzyme preparations (Table 1); these results indicate that the ATCV-1 protein contains both forms of the coenzyme. However, in all cases the additive amount of NADP+ and NADPH was about 1 mol/mol of monomeric ATCV-1 protein. In contrast, PBCV-1 GMD contained primarily NADPH, and only trace amounts of NADP+ were detected (Table 1).TABLE 1Determination of GMD-bound NADP+ and NADPHPBCV-1 GMDATCV-1 GMDNADP+NADPHNADP+NADPHμmol/mol of protein monomerNative GMD0.03 ± 0.010.87 ± 0.150.25-0.45aFor ATCV-1 GMD, the ratio between NADP+ and NADPH varied considerably between enzyme preparations, but in all cases the total amount of the coenzymes was close to 1 mol/each mol of monomer.

https://openalex.org/W2168735550,"Networks of regulatory relations between transcription factors (TF) and their target genes (TG)- implemented through TF binding sites (TFBS)- are key features of biology. An idealized approach to solving such networks consists of starting from a consensus TFBS or a position weight matrix (PWM) to generate a high accuracy list of candidate TGs for biological validation. Developing and evaluating such approaches remains a formidable challenge in regulatory bioinformatics. We perform a benchmark study on 34 Drosophila TFs to assess existing TFBS and cis-regulatory module (CRM) detection methods, with a strong focus on the use of multiple genomes. Particularly, for CRM-modelling we investigate the addition of orthologous sites to a known PWM to construct phyloPWMs and we assess the added value of phylogenentic footprinting to predict contextual motifs around known TFBSs. For CRM-prediction, we compare motif conservation with network-level conservation approaches across multiple genomes. Choosing the optimal training and scoring strategies strongly enhances the performance of TG prediction for more than half of the tested TFs. Finally, we analyse a 35(th) TF, namely Eyeless, and find a significant overlap between predicted TGs and candidate TGs identified by microarray expression studies. In summary we identify several ways to optimize TF-specific TG predictions, some of which can be applied to all TFs, and others that can be applied only to particular TFs. The ability to model known TF-TG relations, together with the use of multiple genomes, results in a significant step forward in solving the architecture of gene regulatory networks."

This tie is resolved in anaphase when separase, a giant protease, becomes active and cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin. Premature activation of separase and, hence, chromosome missegregation are prevented by at least two inhibitory mechanisms. Although securin has long been appreciated as a direct inhibitor of separase, surprisingly its loss has basically no phenotype in mammals. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of Cdk1 constitutes an alternative way to inhibit vertebrate separase. Its importance is illustrated by the premature loss of cohesion when Cdk1-resistant separase is expressed in mammalian cells without or with limiting amounts of securin. Here, we demonstrate that crucial inhibitory phosphorylations occur within a region of human separase that is also shown to make direct contact with the cyclin B1 subunit of Cdk1. This region exhibits a weak homology to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc6 of similar Cdk1 binding behavior, thereby establishing phosphoserine/threonine-mediated binding of partners as a conserved characteristic of B-type cyclins. In contrast to the Cdc6-like domain, the previously identified serine 1126 phosphorylation is fully dispensable for Cdk1 binding to separase fragments.

The Cdk1 kinase and the protease separase are two key players of mitosis and meiosis, which control proper segregation of chromosomes into newly forming daughter cells. Cdk1 is considered the master regulator of mitosis. Apart from the catalytic subunit, the holoenzyme consists of a regulatory cyclin of the A- or B-types and a small, phosphopeptide-binding Cks subunit, which might recruit the kinase to prephosphorylated substrates (1Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). High activity of Cdk1 induces mitotic entry and associated processes like DNA condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and mitotic spindle assembly. Cdk1 down-regulation, which is required for reversal of these steps during mitotic exit, is primarily due to degradation of B-type cyclins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This destruction is mediated by an E3 ligase called anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome in conjunction with its activator Cdc20, which is kept inactive by the spindle assembly checkpoint until all chromosomes have properly attached to microtubules and aligned at the metaphase plate of the mitotic spindle. In budding yeast the Cdk inhibitors Sic1 and Cdc6 might contribute slightly to down-regulation of Cdk1 activity in late mitosis (2Archambault V. Li C.X. Tackett A.J. Wasch R. Chait B.T. Rout M.P. Cross F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4592-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In case of Cdc6, the N terminus (Cdc6-N) is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with the kinase (3Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cdc6-N contacts the cyclin B subunit of Cdk1 directly but only when phosphorylated at two (or more) of four Cdk1 phosphorylation sites (4Mimura S. Seki T. Tanaka S. Diffley J.F.

This inhibitor somehow also exerts a positive effect on separase as illustrated by a much decreased level/activity and haploinsufficiency of separase in securin–/– cells (6Wirth K.G. Wutz G.

On the other hand, securin deficiency results in loss of cohesion in metaphase-arrested Cdc20–/– embryos (14Li M. York J.P. Zhang P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3481-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In mice and human cells, however, deletion of just securin does not prevent long term segregation of chromosomes with correct timing and high fidelity (15Mei J. Huang X. Zhang P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1197-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Pfleghaar K. Heubes S. Cox J. Stemmann O. Speicher M.R.

This unexpected finding has led to a recent appreciation of the Cdk1-dependent inhibition of anaphase. Indeed, mammalian cells containing no or only limiting amounts of securin lose sister chromatid cohesion prematurely when this alternative mode of anaphase inhibition is additionally abrogated by expression of a Cdk1-resistant separase mutant (18Huang X. Hatcher R. York J.P. Zhang P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4725-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, association of separase and Cdk1 in vitro leads to inactivation not only of the protease but also of the kinase (12Gorr I.H. Boos D. Stemmann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This unexpected role of separase as a Cdk inhibitor is independent of its proteolytic activity and seems to be crucial for down-regulation of Cdk1 at the end of female meiosis I. Antibodies that selectively block the binding of Cdk1 to separase prevented extrusion of the first polar body (PBE1) in frog and mouse oocytes. Meiosis I could be rescued, however, by independently inhibiting Cdk1 at the same time (20Gorr I.H. Reis A. Boos D. Wuhr M. Madgwick S. Jones K.T. Stemmann O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1035-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Contradicting these data, a conditional knock-out of separase in mouse oocytes was reported to block PBE1 but not Cdk1 inactivation (21Kudo N.R. Wassmann K. Anger M. Schuh M. Wirth K.G. Xu H.

For both studies to be true nonetheless, one has to assume that an alternative, compensatory mode of Cdk1 inactivation is switched on if, and only if, separase is absent. Furthermore, separase would have an additional, Cdk inhibitor-independent role in PBE1. protein phosphatase 2A Cdc6-like domain glutathione S-transferase dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin l-p-benzoylphenylalanine tandem mass spectrometry wild type polo box domain hemagglutinin protein pyrophosphatase maltose-binding protein. protein phosphatase 2A Cdc6-like domain glutathione S-transferase dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin l-p-benzoylphenylalanine tandem mass spectrometry wild type polo box domain hemagglutinin protein pyrophosphatase maltose-binding protein. Given these clear and unclear functions of great cellular importance, a thorough biochemical understanding of the separase-Cdk1 complex appears instrumental. It has been previously shown that Cdk1 binds human separase only when the latter is phosphorylated on serine 1126 and contains an intact, so-called Cdc6-like domain (CLD) (12Gorr I.H. Boos D. Stemmann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As its name implies, this sequence stretch of separase exhibits a very weak, yet intriguing homology toward the N terminus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc6. This suggested that human separase and yeast Cdc6 might bind Cdk1 in the same manner. Here, we demonstrate that this as yet highly speculative model is, in fact, correct. Like the N terminus of Cdc6, the CLD of separase is phosphorylated and in direct contact with cyclin B1. Our in vitro and in vivo studies also help to clarify the mechanistic role of the crucial serine 1126 phosphorylation in establishing the separase-Cdk1 complex. Antibodies and Affinity Matrices—Antibodies against the N terminus (see Fig. 2A) and an internal fragment (immunoprecipitation for supplement Fig. S1) of human separase as well as against the C terminus of Cks1/2 were described (12Gorr I.H.

Xenopus Cdk1 antibody was a gift from J. Walter. Human cyclin B1 antibody from mouse (see Fig. 3) and rabbit (see Fig. 4) were from Upstate (05-373) and Santa Cruz (sc-549), respectively. Rabbit anti-Myc, mouse anti-Myc, and mouse anti-β-tubulin were from Santa Cruz (sc-789), Upstate (05-724), and (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), respectively. The following affinity matrices were used: protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, 17-0618-01), IgG-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, 17-0969-01), glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, 17-5132-02), amylose-resin (New England Biolabs, E8021L), nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, 1018240), and anti-Myc-agarose (Santa Cruz, sc-40 AC).FIGURE 3Separase fragments faithfully recapitulate the binding of Cdk1 to CLD.A, Cdk1 binding to fragments of human separase is dependent on CLD but independent of Ser1126 phosphorylation. MBP-tagged (lanes 10–12) or GST-tagged wild type or mutant separase fragments of various length (amino acids 1063–1506 (lanes 1 and 2), 1063–1440 (lanes 4–6 and 8–9), 1192–1410 (lanes 10–12) or 1192–1440 (lane 7)) were incubated in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts, reisolated, and analyzed by Coomassie (Coom.) staining (top panels) and immunoblotting for Cdk1 and/or cyclin B1.

The beads were washed five times with XB (100 mm KCl, 0, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7,7, 50 mm sucrose, pH 7.7) containing 0.01% Triton X-100 and then eluted with 50 mm glutathione or 50 mm maltose in XB, 0.01% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT for analysis. For Fig. 3, 10 μl of glutathione or amylose beads carrying fragments of human separase, fly three rows, or yeast Cdc6 were reisolated from Xenopus egg extract as above, equilibrated in PPase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100), and incubated with 2 μg of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs, P0753L), 10 μg of BSA, or buffer in 20 μl for 1 h at 18 °C. After collecting the supernatant, the beads were extensively washed with PPase buffer and finally eluted as above. For purification of Myc6-Tev2-separase transgenic HEK-293 Flp-In T-Rex lines were arrested in the S phase by treatment with 4 mm deoxythymidine for 20 h, released for 4 h, and then treated with nocodazole (0.2 μg/ml) and doxycycline (2 μg/ml) for 14 h. Separase was affinity-purified from native lysates of 6 × 106 cells each (lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1× complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science), 1 μm microcystin LR) over 5 μl of anti-Myc-agarose. The beads were extensively washed in lysis buffer containing additional 50 mm NaCl, eluted by TEV protease treatment, and finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining or Western blotting. Kinase Assay and Far Western Analysis—1.5 μg GST-separase fragments in 2.5 μl of XB were combined with 2.5 μl of XB containing 10 μm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 0.2 μl[γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl) and active Plx1 purified from SF9 cells (gift from Ingo Gorr). The reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min. Separase-securin complexes were isolated from transfected 293T cells as described (22Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blocked membranes were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 1 μg/ml bacterially expressed GST-PBD (amino acids 326–603) from human Plk1 in TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 1% BSA. Subsequently, bound PBD was detected by standard anti-GST immunoblot. Site-specific l-p-Benzoylphenylalanine-mediated UV Cross-linking—Wild type separase fragment (amino acids 1192–1410) or corresponding TAG point mutants generated by GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (Promega) were cloned into a pMAL derivative encoding an N-terminal MBP-Tev2- as well as a C-terminal (His6-FLAG)2 tag (23Chin J.W.

Schultz P.G. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (gift from P. G. Schultz). The cultures were grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 2 mm l-p-benzoylphenylalanine (pBpA; Bachem, F-2800). Expression was induced at an A600 of 0.8 with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and carried out for 3 h at 37 °C. Following denaturing purification (Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 8 m urea, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazol, 0.02% Triton X-100) over nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, fusion proteins were renatured in situ with phosphate-buffered saline, 400 mm NaCl, and 0.02% Triton X-100 and eluted in the same buffer plus 250 mm imidazol. Soluble fusion proteins were then bound to a limiting amount of amylose resin, of which 30 μl were incubated in 300 μl of high-Δ90-extract for 1 h at 18 °C. After two washes with XB, 0.01% Triton X-100, and three washes in PPase buffer lacking DTT, 20 μl of beads were eluted in 120 μl of PPase buffer (without DTT) containing 50 mm maltose, whereas the remainder (10 μl of beads) was eluted in 60 μl of PPase buffer (without DTT) containing 30 units of TEV-protease. Where indicated, eluates were UV-treated using a mercury arc lamp (Lot-Oriel, 500 W, 300–700 nm spectrum, for 15 min at 4 °C) in aliquots of 60 μl. Finally, all of the samples were subjected SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining (116th of each sample) and immunoblotting (⅛th). Myc6-Separase Expressing Flp-In T-Rex Cell Lines—Isogenic HEK-293 Flp-In T-Rex cells carrying inducible Myc6-Tev2-separase transgenes were generated by Flp-recombinase mediated, site-specific genomic integration as described (19Holland A.J.

Separase expression was induced with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 14 h (chromosome spreads) or 24 h (cell cycle profiling) in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml nocodazole, where indicated. For determination of DNA contents 106 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol (–20 °C), washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA, and resuspended in 69 μm propidium iodide, 100 μg/ml RNase A in 38 mm trisodium citrate. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the cell cycle profiles were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest Pro software. For chromosome spreads, stepwise addition of 0.25 and 2 ml hypotonic buffer (40% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 400 ng/μl nocodazole) to 106 cells were followed by a 5-min incubation. The cells were then pelleted and fixed by stepwise addition of 0.25, 0.25, and 2 ml of Canoy's solution (methanol: acetic acid = 3:1), followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. After washing with Canoy's solution, 10 μl out of a total volume of 0.25 ml of cell suspension were put onto a precooled coverslip and dried at 60 °C. The specimens were then stained with Giemsa (Fluka, 11700) for 10 min at room temperature, washed in water, sealed, and analyzed by bright field microscopy. Mass Spectrometry—Coomassie-stained protein bands were cut and in-gel digested by a mixture of trypsin (15 ng/μl) and GluC (30 ng/μl) (both enzymes from Roche Applied Science) essentially as described (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7787) Google Scholar). After 16 h, peptides were extracted using 10% formic acid in 30% acetonitrile and dried. For pairwise quantitation experiments, one of the samples was digested in buffer made from 18O water (95 atom %; Aldrich) essentially as described (27Mirgorodskaya O.A. Kozmin Y.P. Titov M.I. Korner R. Sonksen C.P. Roepstorff P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1226-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Peptide separations in nano liquid chromatography MS/MS experiments were performed on a CAPLC system (Waters, Manchester, UK). For phosphorylation analyses, the phosphopeptides were enriched using titanium dioxide microcolumns (28Thingholm T.E. Jorgensen T.J. Jensen O.N. Larsen M.R. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The samples were loaded onto a 2.5-cm-long 100-μm ID precolumn packed with 5 μm AQUASIL C18 phase (Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) and separated on a 13-cm 75-μm column packed with 3 μm reversed-phase material (ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) into a pulled fused silica capillary with a tip of 8 μm (NewObjective, Woburn, MA). The peptides were separated by a stepwise 60-min gradient of 0–100% between buffer A (2% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid) at a flow rate of 170 nl/min. The mass spectrometer (Q-TOF Ultima, Waters, Manchester, UK) was operated in data dependent MS/MS mode to automatically switch between 1.5-s MS survey and 2.0-s MS/MS fragmentations of the four most abundant precursor ions. Data base searches were performed using the Mascot (Matrix-science, London, UK) software package with carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidized methionine and phosphorylation as variable modifications. Precursor and fragment ion tolerances of 0.15 Da were used for the data base searches, and all of the identified phosphorylation sites were validated by visual inspection of MS/MS spectra. A sequence homology to the cyclin B1-binding N terminus of S. cerevisiae Cdc6 defined the CLD of human separase (amino acids 1342–1404) (12Gorr I.H. Boos D. Stemmann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and spurred the speculation that Cdc6 and separase might bind the regulatory subunit of Cdk1 in the same phosphorylation-dependent manner (4Mimura S. Seki T. Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2004; 431: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, doubts about this model are raised by the facts that the homology is very weak and that serine 1126 of separase, the only residue whose phosphorylation is known to be essential for separase-Cdk1 complex formation (22Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), lacks an equivalent in Cdc6. For the model to be true nonetheless, the following parallels to Cdc6-cyclin B1 have to be fulfilled: 1) Only phosphorylated CLD should mediate the interaction of separase with Cdk1. 2) Phosphorylated CLD should be sufficient for binding of Cdk1. 3) Phosphorylated CLD should entertain direct contacts with the cyclin B1 subunit of Cdk1. 4) Phosphorylated serine 1126 should have an indirect role in binding of the kinase. Here, we combine biochemical and cell biological approaches to rigorously test these predictions. Phosphorylations within the Cdc6-like Domain of Separase Are Critical for Cdk1 Binding—Asking whether residues within the CLD might be phosphorylated in vivo, we performed mass spectrometric analysis of endogenous separase immunoprecipitated from mitotically arrested HelaS3 cells. Indeed, we identified three phosphorylation sites within the CLD: Threonine 1346 (22Stemmann O. Zou H. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), threonine 1363, and serine 1399 (supplement Fig. S1). Interestingly, Thr1346 and Ser1399 align with Thr7 and Thr39 of S. cerevisiae Cdc6, both phosphorylation sites that are crucial for Cdk1 binding (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 12Gorr I.H. Boos D. Stemmann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We changed the three phosphorylation sites identified within the CLD to alanine and analyzed the resulting separase mutant (CLD-AAA) by immunoprecipitation from HEK-293 cells. Indeed, although it bound more Cdk1 than separase-S1126A (1126-A), its Cdk1 binding capacity was much decreased compared with wild type (Fig. 1A). To test whether these CLD phosphorylations contribute to Cdk1-dependent inhibition of separase in vivo, we applied an approach developed by Holland and Taylor (19Holland A.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). They had shown that Cdk1-dependent inhibition becomes crucial when securin is titrated out by induced overexpression of separase in transgenic HEK-293 Flp-In T-REx cells. Confirming previous findings, we found that doxycycline-induced overexpression of separase-S1126A led to an increase of the G2/M cell population from 24 to 49% within 24 h, whereas doxycycline-induced overexpression of wild type separase left the cell cycle profile basically unchanged (Fig. 1, B and C). This observation can be explained by 1126-A-specific premature separation of sister chromatids followed by spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent mitotic arrest. Analysis of the CLD-AAA mutant in the same system demonstrated that it, too, elicited a pronounced accumulation of mitotic cells from 24 to 37% within 24 h of doxycycline induction, although the effect was again less dramatic than for separase-1126-A. Importantly, changing the same sites to acidic residues instead resulted in a separase that could still be inhibited by Cdk1 in vivo (Fig. 1, B and C). In vitro, the same CLD-EED mutation renders the binding of Cdk1 to separase fragments phosphatase-insensitive (see below), consistent with a successful mimicry of phosphorylation. This control therefore strongly indicates that deregulation of sepa"

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it elicits an immediate influx of Ca2+ followed by mitochondrial fragmentation and eventual cell death. To dissect the mechanism of its toxicity, we assessed the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae to amiodarone by DNA microarray. Consistent with the drug-induced calcium burst, more than half of the differentially transcribed genes were induced by high levels of CaCl2. Amiodarone also caused rapid nuclear accumulation of the calcineurin-regulated Crz1. The majority of genes induced by amiodarone within 10 min were involved in utilization of alternative carbon and nitrogen sources and in mobilizing energy reserves. The similarity to nutrient starvation responses seen in stationary phase cells, rapamycin treatment, and late stages of shift to diauxic conditions and nitrogen depletion suggests that amiodarone may interfere with nutrient sensing and regulatory networks. Transcription of a set of nutrient-responsive genes was affected by amiodarone but not CaCl2, indicating that activation of the starvation response was independent of Ca2+. Genes down-regulated by amiodarone were involved in all stages of cell cycle control. A moderate dose of amiodarone temporarily delayed cell cycle progression at G1, S, and G2/M phases, with the Swe1-mediated delay in G2/M phase being most prominent in a calcineurin-dependent manner. Overall, the transcriptional responses to amiodarone revealed by this study were found to be distinct from other classes of antifungals, including the azole drugs, pointing toward a novel target pathway in combating fungal pathogenesis.

Fungal infections are a persistent problem, especially in immunocompromised patients undergoing treatment for AIDS, cancer, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases. Existing antifungal drugs have limitations in that there are relatively few classes with distinct mode of action; of these, the widely prescribed azole drugs are fungistatic and depend upon a healthy immune system for fungal clearance. The need for new drugs that combat resistance and improve the efficacy of existing antifungals is pressing. Amiodarone has been approved to treat ventricular arrhythmias since 1985. Pharmacological studies have shown its property as a cation channel blocker although it has multiple targets and a complex mechanism.

Similarly, 12.5 μm amiodarone elevated cytosolic Ca2+ in Trypansoma cruzi but not in the host Vero cells (3Benaim G. Sanders J.M. Garcia-Marchan Y. Colina C. Lira R. Caldera A.R. Payares G. Sanoja C.

Low levels of amiodarone (1-4 μm), within the therapeutic range achieved in patients, were reported to exhibit synergistic fungicidal effects with azole drugs against pathogenic species of fungi (Candida and Cryptococcus) and protozoa (Trypanosoma), suggesting that the drug may be useful as a sensitizing agent in antimicrobial therapy (5Gupta S.S.

A comprehensive view of the impact of amiodarone on microbial cellular pathways is prerequisite for its potential in vivo use as antifungal adjunct, and to understand mechanisms of drug toxicity and resistance. Phenotypic profiling of the set of S. cerevisiae single gene deletions for amiodarone hypersensitivity revealed the importance of genes involved in membrane trafficking and transport pathways, protein fate, and interaction with the cellular environment (5Gupta S.S. Ton V.K. Beaudry V. Rulli S. Cunningham K. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28831-28839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7Yadav J. Muend S. Zhang Y. Rao R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1480-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extending the analysis to include additional drugs (tunicamycin, sulfometuron methyl, wortmannin) and ion (Ca2+, Mn2+) stress revealed that the major cellular components responsive to drug toxicity and ion stress localize to the endomembrane system. Notably, disruption of calcium and proton homeostasis by deletion of PMR1 (Golgi Ca2+, Mn2+-ATPase) and VMA (endo-membrane/vacuolar H+-ATPase) genes led to multidrug hypersensitivity. Genes involved in ergosterol biogenesis (ERG6, ERG24), lipid flipping and remodeling (SAC1, LEM3, CDC50, OPI1), and compartmental trafficking (RIC1, COG6, VPS20) were important for growth tolerance to toxic drugs. Together, these represented the first line of defense against diverse forms of toxic stress. Phenotypic profiling of multidrug sensitivity also pointed to a significant transcriptional response: genes involved in chromatin remodeling (HAF4, SNF5, SNF6, SWI3), histone modification (HFI1, GCN5), and transcription activation (SUT2, SRB8, SIN4, HCM1, SIP3, SFP1, UGA3) were important for survival in amiodarone (7Yadav J. Muend S. Zhang Y. Rao R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1480-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To gain a global perspective on the impact of this drug on gene expression networks, we profiled the genome-wide transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae to amiodarone by DNA microarray. Our findings demonstrate a prominent overlap between amiodarone and calcium stress responses, consistent with the drug-induced Ca2+ burst reported earlier. Unexpectedly, transcriptional profiling revealed that amiodarone appeared to disrupt nutrient sensing and regulatory networks and delay cell cycle progression. In addition to Ca2+ stress, both cell cycle block and nutrient starvation may contribute to the antifungal mechanism of amiodarone. Yeast Strains, Media, and Amiodarone Treatment Conditions—Yeast deletion mutants (swe1Δ, cnb1Δ, crz1Δ), isogenic to BY4742, were from the MATα S. cerevisiae deletion library (Invitrogen). Yeast strains were grown in standard synthetic complete medium or YPD medium at 30 °C. Liquid cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm) and growth was determined by absorbance at 600 nm. Amiodarone (Sigma) was added from a stock solution of 50 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide to 100-ml log phase culture (OD 0.1, synthetic complete medium) to concentrations specified in the figure legends. Me2SO was added to 0.03% (v/v) in the control culture. These conditions were used for determination of doubling time, viability, DNA microarray, and fluorescent microscopy. To determine cell viability, samples were collected 10 min and 6 h after addition of amiodarone (15 μm) or Me2SO and equal numbers of cells for each treatment (determined after reading A600) were spread on YPD plates, incubated at 30 °C for 36 h before counting 500-1500 colonies to calculate cell viability. Microarray Hybridization and Bioinformatic Analysis—S. cerevisiae BY4742 strain was used for DNA microarray experiment. Culture and amiodarone treatment conditions are as described above. The Me2SO control samples were collected 10 min after Me2SO addition. The amiodarone-treated samples were collected 10 min and 6 h after amiodarone addition. Cells were spun down at 4000 rpm and flash-frozen after removing the supernatant. Two independent samples for each treatment (Me2SO control and amiodarone, 10 min and 6 h exposure) were collected and analyzed with DNA microarray. Total RNA was isolated by the hot acidic phenol extraction method as previously described (8Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. The integrity of the RNA samples was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cDNA synthesis, labeling and hybridization, image scanning, and processing were conducted at the Johns Hopkins Microarray Core Facility. Briefly, first and second strand cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and DNA polymerase I (Invitrogen). Biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized with T7 RNA Polymerase (ENZO Life Sciences, Inc.) and fragmented. Sample mixture was hybridized to Yeast Genome 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix). The arrays were stained and washed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and Mini_euk2V3_450 fluidics script. All arrays were scanned in the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and raw analysis performed with Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System (GCOS) 1.4. Subsequently microarray data were imported to GeneSpring 7.0 (Agilent Technologies) for normalization and analysis. Data for genes showing 2-fold or greater response to amiodarone were imported to Gene Cluster 3.0 (9de Hoon M.J. Imoto S. Nolan J. Miyano S.

Results were displayed with Java Tree View software and edited in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.). Geneset enrichment analyses were performed on the server at the Munich Information center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) data base (mips.gsf.de/proj/funcatDB/search_main_frame.html). Quantitative RT-PCR—Aliquots of the same RNA samples used for DNA microarray were saved for quantitative RT-PCR. 2The abbreviation used is: RT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCR The RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Roche Diagnostics) to remove residual genomic DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in a 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A dissociation curve was generated at the end of each PCR to verify that a single DNA species was amplified. ACT1 was amplified as the reference gene to calculate -fold change for genes of interest. All quantitative RT-PCR experiments were conducted in triplicate. Data were analyzed with Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems). -Fold changes and standard deviations were calculated with the standard curve method according to the manufacturer's instructions. reverse transcriptase-PCR Fluorescence Microscopy—For microscopy with FUN-1 (Invitrogen), BY4742 cells were exposed to amiodarone (15 μm) or Me2SO for 10 min or 6 h, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 50 μl of synthetic complete medium with 4 μm FUN-1 dye (diluted from a stock of 200 μm in dimethyl sulfoxide). Following incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, cells were examined under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Coolsnap fx camera. The fluorescent dye was excited by UV light. Conversion of FUN-1 into cylindrical intravacuolar structures was monitored by recording fluorescent micrographs at emission wavelengths of 645 nm (metabolically active and inactive cells) or 525 nm (metabolically inactive cells only). To monitor Crz1p translocation, crz1Δ yeast cells expressing GFP-Crz1 from plasmid pKK249 (15Kafadar K.A. Cyert M.S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were grown to OD 0.1 and treated with CaCl2 (50 mm) or amiodarone (15 μm) for specified time. Cells were collected by rapid centrifugation and visualized with the Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope at emission wavelength of 525 nm. A total of 300-500 cells were counted for each condition to calculate percentage of cells showing nuclear translocation of Crz1p. Nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Diagnostics). Pseudo-colorization was done with Adobe Photoshop. Flow Cytometry and Cell Cycle Manipulations—In experiments with asynchronous cultures, amiodarone (15 μm) and FK506 (1 μg/ml) were added to 200 ml of BY4742 yeast (OD 0.1) in YPD and samples collected at the specified time intervals. For cell cycle synchronization, 0.2 m hydroxyurea was used to arrest the yeast strains at S phase. The cells were then released into YPD medium for 15 min or 1 h before addition of amiodarone (15 μm). For flow cytometry, cultures were spun down, resuspended in 0.3 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer, and fixed by addition of 0.7 ml of ethanol (95%) at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells were washed with the above buffer once before treatment with RNase A solution (1 mg/ml in 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed once and stained with 1 μm SYTOX Green (Invitrogen) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Samples (20,000 cells) were analyzed with a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). Results were visualized with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR) and edited with Adobe Photoshop. Distribution of cell population in G1,S, and G2/M phases was calculated with FlowJo. Dose-dependent Growth Inhibition and Metabolic Arrest by Amiodarone—To reveal a substantive transcriptional response to amiodarone without eliciting secondary effects, we sought a drug concentration that would prolong the doubling time of the culture by 2-fold. Fig. 1A shows that addition of amiodarone to an exponentially growing yeast culture in synthetic complete medium caused a dose-dependent inhibition of growth, with a doubling time of 110 min in the absence of drug increasing progressively to 150 (9 μm), 170 (12 μm), 230 (15 μm), and 380 min (18 μm). Additional amiodarone completely inhibited growth. At 15 μm, amiodarone was moderately fungicidal, with a19 ± 2% decrease in colony forming units after a 10-min exposure to drug. Longer exposure times increased the fungicidal effect, with a loss in colony forming units of 34 ± 8% after 6 h. Similar effects were seen in cells loaded with the FUN-1 dye (16Millard P.J. Roth B.L. Thi H.P. Yue S.T. Haugland R.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which monitors loss of metabolic activity by a change in fluorescence from red cylindrical structures to diffuse green-yellow stain (Fig. 1B). Based on these results, we chose to monitor both early (10 min) and late (6 h) transcriptional response to a moderate dose of amiodarone (15 μm). Overview of Differentially Transcribed Genes—Within 10 min of exposure to 15 μm amiodarone, we observed differential transcription of 352 genes, using a 2-fold margin as cut-off. Of these, 218 gene transcripts increased, whereas 134 decreased (supplemental data Table 1S). At 6 h, the response was considerably muted, with 106 genes maintaining a ≥2-fold increase and only 9 genes remaining at ≥2-fold decrease. These data suggest that the transcriptional response reached its peak shortly after drug exposure and diminished over time, consistent with the fungicidal efficacy of the drug. Because this was confirmed using additional time intervals (not shown), we focused our analysis on the transcriptional response at 10 min of drug exposure. Relative to the yeast proteome, the differentially up-regulated gene products were significantly enriched in functional categories of metabolism (p value, 5.66 × 10-6) and energy production (p value, 4.56 × 10-9), with protein localization predominantly in membranes (plasma membrane and endo-membranes) and in peroxisomes, as shown in Fig. 2. In contrast, down-regulated genes were highly enriched in functional categories of cell cycle and DNA processing (p value, 1.19 × 10-7), cell type differentiation (p value, 1.60 × 10-5), and cell communication (p value, 2.49 × 10-5). Protein localization of down-regulated gene products showed significant enrichment in the yeast bud and cell periphery, whereas other cell compartments were represented at levels similar to the yeast proteome (Fig. 2). To validate our DNA microarray data, we performed real time quantitative PCR on 26 genes representing a variety of enriched functional categories. Results from real time PCR were in good agreement with DNA microarray results (supplemental data Table 2S), with -fold change in transcript levels being similar to, or greater than results from microarray. This indicated that the DNA microarray results faithfully represented the transcriptional response to amiodarone. Amiodarone Triggers a Large Transcriptional Response to Ca2+ Burst—Among the genes showing differential transcription in response to amiodarone, many are also known to respond to elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ (RCN1, ENA1-5, CMK1, CMK2, and GYP7), consistent with the drug-induced calcium burst reported previously (4Courchesne W.E. Ozturk S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Gupta S.S. Ton V.K. Beaudry V. Rulli S. Cunningham K. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28831-28839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that a large percentage of the amiodarone responsive gene set was also induced (137 of 218 genes; 63%) or repressed (77 of 134 genes; 57%) upon exposure to 200 mm CaCl2 (10Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). A hierarchical clustering analysis confirmed that the transcriptional response to amiodarone most closely resembled the response to high CaCl2 (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Amiodarone elicits a starvation response by a mechanism independent of Ca2+. A, hierarchical clustering of 343 genes that were up- or down-regulated by at least 2-fold when exposed to 15 μm amiodarone for 10 min. Other transcriptionally regulated genes included in this analysis were downloaded from the publisher's websites or requested from the authors: exposure to CaCl2 (5, 15, and 30 min), rapamycin (30 min), time course series for diauxic shift (successive samples 1-7 were collected between 9 and 20.5 h growth), amino acid starvation (0.5-6 h), nitrogen depletion (1 h and 5 days), and growth in YPD (2 h and 5 days). -Fold change values under each condition were log2 transformed and clustered with Gene Cluster 3.0 (9de Hoon M.J. Imoto S. Nolan J. Miyano S. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar). Distances between genes and arrays were computed based on correlation (centered). Both genes and arrays were clustered with average linkage method. The data were visualized with Java Tree View (36Saldanha A.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3246-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar). B, K-means clustering of 343 genes that were differentially regulated by at least 2-fold when exposed to 15 μm amiodarone for 10 min. Euclidean distance method was used to calculate similarity matrix. The set of 52 genes induced by amiodarone but not by Ca2+ is listed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transcription factor Crz1 is the major effector of calcineurin, a highly conserved Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase that couples Ca2+ signals to downstream responses. Analogous to the NFAT family of transcription factors in mammalian cells, yeast Crz1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and migrates to the nucleus where it induces expression of target genes in response to a Ca2+ signal. We monitored the intracellular localization of Crz1-GFP upon exposure to amiodarone (15 μm) and high CaCl2 (50 mm). There was an immediate relocalization of Crz1 to the nucleus upon addition of amiodarone, similar to but more transient than the effect of 50 mm extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3, B and C). Combined with the microarray data, this result demonstrates that amiodarone-induced Ca2+ influx is capable of mounting a robust downstream transcriptional response. Amiodarone Induces a Stress Response—Previous studies have identified a number of genes whose expression is altered under stress. In one study, expression of 216 genes was induced in response to seven stress conditions, namely heat, high salt, acid, alkali, H2O2, hyperosmolarity, and diauxic shift (17Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Of these, 54 gene transcripts (Fig. 3A and supplemental data Table 3S) were also induced by amiodarone, mostly as a response to Ca2+ stress; fewer (11 genes) were repressed in common with general stress response. Transcription of most (∼60%) of these 54 genes is under the control of the MSN2/MSN4 stress-regulated factors. This indicates that the cell initiates its defense mechanism to cope with amiodarone toxicity. Amiodarone Induces a Unique Nutrient Starvation Response—The majority of amiodarone-induced genes were involved in utilization of alternative carbon and nitrogen sources and mobilizing energy reserves (Table 1). This included genes for metabolizing the storage carbohydrates trehalose and glycogen (TPS2, GAC1, GLC3, GPH1, GSY1, GSY2, and others), fermenting non-glucose carbohydrates (FDH1, ACS1, ALD4, CYB2, and others), and metabolizing fatty acids (FOX2, POX1, POT1, ECI1, FAA2, CTA1, PXA1, PXA2, IDP3, TES1, and YPL156C). Concomitantly, we observed an induction of transporters for galactose (GAL2), maltose (MAL31), and high-affinity and moderate-affinity scavengers of glucose (HXT4, HXT5, and HXT6). Numerous genes involved in regulating glucose metabolism were up-regulated (MTH1, CAT8, REG2, NRG1, and MIG2) or repressed (STD1, CYR1, SRB8, MIG1, and GAL11) upon exposure to amiodarone. Similarly, genes under Nitrogen Catabolite Repression, including GAP1, MEP2, DAL80, DAL4, DAL7, PUT1, PUT4, UGA4, and PRB1, were derepressed. Induction of these genes is triggered by depletion of preferred nitrogen sources such as ammonium and glutamine. Collectively, the pattern of global transcriptional change induced by amiodarone is reminiscent of a starvation response. Indeed, hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that the transcriptional response within 10 min of exposure to amiodarone was similar to glucose and nitrogen starvation observed during stationary phase, rapamycin treatment, and late stages of diauxic shift and nitrogen depletion (Fig. 4A). Thus, the rapid and extensive re-programming of yeast metabolic networks to adapt to nutrient-limiting conditions, despite the availability of glucose and ammonium in the medium, suggests that amiodarone may disrupt nutrient sensing and regulatory circuitry.TABLE 1Enrichment of functional categories for genes up-regulated by amiodaroneFunctional categoryFrequency in amiodarone datasetGenome frequencyp value%Metabolism (83)38.024.65.66E-06C-compound & carbohydrate metabolism (44)20.18.231.24E-08Fatty acid metabolism (6)2.750.390.000148Energy (37)16.95.984.56E-09Fermentation (non-glucose) (9)4.120.763.23E-05Energy reserve metabolism (9)4.120.910.000136Oxidation of fatty acids (5)2.290.146.09E-06Cellular transport (42)19.216.90.197659Anion transport (5)2.290.420.001937Sugar transport (6)2.750.500.000659Amine/polyamine transport (3)1.370.220.012073Lipid/fatty acid transport (5)2.290.710.019083Drug/toxin transport (5)2.290.630.011668Cell rescue, defense, and virulence (28)12.89.030.034936Oxidative stress response (5)2.290.890.044778pH stress response (2)0.910.130.030590Heat shock response (3)1.370.320.032343Catalase reaction (2)0.910.030.001259 Open table in a new tab Comparison of the transcriptional profiles in response to amiodarone and CaCl2 by K-means clustering revealed a signature response of amiodarone; a cluster of 52 genes was induced at least 2-fold by amiodarone but not by CaCl2 (Fig. 4B). Of these, 25 genes are known to be activated upon carbon or nitrogen starvation and include key regulators of glucose metabolism (such as CAT8, MIG2, GAC1, MTH1, and REG2), high affinity glucose transporters (HXT4 and HXT6), and genes for alternative carbon metabolism (MAL31, MAL33, POT1, POX1, and others). Additionally, none of the glucose metabolism regulators (STD1, CYR1, SRB8, MIG1, and GAL11) repressed by amiodarone were repressed by CaCl2 (10Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We investigated, by quantitative RT-PCR, the expression of a subset of these genes upon exposure to 200 mm CaCl2: high levels of Ca2+ did not affect these nutrient-responsive genes, whereas expression of the calcium-responsive CMK2 was induced by 24-fold (supplemental data Table 2S). Together, these data indicate that amiodarone activates a starvation response by a mechanism independent of Ca2+ signaling. Amiodarone Blocks Cell Cycle Progression—Genes down-regulated by amiodarone were highly enriched in the category of cell cycle regulation (Table 2). Key cell cycle regulators included CLB6 (promoting DNA replication), CLB1 and CLB2 (promoting nuclear division), FKH2 (promoting G2/M transition), and SWI5 and ACE2 (promoting M/G1 transition). In addition, genes involved in the processes of DNA synthesis and replication, and cytokinesis were repressed. Other important cell cycle regulators, including CLB3, CLB4, and CLB5, were also repressed, albeit at lower levels (1.5-2-fold). To investigate if this large scale repression of cell cycle genes was mediated by Ca2+, we examined the DNA microarray dataset previously reported for calcium response (10Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K.

This dataset includes genes repressed by Ca2+ (200 mm) that have not been analyzed, to date.

https://openalex.org/W2050605263,"The Sprouty (Spry) proteins function as inhibitors of the Ras-ERK pathway downstream of various receptor tyrosine kinases. In this study, we have identified Tesk1 (testicular protein kinase 1) as a novel regulator of Spry2 function. Endogenous Tesk1 and Spry2 exist in a complex in cell lines and mouse tissues. Tesk1 coexpression relocalizes Spry2 to vesicles including endosomes, inhibiting its translocation to membrane ruffles upon growth factor stimulation. Independent of its kinase activity, Tesk1 binding leads to a loss of Spry2 function as an inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation and reverses inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)- and nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells by Spry2. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous Tesk1 in PC12 cells leads to a reduction in neurite outgrowth induced by bFGF. Tesk1 nullifies the inhibitory effect of Spry2 by abrogating its interaction with the adaptor protein Grb2 and interfering with its serine dephosphorylation upon bFGF and FGF receptor 1 stimulation by impeding its binding to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. A construct of Tesk1 that binds to Spry2 but does not localize to the vesicles does not interfere with its function, highlighting the importance of subcellular localization of Tesk1 in this context. Conversely, Tesk1 does not affect interaction of Spry2 with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, c-Cbl, and consequently, does not affect its inhibition of Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor. By selectively modulating the downstream effects of Spry2, Tesk1 may thus serve as a molecular determinant of the signaling outcome.

Conversely, Tesk1 does not affect interaction of Spry2 with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, c-Cbl, and consequently, does not affect its inhibition of Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor. By selectively modulating the downstream effects of Spry2, Tesk1 may thus serve as a molecular determinant of the signaling outcome. Sprouty (Spry) was first discovered in Drosophila as a negative feedback regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y.

Although the Spry proteins contain no known domains, they all have a unique, highly conserved Cys-rich C-terminal region. This sequence was not known to exist in any other protein until the discovery of Spred (Sprouty-related proteins with EVH1 domain) (5Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), of which three mammalian isoforms have been currently identified. Various isoforms of Spry and Spred are reported to be deregulated in cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, and liver (reviewed in Ref. 6Lo T.L. Fong C.W. Yusoff P. McKie A.B. Chua M.S.

A recent report that Spry2 regulates oncogenic K-Ras signaling (7Shaw A.T. Meissner A. Dowdle J.A. Crowley D. Magendantz M. Ouyang C. Parisi T. Rajagopal J. Blank L.J. Bronson R.T. Stone J.R.

Understanding their regulation and mechanism of action is thus a necessary step toward validating these proteins as therapeutic targets for disease treatment. Spry and Spred share several features, including extensive homology over their Cys-rich C terminus (8Guy G.R. Wong E.S. Yusoff P. Chandramouli S. Lo T.L. Lim J. Fong C.W. J.

Tesk1 belongs to a novel family of cofilin kinases comprising of two members (Tesk1 and 2) that share similarity with the LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3) kinases in the catalytic domain (18Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Takeuchi K. Mori R. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31449-31458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Tesk1 regulates actin dynamics in the context of cell adhesion and spreading downstream of integrin signaling by phosphorylating cofilin on the Ser residue at position 3, thereby inactivating it. Spry4 has previously been reported to bind to Tesk1 and negatively regulate its kinase activity, resulting in inhibition of cell spreading (14Leeksma O.C. Van Achterberg T.A. Tsumura Y. Toshima J.

In this study, we present evidence that Tesk1, in turn, is a novel regulator of Spry2 that differentially modulates its downstream effects. Plasmids—Rat Tesk1 and Tesk2 full-length constructs in pCAG-Myc vector have been described earlier (18Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Takeuchi K. Mori R. Mizuno K. J. Biol.

Full-length Spred1 and 2 amplified from mouse brain cDNA and Spry3 amplified from MCF-7 cDNA were cloned into pXJ40-FLAG mammalian expression vector (20Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C100 construct was generated by subcloning the yeast two-hybrid fragment into pXJ40-Myc. pXJ40-FLAG-Spry2-N and -C, pXJ40-HA-Ubiquitin, and EGFP-Rab7 were kind gifts from Chow Soah Yee, Dr. Fu Naiyang, and Dr. Zhou Zhihong. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid was performed using the Match Maker III system from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length Spred1 was subcloned into pGBK-T7 vector and used as bait on a pretransformed mouse brain library cloned into pACT2 vector. Positive clones were selected on triple dropout medium (lacking His/Leu/Trp) and further confirmed on high stringency quadruple dropout (lacking His/Leu/Trp/Ade). Plasmids were isolated, transformed into Escherichia coli DH10B and sequenced to identify and determine the reading frame of the clones. Open reading frames of positive in-frame clones were cloned into pXJ40 vector for expression in mammalian cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse (M2) and rabbit anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-Spry2 (N-terminal), anti-HA, and Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-tubulin were from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10), anti-EGFR (R1), and rabbit antibodies against FGFR1, EGFR, Myc, and Grb2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). EGF was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.

Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell Lines and Transfection—All cell lines used in this study were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). HEK293T, Cos1, and PC12 cells were cultured and maintained as described previously (21Lim J.

All cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described (10Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F. Fong C.W.

For the endogenous immunoprecipitation of cell lines and mouse tissue lysates, the samples were lysed in a HEPES-based lysis buffer (10Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F.

After extensive centrifugation, 5 mg (cell lines) or 10 mg (mouse tissue) of total protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 10 μg of rabbit anti-Spry2 (N-terminal) antibody or normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) as control. The resulting immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted with mouse anti-Tesk1 and rabbit anti-Spry2 (N-terminal) to detect the proteins. PC12 Neurite Outgrowth Assay—PC12 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and transfected with the various constructs indicated. 24 h post transfection, the cells were quiesced in medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum and subsequently stimulated with 50 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor for 4 days or nerve growth factor for 2 days. The cells were fixed and visualized as described below. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cos1 and PC12 cells were fixed, stained, and visualized essentially as described (21Lim J. Yusoff P. Wong E.S. Chandramouli S. Lao D.H. Fong C.W. Guy G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7953-7966Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Permeabilized cells were blocked overnight with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm each of CaCl2 and MgCl2, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 7% fetal bovine serum. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in the same solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h each. The images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss Microimaging). Short Hairpin RNA Knockdown—Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs against Tesk1 (catalog number TR308879) were purchased from Origene Technologies, Inc. The targeted sequences were: AAGTCATGGTGCTGAAGATGAACAAGCTC (#9), TTGGCCTGGATGTGCCTGCTTTCCGAACT (#10), CAGACAACTTCATCAGCACCTGTTCCTCG (#11), and AAGCCAGTCCTGCCTCTTGTGCCACCATC (#12). The plasmids containing the shRNA were transfected into 293T and PC12 cells using normal transfection methods described above. For PC12 cells, equal amounts of EGFP and shRNA plasmids were cotransfected in each experiment. Tesk1 Is a Common Interacting Partner to Spred and Spry—With the view that the nature of associated proteins will provide clues to the physiological function of newly discovered proteins such as Spred, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using an adult mouse brain library with full-length Spred1 as bait. One of the positive clones recovered from the screen encoded for the last 100 amino acid residues of Tesk1 (designated C100, Fig. 1A). When expressed in HEK293T cells, this fragment of Tesk1 coimmunoprecipitates with full-length Spred1 (Fig. 1B). Among the different regions of Spred1 (schematically shown in Fig. 1A), namely the EVH1 (residues 1-136), the kinase-binding domain (residues 137-332), and the Cys-rich region (C terminus; residues 333-444), C100 interacts strongly with the Cys-rich C terminus of Spred1 (Fig. 1C). Since the Cys-rich C terminus of Spred is conserved with that of the Spry proteins and a previous study reported that Spry4 interacts with Tesk1 through this region (19Tsumura Y. Toshima J. Leeksma O.C. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we sought to verify whether Tesk1 may be a common interacting partner to both of these protein families. Furthermore, as only the C-terminal fragment of Tesk1 was isolated in the screen, we wanted to validate this interaction in the context of the full-length protein. When coexpressed, all isoforms of Spry and Spred bind to full-length Tesk1 (Fig. 2A). A mutant of Tesk1 where the catalytic aspartate at position 170 is mutated to alanine (D170A) has been shown to lack kinase activity (22Toshima J. Tanaka T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12171-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We used this mutant (designated DA) and a truncation mutant where the last 100 residues equivalent to C100 were deleted (designated Tr528) to check whether (a) the kinase activity of Tesk1 might influence its binding to Spred and Spry and (b) the binding is mediated by the C-terminal tail of Tesk1. Although the DA mutant binds to Spred1 and Spry2 similar to WT Tesk1, Tr528 does not bind (Fig. 2B). Spry4 also showed a similar pattern of binding (data not shown). Thus, the binding seems to be mediated solely through the C-terminal 100 residues of Tesk1, independent of its kinase activity. Tesk2 is a closely related kinase to Tesk1 that shares about 70% similarity in the kinase domain (23Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The rest of their sequences have little similarity to each other except for three conserved regions designated CR1-3 (Fig. 1A). If the C terminus of Tesk1 mediated binding to Spry/Spred, it would be expected that Tesk2 would not bind as this region is not conserved between the two isoforms. This is indeed the case since none of the Spry or Spred isoforms binds to full-length Tesk2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Tesk1 is expressed at relatively high levels in testes and at lower levels in most other tissues and cell lines (18Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Takeuchi K. Mori R. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31449-31458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Toshima J. Koji T. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine whether Tesk1 interacts endogenously with Spry and Spred, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Spry2 from lysates of cell lines and mouse tissue and assayed for the presence of Tesk1 in the immunoprecipitates. Endogenous Tesk1 coimmunoprecipitates with Spry2 in mouse testes and brain tissue, indicating that these proteins form a complex in vivo.A complex was also detected in CHO-K1 cells but not in 293T cells (Fig. 2C). The other isoforms of Spry and Spred could not be tested due to a lack of specific antibodies. To study the downstream effects of Tesk1 interaction, we used Spry2 in the subsequent experiments as the result in Fig. 2C provided evidence of an endogenous complex with this isoform in addition to its being the best characterized and reportedly the strongest inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation (9Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.Y. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y. Leong H.F. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29993-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Yusoff P.

Tesk1 Alters the Subcellular Localization of Spry2—To determine whether Spry2 colocalized with Tesk1 in cells, we used indirect immunofluorescence to visualize their localization in Cos1 cells. Spry2 on its own localizes to microtubules and translocates to membrane ruffles upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 3A), as reported earlier (13Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2176-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, full-length Tesk1 WT and DA localize to vesicles irrespective of stimulation. Interestingly, the Tr528 mutant no longer localizes to the vesicles, suggesting that the C-terminal tail of Tesk1 may play a role in its own subcellular localization. The vesicular localization of Tesk1 has been previously reported (19Tsumura Y. Toshima J. Leeksma O.C. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the identity of these vesicles has not been determined. To this end, we costained the cells with markers for various subcellular compartments. A subset of the Tesk1-positive vesicles overlaps with the early endosomal markers EEA1 and Rab5 and the late endosomal marker Rab7 but not the Golgi marker GM130 or the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Fig. 3B). There was also no colocalization with the endoplasmic reticulum marker calreticulin or the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c (data not shown). We noted that a subpopulation of Tesk1 vesicles did not overlap with any of the markers used in this study, the identity of which remains to be determined. When coexpressed, Spry2 localizes to the vesicles with Tesk1 WT, and its translocation to membrane ruffles upon EGF stimulation is greatly reduced (Fig. 4, panels a and b). The DA mutant of Tesk1 has a similar effect to the WT, whereas the Tr528 does not affect Spry2 localization (panels c-f), indicating that this effect of Tesk1 is mediated by its binding rather than its kinase activity. The membrane translocation of Spry2 is known to be mediated by its Cys-rich C terminus (21Lim J. Yusoff P. Wong E.S. Chandramouli S. Lao D.H. Fong C.W. Guy G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7953-7966Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A fragment of Spry2 lacking this region (Spry2-N; residues 1-164) exhibits a cytoplasmic distribution both in the basal and the EGF-stimulated state in contrast to the Cys-rich region (Spry2-C; residues 165-315), which shows a clear translocation to the membrane upon stimulation (Fig. 5A). As reported previously, neither the N nor the C terminus of Spry2 alone exhibits the microtubular localization seen with the full-length protein (25Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After confirming that Spry2 binds to Tesk1 through its C terminus in an immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 5B), we determined the effect of Tesk1 coexpression on the localization of these constructs. Although the subcellular distribution of Spry2-N is not altered in the presence of Tesk1 (Fig. 5C, panels a and b), the change in the localization of Spry2-C reflects that of the full-length both in the basal and stimulated states (panels c and d). This is also in agreement with the earlier observation that the homologous region of Spred1 mediates the binding to Tesk1 (Fig. 1C). Tesk1 Negatively Regulates the Role of Spry2 as an Inhibitor of the Ras/ERK Pathway—One of the best known functions of Spry2 is as an inhibitor of the Ras/ERK pathway (8Guy G.R. Wong E.S. Yusoff P. Chandramouli S. Lo T.L. Lim J. Fong C.W. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We used two different systems to determine whether its interaction with Tesk1 had any influence on this function. In the first, cells cotransfected with Spry2 and Tesk1 were stimulated with bFGF, and the levels of phosphorylated ERK were assayed. As seen in Fig. 6A, although Spry2 on its own inhibits ERK phosphorylation compared with control levels (lanes 5 and 7), coexpression of Tesk1 reverses this effect (lane 8), whereas Tesk1 itself does not significantly affect the levels of phosphorylated ERK on its own. We further verified this effect of Tesk1 using overexpression of FGFR1, which is auto-activating, to reflect long term signaling as seen during oncogenesis and development. In this system as well, Tesk1 reverses the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by Spry2 (Fig. 6B, lanes 8 and 9). It appears that the kinase activity of Tesk1 does not play a role in this effect, since the kinase dead DA mutant has a similar effect to the WT (Fig. 6C, lane 15), whereas the Tr528 construct that retains its kinase activity, but no longer binds to Spry2, does not influence its function (Fig. 6C, lane 17). Tesk1 Rescues Neurite Outgrowth Inhibited by Spry2 in PC12 Cells—One of the widely studied downstream consequences of the Ras/ERK inhibitory effect of Spry2 is its inhibition of bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth in the rat pheochromocytoma cells, PC12 (9Lao D.H.

To establish whether the reversal of its ERK inhibition by Tesk1 translated to a cellular context, we studied the effect of Tesk1 and Spry2 coexpression in PC12 cells. As previous reports in the literature have highlighted the tight regulation on cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in neurite outgrowth (30Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Endo M. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13692-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we wanted to avoid interference from the cofilin kinase activity of Tesk1 in this assay. To this end, we used the kinase dead DA mutant of Tesk1 because it still binds to Spry2 and reverses its inhibition of ERK phosphorylation similar to WT Tesk1. When expressed in PC12 cells, Spry2 almost completely abrogates bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 7A, panel a). Although Tesk1 DA does not affect neurite outgrowth on its own under the same conditions (panel b), it restores neurite outgrowth in these cells in the presence of Spry2 (panel c). As further evidence, we also studied the differentiation of PC12 cells in response to NGF. The result in Fig. 7B shows that similar to the case with bFGF, Spry2 also inhibits neurite outgrowth induced by NGF (panel a), which is reversed by coexpression of Tesk1 DA (panel c). If Tesk1 indeed antagonizes the inhibitory effect of Spry2, it follows that endogenous Tesk1 may play a positive role in this process. To determine whether this is the case, we used shRNA to kno"
https://openalex.org/W2152771882,"Background Nearly 20% of human cancers worldwide have an infectious etiology with the most prominent examples being hepatitis B and C virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and human papilloma virus-associated cervical cancer. There is an urgent need to find new approaches to treatment and prevention of virus-associated cancers. Methodology/Principal Findings Viral antigens have not been previously considered as targets for treatment or prevention of virus-associated cancers. We hypothesized that it was possible to treat experimental HPV16-associated cervical cancer (CC) and Hepatitis B-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by targeting viral antigens expressed on cancer cells with radiolabeled antibodies to viral antigens. Treatment of experimental CC and HCC tumors with 188Re-labeled mAbs to E6 and HBx viral proteins, respectively, resulted in significant and dose-dependent retardation of tumor growth in comparison with untreated mice or mice treated with unlabeled antibodies. Conclusions/Significance This strategy is fundamentally different from the prior uses of radioimmunotherapy in oncology, which targeted tumor-associated human antigens and promises increased specificity and minimal toxicity of treatment. It also raises an exciting possibility to prevent virus-associated cancers in chronically infected patients by eliminating cells infected with oncogenic viruses before they transform into cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2151000710,"Snf1, the yeast AMP kinase homolog, is essential for derepression of glucose-repressed genes that are activated by Adr1. Although required for Adr1 DNA binding, the precise role of Snf1 is unknown. Deletion of histone deacetylase genes allowed constitutive promoter binding of Adr1 and Cat8, another activator of glucose-repressed genes. In repressed conditions, at the Adr1-and Cat8-dependent ADH2 promoter, partial chromatin remodeling had occurred, and the activators recruited a partial preinitiation complex that included RNA polymerase II. Transcription did not occur, however, unless Snf1 was activated, suggesting a Snf1-dependent event that occurs after RNA polymerase II recruitment. Glucose regulation persisted because shifting to low glucose increased expression. Glucose repression could be completely relieved by combining the three elements of 1) chromatin perturbation by mutation of histone deacetylases, 2) activation of Snf1, and 3) the addition of an Adr1 mutant that by itself confers only weak constitutive activity."
https://openalex.org/W2154876876,"GABAA receptors can be modulated by benzodiazepines, although these compounds do not directly activate or inhibit the receptors. The prototypic benzodiazepine, diazepam, potentiates responses to GABA in GABAA receptors that contain a γ subunit. Here we have used mutagenesis, radioligand binding, voltage clamp electrophysiology, and homology modeling to probe the role of the F-loop residues Asp192-Arg197 in the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit in diazepam potentiation of the GABA response. Substitution of all of these residues with Ala and/or a residue with similar chemical properties to the wild type residue decreased the level of diazepam potentiation, and one mutation (D192A) resulted in its complete ablation. None of the mutations changed the GABA EC50 or the [3H]flumazenil binding affinity, suggesting they do not affect GABA or benzodiazepine binding characteristics; we therefore propose that they are involved in the diazepam-mediated conformational change that results in an increased response to GABA. Homology models of the receptor binding pocket in agonist-bound and unbound states suggest that the F-loop is flexible and has different orientations in the two states. Considering our data in relation to these models, we find that the F-loop residues could contribute to hydrogen bond networks and hydrophobic interactions with neighboring residues that change during receptor activation.

Each receptor has a pentameric structure, often comprising 2α1, 2β2, and a γ2 subunit, although many other subunit combinations are possible. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult mammalian brain, and it is therefore not surprising that its malfunction is implicated in a number of disorders in which normal brain inhibition is disrupted, including epilepsy, insomnia, and anxiety-related conditions. Many drugs used to treat these disorders target GABAA receptors, including anesthetics, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines (1Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 245-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). γ-aminobutyric acid, type A γ-aminobutyric acid acetylcholine acetylcholine-binding protein 5-hydroxytryptamine human embryonic kidney. γ-aminobutyric acid, type A γ-aminobutyric acid acetylcholine acetylcholine-binding protein 5-hydroxytryptamine human embryonic kidney. Benzodiazepine agonists potentiate GABAA receptor-mediated GABA currents, whereas inverse agonists inhibit GABA responses, and antagonists competitively block the action of other benzodiazepines. Diazepam is the prototypical benzodiazepine agonist and potentiates the GABA response by increasing the channel opening frequency of the receptor (1Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 245-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). More recently, Rusch and Forman (2Rusch D. Forman S.A. Anesthesiology. 2005; 102: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) used constitutively partially open channels to show that the classical benzodiazepine agonists diazepam and midazolam, and an inverse agonist (FG7142), altered currents through the receptors in the absence of GABA, supporting previous evidence that benzodiazepines contribute directly to channel gating by altering the open-close equilibrium of the receptor (3Campo-Soria C. Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 148: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 4Downing S.S. Lee Y.T. Farb D.H. Gibbs T.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 145: 894-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Numerous binding studies have shown that GABA can stimulate benzodiazepine binding and that in turn benzodiazepines can alter GABA binding, confirming the allosteric links between GABA and benzodiazepine-binding sites (1Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 245-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), and recently benzodiazepine-induced structural changes in the receptor have been identified (5Kloda J.H. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, while details of the residues involved in the benzodiazepine binding area have been identified (e.g. see Ref. 6Sancar F. Ericksen S.S. Kucken A.M. Teissere J.A. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism by which benzodiazepines mediate their effects is not yet clear. Some of the machinery involved in coupling ligand binding to channel gating in the Cys-loop receptors is located at the extracellular/transmembrane interface (7Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 8Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L.

Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar), and coupling of benzodiazepine agonist binding to allosteric modulation also appears to involve residues at this interface (12Boileau A.J. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise regions of the protein that may be involved in this modulation, however, remain unclear, although the flexible F-loop lies within a few angstroms of both the binding site and the extracellular/transmembrane interface and is therefore a good candidate. To probe the role of the F-loop, here we explore the role of six amino acids that constitute this loop in the γ2 subunit; the data show that these residues play an important role in coupling binding of benzodiazepines to their allosteric effects. Materials—All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, except fetal calf serum, which was from Labtech International (Ringmer, UK). [3H]Flumazenil (87.0 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained on 90-mm tissue culture plates at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix F-12 (1:1) with GlutaMAX™ I and 10% fetal calf serum. For radioligand binding studies, cells in 90-mm dishes were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation at 80-90% confluency and routinely incubated for 3 days before use (13Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis reactions were performed using the method of Kunkel (14Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar) using human GABAA receptor subunit DNA (the kind gift of Keith Wafford, Merck Sharp and Dohme) in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the recommendations of Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.54-15.56Google Scholar) and some suggestions of the Primer Generator (16Turchin A. Lawler Jr., J.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A silent restriction site was incorporated into each primer to assist rapid identification. Radioligand Binding—This was undertaken as described previously in HEK 293 cells, which provide an established and robust method of studying ligand binding (17Lummis S.C. Sepulveda M.I. Kilpatrick G.J. Baker J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 243: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Klein R.L. Whiting P.J. Harris R.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2349-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK 293 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) with proteinase inhibitors and frozen at -20 °C. After thawing, they were washed twice with HEPES buffer and resuspended, and 50 μg of cell membranes was incubated in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer containing the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]flumazenil. Saturation binding (eight point) assays were performed on at least three separate plates of transfected cells for each mutant using 0.1-40 nm [3H]flumazenil. Nonspecific binding was determined using 1 μm diazepam. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and terminated by rapid vacuum filtration using a Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine followed by two rapid washes with 4 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6000sc). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin standards. Data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting (Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego) according to the equation, B = (Bmax × [L])/(Kd + [L]), where B is bound radioligand; Bmax is maximum binding at equilibrium; Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant; [L] is the free concentration of radioligand. Values are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance in conjunction with a Dunnett's post test. Xenopus Oocyte Isolation and mRNA Injection—Harvested stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared as described previously. Oocytes, which are well suited to the study of ligand-gated ion channels, especially those constituted from multiple subunits, were injected with 1:1:10 α:β:γ mRNA, generated by in vitro transcription using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) from DNA subcloned into pGEMHE (19Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Oocytes were maintained in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing gentamycin (0.1 mg/ml), theophylline (0.12 mg/ml), and tetracycline (50 μg/ml). Electrophysiological measurements were routinely performed ∼48 h post-injection, which yielded optimal diazepam potentiation. Electrophysiology—Using a two electrode voltage clamp, Xenopus oocytes were routinely clamped at -60 mV using an OC-725 amplifier (Warner Instruments), and currents were digitized by the Digitizer132A interface (Axon Instruments). Micro-electrodes were constructed from borosilicate glass (GC120TF-10, Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent, UK) using a two-stage horizontal pull (Sutter P-87, Novato, CA) and filled with 3 m KCl. Pipette resistances ranged from 0.3 to 3 megohms. Oocytes were perfused with ND96 buffer at a rate of 9 ml/min. Drug application was at 3-5-min intervals via a simple gravity-fed system calibrated to run at the same rate. For diazepam potentiation experiments, an EC10 [GABA] was applied followed by EC10 [GABA] with diazepam and then another EC10 [GABA]. Responses were recorded using Win-WCP freeware. Statistical comparison of EC50 values was performed using a one-way analysis of variance with the Dunnett's post test using Prism software. Modeling—This was performed as described previously (20Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Thompson A.J. Padgett C.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16576-16582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GABAA receptor subunit sequences were aligned to the AChBP sequence using FUGUE (22Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional models of the extracellular region of the GABAA receptor were then built using MODELLER version 7.2 (23Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) by threading the aligned sequence over the crystal structure of AChBP in the unbound and agonist-bound states (PDB codes 2byn and 2byq). The most energetically favorable models were selected from the MODELLER output file using the Modelist program and checked for violations of the Ramachandran plot using RAMPAGE. F-loop Mutations Do Not Affect GABA EC50 Values, Diazepam EC50 Values, or [3H]Flumazenil Kd Values—Wild type GABAA receptors (α1β2γ2L) had a GABA EC50 of 30 μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.5 (Table 1). Amino acid substitutions at the γ2 F-loop resulted in no significant changes to GABA EC50 values or Hill coefficients compared with wild type receptors. Amino acid substitutions also revealed no significant changes in [3H]flumazenil binding affinity at any of the six residues mutated (Table 1). Bmax values varied considerably (50-800 fmol/mg protein), probably because of differences in transfection efficiencies, but none were significantly different from wild type.TABLE 1Parameters for wild type and mutant receptors Data = mean ± S.E., n = 3–10.

Responses above this concentration decreased as reported previously (24Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084PubMed Google Scholar). EC50 values for all F-loop mutant receptors tested were not significantly different to wild type, except for D192A (Table 1). Asp192 replacement by Ala completely ablated the response to diazepam, and replacement with the chemically similar Glu reduced the maximal potentiation to 20% of a wild type response (Fig. 2A and Table 2). This suggests a specific and critical role of this residue.TABLE 2Diazepam potentiation of F-loop mutants Data is normalized to wild type receptors (170% potentiation). Data = mean ± S.E., n = 3–9. * indicates statistically different from wild type, p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Replacement of Thr193 with either Ala or Ser reduced the maximal diazepam potentiation to ∼50% that of wild type (Fig. 2B). Diazepam enhancement curves with both these mutant receptors were very similar, indicating that the hydroxyl group of Thr is probably not critical here, as replacement with Ser, which also has such a group, was no more efficacious than Ala. Replacement of Arg194 with Ala resulted in no change to the diazepam potentiation curves. However, replacement of this residue with Lys, which has similar chemical properties to Arg, decreased potentiation to ∼20% that of wild type (Fig. 2C). Because this was an unexpected result, we also explored substitution with Asn and Gln. Potentiation curves from both these mutant receptors were very similar to Lys, although the maximum potentiation produced by Gln was slightly higher. These data suggest that Arg has a specific interaction here, although it can be replaced efficiently by a much smaller residue. Replacement of Ser193 with either Ala or Thr reduced the maximal diazepam potentiation to ∼70 and ∼20%, respectively. This suggests that the size of the residue located here may be more critical than its chemical properties, as replacement with Thr, which has a hydroxyl group like Ser, was more inhibitory than Ala, and even ablated diazepam potentiation below 300 nm (Fig. 2D). Replacement of Trp196 with Phe had no effect on the level of diazepam potentiation, but substitution of this residue by Tyr decreased the maximum potentiation to ∼15% of WT. The effect of Ala substitution was intermediate, reducing the maximum potentiation to ∼70% of WT (Fig. 2E). Replacement of Arg197 with either Ala or Lys reduced the maximal diazepam potentiation to ∼30% that of wild type (Fig. 2F). Diazepam enhancement curves were very similar for both these mutant receptors, indicating that a positive charge is not critical here, and that Arg has a specific interaction that cannot be replaced by a residue with similar chemical properties. Molecular Modeling—Homology modeling and ligand docking in Cys-loop receptors is being increasingly used to predict molecular interactions, but as there are as yet no high resolution structures of any complete Cys-loop receptors, the data obtained must be viewed with caution. This is particularly important for the F-loop region, which is largely flexible, making it difficult to assign residue locations with certainty, even in the different AChBPs whose structures have been resolved to atomic resolution. Such studies, however, can lead to useful testable hypotheses, and thus, as long as the limitations of such studies are appreciated, they can be extremely useful. Here F-loop modeling studies, using both agonist-free and agonist-bound Aplysia AChBP as templates, suggested some interesting potential interactions of some of the F-loop residues: Trp196 may act as a pin to restrict local protein movement in a hydrophobic region, while Asp192, Thr193, Arg194, Thr195, and Arg197 may contribute to hydrogen bonding networks that differ in the bound and unbound states (Fig. 3). The data reveal that the F-loop of the human GABAA receptor γ2 subunit has a key role in the potentiation of the GABA response by diazepam; substitution of residues Asp192-Arg197 with Ala and/or a residue with similar chemical properties alters the level of diazepam potentiation (Table 2), although only one mutation (D192A) resulted in a complete ablation of potentiation. These are discussed in more detail below. None of the mutations changed [3H]flumazenil binding affinity, suggesting they do not have a significant impact on benzodiazepine binding characteristics; we therefore propose that they are primarily involved in the conformational change that results in an increased GABA-mediated response. Homology models of the receptor binding pocket in agonist-bound and unbound states suggest that the F-loop is flexible, and that there are some differences in residue orientations in the two states. Considering our data in relation to these models show that the F-loop residues could contribute to hydrogen bond networks and hydrophobic interactions with neighboring residues that may change during receptor activation. Asp192 Contributes to a Hydrogen Bond Network—The data suggest a very specific role for Asp192 in diazepam modulation of the GABAA receptor. Mutation of Asp192 to Ala completely abolished diazepam enhancement of GABA currents, and replacement with the chemically similar Glu reduced receptor responsiveness to diazepam by 40%. However, replacement by Asn resulted in receptors that were similar to wild type. These data suggest that a negative charge is not required at this position for maximal potentiation but that size and/or hydrogen bonding ability are critical. Examination of the models reveal a possible explanation for these data, hydrogen bonds that contribute to a hydrogen bonding network. The unbound model shows the carboxylate side chain of Asp192 has the potential to form two hydrogen bonds, one with Asn208 and the other with Thr209 (Fig 3A, panel i). Replacement of Asp192 with Glu would extend the length of the side chain, which would allow only one of these hydrogen bonds to form (Fig 3A, panel ii), whereas replacement with Asn could replace both (Fig 3A, panel iii) and Ala neither (Fig 3A, panel iv). In the bound form Asp192 is in a different orientation, facing the subunit interface. However it still has the potential to hydrogen bond here, this time with Val190 (data not shown). We suggest that these networks of hydrogen bonds are critical for benzodiazepine potentiation, and that their partial or complete removal compromises the response of the receptor to diazepam. An aspartate residue may be important in the F-loop of all Cys-loop receptors. Ligand binding and/or function is disrupted by mutations to Asp residues in the F-loop of nicotinic AChγ (Asp203), δ (Asp208), and ϵ (Asp202) receptor subunits, and GABAA α1 (Asp183) and 5-HT3A (Asp204) receptor subunits (21Thompson A.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13166-13172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These residues may have equivalent roles to Asp192, although both Clustal and FUGUE alignments of complete receptor subunits suggest they are not in equivalent locations. This may, however, be due to poor alignment of the F-loop region due to poor conservation here. A Clustal alignment of the F-loop region alone supports this hypothesis by aligning these Asp residues (Fig. 4A). Trp196 Makes a Hydrophobic Contribution to Diazepam Potentiation—Hydrophobicity appears important at position 196. Phe, which has similar hydrophobicity to Trp, does not change the maximum potentiation. Ala, which is less hydrophobic and less bulky, also performs reasonably well at this location (∼50% of WT potentiation), although surprisingly Tyr does not; it yields a maximal potentiation of only 20% of a wild type. However, Tyr is a polar residue; it is reasonably acidic and it can hydrogen bond; thus it appears that one or more of these characteristics is detrimental to receptor function. Investigation of homology models of the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit, based on both the bound and unbound versions of AChBP, reveal that Trp196 faces toward the principal subunit across the interface. This was unexpected considering the strong evidence that hydrophobicity is important at this position for diazepam modulation; we would expect to find the residue buried within the protein. Further examination of the model, however, reveals that Trp196 is located in a groove in the neighboring α subunit, where it could participate in both hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions (Fig. 3B). Thus Trp 196 could as a pin to restrict the movement of this end of the loop, and perhaps may even serve as a rigid pivot point. Either or both of these possibilities would mean that replacement with a residue that has different chemical properties could be distinctly unfavorable. Other F Loop Residues—Data from mutations of the other F-loop residues suggest specific interactions of Arg194 and Arg197, as replacement of both with the chemically similar Lys reveal similar decreases in the levels of diazepam potentiation, although Ala can efficiently replace Arg194 indicating a small residue is well tolerated here. The bound model reveals that these two arginines may form part of a critical hydrogen bond network required for effective F-loop function (Fig. 3C). Arg197 appears to be central to this network, with the potential to contribute up to five hydrogen bonds to Thr193, Arg194, and Tyr199. An alanine substitution at position 194 would be well tolerated as the hydrogen bond involves the backbone carbonyl, although substitution with a more bulky residue such as lysine could disrupt the backbone architecture. Similarly substitution of Arg197 would significantly disrupt the hydrogen bond network, and as our results show, neither Lys nor Ala mutations are well tolerated here. Interestingly, replacement of Thr193 with Ala or Ser yielded almost identical decreases in the levels of potentiation (40-50% of WT), as would be expected by overreaching (in the case of Ser) or falling short (Ala) of the distance required to hydrogen bond. The data suggest that Thr193 may also contribute to a different hydrogen bonding network in the unbound state, suggesting a change in orientation of this residue between the agonist-free and agonist-bound receptor binding states, as described for Asp192 above. This “unbound state” network also appears to involve Ser195, which could explain why a small residue (Ala) was well tolerated at this position, although the chemically similar Thr resulted in an 80% decrease in potentiation. Thus we propose that F-loop hydrogen bonding networks are important in both the unbound and bound states of the receptor for efficient benzodiazepine modulation. F-loop Flexibility May Be Key to Allosteric Modulation—The models appear to be able to explain many of the results we have obtained, providing support for them. Of course, data from homology models must be viewed with some caution, and this is especially true in this region where there are few elements of secondary structure (7Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

However, this lack of secondary structure suggests that this region is flexible, and we propose this could be the key to its function, allowing the F-loop to undergo structural rearrangements that result in or occur during channel gating. There is support for this hypothesis from other Cys-loop receptors; pentobarbital activation of GABAA receptors resulted in methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium modification of Cys residues substituted for Val180 (aligns with Asp192) and Ala181 (Thr193) in the α1 GABAA receptor subunit, suggesting that these regions undergo structural changes (exposing the residues to chemical modification) during ligand binding and/or channel gating (12Boileau A.J. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and movement in two regions of the F-loop has also been reported to occur in the 5-HT3 receptor (21Thompson A.J. Padgett C.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16576-16582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This conservation of F-loop flexibility, combined with its critical role in Cys-loop receptor function, and at least one conserved residue (Asp), would not be inconsistent with there being a similar structure for all F-loops; however, current techniques preclude testing such a hypothesis. Interestingly our data suggest the F-loop needs to be precisely positioned in both bound and unbound versions of the receptor for efficient enhancement of GABA-mediated responses. If, as previously discussed, benzodiazepines act through modification of channel architecture and/or function (2Rusch D. Forman S.A. Anesthesiology. 2005; 102: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Boileau A.J. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Karobath M. Supavilai P.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8056-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the F-loop is ideally positioned to act as a conduit. It is located at the base of the binding site close to the Cys-loop, β1-β2 loop, β8-β9 loop, the β10 region of the extracellular domain (Fig. 4B), and the M2-M3 loop and M1 region of the transmembrane domain, all of which are implicated in coupling ligand binding to channel gating. We hypothesize that the F-loop may directly contact and influence these interface residues. In conclusion we have shown that residues in the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit F-loop affect diazepam modulation of GABA responses. We propose that Asp192, Ser193, Thr194, and Arg197 make critical contributions to hydrogen bond networks, and a hydrophobic residue is necessary at position 196. Data from homology models indicate the F-loop is highly flexible, and that it is in distinct locations in bound and unbound states of the receptor; our data suggest that destabilizing the F-loop in either of these states decreases diazepam modulation. We propose that the flexibility of the F-loop may allow this region to modify interactions between the interface loops, and thereby enhance responses to GABA in the presence of diazepam.

https://openalex.org/W2013182838,"The human brain and skull are three dimensional (3D) anatomical structures with complex surfaces. However, medical images are often two dimensional (2D) and provide incomplete visualization of structural morphology. To overcome this loss in dimension, we developed and validated a freely available, semi-automated pathway to build 3D virtual reality (VR) and hand-held, stereolithograph models. To evaluate whether surface visualization in 3D was more informative than in 2D, undergraduate students (n = 50) used the Gillespie scale to rate 3D VR and physical models of both a living patient-volunteer's brain and the skull of Phineas Gage, a historically famous railroad worker whose misfortune with a projectile tamping iron provided the first evidence of a structure-function relationship in brain. Using our processing pathway, we successfully fabricated human brain and skull replicas and validated that the stereolithograph model preserved the scale of the VR model. Based on the Gillespie ratings, students indicated that the biological utility and quality of visual information at the surface of VR and stereolithograph models were greater than the 2D images from which they were derived. The method we developed is useful to create VR and stereolithograph 3D models from medical images and can be used to model hard or soft tissue in living or preserved specimens. Compared to 2D images, VR and stereolithograph models provide an extra dimension that enhances both the quality of visual information and utility of surface visualization in neuroscience and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2030376130,"The early stages of vertebrate development depend heavily on control of maternally transcribed mRNAs that are stored for long periods in complexes termed messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) and utilized selectively following maturation and fertilization. The transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is associated with cytoplasmic mRNPs in vertebrate oocytes; however, the mechanism by which any of the mRNP proteins associate with mRNA in the oocyte is unknown. Here we demonstrate the mechanism by which YY1 associates with mRNPs depends on its direct RNA binding activity. High affinity binding for U-rich single-stranded RNA and A:U RNA duplexes was observed in the nanomolar range, similar to the affinity for the cognate double-stranded DNA-binding element. Similar RNA binding affinity was observed with endogenous YY1 isolated from native mRNP complexes. In vivo expression experiments reveal epitope-tagged YY1 assembled into high molecular mass mRNPs, and assembly was blocked by microinjection of high affinity RNA substrate competitor. These findings present the first clues to how mRNPs assemble during early development."

Interestingly, most of the snoRNAs are not essential in yeast, except those involved in cleavage reactions, which include, in addition to box C/D U3 and U14, box H/ACA snR10 and snR30. U3 is encoded by two genes in S. cerevisiae, snR17A and snR17B, and at least one copy is essential for cell viability. These U3 genes are transcribed by RNA pol II and contain introns but are not polyadenylated. Instead, the U3 snoRNA 3′-end is formed after Rnt1p endonucleolytic cleavage (23Kufel J. Allmang C.

Dickmanns A. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8342-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although it is thought to be recruited by Snu13p, Nop1p has been shown to associate specifically with actively transcribed box C/D snoRNA coding genes (31Morlando M. Ballarino M. Greco P.

O'Keefe R.T. RNA. 2004; 10: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), participating in two different RNA processing pathways, rRNA processing and splicing. In addition to the five small nuclear RNPs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6), other protein factors participate in splicing, among them the NTC complex, which is involved in stabilization of U6 snRNA and pre-mRNA base pairing and release of Lsm proteins (34Chan S.P.

Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and sequenced by the Big Dye method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cloning strategies were as follows. CWC24 gene, encoded by the YLR323C open reading frame, was PCR-amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using primers 5′-CAAAGCTCCAGGAATTCATG-3′ and 5′-GTTGATATGGGATCCTCCAT-3′. For the two-hybrid assays, the PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pBTM116 (40Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and pGAD-C2 (41James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes, generating pBTM-CWC24 and pGAD-CWC24 (which code for the fusions BD-Cwc24p and AD-Cwc24p, respectively, where BD refers to the LexA DNA binding domain and AD refers to the Gal4p transcription activation domain). Plasmid pACT-CWC24 was isolated from a cDNA library obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 87002) and consists of a GAL4-Cwc24p-(6–260) fusion (the numbers in parentheses refer to Cwc24p amino acid residues encoded by the plasmid). For heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, pGEX-CWC24 (which expresses GST-Cwc24p fusion protein) was generated through the insertion of an EcoRI-BamHI fragment into pGEX (GE Healthcare). Vector pET28a-CEF1 (which expresses His-Cef1p fusion protein) was generated by the insertion of a PCR-amplified BamHI-SalI DNA fragment containing the CEF1 gene into pET28a (Novagen), digested with BamHI and XhoI. YCp111GAL-CWC24, which carries CWC24 under the control of the GAL1 promoter, was obtained by inserting a fragment from pBTM-CWC24 digested with EcoRI (following filling in with T4 DNA polymerase) and PstI into YCp111-GAL digested with NdeI (following T4 DNA polymerase 3′ overhang removal) and PstI. To determine the subcellular localization of Cwc24p by fluorescence microscopy, the plasmid pGFP-N-FUS-CWC24 was constructed by first cloning CWC24 into pBS, after digestion of the plasmid with EcoRI and SmaI, and inserting a SmaI-SalI fragment from the latter vector into pGFP-N-FUS (42Niedenthal R.K.

Strains described in Table 2 were maintained in yeast extract-peptone medium (YP) or synthetic medium (YNB) with 2% (w/v) galactose or glucose as carbon source as indicated and supplemented with amino acids when required. Yeast cells were transformed using a lithium acetate method (44Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics.

A Δcwc24 diploid strain (2n, CWC24/cwc24::kanR) obtained from Euroscarf was transformed with YCp111GAL-CWC24, induced to sporulation (growth in 1% potassium acetate, 0.005% zinc acetate medium), and spore separation was performed as described elsewhere (44Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Strains CWC24 and Δcwc24/GAL1::CWC24 were grown in galactose-containing medium to stationary phase, and cell suspension was 10-fold concentrated and plated in glucose containing medium in a 10-fold serial dilution (Fig. 3A).TABLE 2List of yeast strains used in this workStrainRelevant featuresReference L40 MATa his3d200 trp1-901 leu2-3,311 ade2 lys2-801am URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 Ref. 45Vojtek A.B.

Wild type CWC24 strain was also used as a control. Cells were grown in galactose-containing medium overnight until stationary phase and then shifted to glucose medium. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Fusion proteins with either LexA DNA binding domain (BD-protein) or Gal4p transcription activation domain (AD-protein) were expressed in the host strain L40 (45Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 225: 331-342Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar), which has two reporter genes for two-hybrid interactions integrated into the genome: yeast HIS3 and E. coli lacZ. Transformants were plated in minimal medium lacking histidine as a first selection, and viable clones were further tested for β-galactosidase activity, as described below. Exponentially growing cultures in minimal medium (supplemented with histidine) were 10-fold concentrated and either transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated overnight at 30 °C for β-galactosidase activity assay (45Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 225: 331-342Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or plated in His- medium in a 10-fold serial dilution. β-Galactosidase activity in cell extracts generated in buffer Z was quantitated using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (40Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Strain L40-41 was used as a positive control, and strain YMG-222 was used as negative control for two-hybrid interaction (Table 2). Immunofluorescence Analysis—In order to determine its subcellular localization, Cwc24p was expressed in the strain YMG-224 with an NH2-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag, encoded by the plasmid pGFP-N-FUS-CWC24. DNA in the cell nucleus was stained using Hoechst. Localization of GFP was analyzed in the strain YMG-225 as a control. Protein Pull-down and Immunoblot Analysis—In the pull-down assay, cellular extracts generated in phosphate-buffered saline of E. coli cells expressing either GST or GST-Cwc24p (TE1; see Fig. 1) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 250 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), and the unbound (FT1) material was washed. Beads where then incubated with cellular extract containing His-Nop17p or His-Cef1p (TE2; not shown), flow-through was collected (FT2), and beads were once again washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted (B) with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with anti-polyhistidine antibody (GE Healthcare), anti-GST antiserum (Sigma), anti-Cwc24p antiserum, or anti-Nop17p antiserum, and the immunoblots were developed using the ECL system (GE Healthcare). To analyze the presence of Cwc24p in the strain Δcwc24/GAL1::CWC24 grown at the restrictive condition, yeast cells were collected at various times after medium shift and broken with glass beads. Immunoblot of the cellular extracts was conducted as described above, and the membrane was additionally incubated with anti-Nip7 as an internal control. RNA Analysis—Exponentially growing cultures of yeast strains were shifted from galactose to glucose medium. At various times, samples were collected and quickly frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath. Total RNA was isolated from yeast cells by a modified hot phenol method (39Gonzales F.A. Zanchin N.I.T. Luz J.S. Oliveira C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RNAs were separated by electrophoresis (20 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane) on 1.3% agarose gels, following denaturation with glyoxal (43Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (Table 3) complementary to specific regions of the 35 S pre-rRNA or with a 32P-labeled DNA fragment corresponding to scR1 RNA, using the hybridization conditions described previously (47Zanchin N.I.T.

Whitworth G.B. Bergkessel M. Guthrie C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e90Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Primer Extension Analysis—Total RNA extracted as described above was used for primer extension analysis. Reactions were performed by annealing 1 pmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide to 5 μg of total RNA. Following annealing, extension was performed with 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and dNTPs (0.5 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. cDNA products were precipitated, resuspended in H2O, treated with RNase A, denatured, and analyzed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and analyzed in a PhosphorImager. Oligonucleotides used in primer extension analyses are listed in Table 3. Cwc24p is an essential yeast protein that had previously been isolated in a complex with Cef1p (38Ohi M.D. Link A.J. Ren L. Jennings J.L. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2011-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), but its function had not been addressed. Cwc24p is a 30-kDa protein containing a zinc finger and a RING domain. In a two-hybrid screen with Nop17p, we identified the interaction between BD-Nop17p and AD-Cwc24p-(6–260) (39Gonzales F.A. Zanchin N.I.T. Luz J.S. Oliveira C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 4F. A. Gonzales and C. C. Oliveira, unpublished results. We subsequently tested the interaction between these two proteins in the two-hybrid system by switching the tags, and the results show that the interaction is independent of the tag, although it is stronger when Nop17p is fused to the DNA binding domain (BD-Nop17p; Fig. 1, A and B). In order to determine the Nop17p-interacting domain of Cwc24p, deletion mutants of the latter were created. The mutants were deleted of either the zinc finger, the RING domain, or the amino-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 1A). The results show that the central portion of Cwc24p, containing the zinc finger domain, BD-Cwc24-(86–164), is sufficient for interaction with Nop17p (Fig. 1B). A Cwc24p amino-terminal fragment, not containing the zinc finger domain, BD-Cwc24-(1–85), however, still interacts with Nop17p, although less strongly (Fig. 1B). The interaction between these two proteins was confirmed through GST pull-down assays of the recombinant proteins His-Nop17p and GST-Cwc24p (Fig. 1C). In these experiments, GST or GST-Cwc24p was immobilized on a glutathione-Sepharose resin, after which total extract of E. coli cells expressing His-Nop17p was incubated with the resin. After washing and elution of bound proteins, fractions were analyzed through immunoblot with various antisera, anti-His, and anti-Nop17 to detect His-Nop17p (Fig. 1C, top) or anti-GST and anti-Cwc24 to detect GST-Cwc24p (Fig. 1C, bottom). Both protein fusions, GST-Cwc24p and His-Nop17p, seem to be unstable under the electrophoresis and immunoblot conditions used, since breakdown products are detected. Anti-GST antiserum, however, detects only one band corresponding to GST-Cwc24p fusion (Fig. 1C). Although Cwc24p had been identified in a complex with Cef1p (38Ohi M.D. Link A.J. Ren L. Jennings J.L. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2011-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), it was not known whether the interaction between these two proteins was direct or whether it depended on another NTC subunit. In order to address that question, the recombinant proteins GST-Cwc24p and His-Cef1p were used in GST pull-down assays, as described above. The results show that GST-Cwc24p pulls down His-Cef1p, leading us to the conclusion that these proteins interact directly with each other (Fig. 1D). The interaction of Cwc24p with the NTC complex subunit Cef1p and with Nop17p indicates a nuclear subcellular localization for the protein. In order to confirm"

https://openalex.org/W2078879189,"Adaptive protein evolution is pervasive in Drosophila. Genomic studies, thus far, have analyzed each protein as a single entity. However, the targets of adaptive events may be localized to particular parts of proteins, such as protein domains or regions involved in protein folding. We compared the population genetic mechanisms driving sequence polymorphism and divergence in defined protein domains and non-domain regions. Interestingly, we find that non-domain regions of proteins are more frequent targets of directional selection. Protein domains are also evolving under directional selection, but appear to be under stronger purifying selection than non-domain regions. Non-domain regions of proteins clearly play a major role in adaptive protein evolution on a genomic scale and merit future investigations of their functional properties."
