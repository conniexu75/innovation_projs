https://openalex.org/W4226027283,"As the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to drive the worldwide pandemic, there is a constant demand for vaccines that offer more effective and broad-spectrum protection. Here, we report a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that elicited potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses by expressing the trimeric RBD of the spike protein, providing robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in both mice and rhesus macaques. Notably, the circRNA vaccine enabled higher and more durable antigen production than the 1mΨ-modified mRNA vaccine and elicited a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and distinct Th1-skewed immune responses. Importantly, we found that the circRNARBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron but not the Delta variant. In contrast, the circRNARBD-Delta vaccine protected against both Delta and Omicron or functioned as a booster after two doses of either native- or Delta-specific vaccination, making it a favorable choice against the current variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4224253542,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a public health threat with emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is a reversible, covalent inhibitor targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and the active protease inhibitor in PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets). However, the efficacy of nirmatrelvir is underdetermined against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we evaluated the in vitro catalytic activity and potency of nirmatrelvir against the Mpro of prevalent variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs): Alpha (α, B.1.1.7), Beta (β, B.1.351), Delta (δ, B1.617.2), Gamma (γ, P.1), Lambda (λ, B.1.1.1.37/C37), Omicron (ο, B.1.1.529), as well as the original Washington or wildtype strain. These VOCs/VOIs carry prevalent mutations at varying frequencies in the Mpro specifically for α, β, γ (K90R), λ (G15S), and ο (P132H). In vitro biochemical enzymatic assay characterization of the enzyme kinetics of the mutant Mpros demonstrates that they are catalytically comparable to wildtype. We found that nirmatrelvir has similar potency against each mutant Mpro including P132H that is observed in the Omicron variant with a Ki of 0.635 nM as compared to a Ki of 0.933 nM for wildtype. The molecular basis for these observations were provided by solution-phase structural dynamics and structural determination of nirmatrelvir bound to the ο, λ, and β Mpro at 1.63 to 2.09 Å resolution. These in vitro data suggest that PAXLOVID has the potential to maintain plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir many-fold times higher than the amount required to stop the SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOI, including Omicron, from replicating in cells."
https://openalex.org/W4221063567,"The large number of spike substitutions in Omicron lineage variants (BA.1, BA.1.1., and BA.2) could jeopardize the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We evaluated in mice the protective efficacy of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine against BA.1 before or after boosting. Whereas two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against historical WA1/2020 strains, lower levels against BA.1 were associated with breakthrough infection and inflammation in the lungs. A primary vaccination series with mRNA-1273.529, an Omicron-matched vaccine, potently neutralized BA.1 but inhibited historical or other SARS-CoV-2 variants less effectively. However, boosting with either mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 vaccines increased neutralizing titers and protection against BA.1 and BA.2 infection. Nonetheless, the neutralizing antibody titers were higher, and lung viral burden and cytokines were slightly lower in mice boosted with mRNA-1273.529 and challenged with BA.1. Thus, boosting with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 enhances protection against Omicron infection with limited differences in efficacy measured."
https://openalex.org/W4224281833,"General anesthetics induce loss of consciousness, a global change in behavior. However, a corresponding global change in activity in the context of defined cortical cell types has not been identified. Here, we show that spontaneous activity of mouse layer 5 pyramidal neurons, but of no other cortical cell type, becomes consistently synchronized in vivo by different general anesthetics. This heightened neuronal synchrony is aperiodic, present across large distances, and absent in cortical neurons presynaptic to layer 5 pyramidal neurons. During the transition to and from anesthesia, changes in synchrony in layer 5 coincide with the loss and recovery of consciousness. Activity within both apical and basal dendrites is synchronous, but only basal dendrites' activity is temporally locked to somatic activity. Given that layer 5 is a major cortical output, our results suggest that brain-wide synchrony in layer 5 pyramidal neurons may contribute to the loss of consciousness during general anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W4224250521,"Smoking is associated with lung cancer and has a profound impact on tumor immunity. Nicotine, the addictive and non-carcinogenic smoke component, influences various brain cells and the immune system. However, how long-term use of nicotine affects brain metastases is poorly understood. We, therefore, examined the mechanism by which nicotine promotes lung cancer brain metastasis. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 810 lung cancer patients with smoking history and assessed brain metastasis. We found that current smoker's lung cancer patients have significantly higher brain metastatic incidence compared to the never smokers. We also found that chronic nicotine exposure recruited STAT3-activated N2-neutrophils within the brain pre-metastatic niche and secreted exosomal miR-4466 which promoted stemness and metabolic switching via SKI/SOX2/CPT1A axis in the tumor cells in the brain thereby enabling metastasis. Importantly, exosomal miR-4466 levels were found to be elevated in serum/urine of cancer-free subjects with a smoking history and promote tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that exosomal miR-4466 may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for predicting increased risk of metastatic disease among smoker(s). Our findings suggest a novel pro-metastatic role of nicotine-induced N2-neutrophils in the progression of brain metastasis. We also demonstrated that inhibiting nicotine-induced STAT3-mediated neutrophil polarization effectively abrogated brain metastasis in vivo. Our results revealed a novel mechanistic insight on how chronic nicotine exposure contributes to worse clinical outcome of metastatic lung cancer and implicated the risk of using nicotine gateway for smoking cessation in cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W4226310160,"Background Monitoring COVID-19 infection risk among health care workers (HCWs) is a public health priority. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs following the fall infection surge in Minnesota, and before and after COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, we assessed demographic and occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We conducted two rounds of seroprevalence testing among a cohort of HCWs: samples in round 1 were collected from 11/22/20–02/21/21 and in round 2 from 12/18/20–02/15/21. Demographic and occupational exposures assessed with logistic regression were age, sex, healthcare role and setting, and number of children in the household. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity. A secondary outcome, SARS-CoV-2 infection, included both seropositivity and self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Results In total, 459 HCWs were tested. 43/454 (9.47%) had a seropositive sample 1 and 75/423 (17.7%) had a seropositive sample 2. By time of sample 2 collection, 54% of participants had received at least one vaccine dose and seroprevalence was 13% among unvaccinated individuals. Relative to physicians, the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other roles were increased (Nurse Practitioner: OR[95%CI] 1.93[0.57,6.53], Physician’s Assistant: 1.69[0.38,7.52], Nurse: 2.33[0.94,5.78], Paramedic/EMTs: 3.86[0.78,19.0], other: 1.68[0.58,4.85]). The workplace setting was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (p = 0.04). SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among HCWs reporting duties in the ICU vs. those working in an ambulatory clinic was elevated: OR[95%CI] 2.17[1.01,4.68]. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in HCW increased during our study period which was consistent with community infection rates. HCW role and setting—particularly working in the ICU—is associated with higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4224260082,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of misfolded proteins. Genetic studies implicate microglia, brain-resident phagocytic immune cells, in AD pathogenesis. As positive effectors, microglia clear toxic proteins, whereas as negative effectors, they release proinflammatory mediators. An imbalance of these functions contributes to AD progression. Polymorphisms of human CD33, an inhibitory microglial receptor, are linked to AD susceptibility; higher CD33 expression correlates with increased AD risk. CD33, also called Siglec-3, is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin (Siglec) family of immune regulatory receptors. Siglec-mediated inhibition is initiated by binding to complementary sialoglycan ligands in the tissue environment. Here, we identify a single sialoglycoprotein in human cerebral cortex that binds CD33 as well as Siglec-8, the most abundant Siglec on human microglia. The ligand, which we term receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta (RPTPζ)S3L, is composed of sialylated keratan sulfate chains carried on a minor isoform/glycoform of RPTPζ (phosphacan) and is found in the extracellular milieu of the human brain parenchyma. Brains from human AD donors had twofold higher levels of RPTPζS3L than age-matched control donors, raising the possibility that RPTPζS3L overexpression limits misfolded protein clearance contributing to AD pathology. Mice express the same structure, a sialylated keratan sulfate RPTPζ isoform, that binds mouse Siglec-F and crossreacts with human CD33 and Siglec-8. Brains from mice engineered to lack RPTPζ, the sialyltransferase St3gal4, or the keratan sulfate sulfotransferase Chst1 lacked Siglec binding, establishing the ligand structure. The unique CD33 and Siglec-8 ligand, RPTPζS3L, may contribute to AD progression."

https://openalex.org/W4224280962,"Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) that is prevalent in Asia and the Western Pacific. Currently, there is no effective treatment for Japanese encephalitis. Curcumin (Cur) is a compound extracted from the roots of Curcuma longa, and many studies have reported its antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the high cytotoxicity and very low solubility of Cur limit its biomedical applications. In this study, Cur carbon quantum dots (Cur-CQDs) were synthesized by mild pyrolysis-induced polymerization and carbonization, leading to higher water solubility and lower cytotoxicity, as well as superior antiviral activity against JEV infection. We found that Cur-CQDs effectively bound to the E protein of JEV, preventing viral entry into the host cells. In addition, after continued treatment of JEV with Cur-CQDs, a mutant strain of JEV was evolved that did not support binding of Cur-CQDs to the JEV envelope. Using transmission electron microscopy, biolayer interferometry, and molecular docking analysis, we revealed that the S123R and K312R mutations in the E protein play a key role in binding Cur-CQDs. The S123 and K312 residues are located in structural domains II and III of the E protein, respectively, and are responsible for binding to receptors on and fusing with the cell membrane. Taken together, our results suggest that the E protein of flaviviruses represents a potential target for the development of CQD-based inhibitors to prevent or treat viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W4224282737,"The mildly thermophilic purple phototrophic bacterium Allochromatium tepidum provides a unique model for investigating various intermediate phenotypes observed between those of thermophilic and mesophilic counterparts. The core light-harvesting (LH1) complex from A. tepidum exhibits an absorption maximum at 890 nm and mildly enhanced thermostability, both of which are Ca2+-dependent. However, it is unknown what structural determinants might contribute to these properties. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of the reaction center-associated LH1 complex at 2.81 Å resolution, in which we identify multiple pigment-binding α- and β-polypeptides within an LH1 ring. Of the 16 α-polypeptides, we show that six (α1) bind Ca2+ along with β1- or β3-polypeptides to form the Ca2+-binding sites. This structure differs from that of fully Ca2+-bound LH1 from Thermochromatium tepidum, enabling determination of the minimum structural requirements for Ca2+-binding. We also identified three amino acids (Trp44, Asp47, and Ile49) in the C-terminal region of the A. tepidum α1-polypeptide that ligate each Ca ion, forming a Ca2+-binding WxxDxI motif that is conserved in all Ca2+-bound LH1 α-polypeptides from other species with reported structures. The partial Ca2+-bound structure further explains the unusual phenotypic properties observed for this bacterium in terms of its Ca2+-requirements for thermostability, spectroscopy, and phototrophic growth, and supports the hypothesis that A. tepidum may represent a ""transitional"" species between mesophilic and thermophilic purple sulfur bacteria. The characteristic arrangement of multiple αβ-polypeptides also suggests a mechanism of molecular recognition in the expression and/or assembly of the LH1 complex that could be regulated through interactions with reaction center subunits."
https://openalex.org/W4224319460,"COVID-19 is a disease characterized by its seemingly unpredictable clinical outcomes. In order to better understand the molecular signature of the disease, a recent multi-omics study was done which looked at correlations between biomolecules and used a tree- based machine learning approach to predict clinical outcomes. This study specifically looked at patients admitted to the hospital experiencing COVID-19 or COVID-19 like symptoms. In this paper we examine the same multi-omics data, however we take a different approach, and we identify stable molecules of interest for further pathway analysis. We used stability selection, regularized regression models, enrichment analysis, and principal components analysis on proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and RNA sequencing data, and we determined key molecules and biological pathways in disease severity, and disease status. In addition to the individual omics analyses, we perform the integrative method Sparse Multiple Canonical Correlation Analysis to analyse relationships of the different view of data. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 status is associated with the cell cycle and death, as well as the inflammatory response. This relationship is reflected in all four sets of molecules analyzed. We further observe that the metabolic processes, particularly processes to do with vitamin absorption and cholesterol are implicated in COVID-19 status and severity."
https://openalex.org/W4224442169,"We investigated blood samples from fully SARS-CoV2-vaccinated subjects and from previously positive tested patients up to one year after infection with SARS-CoV2, and compared short- and long-term T cell and antibody responses, with a special focus on the recently emerged delta variant (B.1.617.2).In 23 vaccinated subjects, we documented high anti-SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titers. Average virus neutralization by antibodies, assessed as inhibition of ACE2 binding to RBD, was 2.2-fold reduced for delta mutant vs. wild type (wt) RBD. The mean specific antibody titers were lower one year after natural infection than after vaccination; ACE2 binding to delta mutant vs. wt RBD was 1.65-fold reduced. In an additional group, omicron RBD binding was reduced compared to delta. Specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured after stimulation with peptides pools from wt, alpha, beta, gamma, or delta variant SARS-CoV2 spike proteins by flow cytometric intracellular cytokine staining. There was no significant difference in cytokine production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2 between vaccinated subjects. T cell responses to wt or mutant SARS-CoV2 spike were significantly weaker after natural occurring infections compared to those in vaccinated individuals.Antibody neutralisation of the delta mutant was reduced compared to wt, as assessed in a novel inhibition assay with a finger prick blood drop. Strong CD4 T cell responses were present against wt and mutant SARS-CoV2 variants, including the delta (B.1.617.2) strain, in fully vaccinated individuals, whereas they were partly weaker 1 year after natural infection. Hence, immune responses after vaccination are stronger compared to those after naturally occurring infection, pointing out the need of the vaccine to overcome the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4224438764,"Young farmers play a significant role in sustaining food security and the communities' and rural areas' viability. However, as with many countries, Thailand is facing a decline in the number of young farmers who, if not productive and satisfied with their farm business, are likely to exit farming to take advantage of their increased educational level and off-farm job opportunities. Data were collected by interviewing young farmers in the Prachin Buri province, Thailand, with the aim of assessing their reason for farming in the long-term and the type of farming. Farming decisions can be categorised into three types: full-time profit-oriented farming with a focus on rice production (~53%), full-time multifunctional farming in innovative mixed or organic production systems (~23%), and part-time farming where young farmers work off-farm and farm outside regular working hours (~24%). Using path analysis, we investigated which physical and psychological factors affect young farmers' decisions to pursue these three farming types. The results show that non-monetary farming's benefits are as important as monetary benefits. Education, farming and regular off-farm work experience, farm production, market and pest problems, and government support directly affect the farming types. These effects were also mediated by attitudes towards farming and net farming income. Young farmers choosing to pursue multifunctional farming have higher incomes, more often apply sophisticated technologies, and farm more sustainably than those choosing the other types of farming. This indicates that a shift from conventional rice production to more diversified production systems using innovative technologies is needed to sustain farming success and retain young people in the farming sector."
https://openalex.org/W4224228958,"To successfully feed on blood, hematophagous arthropods must combat the host's natural hemostatic and inflammatory responses. Salivary proteins of blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes contain compounds that inhibit these common host defenses against blood loss, including vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, blood clotting, pain, and itching. The D7 proteins are some of the most abundantly expressed proteins in female mosquito salivary glands and have been implicated in inhibiting host hemostatic and inflammatory responses. Anopheles gambiae, the primary vector of malaria, expresses three D7 long-form and five D7 short-form proteins. Previous studies have characterized the AngaD7 short-forms, but the D7 long-form proteins have not yet been characterized in detail. Here, we characterized the A. gambiae D7 long-forms by first determining their binding kinetics to hemostatic agonists such as leukotrienes and serotonin, which are potent activators of vasoconstriction, edema formation, and postcapillary venule leakage, followed by ex vivo functional assays. We found that AngaD7L1 binds leukotriene C4 and thromboxane A2 analog U-46619; AngaD7L2 weakly binds leukotrienes B4 and D4; and AngaD7L3 binds serotonin. Subsequent functional assays confirmed AngaD7L1 inhibits U-46619-induced platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, and AngaD7L3 inhibits serotonin-induced platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. It is therefore possible that AngaD7L proteins counteract host hemostasis by scavenging these mediators. Finally, we demonstrate that AngaD7L2 had a dose-dependent anticoagulant effect via the intrinsic coagulation pathway by interacting with factors XII, XIIa, and XI. The uncovering of these interactions in the present study will be essential for comprehensive understanding of the vector-host biochemical interface."
https://openalex.org/W4224232645,"To understand the mechanisms regulating the in vitro maturation of hPSC-derived hepatocytes, we developed a 3D differentiation system and compared gene regulatory elements in human primary hepatocytes with those in hPSC-hepatocytes that were differentiated in 2D or 3D conditions by RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq. Regulome comparisons showed a reduced enrichment of thyroid receptor THRB motifs in accessible chromatin and active enhancers without a reduced transcription of THRB. The addition of thyroid hormone T3 increased the binding of THRB to the CYP3A4 proximal enhancer, restored the super-enhancer status and gene expression of NFIC, and reduced the expression of AFP. The resultant hPSC-hepatocytes showed gene expression, epigenetic status, and super-enhancer landscape closer to primary hepatocytes and activated regulatory regions including non-coding SNPs associated with liver-related diseases. Transplanting the hPSC-hepatocytes resulted in the engraftment of human hepatocytes into the mouse liver without disrupting normal liver histology. This work implicates the environmental factor-nuclear receptor axis in regulating the maturation of hPSC-hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4224234309,"Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, with a 5-year survival rate of 10%. A stagnant high mortality rate over the last decades highlights the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Pancreatic tumors pursue an altered metabolism in order to maintain energy generation under low nutrient influx and hypoxic conditions. Targeting these metabolic strategies might therefore be a reasonable therapeutic approach for pancreatic cancer. One promising agent is CPI- 613, a potent inhibitor of two enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The present study evaluated the anti-cancerous efficacy of CPI-613 in combination with galloflavin, a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor or with alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, an inhibitor of monocarboxylate transporters. The efficacy of both combination therapies was tested in vitro on one human and two murine pancreatic cancer cell lines and in vivo in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. Tumor progression was evaluated by MRI and 18 F-FDG PET-CT. Both combinatorial treatments demonstrated in vitro a significant inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induction of cell death. In contrast to the in vitro results, both combination therapies did not significantly reduce tumor growth in vivo . The in vitro results suggest that a combined inhibition of different metabolic pathways might be a promising approach for cancer therapy. However, the in vivo experiments indicate that applying a higher dosage or using other drugs targeting these metabolic pathways might be more promising."
https://openalex.org/W4224253719,"Activating RAS mutations are found in a subset of fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and therapeutic strategies to directly target RAS in these tumors have been investigated, without clinical success to date. A potential strategy to inhibit oncogenic RAS activity is the disruption of RAS prenylation, an obligate step for RAS membrane localization and effector pathway signaling, through inhibition of farnesyltransferase (FTase). Of the major RAS family members, HRAS is uniquely dependent on FTase for prenylation, whereas NRAS and KRAS can utilize geranylgeranyl transferase as a bypass prenylation mechanism. Tumors driven by oncogenic HRAS may therefore be uniquely sensitive to FTase inhibition. To investigate the mutation-specific effects of FTase inhibition in RMS we utilized tipifarnib, a potent and selective FTase inhibitor, in in vitro and in vivo models of RMS genomically characterized for RAS mutation status. Tipifarnib reduced HRAS processing, and plasma membrane localization leading to decreased GTP-bound HRAS and decreased signaling through RAS effector pathways. In HRAS-mutant cell lines, tipifarnib reduced two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell growth, and in vivo treatment with tipifarnib resulted in tumor growth inhibition exclusively in HRAS-mutant RMS xenografts. Our data suggest that small molecule inhibition of FTase is active in HRAS-driven RMS and may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for a genomically-defined subset of patients with RMS."
https://openalex.org/W4224271830,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with mesenchymal features exhibits enhanced chemotherapeutic resistance and results in reduced overall survival. Recent studies have suggested that there is a positive correlation between the GBM mesenchymal status and immune cell infiltration. However, the mechanisms by which GBM acquires its mesenchymal features in a tumor immune microenvironment-dependent manner remains unknown. Here, we uncovered a chemerin-mediated autocrine and paracrine network by which the mesenchymal phenotype of GBM cells is strengthened. We identified chemerin as a prognostic secretory protein mediating the mesenchymal phenotype-promoting network between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells in GBM. Mechanistically, chemerin promoted the mesenchymal features of GBM by suppressing the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of CMKLR1, a chemerin receptor predominantly expressed on TAMs and partially expressed on GBM cells, thereby enhancing NF-κB pathway activation. Moreover, chemerin was found to be involved in the recruitment of TAMs in the GBM tumor microenvironment. We revealed that chemerin also enhances the mesenchymal phenotype-promoting ability of TAMs and promotes their M2 polarization via a CMKLR1/NF-κB axis, which further exacerbates the mesenchymal features of GBM. Blocking the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis with 2-(α-naphthoyl) ethyltrimethylammonium iodide disrupted the mesenchymal network and suppressed tumor growth in GBM. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis to block the mesenchymal network in GBM."

Nevertheless, its efficiency is limited by poor solubility and gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) associated side effects. Seventeen formulations of MLX loaded HPMC microparticles were fabricated by the oil-in-oil (O/O)/ emulsion solvent evaporation (ESE) technique. A 3-factor, 3-level Box Behnken (BBD) statistical design was used to estimate the combined effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables (responses), such as the percent yield (R1), the entrapment efficiency (EE) (R2), mean particle size (R3) and in vitro percentage of cumulative drug release (R4). For physicochemical characterization FTIR, XRD, DSC, and SEM analyses were performed. Biocompatibility and non-toxicity were confirmed by in-vivo acute oral toxicity determination. The percentage yield and EE were 65.75-90.71%, and 70.62-88.37%, respectively. However, the mean particle size was 62.89-284.55 μm, and the in vitro cumulative drug release percentage was 74.25-92.64% for 24 hours. FTIR analysis showed that the composition of the particles was completely compatible, while XRD analysis confirmed the crystalline nature of the pure drug and its transition into an amorphous state after formulation. DSC analysis revealed the thermal stability of the formulations. The SEM analysis showed dense spherical particles. The toxicity study in albino rabbits showed no toxicity and was found biocompatible. The histopathological evaluation showed no signs of altered patterns. Results of this study highlighted a standard colonic drug delivery system with the ability to improve patient adherence and reduce GIT drug-associated side effects in CRC treatment."

Efficiency assessments have previously been conducted in single province. This study aimed to investigate the technical efficiency of rural traditional Chinese medicine hospitals across China from 2013 to 2018, with the application of super slack-based measure data envelopment analysis. In total, 1219 hospitals covering 28 provinces were included as sample hospitals. Overall, hospitals performed technically less efficiently but presented with an increasing trend. Redundancy and insufficiency existed in health input and output variables, respectively. Notably, optimizing input variables was found to make more substantial improvement in hospital efficiency. Provincial and regional disparities were also observed in hospital efficiency. In conclusion, rural traditional Chinese medicine hospitals have experienced slight improvement in efficiency during the study period, however, their efficiency was still in a relatively low level with ample room for improvement. Meanwhile, regional coordinated development should also be noticed in this process."
https://openalex.org/W4224242221,"Genetic technology using site-specific recombinases, such as the Cre-loxP system, has been widely employed for labeling specific cell populations and for studying their functions in vivo. To enhance the precision of cell lineage tracing and functional study, a similar site-specific recombinase system termed Dre-rox has been recently used in combination with Cre-loxP. To enable more specific cell lineage tracing and ablation through dual recombinase activity, we generated two mouse lines that render Dre- or Dre+Cre-mediated recombination to excise a stop codon sequence that prevents the expression of diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) knocked into the ubiquitously expressed and safe Rosa26 locus. Using different Dre- and Cre-expressing mouse lines, we showed that the surrogate gene reporters tdTomato and DTR were simultaneously expressed in target cells and in their descendants, and we observed efficient ablation of tdTomato+ cells after diphtheria toxin administration. These mouse lines were used to simultaneously trace and deplete the target cells of interest through the inducible expression of a reporter and DTR using dual Cre and Dre recombinases, allowing a more precise and efficient study of the role of specific cell subsets within a heterogeneous population in pathophysiological conditions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4224251787,"Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is an essential cofactor for a class of enzymes that catalyze diverse reactions in central metabolism. The catalytic mechanism of some PLP-dependent enzymes involves the generation of reactive enamine intermediates like 2-aminoacrylate (2AA). 2AA can covalently modify PLP in the active site of some PLP-dependent enzymes and subsequently inactivate the enzyme through the formation of a PLP–pyruvate adduct.

This method was then used to examine active site residues of Alr, a 2AA-sensitive PLP-dependent enzyme, that affect its sensitivity to 2AA in vivo. Unexpectedly, our data also showed that a low level of 2AA stress can persist even in the presence of a functional RidA.

The metabolic network in microbes is responsible for the robust physiology characteristic of these organisms. A responsive metabolism can react to perturbations caused by both internal and external stresses and maintain overall fitness of the organism. Included in the metabolic network are numerous enzymes that utilize a range of cofactors to catalyze the biochemical reactions necessary for an organism to thrive. Disruption of these reactions causes perturbations throughout the system and can result in detectable phenotypic consequences. One means by which enzymatic reactions can be compromised is to limit or damage a required cofactor. Relevant to the work herein is pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), an essential cofactor for a class of enzymes most often involved in transamination, decarboxylation, and racemization reactions (1Eliot A.C.

Significantly, 2AA was both generated by, and caused damage to, PLP-dependent enzymes (reviewed in the studies by Borchert et al. (2Borchert A.J. Ernst D.C. Downs D.M.

The catalytic mechanism of some PLP-dependent enzymes (i.e., threonine/serine dehydratases [EC 4.3.1.19]) generates a reactive enamine intermediate that is protonated to an iminium ion, which then undergoes Schiff base hydrolysis to form a final relevant product. For instance, the biosynthetic serine/threonine dehydratase, IlvA (EC 4.3.1.19), dehydrates L-threonine to the enamine intermediate 2-aminocrotonate, which is hydrolyzed to 2-ketobutyrate (releasing ammonium) as the first step in L-isoleucine biosynthesis (4Chargaff E. Sprinson D.B. Studies on the mechanism of deamination of serine and threonine in biological systems.J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 151: 273-280Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 5Phillips A.T. Wood W.A. The mechanism of action of 5'-adenylic acid-activated threonine dehydratase.J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4703-4709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work investigating the stereospecific deuteration of 2-ketobutyrate formed by IlvA from Serratia marcescens found that protonation of 2-aminocrotonate was enzyme catalyzed (6Crout D.H. Gregorio M.V. Muller U.S. Komatsubara S. Kisumi M. Chibata I. Stereochemistry of the conversions of L-threonine and D-threonine into 2-oxobutanoate by the L-threonine and D-threonine dehydratases of Serratia marcescens.Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli IlvA orthologs generate 2-aminocrotonate that can interact with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate in an anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase–dependent manner to form phosphoribosyl amine, an intermediate in purine biosynthesis (7Lambrecht J.A. Downs D.M. Anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase (TrpD) generates phosphoribosylamine for thiamine synthesis from enamines and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate.ACS Chem.

These findings suggest that IlvA orthologs from S. enterica and E. coli either do not catalyze the protonation of 2-aminocrotonate or, if 2-aminocrotonate protonation is enzyme catalyzed, the imine product can be released from the active cite and undergo tautomerization back to 2-aminocrotonate. IlvA can also use L-serine as a substrate, which generates 2AA, a reactive enamine with a half-life of less than 3 min in aqueous solution (9Flavin M. Slaughter C.

Significantly, 2AA damages some PLP-dependent enzymes by a covalent modification which involves forming a pyruvate–PLP adduct and thus inactivating the enzyme (11Ueno H. Likos J.J. Metzler D.E.

RidA is a broadly conserved member of the large Rid (YjgF/YER057c/UK114) protein superfamily (13Niehaus T.D. Gerdes S. Hodge-Hanson K. Zhukov A. Cooper A.J. ElBadawi-Sidhu M. Fiehn O. Downs D.M.

Most PLP-dependent enzymes can be grouped into four distinct fold types based on their structural similarities and evolutionary relatedness (1Eliot A.C. Kirsch J.F.

The dominant 2AA generator in S. enterica, IlvA, is fold type II, as are two other dehydratases that generate 2AA in this organism, cysteine desulfhydrase CdsH (EC 2.5.1.47) and diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase DapL (EC 4.3.1.15) (23Ernst D.C.

The finding that these enzymes generate 2AA that can diffuse out of the active site suggested that they were at least partially immune to attack by this enamine. Covalent inactivation of PLP-dependent enzymes by 2AA has been characterized in vitro (11Ueno H. Likos J.J. Metzler D.E.

Many more targets of 2AA stress are expected given the numerous PLP-dependent enzymes in most organisms. In the studies of RidA, a rough correlation between fold type and the ability of PLP-dependent enzymes to generate, or be inactivated by, 2AA seemed to exist. Namely, enzymes belonging to the fold type II class of PLP-dependent enzymes appeared resistant to 2AA damage, while those were sensitive to damage belonged to other fold types. The present study was initiated to implement a system to detect and quantify damage caused by 2AA in vivo. The work herein explored structural features of an enzyme that affect sensitivity to 2AA and developed a system to quantify in vivo 2AA stress that might not result in detectable phenotypic consequence(s). A previous study found a fraction of alanine racemase, Alr, purified from a ridA mutant carried a pyruvate–PLP adduct, indicating prior attack by 2AA. In contrast, a pyruvate–PLP adduct was absent from the same protein purified from an isogenic wildtype strain (16Flynn J.M. Downs D.M. In the absence of RidA, endogenous 2-aminoacrylate inactivates alanine racemases by modifying the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 3603-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Distinct strains and slightly modified protocols were used here to affirm this result and extend the understanding of the 2AA stress present in vivo. An isogenic pair of strains carrying either a wildtype (DM13509) or null allele of ridA (DM17050) was used as host for a set of plasmids expressing AlrWT or select Alr variants. Strains were grown in minimal medium supplemented with L-serine (5 mM) and glycine (1 mM); these additions ensured 2AA production and full growth in the presence of 2AA stress, respectively (17Ernst D.C. Downs D.M. 2-Aminoacrylate stress induces a context-dependent glycine requirement inridAStrains of Salmonella enterica.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Enos-Berlage J.L. Langendorf M.J. Downs D.M. Complex metabolic phenotypes caused by a mutation in yjgF, encoding a member of the highly conserved YER057c/YjgF family of proteins.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6519-6528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The respective Alr protein was overexpressed and purified from both the wildtype and ridA mutant strains. Each protein sample was treated with base, and the released cofactors were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and monitored at 305 nm (16Flynn J.M. Downs D.M. In the absence of RidA, endogenous 2-aminoacrylate inactivates alanine racemases by modifying the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 3603-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The HPLC chromatogram derived from the AlrWT protein sample purified from the ridA mutant strain had two dominant peaks (Fig. 2). The first peak had a retention time close to 8 min and could be attributed to PLP (Fig. S1). The second peak had a retention time of ∼10.5 min and was ascribed to a pyruvate–PLP adduct (Fig. S1). The sample derived from the wildtype strain had a large PLP peak at ∼8 min and little, if any, detectable absorbance (≤500 AU) at 305 nm between 10 and 12 min. The released cofactors were quantified using peak area measured at the relevant absorbance maximum, and a standard curve was generated with the authentic metabolites (Fig. S2). Analyses of the peak areas indicated 0.83 ± 0.01 and 0.66 ± 0.03 nmol PLP were released from 1 nmol of Alr protein purified from the wildtype or ridA mutant, respectively. Approximately 0.11 ± 0.01 nmol pyruvate–PLP was released per nmol Alr protein when purified from the ridA mutant, while pyruvate–PLP adduct was undetectable when treating Alr purified from the wildtype strain. The pyruvate–PLP accounted for approximately 14% of the total cofactor released from the AlrWT protein isolated from the ridA mutant strain. The specific activity of Alr protein samples purified from wildtype and the ridA mutant was 2.52 ± 0.05 and 2.17 ± 0.22 μmol alanine min−1 mg−1, respectively. Taken together, these data suggested the 2AA-dependent modification was responsible for the decreased activity of Alr in a strain lacking RidA, as previously proposed (16Flynn J.M. Downs D.M. In the absence of RidA, endogenous 2-aminoacrylate inactivates alanine racemases by modifying the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 3603-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Further, these data suggested a framework to probe the direct impact of in vivo 2AA stress on PLP-dependent proteins by assessing pyruvate–PLP released from a protein sample. To probe the susceptibility of Alr variants to 2AA damage, we focused on the residue coordinating the pyridine nitrogen of the bound PLP. This residue has been implicated in assignment of fold type and appears to exert significant control over differences in the electrophilic strength of the Schiff base in PLP-dependent enzymes (30Percudani R. Peracchi A. A genomic overview of pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzymes.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 31Casasnovas R. Adrover M. Ortega-Castro J. Frau J. Donoso J. Munoz F. C-H activation in pyridoxal-5'-phosphate Schiff bases: The role of the imine nitrogen. A combined experimental and computational study.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2012; 116: 10665-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a simple scenario, such a residue (R209 in Alr) could affect the interaction of 2AA with the active site PLP to impact susceptibility to attack. Based on this reasoning, Alr variants with substitutions at R209, designed to imitate different fold types and change the electrophilicity of the Schiff base, were constructed. Fold type II includes proteins shown to generate 2AA stress in vivo and have a serine or threonine residue in the position equivalent to 209. An AlrR209S variant was generated and queried for 2AA damage in the relevant genetic backgrounds (Fig. 3A). Similar to AlrWT, the AlrR209S variant purified from a wildtype strain released PLP and no detectable pyruvate–PLP. However, the AlrR209S variant purified from the ridA mutant background released considerably more pyruvate–PLP than the wildtype protein (0.55 versus 0.11 nmol/nmol protein, respectively), and perhaps more significantly, the pyruvate–PLP made up 66% of the total cofactor released from this variant. Both samples of the AlrR209S variant released less PLP than the wildtype protein, most likely a consequence of the changed active site environment. These data suggest the AlrR209S variant is more susceptible to 2AA damage than the wildtype protein in vivo, despite having a substitution making it more like fold type II enzyme. Additional Alr variants substituted R209 with other residues to alter the electrophobicity of the N Schiff base (32Singh R. Spyrakis F. Cozzini P. Paiardini A. Pascarella S. Mozzarelli A. Chemogenomics of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent enzymes.J. Enzym Inhib. Med. Chem. 2013; 28: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). AlrR209D, AlrR209E, and AlrR209A variants were similarly purified from a strain in which 2AA persisted (ridA) and one where it would not (wildtype). All three variants had evidence of attack by 2AA in vivo reflected in the release of pyruvate–PLP from protein purified from a ridA mutant (Fig. 3 and Table S1). Particularly telling was the high percentage of total cofactor that was pyruvate–PLP when the proteins were purified from a ridA mutant, 66%, 52%, and 98%, from AlrR209D, AlrR209A, and AlrR209E variants, respectively. When purified from wildtype cells, the amount of PLP released by the variants differed, suggesting these substitutions also affected the affinity of the protein for the coenzyme. In three of the four variants (AlrR209S, AlrR209D, AlrR209A), less PLP was released in the presence of 2AA stress, i.e., in the ridA mutant. The cause of the 2AA impact on PLP levels and the relationship it had to the pyruvate–PLP or the activity of the enzyme was not pursued further here. While each of the variants released significant pyruvate–PLP when purified from the ridA mutant, the behavior of AlrR209E was unique. First, the purified AlrR209E variant had very low PLP occupancy. Second, when purified from the ridA mutant background, the AlrR209E variant released dramatically more pyruvate–PLP than any of the other proteins, approaching 1 nmol/nmol protein. Third, and most noteworthy, this variant released pyruvate–PLP when purified from the wildtype strain, a condition where persistence of 2AA was not anticipated. In fact, pyruvate–PLP was the dominant form of cofactor released from the AlrR209E variant regardless of whether the protein was purified from the wildtype or ridA background (Fig. 3D and Table S1). The release of pyruvate–PLP from AlrR209E purified from the wildtype strain was the first indication that 2AA stress could be present in vivo in the presence of active RidA. Further, the data indicated that the AlrR209E variant was more sensitive to, or has a higher affinity for, 2AA than AlrWT or any of the tested variants. Significantly, the R209E substitution results in a protein with the same residue coordinating the pyridine nitrogen as IlvE (transaminase B, EC 2.6.1.42), which has been characterized as an in vivo target of 2AA in S. enterica (14Lambrecht J.A. Schmitz G.E. Downs D.M. RidA proteins prevent metabolic damage inflicted by PLP-dependent dehydratases in all domains of life.mBio. 2013; 4e00033-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In total, the aforementioned results showed the residue coordinating the pyridine nitrogen of PLP impacts the sensitivity of Alr to 2AA. Somewhat surprisingly, all changes made the protein more sensitive to 2AA attack. Transaminase B (IlvE) is a target of 2AA stress in S. enterica and has been used as a proxy for 2AA-dependent damage in multiple organisms (15Irons J. Sacher J.C. Szymanski C.M. Downs D.M.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). IlvE was purified from the ridA and wildtype strains, and the cofactors released by base treatment were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 4). The IlvE protein purified from the ridA mutant released significant pyruvate–PLP, as expected based on the sensitivity of this protein to 2AA in other assays (14Lambrecht J.A. Schmitz G.E. Downs D.M. RidA proteins prevent metabolic damage inflicted by PLP-dependent dehydratases in all domains of life.mBio. 2013; 4e00033-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Schmitz G. Downs D.M.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this sample, pyruvate–PLP was 82% of the total cofactor released. Like AlrR209E, IlvE released significant pyruvate–PLP when purified from the wildtype strain, in this case making up 17% the total released cofactor. The pattern of pyruvate–PLP release paralleled that of the AlrR209E variant, with the amount of cofactor released under each condition being similar. Thus, IlvE was the second protein that showed 2AA stress could persist in a wildtype strain. These data suggested that IlvE was more sensitive to 2AA than Alr such that it was damaged by the presumably low level of 2AA that persists in the presence of a functional RidA. This sensitivity justified the continued use of IlvE as to query the 2AA stress level in a cell and indicated that extraction of cofactors provides a more sensitive assay for in vivo damage than enzymatic activity. Interestingly, the cofactor profile released from IlvE showed the presence of two peaks with a retention time near that of PLP, rather than the single peak observed for the other PLP-dependent proteins tested. IlvE is a transaminase, suggesting there would be enzyme subpopulations with either PLP or pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) occupancy (34Hayashi H.

Coinjection with authentic standards determined that the early peak was PLP, while the one with the later elution time was PMP (Fig. S2). This profile is consistent with a pool of the enzyme available to catalyze each half of the transamination (36Islam M.M. Nautiyal M. Wynn R.M. Mobley J.A. Chuang D.T. Hutson S.M.

In vivo and in vitro work has shown that serine/threonine dehydratase (IlvA) generates the 2AA that causes phenotypic defects in at least S. enterica, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (reviewed in the study by Irons et al. (3Irons J.L. Hodge-Hanson K. Downs D.M. RidA proteins protect against metabolic damage by reactive intermediates.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2020; 84e00024-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). The generation of 2AA in the catalytic mechanism of serine dehydration suggests that IlvA must be resistant to attack by this reactive enamine. The implication is that either the 2AA generated by IlvA leaves the enzyme active site"

At baseline, 6.2% (95% CI 4.29–8.19) were seropositive using the spike RBD assay; four (0.4%) were seropositive using the nucleocapsid assay, and 44 (4.8%) using the Spike NTD assay. Cumulative incidence was 3.61% (95% CI: 2.04–5.16). Six asymptomatic individuals had positive RT-PCR results. Conclusions Prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections were low; however, differences in target antigens of serological tests provided different estimates. Future research on appropriate methods of serological testing in unvaccinated and vaccinated populations is needed. Frequent RT-PCR testing of asymptomatic individuals is required to detect acute infections, and repeated serosurveys are beneficial for monitoring subclinical infection."
https://openalex.org/W4226146066,"Due to their high energy demands and characteristic morphology, retinal photoreceptor cells require a specialized lipid metabolism for survival and function. Accordingly, dysregulation of lipid metabolism leads to the photoreceptor cell death and retinal degeneration. Mice bearing a frameshift mutation in the gene encoding lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (Lpcat1), which produces saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) composed of two saturated fatty acids, has been reported to cause spontaneous retinal degeneration in mice; however, the mechanism by which this mutation affects degeneration is unclear. In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of LPCAT1 in the retina and found that genetic deletion of Lpcat1 induces light-independent and photoreceptor-specific apoptosis in mice. Lipidomic analyses of the retina and isolated photoreceptor outer segment (OS) suggested that loss of Lpcat1 not only decreased saturated PC production but also affected membrane lipid composition, presumably by altering saturated fatty acyl-CoA availability. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Lpcat1 deletion led to increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels in photoreceptor cells, but not in other retinal cells, and did not affect the OS structure or trafficking of OS-localized proteins. These results suggest that the LPCAT1-dependent production of saturated PC plays critical roles in photoreceptor maturation. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of saturated fatty acid metabolism in photoreceptor cell degeneration-related retinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4224210804,"Egg-laying defective nine 1 (EGLN1) functions as an oxygen sensor to catalyze prolyl hydroxylation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α under normoxia conditions, leading to its proteasomal degradation. Thus, EGLN1 plays a central role in the hypoxia-inducible factor-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway; however, the posttranslational modifications that control EGLN1 function remain largely unknown. Here, we identified that a lysine monomethylase, SET7, catalyzes EGLN1 methylation on lysine 297, resulting in the repression of EGLN1 activity in catalyzing prolyl hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α. Notably, we demonstrate that the methylation mimic mutant of EGLN1 loses the capability to suppress the hypoxia signaling pathway, leading to the enhancement of cell proliferation and the oxygen consumption rate. Collectively, our data identify a novel modification of EGLN1 that is critical for inhibiting its enzymatic activity and which may benefit cellular adaptation to conditions of hypoxia."

https://openalex.org/W4224257267,"The receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1), a highly conserved eukaryotic protein, is known to have many varying biological roles and functions. Previous work has established RACK1 as a ribosomal protein, with defined regions important for ribosome binding in eukaryotic cells. In Plasmodium falciparum, RACK1 has been shown to be required for parasite growth, however, conflicting evidence has been presented about RACK1 ribosome binding and its role in mRNA translation. Given the importance of RACK1 as a regulatory component of mRNA translation and ribosome quality control, the case could be made in parasites that RACK1 either binds or does not bind the ribosome. Here, we used bioinformatics and transcription analyses to further characterize the P. falciparum RACK1 protein. Based on homology modeling and structural analyses, we generated a model of P. falciparum RACK1. We then explored mutant and chimeric human and P. falciparum RACK1 protein binding properties to the human and P. falciparum ribosome. We found that WT, chimeric, and mutant RACK1 exhibit distinct ribosome interactions suggesting different binding characteristics for P. falciparum and human RACK1 proteins. The ribosomal binding of RACK1 variants in human and parasite cells shown here demonstrates that although RACK1 proteins have highly conserved sequences and structures across species, ribosomal binding is affected by species-specific alterations to this protein. In conclusion, we show that in the case of P. falciparum, contrary to the structural data, RACK1 is found to bind ribosomes and actively translating polysomes in parasite cells.

RACK1 is a highly conserved, eukaryotic, seven-bladed WD β-propeller repeat scaffolding protein (1Adams D.R. Ron D. Kiely P.A. RACK1, A multifaceted scaffolding protein: Structure and function.Cell Commun. Signal. 2011; 9: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The WD domain proteins, fold into a β-propeller structure, is typically characterized by the repetition of glycine (G)–histidine (H) and tryptophan (W)–aspartic acid (D) dipeptide repeats (2Jain B.P. Pandey S. WD40 repeat proteins: Signalling scaffold with diverse functions.Protein J. 2018; 37: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). They also happen to be incredibly abundant throughout the eukaryotic tree of life (3Li D. Roberts R.

Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2085-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Proteins with WD domains are primarily associated with signalosome assembly (4Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Cloning of an intracellular receptor for protein kinase C: A homolog of the beta subunit of G proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pandey S. WD40 repeat proteins: Signalling scaffold with diverse functions.Protein J. 2018; 37: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Besides signal transduction, WD domains are involved in processes ranging from organism proliferation to virulence in lower eukaryotes (5Yuan L. Su Y. Zhou S. Feng Y. Guo W. Wang X.

RACK1 was indeed initially associated with protein kinase C signaling, the reason for its namesake (7Smith B.L. Mochly-Rosen D.

The mammalian homolog is found to be stably associated with 40S ribosomal subunit and actively translating ribosomes, having an in vitro half-life of 15 h (8Johnson A.G. Lapointe C.P. Wang J. Corsepius N.C. Choi J. Fuchs G. Puglisi J.D. RACK1 on and off the ribosome.RNA. 2019; 25: 881-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggests a primary role of human RACK1 and its yeast ASC1 homolog as ribosomal proteins. In Plasmodium falciparum, unlike yeast and mammalian cell lines (8Johnson A.G. Lapointe C.P. Wang J. Corsepius N.C. Choi J. Fuchs G. Puglisi J.D. RACK1 on and off the ribosome.RNA. 2019; 25: 881-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), RACK1 is required for parasite growth during IDC stages, as knockdown during ring stage results in growth arrest in the trophozoite stage (20Blomqvist K. DiPetrillo C. Streva V.A. Pine S. Dvorin J.D. Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1 (PfRACK1) is required for Plasmodium falciparum intra-erythrocytic proliferation.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2017; 211: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Previous work has suggested that RACK1 is mainly localized to the parasitic cytoplasm during the schizont stage (20Blomqvist K. DiPetrillo C. Streva V.A. Pine S. Dvorin J.D. Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1 (PfRACK1) is required for Plasmodium falciparum intra-erythrocytic proliferation.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2017; 211: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but proteomic data has indicated that P. falciparum RACK1 (PfRACK1) might be exported to the erythrocyte cytoplasm for a yet to be define function (21Vincensini L. Richert S. Blisnick T. Van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. Braun Breton C.

Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 582-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). What remains unclear are the functions of RACK1 in the parasite, given the lack of a PKC IIβ homolog (14Ceci M. Gaviraghi C. Gorrini C. Sala L.A. Offenhäuser N. Marchisio P.C. Biffo S. Release of eIF6 (p27BBP) from the 60S subunit allows 80S ribosome assembly.Nature. 2003; 426: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Conflicting evidence has been provided regarding RACK1 ribosomal binding in P. falciparum. Structural data show that RACK1 does not copurify with schizont 80S ribosomes (22Wong W. Bai X.C. Brown A. Fernandez I.S. Hanssen E. Condron M. Tan Y.H. Baum J. Scheres S.H. Cryo-EM structure of the Plasmodium falciparum 80S ribosome bound to the anti-protozoan drug emetine.Elife. 2014; 3e03080Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Sun M. Li W. Blomqvist K. Das S. Hashem Y. Dvorin J.D. Frank J. Dynamical features of the Plasmodium falciparum ribosome during translation.Nucl. Acids Res. 2015; 43: 10515-10524PubMed Google Scholar), while mass spectrometry of polysome profiling data paints a contradictory picture (24Bunnik E.M. Batugedara G. Saraf A. Prudhomme J. Florens L. Le Roch K.G. The mRNA-bound proteome of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Authors of the initial structural study noted that loss of PfRACK1 binding to ribosomes may have been a result of different modes of ribosome binding or culturing conditions (22Wong W. Bai X.C. Brown A. Fernandez I.S. Hanssen E. Condron M. Tan Y.H. Baum J. Scheres S.H. Cryo-EM structure of the Plasmodium falciparum 80S ribosome bound to the anti-protozoan drug emetine.Elife. 2014; 3e03080Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Authors of the second structural study suggested that the loss of RACK1 interaction may be driven by stage-regulated binding, but not that of the EM sample preparation (23Sun M. Li W. Blomqvist K. Das S. Hashem Y. Dvorin J.D. Frank J. Dynamical features of the Plasmodium falciparum ribosome during translation.Nucl. Acids Res. 2015; 43: 10515-10524PubMed Google Scholar). The mass spectrometry data (24Bunnik E.M. Batugedara G. Saraf A. Prudhomme J. Florens L. Le Roch K.G. The mRNA-bound proteome of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), however, indicated a primarily ribosome-bound RACK1 and suggested binding of RACK1 to the ribosome may be disrupted by experimental procedures. Lastly, the in vitro assessment of P. falciparum RACK1 ribosome binding was previously attempted with human ribosomes, however, authors were unable to exogenously produce and subsequently purify the parasite homolog due to suspected protein instability (8Johnson A.G. Lapointe C.P. Wang J. Corsepius N.C. Choi J. Fuchs G. Puglisi J.D. RACK1 on and off the ribosome.RNA. 2019; 25: 881-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As such, it is still unknown whether P. falciparum RACK1 protein binds to ribosomes and whether this ribosomal binding is conserved like in the case of mammalian and yeast homologs. As previously mentioned, RACK1 is a highly conserved, eukaryotic scaffolding protein with a seven-bladed WD β-propeller repeat structure (1Adams D.R. Ron D. Kiely P.A. RACK1, A multifaceted scaffolding protein: Structure and function.Cell Commun. Signal. 2011; 9: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We performed bioinformatic analysis on a selected set of organisms including other single-celled parasitic organisms, a human malaria vector, the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the human host (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Expectedly, the Plasmodium spp. shares the highest sequence identity with P. falciparum Dd2 strain RACK1 (PfRACK1) protein, whereby human-infective strains Plasmodium vivax P01 and Plasmodium knowlesi strain H show only minor differences. This is followed by the murine parasite species Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi, Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 17X, and Plasmodium berghei ANKA. The RACK1 homolog expressed by Toxoplasma gondii, a fellow Apicomplexan whose genes and their functions are often compared with P. spp., is also quite similar at 67.30% (Table 1). Interestingly, the Homo sapiens RACK (HsRACK1) homolog has a shared identity of almost 60%, higher than other single-celled parasites (Trypanosoma brucei brucei at 51.30% and Leishmania brazilliensis at 41.97%) and S. cerevisiae (ScRACK1, 42.99%) with which one might anticipate the parasite sharing greater sequence identity. Lastly, the model organism D. melanogaster and malaria vector Anopheles gambiae also share relatively high sequence identity at 58.15% and 56.45%, respectively.Table 1Analysis of RACK1 sequence identities versus Plasmodium falciparum Dd2 strainOrganismIdentity (%)Plasmodium falciparum 3D7100.00Plasmodium reichenowi CDC100.00Plasmodium vivax P0195.03Plasmodium knowlesi strain H95.03Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi91.93Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 17X91.61Plasmodium berghei ANKA91.30Toxoplasma gondii67.30Homo sapiens59.55Drosophila melanogaster58.15Anopheles gambiae PEST56.45Trypanosoma brucei brucei TREU92751.30Saccharomyces cerevisiae42.99Leishmania braziliensis MHOM/BR/75/M290441.97Sequence identities were determined using protein BLAST to align protein sequences with P. falciparum Dd2 RACK1 protein sequence for each organism. Open table in a new tab Sequence identities were determined using protein BLAST to align protein sequences with P. falciparum Dd2 RACK1 protein sequence for each organism. Bioinformatic analysis of HsRACK1 and ScAsc1 proteins show that they share a 53.82% sequence identity, with HsRACK1 and PfRACK1 having higher sequence identity (59.55%). A multiple sequence alignment combined with secondary structure analysis of these RACK1 proteins was performed to further determine what features, if any, would affect the binding of PfRACK1 to the 40S ribosome subunit. The analysis demonstrates a conservation of the β-sheet blades and loop features and positioning (Fig. 2A).This is apparent in the overall structure of PfRACK1-generated model even in the regions that may have sequence variation and are indicated in the RACK1-ribosome binding regions (Fig. 2B, regions in blue and red). Previously described residues, such as the RDK motif vital to ribosome binding (Fig. 2A region 3 and Fig. 2C, DDE), are conserved with charge inversion by mutation of the arginine (R) to aspartate (D) and the lysine (K) to glutamate (E) resulting in the RDK→DDE mutation, which significantly reduces ribosome binding due to the increased negative charge of the amino acid triplicate clashing with that of the rRNA (1Adams D.R.

Gilbert W.V. Doudna J.A. Direct link between RACK1 function and localization at the ribosome in vivo.Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, there are multiple regions within the N-terminus whereby significant residue changes result in charges differences that could affect RACK1 ribosomal binding. Some of these changes have been subtle (Fig. 2, A–C, region 1), however, others are more drastic, such as changes in or introductions of charge Fig. 2, A–C, regions 2 and 5) or loop length and residue polarity (Fig. 2, A–C, region 4). The C-terminal of the proteins appear to be significantly more conserved with the exception of the so called “knob” region (Fig. 2, A–C, red) located in the sixth β-sheet blade suggested to be a species-specific region offering differences in translational control (26Rollins M.G. Jha S. Bartom E.T. Walsh D. RACK1 evolved species-specific multifunctionality in translational control through sequence plasticity within a loop domain.J. Cell Sci. 2019; 132jcs228908PubMed Google Scholar). This region was shown to be dispensable in yeast (25Coyle S.M. Gilbert W.V. Doudna J.A. Direct link between RACK1 function and localization at the ribosome in vivo.Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This sequence is encoded as FAGYS in yeast, STSS in humans, and KQS in P. falciparum. Regardless, previous work suggests that the loop region (Fig. 2, A–C, red) has evolved to accommodate differences in eIF6 binding and 5′ polyA leader sequence usage by different eukaryotic organisms, thereby not necessarily being important of ribosome binding (26Rollins M.G. Jha S. Bartom E.T. Walsh D. RACK1 evolved species-specific multifunctionality in translational control through sequence plasticity within a loop domain.J. Cell Sci. 2019; 132jcs228908PubMed Google Scholar). To get further insight into differences and similarities between PfRACK1 and HsRACK1 proteins, we created a de novo model of the PfRACK1 protein (Figs. 2 and 3). The model was generated based on the sequence alignments (Figs. 1 and 2) and homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL (27Waterhouse A. Bertoni M. Bienert S. Studer G. Tauriello G. Gumienny R.

This de novo model generated by SWISS-MODEL was also compared with the P. falciparum RACK1 model produced by the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (32Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T.

HsRACK1 has been previously shown to bind to the human 40S ribosome, with emphasis placed on helices 39 and 40 of the 18s rRNA and the N-terminal region of RACK1 (34Nielsen M.H. Flygaard R.K. Jenner L.B. Structural analysis of ribosomal RACK1 and its role in translational control.Cell. Signal. 2017; 35: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We checked whether this feature is preserved in P. falciparum RACK1 protein and displayed PfRACK1 as previously published for HsRACK1 interaction with the human 80S ribosome (34Nielsen M.H. Flygaard R.K. Jenner L.B. Structural analysis of ribosomal RACK1 and its role in translational control.Cell. Signal. 2017; 35: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The helices 39 and 40 of the parasite 18S rRNA reveal the potential for highly similar interactions between the PfRACK1 protein and the P. falciparum 18S rRNA. Previous work also examined ribosomal proteins in this region: RPS16 (uS9), RPS17 (eS17), and RPS3 (uS3) (Fig. 3, B and C), which are also in close proximity. Therefore, residues that may interact with these proteins must also be taken into consideration. Those residues on PfRPS16 and PfRPS17 within 3 to 5 Å range are also highly conserved (Fig. S2) and therefore are not expected to hinder binding. The residues of PfRPS3 are also highly conserved, however, it appears that there may be a C-terminal truncation of 18 residues when compared with HsRPS3 that may impact interaction of the disordered region of the protein (Fig. S2). Overall, the PfRACK1 model data shows high sequence and structural conservation of the PfRACK1 protein compared with HsRACK1 and indicating the possibility of for PfRACK1 to bind the ribosome. We performed transcriptional analysis of PfRACK1 to compare its expression profile over the different parasite life stages as well as correlation with expression of P. falciparum ribosomal proteins. RNAseq data for all available P. falciparum proteins for the ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, schizont, gametocyte II, gametocyte V, ookinete, oocyst, and sporozoite stages from the previous study (35López-Barragán M.J. Lemieux J. Quiñones M. Williamson K.C. Molina-Cruz A. Cui K. Barillas-Mury C. Zhao K. Su X.Z. Directional gene expression and antisense transcripts in sexual and asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 587Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) were collected from PlasmoDB (36Aurrecoechea C. Brestelli J. Brunk B.P. Dommer J. Fischer S. Gajria B. Gao X. Gingle A. Grant G. Harb O.S. Heiges M. Innamorato F. Iodice J. Kissinger J.C. Kraemer E. et al.PlasmoDB: A functional genomic database for malaria parasites.Nucl. Acids Res. 2009; 37: D539-D543Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). A violin plot (Fig. 4A, solid) of all data, other than PfRACK1 and ribosomal proteins, was generated. The ribosomal proteins were plotted as another violin plot (Fig. 4A, dotted outline). The RNAseq data points for RACK1 were then plotted (Fig. 4A, dot plot) to compare the RNA expression of RACK1 with the ribosomal proteins versus all parasite proteins. Our analysis shows that the PfRACK1 gene, like other ribosomal proteins, is highly expressed in comparison to the average total protein transcript expression at each stage and in a pattern similar to other ribosomal proteins (Fig. 4A). Notably, PfRACK1 expression drops by approximately one log10 from the early trophozoite stage where translation is high to when the parasites transition into the schizont stage. A pairwise t test was performed on the three groups and further suggested that PfRACK1 RNA expression is more closely aligned to that of ribosomal proteins than nonribosomal proteins (Table S1). However, a normal Q-Q plot of the data indicated a non-normal distribution (Fig. S3). Therefore, a pairwise Wilcox test was done, which again suggested that PfRACK1 RNA expression is more closely aligned to that of ribosomal proteins than nonribosomal proteins; however, with more statistical significance (Table S2). Thus, the RNAseq data suggests that PfRACK expression follows that of other ribosomal proteins and significant changes in expression are seen during stages where protein synthesis dramatically increases or decreases. Analysis of the protein mass spectrometry data was also performed. Protein mass spectrometry data for all available P. falciparum proteins for the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages of a previous study (37Pease B.N. Huttlin E.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Talevich E.

Acids Res. 2009; 37: D539-D543Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). A pairwise t test of the data revealed that no differences in the three groups exist (Table S3). Again, a normal Q-Q plot of the data suggests that while most of the data falls within the normal distributions, the dataset may have a non-normal distribution (Fig. S4) and a pairwise Wilcox test was also performed and again indicated that no differences in the three groups exist (Table S4). However, it should be noted that protein mass spectrometry data is not available for many parasite proteins, with only about a third of proteins having data, which could dramatically alter the analysis (Fig. 4B). To compare ribosomal binding of human and P. falciparum RACK1, WT, chimeric, and mutant constructs were generated based on bioinformatic and structural model analyses (Figs. 2, A–C, 3, and 5A), as well as previous work (1Adams D.R.

While progress has recently been made in targeting Gαq/11 for UM therapy, the crucial role for these proteins in normal physiology and their high structural similarity with many other important GTPase proteins renders this approach challenging. The aim of the current study was to validate whether a key regulator of Gq signaling, regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2), can inhibit Gαq-mediated UM cell growth. We used two UM cell lines, 92.1 and Mel-202, which both contain the most common activating mutation GαqQ209L and developed stable cell lines with doxycycline-inducible RGS2 protein expression. Using cell viability assays, we showed that RGS2 could inhibit cell growth in both of these UM cell lines. We also found that this effect was independent of the canonical GTPase-activating protein activity of RGS2 but was dependent on the association between RGS2 and Gαq. Furthermore, RGS2 induction resulted in only partial reduction in cell growth as compared to siRNA-mediated Gαq knockdown, perhaps because RGS2 was only able to reduce mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling downstream of phospholipase Cβ, while leaving activation of the Hippo signaling mediators yes-associated protein 1/TAZ, the other major pathway downstream of Gαq, unaffected. Taken together, our data indicate that RGS2 can inhibit UM cancer cell growth by associating with GαqQ209L as a partial effector antagonist.

Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular cancer in adults, arising from melanocytes residing within the three parts of the uveal (iris, ciliary body, and choroid) (1Kaliki S. Shields C.L. Uveal melanoma: Relatively rare but deadly cancer.Eye (Lond.). 2017; 31: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The disease is associated with a high mortality rate, with up to 50% of patients developing metastases with a 1-year survival rate of 15% (2Carvajal R.D. Schwartz G.K. Tezel T. Marr B. Francis J.H. Nathan P.D. Metastatic disease from uveal melanoma: Treatment options and future prospects.Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2017; 101: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). There are currently no targeted therapies for UM, and patients are limited to relying on surgery and radiation therapy, which cause severe side effects (1Kaliki S. Shields C.L. Uveal melanoma: Relatively rare but deadly cancer.Eye (Lond.). 2017; 31: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Hence, in recent years, several groups have dedicated significant effort to identifying targeted UM therapeutic strategies. A majority of UM patients (85%–91%) have a mutation in either the GNAQ or GNA11 gene in a mutually exclusive pattern (3Van Raamsdonk C.D. Griewank K.G. Crosby M.B. Garrido M.C. Vemula S. Wiesner T.

Sci. 2012; 53: 6991-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These genes encode two members of the Gq subfamily of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits, Gαq and Gα11, respectively. These proteins share 90% protein sequence similarity and have been suggested to play similar physiological functions (5Mizuno N. Itoh H. Functions and regulatory mechanisms of Gq-signaling pathways.Neurosignals. 2009; 17: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutations associated with UM all occur at either glutamine 209 (Q209) or arginine 183 (R183) (3Van Raamsdonk C.D. Griewank K.G. Crosby M.B. Garrido M.C. Vemula S. Wiesner T. Obenauf A.C.

This, in turn, results in constitutive activation of multiple downstream effectors, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and yes-associated protein 1 (YAP), that contributes to accelerate abnormal cell growth (6Chen X.

Therefore, these oncogenic mutants have been suggested as promising UM therapeutic targets. Recent studies determined that Gαq/11 inhibitors, such as FR900359, show great promise in targeting both primary and metastatic UM tumors (11Onken M.D. Makepeace C.M. Kaltenbronn K.M. Choi J.

Signal. 2019; 12eaau5948Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, given the central role for Gαq/11 in physiology, directly targeting these proteins represents a challenge. Indeed, decreasing Gαq/11 activity by more than 50%, as demonstrated by early gene dosage studies in mice, is likely to be lethal (13Offermanns S. Zhao L.P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. Embryonic cardiomyocyte hypoplasia and craniofacial defects in G alpha q/G alpha 11-mutant mice.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, therapies that modulate, rather than completely abolish, Gαq/11 activity represent a desirable avenue. In addition to its physiological importance, high structure similarity between Gαq/11 and other important GTPase proteins adds another layer of complexity for selective targeting (14Sprang S.R. Chen Z. Du X. Structural basis of effector regulation and signal termination in heterotrimeric Galpha proteins.Adv. Protein Chem. 2007; 74: 1-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As an alternative to targeting Gαq/11 directly, identifying critical regulators of Gαq/11 may represent a promising, yet underexplored, approach. One of these is represented by regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2), a member of the RGS protein superfamily, which serve as key negative regulators of G protein–mediated signal transduction (15Sjogren B.

RGS2 is unique among the more than 20 known RGS proteins, in that it is a potent and selective regulator of Gαq/11 over other Gα subtypes (18Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R.

RGS2 is known to deactivate Gq/11 signaling through two distinct mechanisms (18Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. RGS2/G0S8 is a selective inhibitor of Gqalpha function.Proc.

Through its canonical GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, RGS2 accelerates GTP hydrolysis at active Gαq/11, resulting in diminished downstream signaling. Additionally, RGS2 can act as an effector antagonist, binding active Gαq/11 and interrupts interactions with its downstream effectors (22Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U.

Chem. 2004; 279: 3906-3915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The most prevalent mutation in UM cells is the constitutively active Gαq/11Q209L, representing approximately 50% of UM cases (23Feng X. Arang N. Rigiracciolo D.C. Lee J.S. Yeerna H. Wang Z. Lubrano S. Kishore A. Pachter J.A. Konig G.M. Maggiolini M. Kostenis E. Schlaepfer D.D. Tamayo P.

The constitutive activity for this mutant is achieved by greatly diminishing its intrinsic GTPase activity, thus RGS2 (or any other RGS protein) cannot deactivate this mutant through its canonical GAP activity (22Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U. Differential contribution of GTPase activation and effector antagonism to the inhibitory effect of RGS proteins on Gq-mediated signaling in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3906-3915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, RGS2 can still act as an effector antagonist at this, and other constitutively active Gαq/11 mutants in vitro (22Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U.

Differential effects of RGS proteins on G alpha(q) and G alpha(11) activity.Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that targeting RGS2 is a rational, yet unexplored approach to reduce the functional abundance of oncogenic Gαq/11 mutants and inhibit UM tumor growth. To this end, we used UM cells, which endogenously express GαqQ209L (25Griewank K.G. Yu X. Khalili J. Sozen M.M. Stempke-Hale K. Bernatchez C. Wardell S. Bastian B.C. Woodman S.E. Genetic and molecular characterization of uveal melanoma cell lines.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2012; 25: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), in the current study, as a model system to determine the effects of RGS2 on Gαq-dependent UM cell growth. To determine whether RGS2 can suppress Gαq-dependent UM cell growth, we used the UM cell line 92.1, that endogenously expresses the constitutively active GαqQ209L mutant, as a model system. We first developed a stable cell line with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible RGS2 expression using the Lenti-Tet-One expression system (Clontech). Treatment of these cells with 1 μg/ml Dox induced expression of RGS2-HA after 24 h, which was sustained for at least 72 h (Fig. 1A). We then performed cell growth assays using the RealTime-Glo MT Cell Viability Assay (Promega). This nonlytic assay has the benefit of enabling multiple viability measures over time, thus enabling one well to be measured at every time point, reducing variability. We used cells stably transduced with the empty vector (vector ctrl) as a negative control. In the vector ctrl cells, Dox had no significant effect on cell growth. However, we observed a significant reduction of cell growth in cells with induced RGS2-HA expression (Fig. 1D), both as compared to the same cells without Dox, as well as to the vector control cells in the presence of Dox. Cell number was significantly reduced at all time points (24, 48, and 72 h), indicating that increased RGS2 expression can reduce growth of 92.1 UM cells. We used an additional UM cell line, Mel-202, which also expresses GαqQ209L as the oncogenic driver and created stable, Dox-inducible RGS2 protein expression in these cells as well. Similar to 92.1 cells, induction of RGS2-HA expression was induced by 1 μg/ml Dox at 24 h and remained stable for at least 72 h posttreatment (Fig. 1B). The induction of RGS2-HA expression resulted in a significant decrease in Mel-202 cell growth at all time points (24, 48, and 72 h), as measured by the RealTime-Glo MT Cell Viability Assay (Fig. 1E). In contrast, induction of RGS2-HA expression resulted in no suppression of cell growth in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (Fig. 1, C and F), which is not dependent on mutations in Gαq as the oncogenic driver. As stated above, the chosen assay paradigm has the benefit of enabling the same well being measured at every time point; however, the reagent is only stable in cell culture for 72 h. To make sure that the effect of RGS2-HA induction on UM cell growth will not be compensated easily and quickly over time, we used an end-point approach, where cells were plated at equal cell densities on day 0, harvested on day 2, 4, and 6, respectively, and then subjected to the RealTime-Glo MT Cell Viability Assay. Dox was added every 2 days to maintain RGS2-HA induction. Using this approach, we found that the suppression of cell growth induced by RGS2-HA was maintained at least up to 6 days in both 92.1 (Fig. 1G) and Mel-202 (Fig. 1H) cells. Cell growth was significantly lower in both cell lines as compared to vector ctrl cells treated with Dox, as well as RGS2-HA transduced cells in the absence of Dox. Altogether these data suggest that RGS2 can suppress Gq-dependent UM cell growth. After establishing that RGS2 can inhibit GαqQ209L-dependent UM cell growth, we next aimed to determine whether this suppression was mediated through actions of RGS2 on Gαq. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gαq in our stable 92.1 cell line resulted in an 83% reduction in Gαq protein levels, as detected by Western blot (Fig. 2A). This resulted in a large decrease in 92.1 UM cell growth (Fig. 2B), indicating that Gαq is a major driver of proliferation in these cells, in agreement with previous literature (25Griewank K.G. Yu X. Khalili J. Sozen M.M. Stempke-Hale K. Bernatchez C. Wardell S. Bastian B.C. Woodman S.E. Genetic and molecular characterization of uveal melanoma cell lines.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2012; 25: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To validate the SMART-POOL siRNA used in these studies, we used the individual siRNA oligos. All four individual siRNAs resulted in a significant reduction in both Gαq protein levels (Fig. S1, A and B) and 92.1 cell growth (Fig. S1C), although to lesser extent than what was achieved by the SMART-POOL siRNA. Dox-mediated induction of RGS2-HA in cells transfected with a nontargeting siRNA control (ctrl siRNA) resulted in significant reduction in cell growth (Fig. 2B), at a similar magnitude as we had initially observed (Fig. 1). However, RGS2 lost the ability to reduce cell growth in cells transfected with Gαq siRNA, indicating that RGS2 suppresses 92.1 UM cell growth through actions that are dependent on Gαq. To complement our genetic approach to inhibit Gαq, we used YM-254890 a selective Gαq/11 inhibitor (26Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Kobori M. A novel Galphaq/11-selective inhibitor.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47438-47445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies, YM-254890 caused a significant decrease in 92.1 cell growth (Figs. 2C and S1D) (27Ma J. Weng L. Bastian B.C. Chen X. Functional characterization of uveal melanoma oncogenes.Oncogene. 2021; 40: 806-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the presence of YM-254890, induction of RGS2-HA expression had no additional effect on 92.1 cell growth (Fig. 2C), confirming that RGS2 suppresses Gq-dependent UM cell growth through a mechanism that is dependent on the presence and activity of Gαq. We next aimed to determine the mechanism by which RGS2 suppresses GαqQ209L-mediated cell growth in 92.1 cells. Previous studies have shown that while RGS2 does not have GAP activity toward GαqQ209L, it can still bind to this constitutively active mutant (22Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U.

To confirm this, we used RGS2N149A, which is thought to possess no GAP activity toward any Gα subtype (29Nguyen C.H. Ming H. Zhao P. Hugendubler L. Gros R. Kimball S.R. Chidiac P.

We first confirmed the ability for RGS2WT, RGS2N149A, and RGS2S179D to bind GαqQ209L using proteins expressed by in vitro transcription/translation, followed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) utilizing a Glu-Glu (EE) tag on GαqQ209L. Both RGS2WT and RGS2N149A associated with GαqQ209L to a similar degree (Fig. 3A). In contrast, RGS2S179D was severely deficient in associating with GαqQ209L (Fig. 3A). Next, we determined the effect of RGS2N149A and RGS2S179D on 92.1 cell growth. We created stable 92.1 cell lines with Dox-inducible expression of either mutant using the same strategy as for RGS2WT. Following induction with 1 μg/ml Dox, RGS2N149A expressed at similar levels as RGS2WT. In contrast, RGS2S179D was expressed at significantly higher levels than RGS2WT (Fig. 3B). Gαq protein levels were unchanged by induction of either RGS2 variant (Fig. 3C). We next determined the effect of the GAP-deficient RGS2N149A and the Gαq binding-deficient RGS2S179D on 92.1 cell growth. Similar to what we had observed with RGS2WT (Figs. 1 and 3D), RGS2N149A significantly inhibited cell growth (Fig. 3E), indicating that RGS2 inhibits Gαq-dependent UM cell growth through a GAP-independent mechanism. In contrast. Induction of RGS2S179D did not significantly change 92.1 cell growth (Fig. 3F), indicating that RGS2 suppresses UM cell growth through a mechanism that involves binding to Gαq. The suppression of cell growth by RGS2WT and RGS2N149A were significantly decreased at 48 and 72 h. Altogether our data support a model where RGS2 inhibits GαqQ209L-mediated cell proliferation through effector antagonism, rather than through its canonical GAP activity. We next aimed to determine which signaling pathway(s) downstream of Gαq are affected by RGS2 protein induction. Two main signaling pathways are associated with cell proliferation downstream of Gαq. First, Gαq activates phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), which subsequently leads to activation of protein kinase C, and downstream activation of a MAPK cascade leading to phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) (Figs. 4A). We therefore used phosphorylation of ERK1/2 as a readout of signaling downstream of GαqQ209L via the canonical PLCβ pathway. First, the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib (Tram) was used to determine effects of ERK1/2 activation on 92.1 cell growth. Treatment of 92.1 cells with Tram caused complete abolishment of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown) and a corresponding strong, dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth (Fig. S2). At low concentrations of Tram (≤1 nM), induction of RGS2 caused additional suppression of cell growth (Fig. 4B). This effect was lost at higher Tram concentrations (Fig. S2). We next used siRNA to knock down Gαq in the Dox-inducible RGS2WT 92.1 cells. Gαq siRNA caused a significant reduction in Gαq protein levels, as determined by Western blot (Fig. 4, C and F). Under basal conditions, these cells displayed a high level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D). Gαq siRNA caused a significant decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, consistent with the model that Gαq drives proliferation in these cells via activation of MAPK signaling (Fig. 4, C and D). Induction of RGS2-HA expression also caused a significant decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D). However, RGS2 lost the ability to reduce ERK1/2 phosphorylation when Gαq was concurrently knocked down. Total ERK1/2 protein levels were unaffected by either Dox or Gαq siRNA (Fig. 4, C and E). The effects of RGS2-HA induction and Gαq knockdown on ERK1/2 phosphorylation could be replicated in a second GαqQ209L-dependent UM cell line, Mel-202 (Fig. 4, G–J). Importantly, medium to high concentrations of Tram caused complete abolishment of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown), with virtually complete arrest in cell growth as a result (Fig. S2). In contrast, both Dox-induced induction of RGS2 protein or Gαq siRNA only caused partial inhibition (50%–70%) of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Altogether these data are consistent with the model that RGS2 mediates effects on ERK1/2 signaling through actions that are dependent on Gαq.Figure 5RGS2 does not affect Gαq-mediated YAP activation in uveal melanoma cells.

Representative images (B) and quantification (C) of three independent experiments demonstrating effects of Gαq siRNA and Dox-induced RGS2 expression on nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ. Gαq siRNA results in almost a 50% reduction in YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Induction of RGS2 protein expression has no effect on YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. YAP/TAZ activation was measured using a lentiviral TEAD luciferase reporter in 92.1 (D) and Mel-202 (E) cells. In both cell lines, Gαq siRNA results in a significant (∼75%) reduction in TEAD luciferase activity. Induction of RGS2-HA has no effect on TEAD luciferase.

https://openalex.org/W4224283457,"Formation of transcription factor (TF)-coregulator complexes is a key step in transcriptional regulation, with coregulators having essential functions as hub nodes in molecular networks. How specificity and selectivity are maintained in these nodes remain open questions. In this work, we addressed specificity in transcriptional networks using complexes formed between TFs and αα-hubs, which are defined by a common αα-hairpin secondary structure motif, as a model. Using NMR spectroscopy and binding thermodynamics, we analyzed the structure, dynamics, stability, and ligand-binding properties of the Arabidopsis thaliana RST domains from TAF4 and known binding partner RCD1, and the TAFH domain from human TAF4, allowing comparison across species, functions, and architectural contexts. While these αα-hubs shared the αα-hairpin motif, they differed in length and orientation of accessory helices as well as in their thermodynamic profiles of ligand binding. Whereas biologically relevant RCD1-ligand pairs displayed high affinity driven by enthalpy, TAF4-ligand interactions were entropy driven and exhibited less binding-induced structuring. We in addition identified a thermal unfolding state with a structured core for all three domains, although the temperature sensitivity differed. Thermal stability studies suggested that initial unfolding of the RCD1-RST domain localized around helix 1, lending this region structural malleability, while effects in TAF4-RST were more stochastic, suggesting variability in structural adaptability upon binding. Collectively, our results support a model in which hub structure, flexibility, and binding thermodynamics contribute to αα-hub-TF binding specificity, a finding of general relevance to the understanding of coregulator-ligand interactions and interactome sizes."
https://openalex.org/W4224434483,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, as beneficial soil microorganisms, inevitably interact with indigenous microorganisms, regulating plant growth and nutrient utilization in natural habitats. However, how indigenous microorganisms affect the benefits of growth and nutrition regulated by inoculated AM fungi for plants in karst ecosystem habitats remains unclear today. In this experiment, the Gramineae species Setaria viridis vs. Arthraxon hispidus and the Compositae species Bidens pilosa vs. Bidens tripartita exist in the initial succession stage of the karst ecosystem. These plant species were planted into different soil microbial conditions, including AM fungi soil (AMF), AM fungi interacting with indigenous microorganisms soil (AMI), and a control soil without AM fungi and indigenous microorganisms (CK). The plant biomass, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were measured; the effect size of different treatments on these variables of plant biomass and N and P were simultaneously calculated to assess plant responses. The results showed that AMF treatment differently enhanced plant biomass accumulation, N, and P absorption in all species but reduced the N/P ratio. The AMI treatment also significantly increased plant biomass, N and P, except for the S. viridis seedlings. However, regarding the effect size, the AM fungi effect on plant growth and nutrition was greater than the interactive effect of AM fungi with indigenous microorganisms. It indicates that the indigenous microorganisms offset the AM benefits for the host plant. In conclusion, we suggest that the indigenous microorganisms offset the benefits of inoculated AM fungi in biomass and nutrient accumulation for pioneer plants in the karst habitat."

Complete chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) genomes of three Asparagus specimens collected in Hong Kong— A . aethiopicus , A . densiflorus ‘Myers’, and A . cochinchinensis —were de novo assembled using Illumina sequencing. Their sizes ranged from 157,069 to 157,319 bp, with a total guanine–cytosine content of 37.5%. Structurally, a large single copy (84,598–85,350 bp) and a small single copy (18,677–18,685 bp) were separated by a pair of inverted repeats (26,518–26,573 bp). In total, 136 genes were annotated for A . aethiopicus and A . densiflorus ‘Myers’; these included 90 mRNA, 38 tRNA, and 8 rRNA genes. Further, 132 genes, including 87 mRNA, 37 tRNA, and 8 rRNA genes, were annotated for A . cochinchinensis . For comparative and phylogenetic analysis, we included NCBI data for four congenerics, A . setaceus , A . racemosus , A . schoberioides , and A . officinalis . The gene content, order, and genome structure were relatively conserved among the genomes studied. There were similarities in simple sequence repeats in terms of repeat type, sequence complementarity, and cpDNA partition distribution. A . densiflorus ‘Myers’ had distinctive long sequence repeats in terms of their quantity, type, and length-interval frequency. Divergence hotspots, with nucleotide diversity (Pi) ≥ 0.015, were identified in five genomic regions: accD - psaI , ccsA , trnS - trnG , ycf1 , and ndhC - trnV . Here, we summarise the historical changes in the generic subdivision of Asparagus . Our phylogenetic analysis, which also elucidates the nomenclatural complexity of A . aethiopicus and A . densiflorus ‘Myers’, further supports their close phylogenetic relationship. The findings are consistent with prior generic subdivisions, except for the placement of A . racemosus , which requires further study.

https://openalex.org/W4224223018,"The metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA), is known to affect synaptic plasticity in the nervous system and to play an important role in learning and memory. A ubiquitous mechanism by which neuronal plasticity develops in the nervous system is through modulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) and voltage-gated K+ channels. However, how retinoids might regulate the activity of these channels has not been determined. Here, we show that RA modulates neuronal firing by inducing spike broadening and complex spiking in a dose-dependent manner in peptidergic and dopaminergic cell types. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we show that RA-induced complex spiking is activity dependent and involves enhanced inactivation of delayed rectifier voltage-gated K+ channels. The prolonged depolarizations observed during RA-modulated spiking lead to an increase in Ca2+ influx through CaV channels, though we also show an opposing effect of RA on the same neurons to inhibit Ca2+ influx. At physiological levels of Ca2+, this inhibition is specific to CaV2 (not CaV1) channels. Examining the interaction between the spike-modulating effects of RA and its inhibition of CaV channels, we found that inhibition of CaV2 channels limits the Ca2+ influx resulting from spike modulation. Our data thus provide novel evidence to suggest that retinoid signaling affects both delayed rectifier K+ channels and CaV channels to fine-tune Ca2+ influx through CaV2 channels. As these channels play important roles in synaptic function, we propose that these modulatory effects of retinoids likely contribute to synaptic plasticity in the nervous system.

As these channels play important roles in synaptic function, we propose that these modulatory effects of retinoids likely contribute to synaptic plasticity in the nervous system. Neural circuits are able to process and store information largely as a result of their ability to undergo plasticity and modulation. A ubiquitous mechanism through which neuronal plasticity occurs is through modulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) and voltage-gated K+ (KV) channels (1Nanou E. Catterall W.A.

CaV channel activity influences synaptic transmission and gene transcription, whereas KV channel activity regulates action potential repolarization and neuronal excitability. Neurons can possess three major subtypes of CaV channels, CaV1, CaV2, and CaV3. The CaV1 (L-type) channels are activated at high voltages, are largely present in neuronal dendrites and the cell body, and mediate activity-dependent gene transcription (3Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E.

CaV2 (non–L-type) channels also activate at high voltages, are largely present at presynaptic terminals and mediate synaptic transmission, though can also mediate Ca2+ signaling in neuronal cell bodies (1Nanou E.

Finally, CaV3 (T-type) channels activate at low voltages and shape the firing properties of neurons (5Cheong E. Shin H.S. T-type Ca2+ channels in normal and abnormal brain functions.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 961-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). There are many different gene families for KV channels. Two broad categories of Kv channels are the rapidly inactivating A-type channels and the nonrapidly inactivating delayed rectifier channels (6Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. Lazdunski M.

Both these categories of KV channels have been implicated in shaping the firing properties of neurons, (e.g., hippocampal neurons) and have thus been implicated in synaptic plasticity in the nervous system (2Cho I.H.

Retinoic acid (RA), the active metabolite of vitamin A, has recently emerged as a critical regulator of neural plasticity in the adult brain (in addition to its important roles in nervous system development). It can exert both genomic and nongenomic effects by binding to retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors (RXR) (8Chen L. Lau A.G. Sarti F.

In particular, activation of RA signaling induces local synthesis and membrane insertion of glutamate receptors, subsequently increasing Ca2+ influx into the postsynaptic neurons in an activity-dependent manner (8Chen L.

A. 2015; 112: E5744-E5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RA has also been shown to reduce inhibitory synaptic transmission through rapid endocytosis of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (18Sarti F. Zhang Z. Schroeder J. Chen L. Rapid suppression of inhibitory transmission by retinoic acid.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 11440-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to these postsynaptic effects of RA, it can both increase or decrease inhibitory synaptic transmission through presynaptic mechanisms, in a cell type–specific manner (19Yee A.X. Chen L. Differential regulation of spontaneous and evoked inhibitory synaptic transmission in somatosensory cortex by retinoic acid.Synapse. 2016; 70: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Zhong L.R.

Neurosci. 2018; 38: 10454-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, RA signaling can regulate activity-dependent plasticity at different synapses through diverse presynpatic and postsynaptic mechanisms. In addition to modulating synaptic efficacy in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS), RA signaling also affects neural circuitry in invertebrates. We have previously shown that RA is required for normal associative learning and memory in the mollusc, Lymnaea stagnalis (21Rothwell C.M. Spencer G.E. Retinoid signaling is necessary for, and promotes long-term memory formation following operant conditioning.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2014; 114: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and can affect neuronal synapse formation and modulation in vitro (22Rothwell C.M. de Hoog E. Spencer G.E. The role of retinoic acid in the formation and modulation of invertebrate central synapses.J. Neurophysiol. 2017; 117: 692-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the activity-dependent mechanisms by which RA regulates neural plasticity are largely unknown. In Lymnaea neurons, RA produces spike broadening and complex spiking, which includes burst firing and plateau potentials (23Vesprini N.D. Spencer G.E. Retinoic acid induces changes in electrical properties in a dose- & isomer-dependent manner.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Such a modulation of spike shape and firing patterns is known to play a role in synaptic plasticity (during learning and memory) and can result in enhanced synaptic transmission in neural circuits (24Xu W. Morishita W. Buckmaster P.S. Pang Z.P. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C. Distinct neuronal coding schemes in memory revealed by selective erasure of fast synchronous synaptic transmission.Neuron. 2012; 73: 990-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have also shown that RA signaling inhibits CaV channels in Lymnaea neurons (25de Hoog E. Lukewich M.K. Spencer G.E. Retinoic acid inhibits neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.Cell Calcium. 2018; 72: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whether the RA-induced spike broadening and complex spiking is activity dependent (and thus contributes to activity-dependent processes such as learning and memory), and how this effect interacts with concurrent RA-mediated inhibition of CaV channels, is not yet known. In this study, we examine this interaction and also determine whether changes in KV channel function contribute to these modulatory effects of RA on spike broadening and complex spiking activity. We show that micromolar concentrations of RA (similar to those eliciting effects in mouse and human neurons) produce spike broadening and complex spiking in an activity-dependent manner and in diverse neuronal cell types. By playing back neuronal firing patterns (action potential clamp) into single neurons in vitro, we show that RA-mediated inhibition of CaV2 channels limits the enhanced Ca2+ influx that occurs during RA-mediated spike broadening and activity-dependent complex spiking. We also determine that spike broadening and activity-dependent complex spiking likely occurs as a result of RA-mediated inhibition of delayed rectifier KV channels. These data provide novel insights into how multiple forms of neuromodulation mediated by RA might tune Ca2+ influx (and thus potentially neurotransmitter release) at neuronal synapses. Spike broadening and burst firing are important for information transfer and plasticity in neural circuits. We have previously shown that all-trans RA produces spike broadening and complex spiking (burst firing and plateau potentials) in Lymnaea visceral F (VF) neurons (23Vesprini N.D. Spencer G.E. Retinoic acid induces changes in electrical properties in a dose- & isomer-dependent manner.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the activitydependence of these effects, as well as the underlying cellular mechanisms, has not yet been determined. VF neurons were incubated overnight in varying concentrations of RA (ranging from 1 to 5 μM) or the equivalent concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (as controls). The following day, individual neurons were current clamped and stimulated using a current-step protocol ranging from −100 to 400 pA in intervals of 25 pA. To determine whether RA-mediated spike broadening and complex spiking was activity dependent, we analyzed spike half-width (spike broadening) and complex spiking at the first current step that elicited a minimum of three action potentials (rheobase 1) and at the three subsequent depolarizing current injection steps (rheobases 2–4). We found that all concentrations of RA between 1 and 5 μM produced spike broadening (representative example is shown in Fig. 1A). We compared the spike half-width in the presence or the absence of RA at all four rheobases and for each concentration of RA. A two-way ANOVA of spike half-width at each concentration (1, 2, 2.5, 3, and 5 μM RA) revealed a significant effect of treatment (RA), but not rheobase (activity), for all concentrations including the lowest concentrations of 1 μM (F(1,84) = 11.546; p = 0.001; Fig. 1B) and 2 μM (F(1,99) = 13.173; p < 0.001; Fig. 1C). We also determined whether RA influenced other physiological properties of neuronal activity. A two-way ANOVA of the peak voltage of the action potential across rheobases 1 to 4, for each concentration of RA, revealed that all concentrations of RA (except 1 μM) significantly reduced the action potential peak voltage, including the lower concentration of 2 μM (F(1,99) = 5.175; p = 0.025; RA: 39.24 ± 9.7 mV; DMSO: 41.9 ± 5.7 mV). Similarly, all concentrations of RA (including the lowest concentration of 1 μM [F(1,84) = 74.152; p < 0.001]) significantly depolarized the peak voltage of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) (1 μM RA: −48.93 ± 6.4 mV; DMSO: −58.91 ± 5.8 mV), indicative of a reduced AHP amplitude. However, there were minimal effects of RA on the resting membrane potential (RMP) or input resistance; only 2.5 μM RA had a significant effect on the RMP (RA: −52.77 ± 7.1 mV; DMSO: −44.25 ± 7.7 mV; t = −2.572; p = 0.019), whereas only 3 μM significantly reduced the input resistance (RA: 661.24 ± 275.5 MΩ; DMSO: 919.86 ± 273.2 MΩ; t = −2.137; p = 0.046). To determine the concentration dependence of complex spiking induced by RA, statistical analysis (Fisher's exact tests) revealed that all concentrations of RA produced a significant increase in the proportion of cells exhibiting complex spiking (1 μM RA: 69%; p = 0.002; 2 μM RA: 81%; p < 0.001; 2.5 μM RA: 82%; p < 0.001; 3 μM RA: 75%; p = 0.001; 5 μM RA: 86%; p < 0.001) compared with the equivalent concentrations of DMSO, at which no cells (0%) exhibited complex spiking. These data suggest that concentrations of RA in a range similar to those previously estimated to occur in the Lymnaea CNS (26Dmetrichuk J.M. Carlone R.L. Jones T.R.B. Vesprini N.D. Spencer G.E. Detection of endogenous retinoids in the molluscan CNS and characterization of the trophic and tropic actions of 9-cis retinoic acid on isolated neurons.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13014-13024Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and similar to those that induce effects in vertebrate neurons, produce both spike broadening, changes in spike amplitude and AHP, as well as complex firing in individual VF neurons. To determine whether the effect of RA on complex spiking was activity dependent, we compared the number of complex spikes that occurred across rheobases 1 to 4, for each RA concentration. An example of complex spikes in the presence of 1 μM RA (at rheobase 4) is shown in Figure 2A. These representative recordings in Figure 2A also illustrate how the number of elicited spikes significantly increased from rheobase 1 to 4 (1 μM RA: H = 8.827; p = 0.032, ANOVA on ranks). This was also true for 2, 3, and 5 μM RA (and DMSO), confirming an activity-dependent increase in spike number across rheobases. A one-way ANOVA on ranks revealed that the incidence of complex spiking was found to be activity dependent at lower concentrations of 1 μM RA (H = 8.177; p = 0.042; Fig. 2B), 2 μM RA (H = 9.019; p = 0.029; Fig. 2C), and 3 μM RA (H = 9.138; p = 0.028; Fig. 2D), but not at the higher concentration of 5 μM (H = 1.003; p = 0.8; Fig. 2E). A concentration of 2 μM RA, which elicits both spike broadening and activity-dependent complex spiking, was chosen for use throughout the remainder of this study. We next determined whether RA would produce spike broadening and activity-dependent complex spiking in other neuronal cell types, or whether this was specific to VF neurons. We assessed the effects of RA on the large dopaminergic interneuron, right pedal dorsal 1 (RPeD1, n = 7), the neuroendocrine right parietal B (RPB) cells (n = 8), or the right parietal A (RPA) respiratory motor neurons (n = 6). A two-way ANOVA of spike half-width revealed a significant effect of treatment on RPeD1 (F(1,48) = 61.375; p < 0.001), RPB (F(1,54) = 12.363; p < 0.001), and RPA cells (F(1,40) = 16.601; p < 0.001), indicating that RA significantly increased spike half-width in all three cell types (compared with DMSO). RA also significantly increased the proportion of cells exhibiting complex spiking at any of the four rheobases (RPeD1: RA 71.4%, DMSO 0%; p = 0.021; RPB: RA 100%, DMSO 0%; p < 0.001; RPA: RA 83.3%, DMSO 0%; p = 0.015; Fisher’s exact tests). The ability of RA to induce complex spiking was also activity dependent in RPeD1 (H = 9.998; p = 0.019; Fig. 2F) and RPB cells (H = 16.395; p < 0.001; Fig. 2G) but not in RPA cells (F(3,20) = 1.114; p = 0.367). These data suggest that RA induces activity-dependent complex spiking in diverse neuronal subtypes, including dopaminergic and peptidergic cells, suggesting a possible wide range of influence on distinct cell types within the brain. As CaV channels play an ubiquitous role in synaptic transmission and activity-dependent changes in gene expression, modulation of their activity might directly influence activity-dependent changes in neural circuits. We have previously shown that RA (1 and 5 μM) inhibits CaV channels by shifting the voltage dependence of channel activation; a biophysical property that determines at which voltage the channels open, thus determining their activity during neuronal firing. However, the previous study was performed using 10 mM barium as the charge carrier, eliminating any subsequent effects of calcium influx (25de Hoog E. Lukewich M.K. Spencer G.E. Retinoic acid inhibits neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.Cell Calcium. 2018; 72: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As RA is known to interact with Ca2+ signaling at hippocampal synapses (17Arendt K.L. Zhang Z. Ganesan S. Hintze M. Shin M.M. Tang Y. Cho A. Graef I.A. Chen L. Calcineurin mediates homeostatic synaptic plasticity by regulating retinoic acid synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Decrease in calcium concentration triggers neuronal retinoic acid synthesis during homeostatic synaptic plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 17764-17771Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we deemed it necessary to examine the effects of RA on CaV channels in the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca2+. VF neurons were cultured overnight in the presence or the absence of RA and then voltage clamped in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (4.1 mM). Cells were held at −115 mV for 1 s and then stepped to potentials between −115 mV and +55 mV for 400 ms, in 5 mV increments. Raw recordings in Figure 3A illustrate the reduction in ICa in the presence of 2 μM RA. A two-way ANOVA of peak current density revealed a significant interaction between treatment and voltage (F(34,1260) = 2.758; p < 0.001). The current–voltage (IV) relationship in Figure 3B illustrates that RA inhibited ICa at potentials between −15 and +35 mV. However, RA did not significantly affect the voltage dependence of channel activation (Fig. 3C), the voltage of half-maximal activation (RA: −2.683 ± 7.1 mV; DMSO: −5.224 ± 6.4 mV; p = 0.260), or the slope factor (RA: 5.777 ± 1.9; DMSO: 5.179 ± 1.6; p = 0.186). Two additional properties that influence Ca2+ influx through CaV channels are the voltage dependence of inactivation (the inactivation that occurs at a particular membrane potential) and the recovery from inactivation (the time dependence of the removal of inactivation at negative membrane potentials). However, a two-way ANOVA of ICa inactivation revealed that treatment (RA versus DMSO) had no effect on the voltage dependence of inactivation (F(1,490) = 1.252; p = 0.264). RA had no effect on the voltage of half-maximal inactivation (RA: −14.362 ± 4.5 mV; DMSO: −12.091 ± 4.4 mV; t = −1.021; p = 0.324) or the slope of inactivation (RA: 4.88 ± 0.4; DMSO: 4.504 ± 0.7; t = 1.313; p = 0.210). A two-way ANOVA of recovery from inactivation also revealed no significant effect of treatment (F(1,294) = 0.242; p = 0.623), suggesting that RA had no effect on the recovery from inactivation of CaV channels. Though it was not possible to record firing activity and Ca2+ currents in the same cell (because of the presence of K+ channel blockers), overall these data indicate that concentrations of RA that produced activity-dependent complex spiking also inhibited ICa in the same cell type. We next determined, using physiological concentrations of Ca2+, whether RA specifically affected L-type or non–L-type channels. VF neurons were cultured in the presence or the absence of RA overnight and then voltage clamped to record ICa. The CaV1 (L-type) channel blocker, nifedipine (Sigma–Aldrich; 10 μM), was utilized to separate CaV2 (non–L-type) currents from CaV1 (L-type) currents (28Spafford J.D. Dunn T. Smit A.B. Syed N.I.

Chem. 2019; 294: 10076-10093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The proportional block of ICa by nifedipine indicated that CaV1 current comprised approximately 20 to 25% of total ICa. The proportional block by nifedipine was slightly (but nonsignificantly) greater following RA treatment, compared with DMSO (RA: 26.839% ± 15.7; DMSO: 20.26% ± 12.1; t = 1.008; p = 0.329). A two-way ANOVA of nifedipine-insensitive (CaV2; non–L-type) ICa revealed a significant interaction between treatment (RA versus DMSO) and voltage (F(34,665) = 2.244; p < 0.001). Raw recordings (Fig. 4A) and the IV relationship (Fig. 4B) illustrate the inhibition of CaV2 channels by RA at voltages ranging from −10 to +20 mV. Furthermore, the activation curve in Figure 4C illustrates that RA inhibited CaV2 by shifting the voltage dependence of channel activation to more positive potentials; RA significantly increased the voltage of half-maximal activation (Fig. 4D) but had no significant effect on slope factor (RA: 7.101 ± 1.6; DMSO: 6.533 ± 1.3; t = 0.906; p = 0.376). In contrast, RA had no significant effect on CaV1 channels (Fig. 4, E and F). These data suggest that concentrations of RA (2 μM), known to produce activity-dependent complex spiking in these cells, also inhibited CaV2 (but not CaV1) channels, by shifting the voltage dependence of channel activation to more positive potentials. The aforementioned results indicate that the RA-mediated spike broadening and activity-dependent complex spiking occurs in the same cell type and at the same concentrations as the RA-mediated inhibition of CaV2 channels. Presumably, the prolonged depolarizations occurring during spike broadening and complex spiking would enhance Ca2+ influx through CaV channels, and it is possible that, if occurring concurrently, RA might induce opposing effects on Ca2+ signaling. We next determined whether spike broadening and activity-dependent complex spiking does indeed enhance Ca2+ influx, and if so, whether this is influenced by concurrent RA-induced inhibition of CaV2 channels. To this end, we utilized the action potential clamp technique, which uses previously recorded neuronal activity (spiking) as the voltage stimulus for recording ion channel activity. Specifically, the voltage stimulus protocol consiste"
https://openalex.org/W4224253022,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver and occurs predominantly in patients with underlying chronic liver diseases. Over the past decade, human ornithine aminotransferase (hOAT), which is an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolic conversion of ornithine into an intermediate for proline or glutamate synthesis, has been found to be overexpressed in HCC cells. hOAT has since emerged as a promising target for novel anticancer therapies, especially for the ongoing rational design effort to discover mechanism-based inactivators (MBIs). Despite the significance of hOAT in human metabolism and its clinical potential as a drug target against HCC, there are significant knowledge deficits with regard to its catalytic mechanism and structural characteristics. Ongoing MBI design efforts require in-depth knowledge of the enzyme active site, in particular, pKa values of potential nucleophiles and residues necessary for the molecular recognition of ligands. Here, we conducted a study detailing the fundamental active-site properties of hOAT using stopped-flow spectrophotometry and X-ray crystallography. Our results quantitatively revealed the pH dependence of the multistep reaction mechanism and illuminated the roles of ornithine α-amino and δ-amino groups in substrate recognition and in facilitating catalytic turnover. These findings provided insights of the catalytic mechanism that could benefit the rational design of MBIs against hOAT. In addition, substrate recognition and turnover of several fragment-sized alternative substrates of hOATs, which could serve as structural templates for MBI design, were also elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W4224257443,"The signaling pathways and cellular functions regulated by the four Numb-associated kinases are largely unknown. We reported that AAK1 and GAK control intracellular trafficking of RNA viruses and revealed a requirement for BIKE in early and late stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, the downstream targets phosphorylated by BIKE have not yet been identified. Here, to identify BIKE substrates, we conducted a barcode fusion genetics-yeast two-hybrid screen and retrieved publicly available data generated via affinity-purification mass spectrometry. We subsequently validated 19 of 47 putative BIKE interactors using mammalian cell–based protein–protein interaction assays. We found that CLINT1, a cargo-specific adapter implicated in bidirectional Golgi-to-endosome trafficking, emerged as a predominant hit in both screens. Our experiments indicated that BIKE catalyzes phosphorylation of a threonine 294 CLINT1 residue both in vitro and in cell culture. Our findings revealed that CLINT1 phosphorylation mediates its binding to the DENV nonstructural 3 protein and subsequently promotes DENV assembly and egress. Additionally, using live-cell imaging we revealed that CLINT1 cotraffics with DENV particles and is involved in mediating BIKE’s role in DENV infection. Finally, our data suggest that additional cellular BIKE interactors implicated in the host immune and stress responses and the ubiquitin proteasome system might also be candidate phosphorylation substrates of BIKE.

The 10.7-kb genome of DENV, an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus, encodes a single polyprotein, which is proteolytically cleaved into individual proteins (3Diamond M.S. Pierson T.C. Molecular insight into dengue virus pathogenesis and its implications for disease control.Cell. 2015; 162: 488-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). While the viral replication machinery is composed of the DENV nonstructural (NS) proteins, virions are formed by the capsid, premembrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins. DENV enters its target cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (3Diamond M.S. Pierson T.C. Molecular insight into dengue virus pathogenesis and its implications for disease control.Cell. 2015; 162: 488-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Infectious DENV production is thought to be initiated by assembly of viral particles in ER sites where the E protein is present (4Welsch S. Miller S. Romero-Brey I. Merz A. Bleck C.K.E. Walther P.

Nevertheless, it remains incompletely characterized what the mechanisms that control trafficking of DENV particles during viral entry and assembly/egress are. The family of Numb-associated kinases (NAKs) is composed of the Ser/Thr kinases BMP2-inducible kinase (BIKE), adapter-associated kinase 1 (AAK1), G-cyclin–associated kinase (GAK), and serine/threonine kinase 16 (STK16). These diverse kinases share only limited homology in the kinase domain with low homology in other protein regions (6Sorrell F.J. Szklarz M. Abdul Azeez K.R. Elkins J.M. Knapp S.

The structure of BIKE and AAK1 is closely related, whereas STK16 is the most distantly related NAK. Members of the NAK family have been shown to regulate intracellular membrane trafficking (7Sato J.

More recently, we have demonstrated that BIKE, but not STK16, mediates both an early (postinternalization) stage in the DENV life cycle and a late (assembly/egress) stage (20Pu S. Schor S. Karim M.

We have reported that small molecules that potently inhibit the kinase activity of BIKE suppress replication of DENV infection both in vitro and ex vivo and demonstrate antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses with a high genetic barrier to resistance. We have also shown that BIKE is involved in mediating the mechanism of antiviral activity of these small molecules (20Pu S. Schor S. Karim M. Saul S. Robinson M. Kumar S. Prugar L.I. Dorosky D.E.

Lastly, we have shown that BIKE’s effect is mediated in part by phosphorylation of a threonine 156 (T156) AP2M1 residue (20Pu S. Schor S. Karim M. Saul S. Robinson M. Kumar S. Prugar L.I.

We show that BIKE catalyzes phosphorylation of a threonine 294 (T294) CLINT1 residue and that additional BIKE interactors are candidate phosphorylation substrates. Additionally, our data indicate that the phosphorylation of CLINT1 by BIKE mediates binding of CLINT1 to the DENV NS3 protein and subsequently DENV assembly and egress. To identify BIKE interactors and candidate substrates, we screened for its interactions with the human proteome via a Barcode Fusion Genetics-Yeast 2-Hybrid (BFG-Y2H) approach (29Yachie N. Petsalaki E. Mellor J.C. Weile J. Jacob Y. Verby M. Ozturk S.B. Li S. Cote A.G. Mosca R. Knapp J.J. Ko M. Yu A. Gebbia M. Sahni N. et al.Pooled-matrix protein interaction screens using Barcode Fusion Genetics.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2016; 12: 863Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This screening pipeline is based on mating haploid yeast of opposite mating type, and it utilizes the human ORFeome collection of full-length open reading frames (ORFs) rather than cDNA libraries for expression (30ORFeome CollaborationThe ORFeome collaboration: A genome-scale human ORF-clone resource.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This approach overcomes several limitations of classical Y2H systems. First, it avoids enrichment bias for housekeeping proteins by utilizing an arrayed collection of human ORFs. Second, it facilitates high-throughput multiplexed screening using DNA barcodes attached to ORFs encoding baits and preys. Third, it increases coverage by using barcode stitching of the interacting bait and prey generated via Cre-recombinase, PCR amplification of barcode tandems, pooling, and next-generation sequencing followed by data deconvolution for extracting interacting pairs (29Yachie N. Petsalaki E. Mellor J.C. Weile J. Jacob Y. Verby M. Ozturk S.B. Li S. Cote A.G. Mosca R. Knapp J.J. Ko M. Yu A. Gebbia M. Sahni N. et al.Pooled-matrix protein interaction screens using Barcode Fusion Genetics.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2016; 12: 863Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Positive interactions (hits) were defined based on a score that incorporated (1): the stickiness of the prey—a proxy for a hit specificity based on the number of baits other than BIKE (out of ∼200 tested) that also bound this prey; and (2) the number of observations—a proxy for robustness and sensitivity, representing the number of times BIKE was identified with this hit upon sequencing. Using stickiness <10% and >3 observations as the criteria, 36 candidate BIKE interactors were identified via this screen (Fig. 1A and Table S1). In parallel, we retrieved publicly available data from the biophysical interactions of ORFeome-based complexes network (BioPlex), which was constructed using a high-throughput affinity-purification mass spectrometry approach (31Huttlin E.L.

Twelve putative interactors of BIKE were identified in this dataset. A BIKE interaction network was then generated by combining the hits from the BFG-Y2H and this dataset.

The AP2 complex subunits AP2S1 and AP2M1 were among the BioPlex hits. To further understand the functions of BIKE-related pathways, first neighbors of BIKE (node of degree >2) were extracted from BioGRID, a public repository of interactomics data, and introduced into this BIKE interactome network (32Stark C. Breitkreutz B.-J. Reguly T. Boucher L. Breitkreutz A. Tyers M. BioGRID: A general repository for interaction datasets.Nucl. Acids Res. 2006; 34: D535-D539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2643) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of BIKE, CLINT1, and their overlapping interactors via BiNGO showed significant enrichment of “vesicle coating,” “membrane budding,” “vesicle-mediated transport,” and “cellular protein complex assembly” proteins (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that BIKE may play an important role in intracellular membrane trafficking, in part via its interaction with CLINT1. To assess the robustness of the BIKE interactome, we used protein-fragment complementation assays (PCAs), an orthogonal platform for detecting protein–protein interactions in mammalian (293T) cells (33Cassonnet P.

Interaction signals of 45 of the 47 hits were normalized to the average luminescence of each pair member matched with the complementary luciferase fragment to generate a normalized luminescence ratio (NLR). We benchmarked the accuracy and sensitivity of this screen with a random set of 7 proteins not predicted to interact with BIKE (mean NLR of 1.81 ± 1.11) (Table S2). We chose a stringent cutoff of NLR > 10 representing greater than two standard deviations above the mean NLR of this noninteracting control set. Using this cutoff, 19 interactions were validated in this secondary screen, of which CLINT1 demonstrated the third highest apparent affinity (Fig. 1B). RABL2A and DYNLT3 were also validated as candidate BIKE interactors, supporting that BIKE controls various aspects of intracellular membrane trafficking (36Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H.

To further confirm the interaction between BIKE and CLINT1, constructs expressing either BIKE-FLAG or CLINT1-FLAG were transfected into Huh7 cells followed by pulldown with anti-FLAG affinity gel. Western blot analysis of these samples revealed effective pulldown of the FLAG-tagged proteins and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of CLINT1 with BIKE-FLAG and reciprocally, BIKE with CLINT1-FLAG (Fig. 1C). Notably, the anti-CLINT1 antibody we used detects the three isoforms of CLINT1: two predominant isoforms, 1 and 2 (68 kDa) and a lower intensity band corresponding to isoform 3 (70 kDa) (Fig. 1C, whole-cell lysates [WCLs]). Since the CLINT1-FLAG plasmid used in this study encodes isoform 1 of CLINT1, ectopic expression of CLINT1-FLAG enhances the signal of the top band (equivalent to the molecular weight of isoform 1 plus an additional 22-aa linker [∼71 kDa]) (Fig. 1C, WCL). An additional lower-molecular-weight band is observed when CLINT1-FLAG is pulled down and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1C). We speculate that there may be a complex formed between CLINT1-FLAG, endogenous BIKE, and endogenous CLINT1 or that CLINT1 may form oligomers. Collectively, BIKE-CLINT1 binding was demonstrated via four orthogonal methods. To identify candidate substrates, we ectopically expressed 10 individual FLAG-tagged candidate BIKE interactors in Huh7 cells depleted for BIKE via siRNA or expressing a nontargeting (NT) control siRNA (siNT) (Fig. 2, A and B). We then ran the cell lysates on Phos-tag gels, which separate phosphorylated (P) from unphosphorylated (U) protein forms by binding of phosphorylated residues to divalent Phos-tag molecules (44Nagy Z. Comer S. Smolenski A. Analysis of protein phosphorylation using phos-tag gels.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2018; 93: e64Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Membranes were blotted with anti-FLAG antibody, and P/U ratios were calculated by dividing the intensity of the high by the low molecular bands (Fig. 2A). Multiple bands were observed for some of the cellular factors, indicating various phosphorylation states, as typically resolved via Phos-tag gel analysis. BIKE depletion reduced the intensity of higher-molecular-weight bands and the P/U ratio to 0.22 and 0.58 in cells expressing CLINT1-FLAG relative to control cells expressing siNT (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W4224281098,"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a disease associated with dysregulation of the immune complement system, especially of the alternative pathway (AP). Complement factor H (CFH), consisting of 20 domains called complement control protein (CCP1-20), downregulates the AP as a cofactor for mediating C3 inactivation by complement factor I. However, anomalies related to CFH are known to cause excessive complement activation and cytotoxicity. In aHUS, mutations and the presence of anti-CFH autoantibodies (AAbs) have been reported as plausible causes of CFH dysfunction, and it is known that CFH-related aHUS carries a high probability of end-stage renal disease. Elucidating the detailed functions of CFH at the molecular level will help to understand aHUS pathogenesis. Herein, we used biophysical data to reveal that a heavy-chain antibody fragment, termed VHH4, recognized CFH with high affinity. Hemolytic assays also indicated that VHH4 disrupted the protective function of CFH on sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, X-ray crystallography revealed that VHH4 recognized the Leu1181-Leu1189CCP20 loop, a known anti-CFH AAbs epitope. We next analyzed the dynamics of the C-terminal region of CFH and showed that the epitopes recognized by anti-CFH AAbs and VHH4 were the most flexible regions in CCP18-20. Finally, we conducted mutation analyses to elucidate the mechanism of VHH4 recognition of CFH and revealed that VHH4 inserts the Trp1183CCP20 residue of CFH into the pocket formed by the complementary determining region 3 loop. These results suggested that anti-CFH AAbs may adopt a similar molecular mechanism to recognize the flexible loop of Leu1181-Leu1189CCP20, leading to aHUS pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W4224442507,"Blebs, pressure driven protrusions of the cell membrane, facilitate the movement of eukaryotic cells such as the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , white blood cells and cancer cells. Blebs initiate when the cell membrane separates from the underlying cortex. A local rupture of the cortex, has been suggested as a mechanism by which blebs are initiated. However, much clarity is still needed about how cells inherently regulate rupture of the cortex in locations where blebs are expected to form. In this work, we examine the role of membrane energy and the motor protein myosin II (myosin) in facilitating the cell driven rupture of the cortex. We perform under-agarose chemotaxis experiments, using Dictyostelium discoideum cells, to visualize the dynamics of myosin and calculate changes in membrane energy in the blebbing region. To facilitate a rapid detection of blebs and analysis of the energy and myosin distribution at the cell front, we introduce an autonomous bleb detection algorithm that takes in discrete cell boundaries and returns the coordinate location of blebs with its shape characteristics. We are able to identify by microscopy naturally occurring gaps in the cortex prior to membrane detachment at sites of bleb nucleation. These gaps form at positions calculated to have high membrane energy, and are associated with areas of myosin enrichment. Myosin is also shown to accumulate in the cortex prior to bleb initiation and just before the complete disassembly of the cortex. Together our findings provide direct spatial and temporal evidence to support cortex rupture as an intrinsic bleb initiation mechanism and suggests that myosin clusters are associated with regions of high membrane energy where its contractile activity leads to a rupture of the cortex at points of maximal energy."
https://openalex.org/W4224862041,"Maternal mortality is a persistent public health problem worldwide. The maternal mortality ratio of Myanmar was 250 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017 which was the second-highest among ASEAN member countries in that year. Myanmar's infant mortality rate was twice the average of ASEAN member countries in 2020. This study examined factors influencing institutional maternity service utilization and identified the need for improved maternal health outcomes.A cross-sectional study design was used to examine the experience of 3,642 women from the 2015-16 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey by adapting Andersen's Behavioral Model. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were reported in the logistic regression results.The findings illustrate that the proportion of women who delivered their last child in a health/clinical care facility was 39.7%. Women live in rural areas, states/regions with a high levels of poverty, poor households, experience with financial burden and the husband's occupation in agriculture or unskilled labor were negatively associated with institutional delivery. While a greater number of ANC visits and level of the couple's education had a positive association with institutional delivery.The determinants of institutional delivery utilization in this study related to the institutional facilities environment imply an improvement of the institutional availability and accessibility in rural areas, and different states/regions, particularly Chin, Kayah and Kachin States- the poorest states in Myanmar. The poverty reduction strategies are urgently implemented because problems on health care costs and household economic status played important roles in institutional delivery utilization. The ANC visits indicated a significant increase in institutional delivery. The government needs to motivate vulnerable population groups to seek ANC and institutional delivery. Moreover, education is crucial in increasing health knowledge, skills, and capabilities. Thus, improving access to quality, formal, and informal education is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4224862673,"Plasmodium vivax (Pv) infections were 68% of the total malaria burden in Laos in 2019. The parasite causes frequent relapses, which can be prevented by primaquine (PMQ). Testing for glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is recommended before giving PMQ to avoid haemolysis. Because of the risk of haemolysis in G6PD intermediate deficiencies among females, Laos uses the PMQ 14-days regimen only in G6PD normal females. Among G6PD point-of-care tests, qualitative tests cannot differentiate between G6PD normal and intermediate females. Quantitative tests are required to differentiate between G6PD normal and intermediate deficiencies. However, the quantitative test lacks the cost-effectiveness evidence necessary for decision-making for large-scale adoption. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of quantitative G6PD test, with either supervised PMQ treatment or unsupervised PMQ treatment, against the usual unsupervised PMQ 8-weeks strategy. Supervised PMQ 8-weeks strategy without G6PD testing was also compared against the unsupervised PMQ 8-weeks strategy since the former had recently been adopted in malaria high burden villages that had village malaria volunteers. A budget impact analysis was conducted to understand the incremental cost and effect needed for a nationwide scale-up of the chosen strategy.A decision tree model compared the cost-effectiveness of implementing four strategies at one health facility with an average of 14 Pv cases in one year. The strategies were unsupervised PMQ strategy, supervised PMQ strategy, G6PD test with unsupervised PMQ strategy, and G6PD test with supervised PMQ strategy. Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) was the effect measure. Costs were calculated from a payer perspective, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. One Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of Laos was set as the cost-effectiveness threshold. Budget impact analysis was conducted using the health facility wise Pv data in Laos in 2020.Supervised PMQ strategy was extendedly dominated by G6PD test strategies. When compared against the unsupervised PMQ strategy, both G6PD test strategies were more costly but more effective. Their Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICER) were 96.72US$ for the G6PD test with unsupervised PMQ strategy and 184.86US$ for the G6PD test with supervised PMQ strategy. Both ICERs were lower than one GDP per capita in Laos. Following the sensitivity analysis, low adherence for PMQ 14 days made both G6PD test strategies less cost-effective. The lower the Pv case number reported in a health facility, the higher the ICER was. In the budget impact analysis, the expected budget need was only half a million US$ when the G6PD test rollout was discriminately done depending on the Pv case number reported at the health facilities. Indiscriminate roll out of G6PD test to all health facilities was most expensive with least effect impact."

MukB also interacts with the ParC subunit of the cellular chromosomal decatenase topoisomerase IV, an interaction that is required for proper chromosome condensation and segregation in Escherichia coli, although it suppresses the MukB ATPase activity. Other structural determinants and interactions that regulate the ATPase activity of MukBEF are not clear. Here, we have investigated the MukBEF ATPase activity, identifying intersubunit and intrasubunit interactions by protein–protein crosslinking and site-specific mutagenesis. We show that interactions between the hinge of MukB and its neck region are essential for the ATPase activity, that the ParC subunit of topoisomerase IV inhibits the MukB ATPase by preventing this interaction, that MukE interaction with DNA is likely essential for viability, and that interactions between MukF and the MukB neck region are necessary for ATPase activity and viability.

Structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins are essential for the management of chromosome compaction, segregation, and repair. In Escherichia coli, MukB, an SMC-like protein (1Uhlmann F. SMC complexes: From DNA to chromosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), acts in concert with its accessory proteins MukF, the kleisin, and MukE, a KITE (kleisin-interacting winged-helix tandem elements) protein (2Yamazoe M.

SMC proteins are characterized by long coiled-coil arms nearly 50 nm in length that separate a head domain formed by N-terminal and C-terminal globular regions. SMC proteins dimerize by interactions at the hinge region, which divides the coiled-coil region roughly in half (1Uhlmann F. SMC complexes: From DNA to chromosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The head domains of the two protomers in the dimer bind ATP between them and are responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP (11Woo J.S. Lim J.H. Shin H.C. Suh M.K. Ku B. Lee K.H. Joo K. Robinson H. Lee J.

The long MukB protomer has globular domains at its N-terminal and C-terminal ends that form half of the ATPase head domain in a MukB dimer. The coiled-coil domains are divided in half by another globular domain, the hinge, which dimerizes two MukB monomers to form the MukB dimer. Both MukB monomers in the MukB dimer fold over at a region called the elbow, resulting in the hinge domain becoming juxtaposed with the neck region, constituted of coiled coils just above the head domain, of one of the MukB monomers, κMukB. The C terminus of one MukF monomer in the MukF dimer binds to the cap region of κMukB. A long linker domain of MukF then snakes across the head domain of the νMukB monomer with its middle domain (MD) making contacts with the neck of the κMukB monomer, forming a clamp for DNA bound in the MukB DNA-binding domain in the joined MukB head domains. The N terminus of MukF is bound to the head domain near the DNA-binding site in the dimeric structure. The N-terminal domains of MukF from two dimeric MukB complexes interact to assemble a dimer of dimers (11Woo J.S. Lim J.H. Shin H.C. Suh M.K. Ku B. Lee K.H. Joo K. Robinson H. Lee J. Park S.Y.

Recently, a number of SMC proteins have been shown to manipulate DNA conformation by an ATP-dependent process termed loop extrusion. Yeast condensin extrudes DNA loops in a unidirectional manner (15Ganji M. Shaltiel I.A. Bisht S. Kim E. Kalichava A. Haering C.H. Dekker C.

A “hold and feed” mechanism for loop extrusion has recently been proposed (19Shaltiel I.A. Datta S. Lecomte L. Hassler M. Kschonsak M. Bravo S. Stober C. Eustermann S. Haering C.H.

Whereas a similar activity for MukBEF has not yet been reported, it has been shown that the protein complex organizes the E. coli chromosome into an axial core from which loops of DNA protrude (20Makela J.

MukB and topo IV are often found in the same locations on the chromosome (21Nicolas E. Upton A.L. Uphoff S. Henry O. Badrinarayanan A. Sherratt D.

We have shown that when in a stoichiometric complex together, MukB and topo IV inhibit the catalytic activities of each other: ParC inhibits the ATPase activity of MukB, whereas MukB inhibits DNA transport segment trapping and DNA cleavage by topo IV (24Kumar R. Bahng S. Marians K.J. The MukB-topoisomerase IV interaction mutually suppresses their catalytic activities.Nucl. Acids Res. 2021; 50: 2621-2634Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), suggesting that any ATP-dependent DNA manipulation catalyzed by MukBEF is modulated by topo IV. Very recently, a cryo-EM structure of MukBEF bound to DNA and MatP, a protein that acts to individualize the terminus region of the E. coli chromosome (25Mercier R. Petit M.A. Schbath S. Robin S. El Karoui M. Boccard F. Espeli O.

Funke L.F.H. Chin J.W. Lowe J. Cryo-EM structure of MukBEF reveals DNA loop entrapment at chromosomal unloading sites.Mol. Cell. 2021; 81: 4891-4906.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This structure showed that the coiled-coil regions were bent so that the MukB hinge region contacted the coiled-coil region of one of the MukB protomers at the “neck,” which is just above the head domains. This bent conformation of MukB had been reported previously (13Burmann F. Lee B.G. Than T. Sinn L. O'Reilly F.J. Yatskevich S. Rappsilber J. Hu B. Nasmyth K. Lowe J. A folded conformation of MukBEF and cohesin.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). AcpP has also very recently been shown to be required for the MukB ATPase (26Prince J.P. Bolla J.R. Fisher G.L.M. Makela J. Fournier M. Robinson C.V. Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J. Acyl carrier protein promotes MukBEF action in Escherichia coli chromosome organization-segregation.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 6721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Prior to the publication of either of the structures of MukB mentioned previously, in order to understand the effect of ParC on MukB, we initiated a protein–protein crosslinking study between ParC and MukB and MukB and MukF. We report the results of this study here combined with site-specific mutagenesis of contact points within the MukB protomer, between MukB and ParC, and between MukB and MukF. We define an area within the MukB neck and head region that crosslinks with ParC and the hinge region of MukB. We show that interaction of the hinge region of MukB with its neck region is required for the MukB ATPase activity. These latter two observations indicate that ParC inhibits the MukB ATPase activity by preventing the interaction between the hinge and the neck regions. We also show that interactions between MukF and the same region of the MukB neck are required for the MukB ATPase activity and for viability and that mutation of amino acid residues of MukE that are likely to contact DNA also result in the loss of viability. MukB alone hydrolyzes ATP (27Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. DNA reshaping by MukB. Right-handed knotting, left-handed supercoiling.J. Biol.

Acyl carrier protein promotes MukBEF action in Escherichia coli chromosome organization-segregation.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 6721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) demonstrated that AcpP was required for maximal MukBF ATPase activity. This observation indicated that some previous observations of the MukB ATPase activity might have been affected by the extent to which the MukB preparation was saturated with AcpP. The cryo-EM structure of MukBEF shows the stoichiometry of AcpP to MukB to be 1:1 (14Burmann F. Funke L.F.H. Chin J.W. Lowe J. Cryo-EM structure of MukBEF reveals DNA loop entrapment at chromosomal unloading sites.Mol. Cell. 2021; 81: 4891-4906.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore reinvestigated the optimal conditions for MukBF ATPase activity. To do so, we compared the ATPase activity of a preparation of MukB that was only 5% saturated with AcpP (apo-MukB) with that of one that was nominally 100% saturated (holo-MukB) (Fig. 1). To measure ATPase activity, we used the ENZCheck Phosphate Assay Kit (Life Technologies) that detects free inorganic phosphate in the presence of 250 nM MukB2 and other additions to the reaction as indicated. We use least squares analysis to fit the linear portion of the phosphate accumulation curve to a straight line and calculate the rate of phosphate release. This value is then converted to ATP hydrolyzed per MukB dimer per second. AcpP was purified as described under the Experimental procedures section (a gel showing the purified preparation is shown in Fig. 1B). The response of the MukBF ATPase to increasing concentrations of AcpP is shown in Figure 1C. Even the preparation of MukB that had 1:1 stoichiometry with AcpP (based on Coomassie staining, Fig. 1B) was stimulated by additional AcpP (Fig. 1, C–I). Based on this analysis, we performed all MukB ATPase assays reported herein (except those shown in Fig. 5A- ii ) in the presence of 250 nM AcpP.Figure 3The MukE6X variant is less inhibitory than the wildtype to the MukBF ATPase. A, the graph shows the relative maximal ATPase activity determined in standard ATPase reactions containing either wildtype or MukE6X at the indicated concentrations. B, DNA has no effect on the MukBFE6X ATPase activity. Standard ATPase reactions contained either wildtype or MukB6X and DNA (as in Fig. 2B) as indicated. C, the mukE6X allele does not complement a temperature-sensitive mukE::kan strain.

This ratio remained the same in the presence of 250 nM AcpP (Fig. 1D). We therefore selected as standard ATPase conditions 250 nM MukB2, 75 nM MukF2, and 250 nM AcpP. Assuming the majority of MukB molecules in our preparations are active (and we find this MukF saturation ratio remains the same for all MukB variants discussed in this report), this observation suggests that MukF is acting catalytically in the ATPase assay, binding to and dissociating from MukB dimers. It is known from both crystal structures of portions of MukBF (11Woo J.S. Lim J.H. Shin H.C. Suh M.K. Ku B. Lee K.H. Joo K. Robinson H. Lee J. Park S.Y. Ha N.C. Oh B.H.

It is therefore possible that MukF releases completely from MukB during the ATPase cycle. The addition of MukE dimer inhibits the MukBF ATPase (28Bahng S. Hayama R. Marians K.J.

MukB ATPases are regulated independently by the N- and C-terminal domains of MukF kleisin.Elife. 2018; 7e31522Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). It has been reported that the addition of excess (to MukB) concentrations of small double-stranded DNA oligomers relieved this inhibition (29Zawadzka K. Zawadzki P. Baker R. Rajasekar K.V. Wagner F. Sherratt D.J. Arciszewska L.K. MukB ATPases are regulated independently by the N- and C-terminal domains of MukF kleisin.Elife. 2018; 7e31522Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Unlike that of most SMC proteins, the MukBF ATPase is not DNA dependent (32Chen N. Zinchenko A.A. Yoshikawa Y. Araki S. Adachi S. Yamazoe M. Hiraga S. Yoshikawa K. ATP-induced shrinkage of DNA with MukB protein and the MukBEF complex of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3731-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and is not affected by the presence of high concentrations of a 50mer DNA duplex (Fig. 2B). We find that under the optimal conditions of MukBF ATPase, MukE inhibition was not relieved by the presence of even 10-fold more DNA oligomer than MukB (Fig. 2B). It is possible that previous observations (29Zawadzka K. Zawadzki P. Baker R. Rajasekar K.V. Wagner F. Sherratt D.J. Arciszewska L.K. MukB ATPases are regulated independently by the N- and C-terminal domains of MukF kleisin.Elife. 2018; 7e31522Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were influenced by substoichiometric concentrations of AcpP in the MukB preparations used. The cryo-EM structure of MukBEF shows, however, that MukE forms part of the clamp that binds DNA to the MukB heads (14Burmann F. Funke L.F.H. Chin J.W. Lowe J. Cryo-EM structure of MukBEF reveals DNA loop entrapment at chromosomal unloading sites.Mol. Cell. 2021; 81: 4891-4906.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To address the effect of DNA binding to MukB on MukE modulation of the MukBF ATPase activity, we used a MukB variant we had previously developed (28Bahng S. Hayama R. Marians K.J. MukB-mediated catenation of DNA is ATP and MukEF independent.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 23999-24008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), MukB R187E R189E (MukBDNA), that binds DNA with one-quarter the affinity of the wildtype protein and manifests a reduced ATPase activity compared with the wildtype (compare Fig. 2, A and C-i). Remarkably, MukE stimulated the ATPase of this protein, rather than inhibited (Fig. 2, C–I). Added DNA had no effect (Fig. 2C-ii). The decreased ATPase activity of MukBDNA suggests that the mutated MukB residues perturb necessary intersubunit interactions and that this perturbation could be overcome to some extent by the presence of MukE, likely by a stabilizing effect on the MukBEF complex. Therefore, to address the role of DNA in the ATPase cycle, we turned our attention to MukE, which makes a significant number of interactions with the DNA bound to the head in the presence of ATP (14Burmann F. Funke L.F.H. Chin J.W. Lowe J. Cryo-EM structure of MukBEF reveals DNA loop entrapment at chromosomal unloading sites.Mol. Cell. 2021; 81: 4891-4906.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the structure of the core MukBEF complex (MukBEF, AcpP), MukE resides outside the MukB lumen and, as the MukBEF holocomplex (MukBEF, MatP, DNA, and ATP) is assembled with DNA and ATP, it moves closer to the bound DNA and forces open the neck of νMukB. This DNA binding concurrent with the opening of the neck by MukE points to its important role in the ATPase reaction. We made charge-reversal mutations in six positively charged residues (R78E, R85E, K150E, R156E, R163E, and R164E; MukE6X) of MukE, based on their proximity to the DNA in the structure. MukE6X was significantly less inhibitory to the MukBF ATPase than wildtype MukE in either the absence or the presence of DNA (Fig. 3, A and B). Examination of the crystal structure of fragments of MukBEF (11Woo J.S. Lim J.H. Shin H.C. Suh M.K. Ku B. Lee K.H. Joo K. Robinson H. Lee J. Park S.Y. Ha N.C. Oh B.H.

Charge reversal substitutions at these residues may therefore stabilize MukE in this position, favoring an ATP-engaged conformation of the MukB heads to stimulate ATP hydrolysis. Because the DNA is clamped between MukB, MukE, and MukF, any alterations to the DNA-binding residue are likely to affect the dynamics of the MukBEF complex in the absence of DNA. Although the ATPase activity is not affected by DNA binding in the assays reported here, the energy generated from ATP hydrolysis is believed to fuel translocation of the complex on DNA. To address the connection between the two activities in overall function of the MukBEF complex, we carried out complementation assays with plasmids carrying mukE and mukE6X alleles using a temperature-sensitive strain where mukE was disrupted (Fig. 3C). Whereas wildtype mukE complemented well at the nonpermissive temperature, mukE6X failed to do so, underscoring the importance of these DNA-binding residues in vivo. Expression levels of the mukE variants from the plasmids were equivalent (Fig. S1). In order to develop insight into the interactions between MukBEF subunits and the mechanism of inhibition of the MukBF ATPase by the ParC subunit of topo IV (24Kumar R. Bahng S. Marians K.J. The MukB-topoisomerase IV interaction mutually suppresses their catalytic activities.Nucl. Acids Res. 2021; 50: 2621-2634Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we performed di-(N-succinimidyl) glutarate–catalyzed protein–protein crosslinking experiments with MukB alone, MukB and ParC, and MukB and MukF, followed by trypsin digestion and analysis of the cross-linked peptides by mass spectrometry (MS). The crosslinks found between ParC and MukB, MukF and MukB, and selected crosslinks for MukB alone are displayed in Figure 4. Complete crosslinking results are included in Tables S1–S3. Our crosslinking studies defined three major regions on the outer surface of each MukB monomer marked by residues K1232 and K1246 on the neck and K1395 on the head domain that interacted with ParC, MukF, and the MukB hinge (Fig. 4). These interactions are not directly with the catalytic ATPase center and are therefore likely to play a regulatory role, as shown later.

An imbalance of hepatic lipid processes including fatty acid uptake, esterification, oxidation, and triglyceride secretion leads to alcoholic fatty liver (AFL). However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AFL remain elusive. Here, we show that mice deficient in microRNAs (miRs)-141 and -200c display resistance to the development of AFL. We found that miR-200c directly targets HNF1 homeobox B (Hnf1b), a transcriptional activator for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp), as well as apolipoprotein O (ApoO), an integral component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system complex. We show that expression of these miRs is significantly induced by chronic ethanol exposure, which is accompanied by reduced HNF1B and APOO levels. Furthermore, miR-141/200c deficiency normalizes ethanol-mediated impairment of triglyceride secretion, which can be attributed to the restored levels of HNF1B and MTTP, as well as phosphatidylcholine abundance. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-141/200c deficiency restores ethanol-mediated inhibition of APOO expression and mitochondrial dysfunction, improving mitochondrial antioxidant defense capacity and fatty acid oxidation. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-200c contributes to the modulation of lipid homeostasis in AFL disease by cooperatively regulating Hnf1b and ApoO functions."
https://openalex.org/W4224294659,"Reducing floor eggs in cage-free (CF) housing systems is among primary concerns for egg producers. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of ground robot manipulation on reduction of floor eggs. In addition, the effects of ground robot manipulation on production performance, stress response, bone quality, and behavior were also investigated. Two successive flocks of 180 Hy-Line Brown hens at 34 weeks of this age were used. The treatment structure for each flock consisted of six pens with three treatments (without robot running, with one-week robot running, and with two-weeks robot running), resulting in two replicates per treatment per flock and four replicates per treatment with two flocks. Two phases were involved with each flock. Phase 1 (weeks 35-38) mimicked the normal scenario, and phase 2 (weeks 40-43) mimicked a scenario after inadvertent restriction to nest box access. Results indicate that the floor egg reduction rate in the first two weeks of phase 1 was 11.0% without the robot treatment, 18.9% with the one-week robot treatment, and 34.0% with the two-week robot treatment. The effect of robot operation on floor egg production was not significant when the two phases of data were included in the analysis. Other tested parameters were similar among the treatments, including hen-day egg production, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, live body weight, plasma corticosterone concentration, bone breaking force, ash percentage, and time spent in nest boxes. In conclusion, ground robot operation in CF settings may help to reduce floor egg production to a certain degree for a short period right after being introduced. Additionally, robot operation does not seem to negatively affect hen production performance and well-being."

Here, we report that both high-iron diet and advanced age in mice consistently altered gene expression of many pathways, including those governing the oxidative stress response and the circadian clock. We used a metabolomic approach to reveal similarities between metabolic profiles and the daily oscillation of clock genes in old and iron-overloaded mouse livers. In addition, we show that phlebotomy decreased iron accumulation in old mice, partially restoring the metabolic patterns and amplitudes of the oscillatory expression of clock genes Per1 and Per2. We further identified that the transcriptional regulation of iron occurred through a reduction in AMP-modulated methylation of histone H3K9 in the Per1 and H3K4 in the Per2 promoters, respectively. Taken together, our results indicate that iron accumulation with age can affect metabolic patterns and the circadian clock."

In Vietnam, fisheries are a pro-poor economic sector and essential nutrition source; however, welfares of producers and consumers in the climate change context are not well understood. While most studies focus on the gains or losses of total products and revenues, this paper pays additional attention to the changes in surpluses of market players in the long run. A combination of the production function, demand and supply functions, and partial equilibrium analysis is employed to measure the production and welfare impacts based on time series data from 1976 to 2018 and a Vietnam household living standards survey in 2018. The results show that relative to the present, catch yield is likely to reduce 35%-45% by mid-century and 45%-80% by the end of the century. Consumers may lose their surplus of 7-9 billion USD (PPP, 2018) by 2035 and 10-18 billion USD by 2065 due to supply reduction, while producers may gain additional profit of 3.5-4.5 billion USD by 2035 and 5-9 billion USD by 2065 owing to a price increase. The research findings suggest that Vietnam could impose measures to limit capture effort, as set out in the Law of Fisheries 2017, without harming fisher welfare. The expansion of aquaculture could reduce the gap between supply and demand of wild fish to mitigate consumer welfare loss; however, this impact is still ambiguous."
https://openalex.org/W4224764450,"Individuals with special health care needs continue to experience difficulties with accessing regular dental care. This has largely been due to clinicians feeling they lack the training and experience to manage their needs. The aim of this study was to determine whether working closely with specialists in special need dentistry influenced the willingness of clinicians to treat patients with special needs.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with specialists and clinicians involved in these mentoring initiatives. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to determine perspectives towards how this additional support influenced their willingness to treat individuals with special needs.The views of all participants towards these supports were positive with clinicians feeling it not only offered them opportunities to learn from the specialists, but also increased their willingness to treat individuals with special needs and the timeliness and quality of care they were able to provide. Likewise, despite some concerns about the inappropriate use of specialist support, the specialists felt these mentoring relationships offered many benefits including improving timely access to care and ensuring individuals were able to receive appropriate care.Mentoring provided by specialists in special needs dentistry improved the willingness of clinicians to provide care for individuals with special health care needs. Supports such as these are likely to be crucial to overcoming concerns of clinicians about their ability to manage the needs of these individuals and begin to address a significant barrier to access of care for individuals with special health care needs."
https://openalex.org/W4224865639,"The residues from the internal surface of four archaeological ceramic sherds, excavated from the Armenian Gardens, Jerusalem were analysed to characterise the contents of the original vessel. The sherds derive from four small, thick-walled, sphero-conical vessels recovered from a destruction layer, dating between the 11th and 12th century, Jerusalem. The residue has been analysed using light microscopy, biochemical characterisation, gas chromatography mass spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry. This analysis established the presence of various compounds including fatty acids and notable levels of mercury, sulphur, aluminium, potassium, magnesium, nitrates and phosphorous. The contents and probable functions of the four vessels were characterised from the residues on these sherds as different from each other, reflecting their different decoration, manufacture and ceramic typologies. One of these vessels contains residue that indicate the vessel held oils. The residue of the second vessel is consistent with either scented materials or medicinal contents, while a third probably contained medicinal material. The unique fourth sherd is from a stoneware sphero-conical vessel with very thick walls, no decoration and the residue supports the possibility it was used for the storage of chemicals or may have held the chemical ingredients for an explosive device, consistent with a medieval grenade. This residue analysis of Mamluk sphero-conical vessels provides insight into luxury items, medicines, technology and trade in medieval Jerusalem."
https://openalex.org/W4224214091,"The bi-enzyme HisF-HisH heterodimer is part of the pathway that produces histidine and purines in bacteria and lower eukaryotes, but it is absent in mammals. This heterodimer has been largely studied probing the basis of the allosteric effects and the structural stability in proteins. It is also a potential target for antibacterial drugs. In this work, we developed a simple method to evaluate changes in the affinity between HisF and HisH in the heterodimer of the bacteria Thermotoga maritima . HisH contains a single tryptophan residue, which is exposed in the free protein, but buried in the heterodimer interface. Hence, the intrinsic fluorescence maximum of this residue changes to shorter wavelengths upon dimerization. Thus, we used the fluorescence intensity at this shorter wavelength to monitor heterodimer accumulation when HisH was combined with sub-stoichiometric HisF. Under conditions where the HisF-HisH heterodimer is in equilibrium with the free states of these enzymes, when [HisH] &gt; [HisF], we deduced a linear function connecting [HisF-HisH] to [HisF], in which the slope depends on the heterodimer dissociation constant ( K d ). Based on this equation, taking fluorescence intensities as proxies of the heterodimer and HisF concentrations, we experimentally determined the K d at four different temperatures. These K d values were compared to those evaluated using ITC. Both methods revealed an increase in the HisF and HisH binding affinity as the temperature increases. In spite of differences in their absolute values, the K d determined using these methods presented an evident linear correlation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the fluorescence method we determined the effect on the K d caused by 12 single mutations in HisF. Coherently, this test singled out the only mutation in the binding interface. In brief, the method described here effectively probes qualitative effects on the K d , can be carried out using common laboratory equipment and is scalable."
https://openalex.org/W4224597203,"We introduce a method for assessing the robustness of community detection and apply it to a world input-output network (WION) to obtain economically plausible results. This method enabled us to rank communities in the WION in terms of their robustness and stability. The algorithmic assignment variability index proposed in this study is shown to have predictive power in terms of forthcoming community rearrangement. We also provide several new approaches for identifying key economic communities. These approaches are based on the application of several centrality measures to a synthetic network in which nodes represent WION communities. Using these methods, we show that in 2000-2014, United States and Japan-centered communities demonstrated decreasing trends, while the importance of the China-centered community predominantly increased. A notable feature of the Germany-centered community rank evolution is that its influence grew only as a result of the inclusion of the Netherlands and Belgium in 2013."
