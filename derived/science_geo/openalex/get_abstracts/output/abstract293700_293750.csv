Most of the desirable physical properties of the sintered masses, such as hardness and thermal conductivity, approach those of large single crystals; their resistance to wear and catastrophic splitting is superior. The sintered masses are produced on a commercial scale and are increasingly used as cutting tools on hard or abrasive materials, as wire-drawing dies, in rock drills, and in special high-pressure apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2159384296,"The unique properties of ceramics based on silicon carbide and silicon nitride make them prime candidates for use in advanced energy conversion systems. These compounds are the bases for broad families of engineering materials, whose properties are reviewed. The relationships between processing, microstructure, and properties are discussed. A review and assessment of recent progress in the use of these materials in high-temperature engineering systems, and vehicular engines in particular, is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2081887801,"Molecular beam epitaxy is an ultrahigh vacuum technique for growing very thin epitaxial layers of semiconductor crystals. Because it is inherently a slow growth process, extreme dimensional control over both major compositional variations and impurity incorporation can be achieved. The result is that it has been possible, with one combination of lattice-matched semiconductors, GaAs and Alx-Gal-xAs, to demonstrate a large variety of novel single-crystal structures. These results have important implications for fundamental studies of the physics of thin-layered structures and for the development of new semiconductor electronic and optoelectronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2057523979,"High-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steels have nearly the same composition as plain carbon steels. However, they are up to twice as strong and their greater load-bearing capacity allows engineering use in lighter sections. Their high strength is derived from a combination of grain refinement; precipitation strengthening due to minor additions of vanadium, niobium, or titanium; and modifications of manufacturing processes, such as controlled rolling and controlled cooling of otherwise essentially plain carbon steel. HSLA steels are less formable than lower strength steels, but dualphase steels, which evolved from HSLA steels, have ferrite-martensite microstructures and better formability than HSLA steels of similar strength. This improved formability has substantially increased the utilization potential of high-strength steels in the manufacture of complex components. This article reviews the development of HSLA and dual-phase steels and discusses the effects of variations in microstructure and chemistry on their mechanical properties."

https://openalex.org/W2045870190,"Physicists, materials scientists, and engineers combined to bring solid-state bubble devices into the computer memory and recording marketplace. Devices with smaller bubbles are being developed for increased data capacity and lower cost. Epitaxial garnet films made by isothermal dipping in molten solutions helped put the technology in place and will probably satisfy the material needs of future devices with bubbles scaled down from 2 to 0.5 micrometer in size."
https://openalex.org/W1978142973,"This article deals with superconducting materials which have zero electrical resistance while carrying high electrical current densities (around 106 amperes per square centimeter) in high magnetic fields (up to 50 teslas). The technological importance of these materials is due to their use in the windings of loss-free electromagnets which generate high magnetic fields. Such magnets are the foundation for superconducting electrotechnology, a rapidly growing field whose applications include advanced electrical machines and fusion reactors. The article focuses primarily on the materials aspects of this new technology. A brief overview is given of the physical principles which underlie this special type of superconducting behavior, and some of the important basic parameters are examined. The technology required to adapt the materials to electromagnets is also discussed. A few concluding remarks concern future possibilities for materials that can be used in generating very high magnetic fields."
https://openalex.org/W2019022832,"The III-V compounds and alloys have been studied for three decades. Until recently, these materials have been commercialized for only a few specialized optoelectronic devices and microwave devices. Advances in thin-film epitaxy techniques, such as liquid phase epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition, are now providing the ability to form good quality lattice-matched heterojunctions with III-V materials. New optoelectronic devices, such as room-temperature continuous-wave injection lasers, have already resulted. This newfound ability may also affect the field of high-speed integrated circuits."

Applications of new techniques and disciplines should lead to impressive advances in the years ahead."
https://openalex.org/W4245598372,"Different polymers can be combined to yield a wide variety of composite materials: layered sheets and films, homogeneous and heterogeneous blends, interpenetrating polymer networks, bicomponent fibers, and others. Some properties of a multipolymer material are roughly additive, but synergistic interactions can yield properties and performances superior to those of the individual constituents. Consequently, the use of polymers in combination is a rapidly growing component of polymer materials technology."

https://openalex.org/W1992858851,"For many years interest in display devices stemmed almost entirely from the needs of television receivers, oscilloscopes, and radar systems whose requirements were almost ideally satisfied by the cathode-ray tube. However, during the past two decades the proliferation of small electronic instruments with digital output has stimulated the development of a number of new display media which, because of their compact nature and low power consumption, are better suited for such applications. In view of the success achieved with these technologies a continuing effort is being directed toward increasing their information capacity to the point where they may ultimately be useful in applications now requiring cathode-ray tubes."
