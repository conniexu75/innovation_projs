https://openalex.org/W2046484662,"A micrometeorological technique has been used to measure the flux of ammonia and related gaseous nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere from a pasture grazed by sheep. During 3 weeks in late summer, the average daily flux density of nitrogen in these forms was 0.26 kilogram per hectare. This is a substantial part of the nitrogen turnover in grazed pastures."

By combining the Ar(42) value with earlier data, a cross section of 0.5 +/- 0.1 barn is calculated for the reaction, with thermal neutrons, Ar(41)(n,gamma)Ar(42)."

https://openalex.org/W2071454850,"Carbon istotope ratios of modern, 10,000-year-old, and more than 40,000-year-old Atriplex confertifolia (C(4)) material from Nevada caves indicate that the C(4) photosynthetic pathway was operating in these plants over that period. Samples of a plant with crassulacean acid metabolism, Opuntia polyacantha, were also measured, and a shift in the 8(13)C value from -21.9 per mil (more than 40,000 years ago) to -13.9 per mil (10,000 years ago) was observed. This provides unique physiological evidence to support the hypothesis that the late Pleistocene pluvial climate in the region already had become drier about 10,000 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2044382058,"Studies of earthquake aftershocks as a function of space, time, and rate of energy release (magnitude) afford new evidence of earth structure. The sharp boundary conditions of the epicenter locations suggest block faulting about the Rat Islands as a subsystem of the Aleutian Islands arc structure. Earthquake frequency of occurrence in time and magnitude are given."
https://openalex.org/W2027893806,"I have tried to talk about three areas in which I think newer techniques of data analysis will come into, or be developed in, geophysics which will advance our knowledge about the plasma-like, gaseous, liquid, and solid earth: (i) developments along the line of the concepts of the spectrum, with emphasis both on the use of cross-spectral methods of studying relationship and on bispectrum and higher methods of studying nonlinearities (including modulations) and frequency interactions; (ii) wise choice of modes of expression for analysis; (iii) the use of methods appropriate and effective in situations where distributions of errors and fluctuations do not have exactly the magic bell-shaped distribution."

https://openalex.org/W2161083914,"A new class of compounds, called ""periodic compounds,"" identified by the selection rule G = Sigmad(i)e(i)/Sigmad(i), where G assumes the integral values 1, 2, 3, . . . corresponding to the periodic table groups I, II, III, . . ., is discussed. The number of bonding electrons contributed by an atom of kind i is designated e(i), and d(i) gives the number, per formula weight, of atoms of this kind. Both e(i) and d(i) assume integral values. Periodic compounds consist of symmetrical and unsymmetrical types. The recent synthesis of the unsymmetrical periodic compound B(2)O, an isoelectronic analog of carbon, suggests that many more unsymmetrical types may be amenable to synthesis, particularly by high-pressure and high-temperature techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2066826197,"To-day the nationâ€™s industries are working together as never before to do their part in the battle for freedom. It is fitting at such a time that we look over that part of civilized life for whose cultivation we as physicists are responsible, that we try to see how our science has been developing and in what direction we may cause it to grow in the future. We want to see clearly the job ahead so we can set about doing it earnestly and cheerfully; for we believe that, with effort, we can determine the future in peace as in war."
