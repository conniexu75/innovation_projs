https://openalex.org/W2020053653,"Diabetes (db), which occurred in an inbred strain of mouse, is inherited as a unit autosomal recessive and is characterized by a metabolic disturbance resembling diabetes mellitus in man. Abnormal deposition of fat at 3 to 4 weeks of age is followed shortly by hyperglycemia, polyuria, and glycosuria. Accompanying morphological changes in the islets of Langerhans suggest neogenesis to compensate for insulin depletion."
https://openalex.org/W2063902677,"Total contralateral hemianopia follows unilateral removal of the entire occipito-temporal neocortex in the cat. This deficit is classically ascribed to interruption of visual radiations serving cortical function (""cortical blindness"") and is considered permanent. Return of vision to the hemianopic field after subsequent removal of the superior colliculus contralateral to the cortical lesion demonstrates that neither assumption is correct. The initial hemianopia is apparently due to depression of function of the colliculus ipsilateral to the cortical lesion, a depression maintained by influx of inhibition from the crossed colliculus. Thus, removal of the contralateral tectum, or splitting of the collicular commissure, abolishes this inhibition and allows the return of function in the ipsilateral colliculus, and with it the recovery from hemianopia. These findings emphasize that visually guided behavior is mediated at both cortical and midbrain levels, and that there is a marked interaction between these sites."
https://openalex.org/W1978910069,"Responses are strengthened by consequences having to do with the survival of individuals and species. With respect to the provenance of behavior, we know more about ontogenic than phylogenic contingencies. The contingencies responsible for unlearned behavior acted long ago. This remoteness affects our scientific methods, both experimental and conceptual. Until we have identified he variables responsible for an event, we tend to invent causes. Explanatory entities such as “instincts,” “drives,” and “traits” still survive. Unable to show how organisms can behave effectively under complex circumstances, we endow them with special abilities permitting them to do so.Behavior exhibited by most members of a species is often accepted as inherited if all members were not likely to have been exposed to relevant ontogenic contingencies. When contingencies are not obvious, it is perhaps unwise to call any behavior either inherited or acquired, as the examples of churring in honey guides and following in imprinted ducklings show. Nor can the relative importance of phylogenic and ontogenic contingencies be argued from instances in which unlearned or learned behavior intrudes or dominates. Intrusions occur in both directions.Behavior influenced by its consequences seems directed toward the future, but only past effects are relevant. The mere fact that behavior is adaptive does not indicate whether phylogenic or ontogenic processes have been responsible for it. Examples include the several possible provenances of imitation, aggression, and communication. The generality of such concepts limits their usefulness. A more specific analysis is needed if we are to deal effectively with the two kinds of contingencies and their products."
https://openalex.org/W2005990056,Quantitative infrared spectrophotometric analysis of whole femurs from male rats demonstrates that amorphous calcium phosphate is a major component of bone mineral. The amount of amorphous calcium phosphate in whole bone decreases while the crystalline bone apatite increases during early stages of bone formation. Mature rat bone contains constant levels of both amorphous and crystalline calcium phosphate.
https://openalex.org/W2087471292,"The separated complemnentary strands of a minor component in mouse DNA reassociate with each other much more rapidly than do the complementary strands of other DNA's including those of the principal part of mouse DNA. This difference in capacity of the strands to reassociate can be used to effect a preparative separation of the minor component from the principal fraction. The rate constant for reassociation of the minor component, compared with those of viral and bacterial DNA's, indicates that the minor component consists of a short nucleotide sequence present in about one million copies."
https://openalex.org/W2081561037,"Human lymphocytes treated with phytohemagglutinin undergo extensive gene activation, as evidenced by augmented synthesis of ribonucleic acids. This activation is preceded by an early stimulation in the rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of nuclear proteins. This finding is consistent with a hypothesized role of phosphoproteins in the modification of chromatin structure and in modulation of the template activity of DNA in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2089918024,A particulate fraction has been isolated from detergent-prepared HeLa cell nuclei. The fraction consists largely of organelles that resemble the nucleoli of intact cells. The 45S RNA that is precursor to 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA is associated with the fraction. The 32S RNA that is labeled after the 45S RNA and is the apparent precursor to 28S RNA is also associated with the fraction. The nucleoplasm contains 28S RNA that behaves as an intermediate between the 32S nucleolar RNA and the 28S cytoplasmic RNA.

https://openalex.org/W1969699612,Reaction of N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene with DNA or RNA at pH 7 causes marked increase in absorption at 280 to 320 millimicrons and marked decrease in guanine content. Reaction with guanosine-8-(14)C yields a radioactive fluorescent derivative. The data suggest that metabolic esters of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene may be intermediates in the binding of this proximate carcinogen to nucleic acids in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W2036419370,"Chicken embryo extract has been fractionated into high-and low-molecular-weight components on Sephadex G-25. Media supplemented with the low-molecular-weight fraction (L) support full differentiation in clones of cartilage and of pigmented retina cells from chicken embryos. Growth rates of such cultures in L-supplemented media are greater than in media without embryo extract, and plating efficiencies are higher than in media with or without whole embryo extract. The high-molecular-weight fraction (H) in low concentrations also stimulates growth and plating efficiency, but inhibits the expression of differentiation."

Their cytoplasm has numerous fine filaments and other components. characteristic of smooth muscle cells. The rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, however, is relatively prominent In some instances, the nuclear surface appears scalloped or folded, and the cell surface presents an irregular profile, similar to that of contracted cells."
https://openalex.org/W2074948096,"Posterior hypothalamic selfstimulation of male rats, in which monopolar,platinum electrodes had been belaterally implanted, increased after systdmic injection of testosterone. constant stimulation to the same site elicited immediate copulation with estrous female rats. During constant stimulation males would press a bar to open a door for access to females. Even after ejaculation, males continued to open the door and to display sexual activity until stimulation terminated. Posterior hypothalamic stimulation is like normal sexual stimulation; it is rewarding, the reward varies with the amount of the sex hormone, and it elicits motivated copulation."

https://openalex.org/W2010656336,"DNA from tobacco leaf chloroplasts was isolated as a single component with a buoyant density in CsCl of 1.702 compared to 1.697 for nuclear DNA. 5-Methylcytosine is present in nuclear DNA but absent in chloroplast DNA. Chloroplast DNA, with a guanine-cytosine content of 43 percent, has a melting temperature of 86 degrees C and renatures completely on slow cooling, whereas nuclear DNA ( melting temperature, 84 degrees C; guanine-cytosine content, 40 percent) does not renature. About 9 percent of the total DNA in tobacco leaves is chloroplast DNA representing about 4.7 xX 10-(15) gram of DNA per chloroplast with a molecular weight of approximately 4 xX 10(7)."

https://openalex.org/W2058086204,"Heart extracts from over 100 species of birds were subjected to starch-gel electrophoresis at pH 7. The ""supernatant"" form of malate dehydrogenase, an enzyme present in every extract, was then located on the gels by a specific staining method. The mobility of this enzyme shows very little interspecific variation. Nearly all birds tested have a supernatant malate dehydrogenase that moves as fast as the chicken enzyme. Those species with an enzyme of unusual mobility are of taxonomic interest. For example, hummingbirds and swifts, which are usually considered as two suborders of Apodiformes, are unique among the birds tested in having an enzyme that moves 63 percent as fast as the chicken enzyme. This finding appears to confirm the unity of the Apodiformes, an order whose unity has long been open to question. Similarly all families tested in the shorebird order (Charadriiformes) are unique in having an enzyme that moves 55 percent as fast as the chicken enzyme. The unity of this order was also previously open to question."
https://openalex.org/W2085089381,"Among the three adult sheep hemoglobins (A, B, and C), two (A and B) are reportedly products of alleles. The beta-chains of A and B differ by at least seven scattered amino acid residues whereas the beta-sequence of C differs from A by at least 16 residues and from B by at least 21 residues. These changes suggest that the origin of C-beta antedated the divergence of A and B. Five shared differences between A-beta and C-beta with respect to B-beta can be interpreted as the result of selective advantage in favor of B. A complex of additional mechanisms has possibly been involved in maintaining the A-B- C porymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2008599581,"Rats deprived of D-state sleep (and, to some extent, of slow-wave sleep) for 96 hours show a significant fall in brain acetylcholine in the telencephalon; there were no significant changes in the diencephalon and brain stem. Restraint stress and activity wheel stress produced no significant change in acetylcholine levels in any of these regions; the telencephalic response to sleep deprivation, therefore, cannot be attributed to nonspecific stress. The effects of D-state deprivation and the psychoactive anticholinergic drugs on telencephalic acetylcholine levels are similar."
https://openalex.org/W2052882569,"Incubation of chick embryos in an hypoxic environment causes an ncrease in the proportion of tissue lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) made up of subunit M, whereas incubation in aerobic conditions decreases the proportional amount of subunit M. The variation of ambient oxygen tension does not change the total LDH activity. These results support the hypothesis that oxygen or oxidative metabolites have an effect on the synthesis of the subunit peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2087249770,"Electrical stimulation of the olfactory tract of goldfish for one minute can deplete completely the stainable neurosecretory granules from cells of the preoptic nucleus as well as from their axons. Thus, in stimulated neurons secretory granules appear to move toward the neurohemal point of discharge at a rate of about 2 millimeters per minuite. Reaccumutlation of neurosecretory granules in depleted neurons to approximately normal numbers requires about 1 to 1.5 hours. Histological evidence indicates that, during the period of reaccumulation, granules move out of the perikaryon until normal granulation in the axons is achieved; finally, granulation of the perikaryon is restored."
https://openalex.org/W1981412415,"An operant procedure was employed to investigate odor discrimination in the pigeon. Amyl acetate concentrations of 6-percent saturation in air, and lower, when paired with electric shock markedly reduced key-pecking during the odor stimulus period. Sectioning the olfactory nerves eliminated this selective suppression behavior. After the operation, the suppression was again conditioned when the concentration of amyl acetate was increased to 15-percent saturation in air. This is theoretically possible through mediation by the trigeminal system."

In alveolar lung tissue the concentration of lead-210 in smokers was about twice that in nonsmokers. These differences are attributed to additional intake by inhalation of lead-210."
https://openalex.org/W2090307863,"This is the first report from the National Fertility Study, 1965, a survey of the reproductive behavior of a national sample of married women, under the age of 55, living with their husbands. The report presents basic data on the use of oral contraception by women under the age of 45, in relation to age, parity, education, race, and religion. The study leads to certain conclusions, as follows. Present, past, and prospective use vary inversely with the age of the woman and directly with the number of years of schooling; the majority of young women with college training have already used the oral contraceptive. Use by Negroes is somewhat less extensive than use by whites, particularly for ages below 25; some of this difference is explainable by concomitant racial differences in educational level. Negroes seem less likely than whites to use oral contraception for timing early births, and more likely, when they do use it, to be attempting to terminate their fertility. The same observation holds for white Catholics in relation to white non-Catholics. Although the extent of use may be lower among Catholics than non-Catholics, the proportion of Catholics who report use is substantial indeed in view of the persisting theological controversy."

The acetaldehyde, acrolein, and hydrogen cyanide produced strong inhibition of the ciliary beat. A filter which removed most of the acetaldehyde and acrolein from smoke did not reduce the inhibitory effect of the gas phase of that smoke, whereas a filter that removed most of the hydrogen cyanide did reduce inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2068750991,"The reduced alkylated derivative of human pituitary growth hormone was prepared by reacting the native hormone in 8M urea solution, first with mercaptoethanol and then with iodoacetamide. On the basis of amino acid analyses, the product isolated after gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 is completely devoid of unreduced cystine but otherwise has a composition identical to that of the native hormone. When assayed in both the rat tibia test and the pigeon crop-sac assay,it appears that the full potency of the native hormone is retained in the reduced alkylated derivative."

https://openalex.org/W2082044550,"Peafowl, like other vertebrates, contain multiple forms of lactate dehydrogenase. The electrophoretic properties of the peafowl isoenzymes are unusual in that the isoenzyme from heart tissue can be either more or less anodic than that of muscle, depending on the pH. This finding focuses attention on the problem of isoenzyme identification. It is suggested that isoenzymes be identified on the basis of properties that are chemically and biologically more significant than electrophoretic mobility."

Starvation of the animal for I week results in a decrease of the glycogen content by about 68 percent. Measurements of its oxygen consumption indicate that sufficient carbohydrate, probably its sole source of energy, is oxidized daily to meet the carbon requirements. The infestation zone of Limnoria is restricted to the surface of submerged wood, since this isopod borer, unlike the molluscan borers, does not have a glycogen reserve sufficient to meet prolonged periods of anaerobiosis."
