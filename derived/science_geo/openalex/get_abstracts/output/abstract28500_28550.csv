https://openalex.org/W2039382131,"The E6 protein encoded by the oncogenic human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 is one of two viral products expressed in HPV-associated cancers. E6 is an oncoprotein which cooperates with E7 to immortalize primary human keratinocytes. Insight into the mechanism by which E6 functions in oncogenesis is provided by the observation that the E6 protein encoded by HPV-16 and HPV-18 can complex the wild-type p53 protein in vitro. Wild-type p53 gene has tumor suppressor properties, and is a target for several of the oncoproteins encoded by DNA tumor viruses. In this study we demonstrate that the E6 proteins of the oncogenic HPVs that bind p53 stimulate the degradation of p53. The E6-promoted degradation of p53 is ATP dependent and involves the ubiquitin-dependent protease system. Selective degradation of cellular proteins such as p53 with negative regulatory functions provides a novel mechanism of action for dominant-acting oncoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2046001565,"Major epidemic outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis result from infections with Norwalk or Norwalk-like viruses. Virus purified from stool specimens of volunteers experimentally infected with Norwalk virus was used to construct recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) and derive clones representing most of the viral genome. The specificity of the clones was shown by their hybridization with post- (but not pre-) infection stool samples from volunteers infected with Norwalk virus and with purified Norwalk virus. A correlation was observed between the appearance of hybridization signals in stool samples and clinical symptoms of acute gastroenteritis in volunteers. Hybridization assays between overlapping clones, restriction enzyme analyses, and partial nucleotide sequence information of the clones indicated that Norwalk virus contains a single-stranded RNA genome of positive sense, with a polyadenylated tail at the 3â€² end and a size of at least 7.5 kilobases. A consensus amino acid sequence motif typical of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases was identified in one of the Norwalk virus clones. The availability of Norwalk-specific cDNA and the new sequence information of the viral genome should permit the development of sensitive diagnostic assays and studies of the molecular biology of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W1977393774,"The mechanism by which transcription factors stimulate DNA replication in eukaryotes is unknown. Bovine papillomavirus DNA synthesis requires the products of the viral E1 gene and the transcriptional activator protein encoded by the E2 gene. Experimental data showed that the 68-kilodalton (kD) E1 protein formed a complex with the 48-kD E2 transcription factor. This complex bound specifically to the viral origin of replication, which contains multiple binding sites for E2. Repressor proteins encoded by the E2 open reading frame failed to complex with E1 suggesting that the 162-amino acid region of E2 that participates in transactivation contained critical determinants for interaction with E1. The physical association between a replication protein and a transcription factor suggests that transcriptional activator proteins may function in targeting replication initiator proteins to their respective origins of replication."
https://openalex.org/W2058354524,"The progesterone receptor (PR) in the chicken oviduct is a phosphoprotein that regulates gene transcription in the presence of progesterone. Treatment with progesterone in vivo stimulates phosphorylation of the progesterone receptor. With transient transfection assays, the present work has tested whether phosphorylation participates in the regulation of PR-mediated transcription. Treatment with 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Br cAMP), a stimulator of cAMP-dependent protein kinase [protein kinase A (PKA)], mimicked progesterone-dependent, receptor-mediated transcription in the absence of progesterone. Inhibition of PKA blocked hormone action. Treatment with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, stimulated transcription in a manner similar to that of progesterone. These observations suggest that phosphorylation of the PR or other proteins in the transcription complex can modulate PR-mediated transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2046536956,"GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, binds to GABAA receptors, which form chloride ion channels. The predicted structure of the GABAA receptor places a consensus phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) on an intracellular domain of the channel. Phosphorylation by various protein kinases has been shown to alter the activity of certain ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. We have examined the role of phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of PKA in the regulation of GABAA receptor channel function using whole-cell and excised outside-out patch-clamp techniques. Inclusion of the catalytic subunit of PKA in the recording pipettes significantly reduced GABA-evoked whole-cell and single-channel chloride currents. Both heat inactivation of PKA and addition of the specific protein kinase inhibitor peptide prevented the reduction of GABA-evoked currents by PKA. Neither mean channel open time nor channel conductance was affected by PKA. The reduction in GABA receptor current by PKA was primarily due to a reduction in channel opening frequency."
https://openalex.org/W1533591905,"Target protein multi-ubiquitination involving lysine 48 of ubiquitin (Ub) is known to occur during protein degradation in the ATP- and Ub-dependent proteolytic pathway (Chau, V., Tobias, J. W., Bachmair, A., Marriott, D., Ecker, D. J., Gonda, D. K., and Varshavsky, A. (1989) Science 243, 1576-1583). However, little is known about the enzymatic mechanism of multi-ubiquitination. We show that a purified Ub carrier protein, E2(25)K, catalyzes multi-Ub chain synthesis from purified Ub. Incubation of E2(25)K with Ub activating enzyme (E1), MgATP, and radiolabeled Ub (Mr = 8500) resulted in time dependent appearance of a ladder of radiolabeled Ub conjugates with molecular masses of 8.5n kDa, where n = 1, 2, 3, 4... (up to at least n = 10). The kinetics of this conjugative process were consistent with Ub2 acting as a steady-state intermediate. The putative Ub2 product of E2(25)K catalysis was purified and cleaved with a partially purified isopeptidase preparation. The sole cleavage product (Mr = 8500) had a tryptic digest identical to that of authentic Ub, confirming that the original conjugate was Ub2. Tryptic digestion of intact Ub2 gave products consistent with the existence of an isopeptide linkage between the COOH terminus of one Ub and Lys-48 of the other; this structure was confirmed by sequence analysis of the unique Ub2 tryptic fragment. Tryptic digestion of higher order Ubn adducts (n greater than or equal to 4) yielded fragments identical to those of Ub2, indicating that E2(25)K ligates successive Ub molecules primarily or exclusively via Lys-48. Although several other E2s supported synthesis of an apparent Ub2 adduct of undetermined linkage, only E2(25)K was capable of synthesizing multi-Ub chains from isolated Ub. Quantitative analysis of single turnovers showed that transfer from E2(25)K-Ub to Ub and Ub2 occurred with kappa 2 = 488 and 1170 M-1 min-1, respectively, at pH 7.3 and 37 degrees C. These results show that increasing the number of Ub molecules in a chain increases susceptibility to further ubiquitination by E2(25)K. Ub2 was a good substrate for activation by E1 and was readily transferred to E2(25)K. The labile E2(25)K-Ub2 adduct was catalytically active, and exhibited preference for Ub2 (versus Ub) as acceptor. These results suggest that E2(25)K may function as a multi-ubiquitinating enzyme in the Ub-dependent proteolytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2034042693,"Voltage-activated calcium channels open and close, or gate, according to molecular transition rates that are regulated by transmembrane voltage and neurotransmitters. Here evidence for the control of gating by calcium was found in electrophysiological records of single, L-type calcium channels in heart cells. Conditional open probability analysis revealed that calcium entry during the opening of a single channel produces alterations in gating transition rates that evolve over the course of hundreds of milliseconds. Such alteration of calcium-channel gating by entry of a favored permeant ion provides a mechanism for the short-term modulation of single-ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2008099529,"Development of methods for the manipulation of the genomes of parasitic protozoa will lead to enhanced understanding of parasite biology and host-parasite relationships. Efficient gene transfer and targeted integration by homologous recombination were achieved in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness. An expression vector with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo), under the control of a procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) gene promoter, was targeted into an intergenic region in beta alpha-tubulin-gene tandem array. Sixteen copies of neo were found in a tandem array in one of the transfectants where the PARP promoter controlled alpha-amanitin-resistant transcription of neo, whereas transcription of tubulin genes remained alpha-amanitin-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1488738675,"Radiolabeled leukotriene (LT) E4 was infused into three healthy subjects in order to assess the production and elimination of sulfidopeptide leukotriene metabolites in urine. Three different radiolabeled tracers were employed, [14,15-3H]LTE4, [35S]LTE4, and [14C] LTE4 in five separate infusion studies. There was a rapid disappearance of radioactivity from the vascular compartment in an apparent two-phase process. The first elimination phase had an apparent half-life of approximately 7 min. Radioactivity quickly appeared in the urine with 10-16% eliminated during the first 2 h following intravenous infusion; 7%, 2-5 h; 4%, 5-8 h; 4%, 8-15 h; and 1.5%, 15-24 h from the [14C] LTE4 experiments. Unmetabolized LTE4 was the major radioactive component in the first urine collection, but at later times two more polar compounds predominated. After extensive purification by normal phase-solid phase extraction and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, these compounds were characterized by UV spectroscopy, co-elution with synthetic standards, negative ion electron capture gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and tandem mass spectrometry. The two major urinary metabolites were structurally determined to be 14-carboxy-hexanor-LTE3 and the conjugated tetraene, 16-carboxy-delta 13-tetranor-LTE4. Three other minor metabolites were detectable in the first urine collection only and were characterized by co-elution with synthetic standards as 16-carboxy-tetranor-LTE3, 18-carboxy-dinor-LTE4, and 20-carboxy-LTE4. omega-Oxidation and subsequent beta-oxidation from the methyl terminus appeared to be the major metabolic fate for sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in man. The accumulation of the 14-COOH-LTE3 and 16-COOH-delta 13-LTE4 may reflect a rate-limiting step in further oxidation of these compounds which places a conjugated triene or conjugated tetraene, respectively, two carbons removed from the CoA ester moiety. Also in the first urine collection there was another minor metabolite identified as N-acetyl-LTE4, however, no subsequent beta-oxidation of this metabolite was observed. The major metabolites of LTE4 might be useful in assessing in vivo production of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1536139694,"A new type of non-heme iron protein was purified to homogeneity from extracts of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC 27774) and Desulfovibrio vulgaris (strain Hildenborough). This protein is a monomer of 16-kDa containing two iron atoms per molecule. The visible spectrum has maxima at 495, 368, and 279 nm and the EPR spectrum of the native form shows resonances at g = 7.7, 5.7, 4.1 and 1.8 characteristic of a high-spin ferric ion (S = 5/2) with E/D = 0.08. Mossbauer data indicates the presence of two types of iron: an FeS4 site very similar to that found in desulforedoxin from Desulfovibrio gigas and an octahedral coordinated high-spin ferrous site most probably with nitrogen/oxygen-containing ligands. Due to this rather unusual combination of active centers, this novel protein is named desulfoferrodoxin. Based on NH2-terminal amino acid sequence determined so far, the desulfoferrodoxin isolated from D. desulfuricans (ATCC 27774) appears to be a close analogue to a recently discovered gene product from D. vulgaris (Brumlik, M.J., and Voordouw, G. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 49996-50004), which was suggested to be a rubredoxin oxidoreductase. However, reduced pyridine nucleotides failed to reduce the desulforedoxin-like center of this new protein."
https://openalex.org/W1508486622,"We have shown previously that the major source of diglyceride (DG) formed following muscarinic receptor (mAChR) stimulation of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is phosphatidylcholine (PC) rather than the phosphoinositides (Martinson, E. A., Goldstein, D., and Brown, J. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14748-14754). We have also noted that there is a delay of several minutes before significant DG accumulation is observed. In the present work, we examine the time course and mechanism of PC hydrolysis in response to mAChR stimulation. Treatment of 1321N1 cells with carbachol results in increases in radiolabeled choline, phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylethanol (PEt), metabolites that are products of phospholipase D (PLD) action on PC. These products are all formed within 15 s of mAChR stimulation and reach a plateau within 30-60 s. The time course of PEt formation suggests that PLD is no longer activated after several minutes of mAChR stimulation. Thus there is a discrepancy between the rapid and transient activation of PLD and the delayed accumulation of DG. It appears that most of the DG is formed through the action of PLD, since propranolol (which inhibits the conversion of PA to DG) and down-regulation of protein kinase C (which prevents activation of PLD by carbachol) both markedly inhibit DG production. Using a protocol in which cells are stimulated with carbachol for only one minute (a period during which PLD and PA formation are maximally activated), we show that DG mass continues to increase following removal of agonist. We suggest that the rapid and transient activation of PLD results in delayed accumulation of DG due to the relatively slow conversion of PA to DG by PA phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2017778575,"The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the site-specific recombination enzyme gamma delta resolvase has been determined at 2.7 A resolution. Its first 120 amino acids form a central five-stranded, beta-pleated sheet surrounded by five alpha helices. In one of the four dyad-related dimers, the two active site Ser-10 residues are 19 A apart, perhaps close enough to contact and become covalently linked to the DNA at the recombination site. This dimer also forms the only closely packed tetramer found in the crystal. The subunit interface at a second dyad-related dimer is more extensive and more highly conserved among the homologous recombinases; however, its active site Ser-10 residues are more than 30 A apart. Side chains, identified by mutations that eliminate catalysis but not DNA binding, are located on the subunit surface near the active site serine and at the interface between a third dyad-related pair of subunits of the tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1591664409,"Two major gelatinolytic metalloproteinases (gelatinases) of 65 kDa and 92 kDa were purified from a tumor cell line. Analysis of collagen degradation showed that native full-length Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) type IV collagen was not cleaved by the purified gelatinases under conditions where native pepsin-extracted human placental type IV and V collagen and heat-denatured collagens were markedly degraded. However, EHS type IV collagen degradation was noted at 37 degrees C, i.e., under conditions that would favor denaturation of the collagen molecule in solution. The pattern of degradation of human placental type IV and V collagen appeared similar for both gelatinases. Zymogram analysis of gelatinase activity in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (to eliminate possible SDS-mediated denaturation of type IV collagen) confirmed the inability of 65 and 92-kDa gelatinases to degrade native full-length EHS type IV collagen. Under the same conditions and in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymograms the gelatinases degraded pepsin-predigested EHS type IV collagen and pepsin-extracted human placental type IV collagen. These data suggest that the 65- and 92-kDa tumor cell gelatinases are not true type IV collagenases. Their ability to degrade pepsin-solubilized, or denatured, type IV collagen suggests a specificity for telopeptide precleaved or conformationally altered forms of this molecule."

In the course of attempting to define these signals by testing virus incorporation of CD4-Env chimeric proteins, normal human CD4 was found to be efficiently and selectively assembled into avian leukosis virus particles in quail cells.

https://openalex.org/W2024782132,"Abstract The axonal localization of the Drosophila abl protein and its genetic interactions with the disabled and fasciclin I genes implicate this cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase in the process of axonal pathfinding. Several changes at the amino terminus of abl permitted proper function and localization of the altered proteins. In contrast, the presence of human c-abl type 1a amino-terminal sequences or the murine c-abl carboxy-terminal domain interfered with function and axonal locallzation. Rescue of phenotypes caused by mutations in abl alone did not require tyrosine kinase activity, indicating a novel kinase-independent function for the properly localizaed abl protein. However, abl kinase activity was required to rescue the mutant phenotypes in genetic backgrounds also mutant for disabled ."

https://openalex.org/W2052969012,"The lack of reagents or molecular probes specific for the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor has hindered characterization of the molecular mechanism(s) by which CNTF influences the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of cells of the vertebrate nervous system. We have developed methods for the detection and separation of cells expressing CNTF receptors by using a variety of binding assays based on a genetically engineered CNTF molecule containing an ""epitope tag"" at its C-terminus. These assays have allowed us to identify several neuronal cell lines, as well as embryonic and adult neurons in primary cultures, that bind CNTF and functionally respond to CNTF by rapidly activating the transcription of immediate early primary response genes."
https://openalex.org/W1543297372,"Various derivatives of thiazolidine-diones have been identified as tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase and c-src kinase were inhibited in vitro with IC50 values in the range of 1-7 microM. The v-abl tyrosine protein kinase was not inhibited by thiazolidine-diones. Inhibition was found to be specific for tyrosine protein kinases. Inhibition of serine/threonine protein kinases was not observed. The active derivatives were shown to inhibit EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation, either in vitro or in intact cells, and were also found to inhibit growth of the EGF-dependent BALB/MK and A431 cell lines (IC50 1-3 microM). Growth of the interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line FDC-P1 was inhibited with equal efficiency. Thus, in these cell lines, members of the c-src kinase family are also potential targets for inhibition by the compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1583347987,"Polarized renal epithelial cells have pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins at their apical membrane capable of modulating Na+ channel activity (Cantiello, H.F., Patenaude, C.R., and Ausiello, D.A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20867-20870). In this study, the patch clamp technique was used to assess if this Gi-mediated regulation of Na+ channels is a component of a phospholipid signal transduction pathway. In excised inside-out patches of apical membranes of A6 cells, guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-stimulated Na+ channel activity (percent open time and channel number) was inhibited by the phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine (50 microM), which had no effect on single channel conductance. In contrast, Na+ channel activity increased in a Ca2(+)-dependent manner following the addition of 100 nM mellitin to untreated or pertussis toxin-treated patches. Addition of 10 microM arachidonic acid in the presence of mepacrine increased Na+ channel activity. Both percent open time and Na+ channel number induced by GTP gamma S, the exogenous alpha i-3 subunit, or arachidonic acid were inhibited by the addition of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Na+ channel activity was restored with the addition of leukotriene D4 (100 nM) or the parental leukotriene substrate 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (10 microM). Thus, Gi activation of apical membrane epithelial Na+ channels is mediated through the regulation of phospholipase and lipoxygenase activities. This apically located signal transduction pathway may be sensitive to, or independent of, classical second messengers generated at the basolateral membrane and known to be responsible for modulation of Na+ channel activity in epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2158143441,"gamma delta resolvase, a transposon-encoded site-specific recombinase, catalyzes the resolution of the cointegrate intermediate of gamma delta transposition. The recombination reaction involves the formation of a catalytic nucleoprotein complex whose structure is determined by specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. We have isolated many resolvase mutants and have identified four that are unable to mediate a subclass of higher order protein-protein interactions necessary for recombination. This mutant phenotype is characterized by an inability to catalyze recombination, a loss of cooperative binding to res DNA, and a failure to induce looping out of the DNA between two resolvase binding sites within res. The amino acid side chains identified by the cooperativity mutants cluster on a surface of the protein that mediates an interaction between resolvase dimers in a crystallographic tetramer. We have therefore identified a region of resolvase that mediates an interdimer protein-protein interaction necessary for the formation of the recombinogenic synaptic intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1588262248,"Abstract Radioiodinated histone H3 was incubated with ubiquitin, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, and one of three ubiquitin carrier proteins, reticulocyte E2(20K) or E2(32K) or the yeast RAD6 product. Although the resulting ubiquitin-histone conjugates were synthesized in the absence of the substrate-binding protein E3, they were nevertheless degraded by purified rabbit reticulocyte 26 S protease. In contrast, unmodified histone H3 remained intact upon challenge with the 26 S ubiquitin/ATP-dependent enzyme. Conjugates produced by the RAD6 protein were better proteolytic substrates than those formed by reticulocyte E2 unless ubiquitin molecules with altered lysines were used for conjugate synthesis. Substitution of methylated ubiquitin or ubiquitin molecules in which lysine 48 was converted to arginine by site-directed mutation produced histone conjugates that were degraded at slow but measurable rates. Since methylated ubiquitin molecules are incapable of forming branched polyubiquitin chains, these results demonstrate that neither ubiquitin trees nor the substrate binding factor E3 is absolutely required for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of histone H3 in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1512980149,"In order to characterize the biogenesis of unique thermogenic mitochondria of brown adipose tissue, differentiation of precursor cells isolated from mouse brown adipose tissue was studied in cell culture. Synthesis of mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP), F1-ATPase, and cytochrome oxidase was examined by L-[35S]methionine labeling and immunoblotting. For the first time, synthesis of physiological amounts of the UCP, a key and tissue-specific component of thermogenic mitochondria, was observed in cultures at about confluence (day 6), indicating that a complete differentiation of brown adipocytes was achieved in vitro. In postconfluent cells (day 8) the content of UCP decreased rapidly, in contrast to some other mitochondrial proteins (beta subunit of F1-ATPase, cytochrome oxidase). In these cells, it was possible, by using norepinephrine, to induce specifically the synthesis of the UCP but not of F1-ATPase or cytochrome oxidase. The maximal response was observed at 0.1 microM norepinephrine and the synthesis of UCP remained activated for at least 24 h. Detailed analysis revealed a major role of the beta-adrenergic receptors and elevated intracellular concentration of cAMP in stimulation of UCP synthesis. A quantitative recovery of the newly synthesized UCP in the mitochondrial fraction indicated completed biogenesis of functionally competent thermogenic mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1481038980,"We have cloned a cDNA encoding the human vitamin D receptor (VDR) into a high copy yeast plasmid controlled transcriptionally by the copper-inducible metallothionein (CUP-1) promoter to produce YEpV1. Introduction of this plasmid in the protease deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ 3505 and subsequent growth in the presence of copper and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 leads to the synthesis of intact VDR comprising over 0.5% of total soluble protein. The VDR was purified to near homogeneity from similarly induced yeast cultures by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and sequential DNA-cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, and then characterized for physical and functional properties. The purified VDR associated with a specific synthetic DNA sequence comprising the vitamin D response element as assayed through bandshift analysis. Binding, however, required the presence of a mammalian cell protein factor that also enhances vitamin D response element interaction by mammalian cell-derived VDR. Polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against the purified VDR further retarded the receptor/nuclear factor/DNA complex in these analyses. These studies, together with our previous experiments that demonstrate reconstitution of a vitamin D-dependent transcription system in yeast, show that the VDR can be produced and purified from yeast in a functional form."
https://openalex.org/W1549868924,"We have identified the structure of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in human platelets. These lipids accounted for less than 2% of the total 32P incorporated into inositol phospholipids in the platelets. All three lipids were labeled in unstimulated platelets, but incorporation of 32P changed rapidly by 15 s after thrombin stimulation, suggesting that they are important in platelet activation. Specific inositol polyphosphate phosphatases were used to both identify the lipid structures and to determine the route of synthesis of these lipids. During 32P labeling and after thrombin stimulation of human platelets, as much as 60% of the total radioactivity present in PtdIns(3,4)P2 was found in the D-4 phosphate and only 35% in the D-3 phosphate indicating that PtdIns(3)P is the precursor of PtdIns(3,4)P2. In addition, the D-5 and D-4 phosphates of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 each contained 35-40% of the total radioactivity in the molecule compared with only 18-28% in the D-3 position, suggesting that PtdIns(3,4)P2 and not PtdIns(4,5)P2 is the major precursor of this lipid. These results define the predominant pathway for synthesis of these lipids in platelets as PtdIns----PtdIns(3)P----PtdIns(3,4)P2----PtdIns(3,4,5)P3."
https://openalex.org/W1575923529,"Two major classes of mRNAs for the alpha-crystallin B chain (or alpha(B)crystallin), about 0.9 and 1.2 kilobases in length, are expressed in rat brain. To examine the structures of these mRNAs, we isolated cDNA clones from rat brain and genomic DNA from rat liver. Characterization of these clones as well as Northern blot analysis indicated that the various mRNAs differed in the lengths of their 5' leader sequences. RNase protection assays revealed that the gene for alpha-crystallin B chain contains multiple start sites. The transcriptional start sites of the longer mRNAs are preceded by a putative CAAT box and that of the shorter mRNA by a putative TATA box. The shorter mRNA encodes the alpha-crystallin B chain protein, whereas the longer mRNA contained three extra small open reading frames upstream of the AUG start codon for the protein. The shorter mRNA is abundant in lens, heart, muscle, and kidney, while the longer mRNAs are constitutively expressed at low levels in a wide variety of tissues. The shorter mRNA was increased by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in rat C6 glioma cells. Since there is only a single copy of the alpha-crystallin B chain gene, our results indicate that the two classes of mRNAs are generated by alternative transcriptional initiation from different promoters and their expressions are regulated differentially."
https://openalex.org/W2049506557,"Poliovirus mutants resistant to neutralization with soluble cellular receptor were isolated. Replication of soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutants was blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed against the HeLa cell receptor for poliovirus, indicating that the mutants use this receptor to enter cells. The srr mutants showed reduced binding to HeLa cells and cell membranes. However, the reduced binding phenotype did not have a major impact on viral replication, as judged by plaque size and one-step growth curves. These results suggest that the use of soluble receptors as antiviral agents could lead to the selection of neutralization-resistant mutants that are able to bind cell surface receptors, replicate, and cause disease."
https://openalex.org/W1964559136,"Influx of calcium through membrane channels is an important initial step in signal transduction of growth signals. Therefore, the effects of Ras protein injection on calcium currents across the soma membrane of an identified neuron of the snail Hermissenda were examined. With the use of these post-mitotic cells, a voltage-sensitive, inward calcium current was increased 10 to 20 minutes after Harvey-ras oncoproteins were injected. The effects of oncogenic Harvey ras p21 protein (v-Ras) occurred quickly and were sustained, whereas the effects of proto-oncogenic ras protein (c-Ras) were transient. This relative potency is consistent with the activities of these oncoproteins in stimulating cell proliferation. Thus, this calcium channel may be a target for Ras action."
https://openalex.org/W1496216397,"The regulation of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) receptor system in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (RVSMC) was examined following long term pretreatment of these cells with rANF99-126 or with any one of a series of truncated and ring-deleted analogs. The latter analogs are reported to bind selectively the ANF-C or clearance receptor. Initial competition binding studies revealed that all analogs examined showed comparable apparent receptor binding affinities (Ki values did not differ by more than 10-fold). In contrast, the extent of interaction of the ANF analogs with the receptor pool coupled to particulate guanylate cyclase (the ANF-B receptor) was much more variable, with some ligands failing to stimulate cGMP production or particulate guanylate cyclase over the concentrations tested. Pretreatment of cells for 24 h with rANF99-126 or any of the truncated analogs that interact with the ANF-B receptor caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the number of ANF binding sites (99% of which are uncoupled in RVSMC) without any change in affinity. Examination of the binding activity following pretreatment of the cells with ANF suggested that the observed reduction in 125I-rANF99-126 binding capacity was not because of the retention of the peptide on its receptor. Furthermore, this down-regulation was associated with desensitization of particulate guanylate cyclase resulting in a decreased responsiveness of intracellular cGMP accumulation to ANF. In contrast, however, analogs selective for the ANF-C receptor pool failed to cause down-regulation or desensitization. These findings suggest that ANF-C receptors in RVSMC are not independently down-regulated by selective ligands but that nonselective analogs that down-regulate and desensitize the ANF-B receptor system can by some cooperative mechanism reduce the size of the predominant ANF-C receptor pool in these cells."

Like the native protein, the recombinant procollagenase synthesized and secreted by these cells was the product of a 2.1-kilobase pair transcript which was translated into a procollagenase protein of 57 kDa, with a small amount of protein that co-migrated with the glycosylated form of the native protein at 61 kDa. The BHK cells expressed levels of recombinant procollagenase equal to or exceeding those of rabbit synovial fibroblasts stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, where procollagenase mRNA may comprise 2% of the mRNA population. Although minimal (approximately 10%) collagenolysis was seen when the zymogen was activated with trypsin or an organ-omercurial compound, the expression of full collagenolytic activity of the recombinant protein depended on the presence of stromelysin (matrix metalloproteinase-3). Purified recombinant collagenase displayed a specific activity of 8,400 units/mg of enzyme (1 unit degraded 1 microgram of collagen/minute at 37 degrees C) when fully activated, which was accomplished by the specific cleavage of the Gln80-Phe81 bond of procollagenase by stromelysin. We conclude that 1) these stably transfected BHK cells represent a high yield source of recombinant mammalian procollagenase, 2) activation of procollagenase depends on the presence of stromelysin, and 3) recombinant procollagenase from this high yield source may be useful in future studies to elucidate the detailed mechanism(s) involved in the activation of this enzyme."

R., Serunian L. A., Soltoff, S. P., Libby, P., and Cantley, L. C. (1989) Cell 57, 167-175. An alternative pathway for in vivo synthesis of one of these lipids was recently suggested: phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate could be produced by phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate at the D-4 position of the inositol ring (Yamamoto, K., and Lapetina, E. G. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 168, 466-472). Here we demonstrate the presence of an enzyme in human platelets that phosphorylates [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate to produce [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. This enzyme is Mg2(+)-dependent and its apparent molecular mass is approximately 150 kDa as estimated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration chromatography. Unlike the major phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase in platelets that is stimulated by the detergent Nonidet P-40, the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-4-kinase is inhibited by Nonidet P-40. Both activities are also differentiated by the action of adenosine. The discovery of this new enzyme raises the possibility that multiple pathways exists for generating D-3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides."
https://openalex.org/W1549507201,"The gene coding for the human estrogen receptor protein was expressed as a ubiquitin fusion under the control of the lambda PL promoter in Escherichia coli. Analysis of extracts by Western blot showed that intact receptor protein was produced only when PL promoter was depressed by nalidixic acid at 30 degrees C. To ascertain the intactness of the expressed protein, estrogen receptor in bacterial extracts was titrated with either 17 beta-[3H]estradiol or 17 beta-[125I]iodoestradiol, and the mass was quantified by enzyme immunoassay. Cell extracts contained 484 fmol of estrogen receptor per mg of soluble protein by titration with a Kd of 3.2 x 10(-10) M. The simultaneous analysis by enzyme immunoassay resulted in 487 fmol/mg of extract protein indicating that most of the expressed protein bound ligand with wild type properties. Ligand competition analysis demonstrated that expressed receptor contained a binding domain preferentially recognizing estrogenic substances identical with that of wild-type estrogen receptor. The E. coli-expressed estrogen receptor also associated specifically with estrogen response DNA elements. Full length receptor protein was detected by ligand binding and immunorecognition using size exclusion chromatography. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography showed a major isoform which exhibited both ligand binding and immuno-recognition identical with the estrogen receptor from human breast tumor tissues. These data indicate that estrogen receptor expressed in E. coli retained characteristics of the native protein found in human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1513710592,"Scopadulcic acid B (SA-B), a novel diterpenoid, is a main ingredient of the Paraguayan traditional medicinal herb Typycha kuratu (Scoparia dulcis L.). SA-B and its debenzoyl derivative, diacetyl scopadol (DAS), specifically inhibit ATP hydrolysis of gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase. Both compounds inhibit the K(+)-dependent dephosphorylation step of the enzyme without any effect on the phosphorylation step. SA-B is a mixed-type inhibitor with respect to the activating cation, K+. SA-B lowers the affinity of H+,K(+)-ATPase to K+ and decreases the maximal velocity of ATP hydrolysis, whereas DAS is an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to K+. Furthermore, the effects of SA-B and DAS on conformational states of the ATPase were studied by measuring the changes in the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled enzyme. The fluorescence study shows that SA-B primarily binds to the E2K form in the presence of Mg2+ and stabilizes the form and that DAS stabilizes the E2PK form. Therefore, the chemical modification of SA-B, debenzoylation, induced the changes in the pattern of inhibition of H+,K(+)-ATPase. Furthermore, the inhibition mechanisms of SA-B and DAS were different from those of omeprazole, which is an irreversible inhibitor, and SCH 28080, which is a reversible, competitive inhibitor with respect to K+. DAS also inhibited the K(+)-dependent p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity, and the inhibition was competitive with respect to K+, indicating that the K(+)-dependent p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity does not represent the partial reaction step of H+,K(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1541439044,"We investigated the effects of superoxide anion on the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in human cultured myometrial cells using a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, indo-1, and a digital imaging fluorescence microscopic system. Hypoxanthine (HX) plus xanthine oxidase induced a rise in [Ca2+]i in a manner dose-dependent on xanthine oxidase. The increase in [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]ex) was 10% of that in the presence of [Ca2+]ex. Nifedipine, which blocks voltage-sensitive calcium channels, also reduced the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by HX-xanthine oxidase. Superoxide dismutase or superoxide dismutase plus catalase, which metabolizes superoxide anion, inhibited the effect of HX-xanthine oxidase on [Ca2+]i. The desensitization of the effect of superoxide anion on [Ca2+]i was investigated by pulsatile administration of HX and xanthine oxidase. Desensitization was observed on pulsatile administration of HX-xanthine oxidase at 2-min intervals. These data suggest that superoxide production may participate in uterine contraction via [Ca2+]i increase."

Methyl radicals were identified by spin-trapping experiments with alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butyl nitrone and tert-nitrosobutane. The methylated guanine products were identified in the neutral hydrolysates of treated DNA by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and spiking with authentic samples. The structure of 8-methylguanine, a product not previously reported in enzymatic systems, was confirmed by HPLC chromatography, UV absorbance, and mass spectrometry. The formation of 8-methylguanine suggests a possible role for carbon-centered radicals as DNA-alkylating agents."

https://openalex.org/W1580560855,"Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of the c-jun proto-oncogene is induced by phorbol esters and other agents that activate protein kinase C. The present work has examined the involvement of cAMP-dependent signaling mechanisms in the regulation of c-jun gene expression. Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in untreated HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment of these cells with 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate was associated with increases in c-jun expression that were maximal at 3 h and then declined to pretreatment levels. Similar findings were obtained with N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, but not with 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. c-jun transcripts were also increased with agents, such as prostaglandin E2 and forskolin, that increase intracellular cAMP levels. The effects of these agents on c-jun expression were associated with activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Moreover, inhibition of this kinase activity with the isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative H8 was associated with a block in the induction of c-jun expression by cAMP. Nuclear run-on analysis further demonstrated that while c-jun transcription is a low levels in untreated HL-60 cells, treatment with cAMP analogs is associated with an increase in the transcriptional rate of this gene. Taken together, these findings suggested that, in addition to activation of protein kinase C, stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity is also involved in the transcriptional induction of c-jun gene expression. The present results similarly demonstrate that c-fos gene transcription is induced in HL-60 cells through a mechanism involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Since heterodimers of the Jun and Fos proteins have been shown to bind to the phorbol ester-responsive element (AP-1-binding site), the present findings indicate that cAMP-induced signaling events may also regulate gene transcription through formation of Fos/Jun heterodimers and that interaction between phorbol ester- and cAMP-dependent pathways could occur through induction of the c-jun gene in these cells."

https://openalex.org/W1504897258,"The major 40 S ribosomal protein S6 phosphatase in Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts is a type 1 enzyme (Olivier, A. R., Ballou, L. M., and Thomas, G. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 4720-4724). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide containing the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of the catalytic subunit of phosphatase 1 (PP-1C). Results from Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation show that the peptide antiserum specifically recognizes PP-1C in cell extracts. Anion-exchange chromatography of cell extracts and Western blot analysis revealed three peaks of PP-1C termed A, B, and C. Peaks A and C are associated with the major type 1 S6 phosphatase activities, but peak B exhibits little activity. The phosphatase in peak A (Mr 39,000) appears to represent the free catalytic subunit, whereas the enzymes in peaks B and C display sizes of 68,000-140,000. Peak B contains two additional proteins of Mr 26,000 and 48,000 that co-immunoprecipitate with PP-1C, while peak C has a single additional protein of Mr 100,000. Fifteen min after serum withdrawal there is a 2-fold stimulation of S6 phosphatase activity in peak A that can be accounted for by an increase in the amount of PP-1C. The amount of PP-1C in the inactive peak B fraction also increases during this time and this increase is associated with changes in the phosphorylation state of the Mr 26,000 and 48,000 proteins. The results are discussed in relation to regulatory mechanisms which are thought to modulate the activity of type 1 phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1497021428,"N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and leukotriene B4 stimulate human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to translocate protein kinase C from the cytosol to plasmalemma as judged by their abilities to increase PMN binding of and receptor numbers for [3H]phorbol dibutyrate [( 3H]PDB) (O'Flaherty, J.T., Jacobson, D.P., Redman, J.F., and Rossi, A.G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9146-9152). Platelet-activating factor (PAF) had these same effects. Moreover, two potent PAF analogs (but not an inactive analog) increased [3H]PDB binding; a PAF antagonist blocked responses to PAF without altering those to fMLP; and PMN treated with PAF became desensitized to PAF while retaining sensitivity to fMLP. Indeed, PMN incubated with 1-100 nM PAF for 5-40 min had markedly enhanced [3H]PDB binding responses to fMLP. PAF thus acted through its receptors to stimulate and prime protein kinase C translocation. Its effects, however, did not necessarily proceed by a standard mechanism: Ca2(+)-depleted PMN failed to raise Fura-2-monitored cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations [( Ca2+]i), yet increased [3H]PDB binding and receptor numbers almost normally after PAF challenge. PAF also primed Ca2(+)-depleted PMN to fMLP. Nevertheless, [3H]PDB binding responses to PAF were blocked in PMN loaded with Ca2+ chelators, viz. Quin 2, Fura-2, or 5,5'-dimethyl-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). Exogenous Ca2+ reversed Quin 2 inhibition, and a weak chelator 4,4'-difluoro-BAPTA, lacked inhibitory actions. The chelators similarly influenced fMLP and leukotriene B4. Thus, PMN can by-pass [Ca2+]i to translocate protein kinase C. They may achieve this using a regulatable pool of Ca2+ that evades conventional [Ca2+]i monitors or a signal that needs cell Ca2+ to form and/or act. This signal may mediate function in Ca2(+)-depleted cells, the actions of [Ca2+]i-independent stimuli, cell priming, and protein kinase C movements that otherwise seem [Ca2+]i-induced."
https://openalex.org/W1574797055,"Extracellular ATP, N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (PIA) and other purinergic agonists inhibited atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-induced cGMP accumulation in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. These agonists were functionally classified into three groups. Group 1 agonists represented by ATP inhibited the ANP action in association with phospholipase C activation in a partially islet-activating protein (IAP, pertussis toxin)-sensitive manner. Group 2 including GTP and 8-bromoadenosine 5'-triphosphate acted similarly to Group 1 except for total insensitivity of the former to IAP. The IAP-insensitive portion of Group 1 actions and the actions of Group 2 as well as of A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore which mimicked the Group 2 agonist actions, were almost completely inhibited by phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as M & B 22948 (2-O-propoxyphenyl-8-azapurin-6-one) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Group 3 including PIA and AMP did not affect phospholipase C, but inhibited the ANP performance in an IAP-sensitive fashion. This action of Group 3 and the IAP-sensitive portion of Group 1 actions were insensitive to the phosphodiesterase inhibitors. We conclude that ATP and other Group 1 agonists attenuated the ANP-induced cGMP accumulation by at least two mechanisms: 1) stimulation of cGMP hydrolysis via a phospholipase C-Ca2(+)-phosphodiesterase system and 2) inhibition of cGMP generation, probably by an IAP-sensitive G-protein-mediated inactivation of the ANP-receptor-coupled guanylate cyclase. Group 2 agonists stimulate only the first mechanisms, whereas Group 3 agonists prefer the second one."

https://openalex.org/W1671553882,"A conjugate of the high affinity benzodiazepine receptor ligand Ro 15-1788 and the fluorescent 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD) moiety was synthesized. This novel compound (BD 623) exhibited excitation and emission maxima at 486 and 542 nm, respectively, and possessed fluorescent properties that are dependent upon the polarity of its environment. BD 623 bound reversibly to benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system with an apparent affinity (K(i) 5.7 nM) comparable to the parent imidazobenzodiazepine (K(d) 2.8 nM). Addition of BD 623 to a suspension of brain membranes resulted in a time-dependent quenching of its fluorescence. Fluorescence quenching of this compound was readily reversed by specific benzodiazepine receptor ligands but not by a variety of other substances. Moreover, inactivation of benzodiazepine receptors by photoaffinity labeling with Ro 15-4513 resulted in a reduction in the fluorescence quenching of BD 623 consistent with the reduction in density of benzodiazepine receptors measured using a radioreceptor assay. Monitoring of fluorescence/dequenching of BD 623 in real time permitted a quantitative characterization of the ligand-receptor interaction, with both the K(d) of BD 623 (13.9 nM) and K(i) of Ro 15-1788 (5.7 nM) comparable with the estimates obtained using radioreceptor techniques. These results indicate that application of fluorescence quenching techniques with BD 623 could prove a useful adjunct for the study of benzodiazepine receptors. BD 623 may serve as a prototype for the development of other fluorescent ligands to study ligand-receptor interactions."
