The small-world phenomenon — the principle that most of us are linked by short chains of acquaintances — was first investigated as a question in sociology1,2 and is a feature of a range of networks arising in nature and technology3,4,5. Experimental study of the phenomenon1 revealed that it has two fundamental components: first, such short chains are ubiquitous, and second, individuals operating with purely local information are very adept at finding these chains. The first issue has been analysed2,3,4, and here I investigate the second by modelling how individuals can find short chains in a large social network."

https://openalex.org/W1642181682,"Calcium-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter release are fundamental signalling steps in the central nervous system. It is generally assumed that fast transmitter release is triggered by elevations in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) to at least 100 microM near the sites of vesicle fusion. For synapses in the central nervous system, however, there are no experimental estimates of this local [Ca2+]i signal. Here we show, by using calcium ion uncaging in the large synaptic terminals of the calyx of Held, that step-like elevations to only 10 microM [Ca2+]i induce fast transmitter release, which depletes around 80% of a pool of available vesicles in less than 3 ms. Kinetic analysis of transmitter release rates after [Ca2+]i steps revealed the rate constants for calcium binding and vesicle fusion. These show that transient (around 0.5 ms) local elevations of [Ca2+]i to peak values as low as 25 microM can account for transmitter release during single presynaptic action potentials. The calcium sensors for vesicle fusion are far from saturation at normal release probability. This non-saturation, and the high intracellular calcium cooperativity in triggering vesicle fusion, make fast synaptic transmission very sensitive to modulation by changes in local [Ca2+]i."

https://openalex.org/W1559316229,"Colloidal suspensions that form periodic self-assembling structures on sub-micrometre scales are of potential technological interest; for example, three-dimensional arrangements of spheres in colloidal crystals1 might serve as photonic materials2, intended to manipulate light. Colloidal particles with non-spherical shapes (such as rods and plates) are of particular interest because of their ability to form liquid crystals. Nematic liquid crystals possess orientational order; smectic and columnar liquid crystals additionally exhibit positional order (in one or two dimensions respectively). However, such positional ordering3,4 may be inhibited in polydisperse colloidal suspensions. Here we describe a suspension of plate-like colloids that shows isotropic, nematic and columnar phases on increasing the particle concentration. We find that the columnar two-dimensional crystal persists for a polydispersity of up to 25%, with a cross-over to smectic-like ordering at very high particle concentrations. Our results imply that liquid crystalline order in synthetic mesoscopic materials may be easier to achieve than previously thought."

Analysis of the mouse TERT promoter revealed a potential NF-κB binding site 350 base pairs upstream from the translational start site. An oligonucleotide from this region of the TERT promoter bound to proteins in a nuclear extract prepared from a mouse hepatoma cell line. These proteins were identified as NF-κB by a number of criteria: 1) the protein complex formed on the TERT oligonucleotide had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that formed on an NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide; 2) protein binding to this site was enhanced by NF-κB activators tumor necrosis factor-α, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and interleukin-1β; and 3) the complex was specific and could be supershifted with antibodies against the p50 or p65 NF-κB subunits. The NF-κB binding site from the mouse TERT promoter activated transcription when fused to a basal SV40 promoter and enhanced the activity of the native TERT promoter in mouse hepatoma cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Transcriptional activation by the TERT NF-κB site could also be enhanced by co-transfection with an NF-κB1 expression vector.

Telomeres are synthesized by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that is capable of de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA. Thus far, three major components of the telomerase complex have been identified. The telomerase RNA component (TR)1 provides the template for telomere repeat synthesis, the telomerase-associated protein (TP1) binds to telomerase RNA and coordinates assembly of the telomerase holoenzyme (3Nakayama J. Saito M. Nakamura H. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F. Cell. 1997; 88: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and the catalytic subunit of telomerase, TERT, provides the reverse transcriptase activity.Expression studies show that TR is present in most cells and tissues, whereas TERT expression is more variable (4Ulaner G.A.

Analysis of the human and mouse TERT promoters reveals that they are regulated by a number of inducible transcription factors, including c-Myc and Sp1 (11Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H.

These transcription factors are likely to contribute to the observed instances of TERT gene activation.Although both human and mouse TERT gene expression is regulated in somatic cells, the contribution of this activated expression to organism survival and health is not clear. Mice strains deficient for telomerase activity are viable without any noticeable phenotype through four generations (17Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A.

Blasco M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2950-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It is not until the fifth and sixth generations that telomerase-deficient mice (TR−/−) begin to show signs of premature aging (19Rudolph K.L. Chang S. Lee H.W. Blasco M. Gottlieb G.J. Greider C. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 701-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The lag in the development of a phenotype in telomerase-deficient mice corresponds with the progressive shortening of the long mouse telomere. Because the mouse telomere can be maintained at a functionally adequate length through four generations in the absence of any telomerase activity, it is not clear why some somatic cells in the mouse activate expression of the TERT subunit. It is possible that laboratory conditions do not reveal subtle selective advantages for telomerase activation in somatic cells. Here, we provide evidence that the mouse TERT promoter is regulated by the widely expressed and highly inducible NF-κB transcription factor (20Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar,21Grilli M. Chiu J.J. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Regulation of the TERT promoter by a highly inducible transcription factor like NF-κB suggests that induction of TERT expression may play an important physiological role.DISCUSSIONA number of instances have been described in which expression of the TERT subunit of telomerase is activated (4Ulaner G.A. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Giudice L.C. Hoffman A.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4168-4172PubMed Google Scholar, 8Greenberg R.A. Allsopp R.C. Chin L. Morin G.B. DePinho R.A.

Sakaguchi N. Blood. 1997; 89: 1299-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TERT expression is often found to be up-regulated when cells are proliferating and down-regulated during cell differentiation. Two inducible transcription factors have been identified that bind the human and mouse TERT promoters, Sp-1 and c-Myc/Mad (11Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 14Greenberg R.A. O'Hagan R.C. Deng H. Xiao Q. Hann S.R. Adams R.R. Lichtsteiner S. Chin L. Morin G.B. DePinho R.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are likely to contribute to the activation of TERT expression. However, many of the stimuli found to activate TERT expression in both human and mouse cells are documented to activate the transcription factor NF-κB (including PMA and UV radiation) (8Greenberg R.A. Allsopp R.C. Chin L. Morin G.B. DePinho R.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 24Ueda M. Ouhtit A. Bito T. Nakazawa K. Lubbe J. Ichihashi M. Yamasaki H.

Analysis of the TERT promoter region revealed a functional NF-κB site on the mouse TERT promoter. Although we were unable to identify an NF-κB site on the proximal human TERT promoter, it remains possible that one exists as part of an enhancer either further upstream or downstream of the transcription start site. Alternatively, human cells may employ slightly different mechanisms to coordinate NF-κB activation and TERT expression; for example, NF-κB activation of Myc expression may lead to subsequent increases in TERT expression (13Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 14Greenberg R.A. O'Hagan R.C. Deng H. Xiao Q. Hann S.R. Adams R.R. Lichtsteiner S.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 81-86PubMed Google Scholar).The ability to generate specific gene knockouts in the mouse makes this animal an exceptional model for studying the biological role of telomerase. Moreover, the mouse has organ systems similar to those found in humans. Telomerase expression in the mouse is also activated under circumstances that activate the human telomerase. It is not clear, however, what benefit arises from activating TERT expression in mouse somatic cells, because telomerase activity can be eliminated from the mouse genetically without any observed effect on the animal for four to five generations (17Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 18Herrera E. Samper E. Martin-Caballero J.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our finding that the TERT promoter is regulated by NF-κB argues that TERT activation in somatic cells provides an advantage to the mouse because NF-κB is found in most cell types and can be activated by an impressive array of stimuli, ranging from cytokines and growth factors to stress-inducing agents such as oxidants and UV radiation (20Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 21Grilli M. Chiu J.J. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Perhaps the conditions that reveal the benefit of telomerase expression in somatic cells have not been identified. TERT activation may be beneficial under conditions of chronic infection, injury, and/or immune and inflammatory responses. Whether or not the NF-κB activation of TERT expression plays an important role in the physiology of the mouse remains an open and interesting question. This question is of particular significance given the importance of the mouse as an experimental model. Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes with a specialized structure that stabilizes chromosomes and prevents their fusion during mitosis (1Cerni C. Mutat.

Moreover, the mouse has organ systems similar to those found in humans. Telomerase expression in the mouse is also activated under circumstances that activate the human telomerase. It is not clear, however, what benefit arises from activating TERT expression in mouse somatic cells, because telomerase activity can be eliminated from the mouse genetically without any observed effect on the animal for four to five generations (17Blasco M.A. Lee H.W.

Our finding that the TERT promoter is regulated by NF-κB argues that TERT activation in somatic cells provides an advantage to the mouse because NF-κB is found in most cell types and can be activated by an impressive array of stimuli, ranging from cytokines and growth factors to stress-inducing agents such as oxidants and UV radiation (20Ghosh S.

TERT activation may be beneficial under conditions of chronic infection, injury, and/or immune and inflammatory responses. Whether or not the NF-κB activation of TERT expression plays an important role in the physiology of the mouse remains an open and interesting question. This question is of particular significance given the importance of the mouse as an experimental model. A number of instances have been described in which expression of the TERT subunit of telomerase is activated (4Ulaner G.A. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Giudice L.C. Hoffman A.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4168-4172PubMed Google Scholar, 8Greenberg R.A. Allsopp R.C. Chin L. Morin G.B. DePinho R.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 9Holt S.E.

TERT expression is often found to be up-regulated when cells are proliferating and down-regulated during cell differentiation. Two inducible transcription factors have been identified that bind the human and mouse TERT promoters, Sp-1 and c-Myc/Mad (11Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are likely to contribute to the activation of TERT expression. However, many of the stimuli found to activate TERT expression in both human and mouse cells are documented to activate the transcription factor NF-κB (including PMA and UV radiation) (8Greenberg R.A.

Analysis of the TERT promoter region revealed a functional NF-κB site on the mouse TERT promoter. Although we were unable to identify an NF-κB site on the proximal human TERT promoter, it remains possible that one exists as part of an enhancer either further upstream or downstream of the transcription start site. Alternatively, human cells may employ slightly different mechanisms to coordinate NF-κB activation and TERT expression; for example, NF-κB activation of Myc expression may lead to subsequent increases in TERT expression (13Wang J.

Using superfused synaptosomes, we have studied the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, measured as the amount of release triggered by hypertonic sucrose. We show that activation of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors by dihydroxyphenylglycine and stimulation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters enhance the readily releasable pool of glutamate. Although the molecular nature of the readily releasable pool is unknown, one possibility is that during its generation, SNARE proteins form full core complexes, and that core complex formation occurs prior to neurotransmitter release. To test this possibility, we employedN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an inhibitor of the ATPaseN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor that dissociates core complexes, to study the relation of the readily releasable pool to core complex assembly in synaptosomes. NEM induced a dose-dependent increase in the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters but by itself did not trigger release. Direct measurements of core complexes confirmed that NEM caused an increase in the levels of SNARE core complexes under these conditions.

Most synapses contain a pool of docked vesicles at the active zone that can be stimulated for rapid release; this pool is referred to as the readily releasable pool (1Stevens C.F. Tsujimoto T. Proc.

Hypertonic solutions, such as 0.5 m sucrose, trigger synaptic vesicle exocytosis from presynaptic nerve terminals by an unknown, Ca2+-independent mechanism (7Fatt P. Katz B. J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 109-128PubMed Google Scholar). Hypertonic sucrose and strong depolarizations stimulate release of the same vesicle pool that is thought to represent the readily releasable pool (8Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F.

A. 1998; 95: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite an extensive electrophysiological characterization, however, little is known about the biochemical nature of the readily releasable pool. Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles involves the assembly of core complexes from SNARE proteins. Core complexes are formed by the synaptic vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin-vesicle-associated membrane protein and the plasma membrane SNARE proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 (15Söllner T. Bennet M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). The synaptic core complex is composed of a four-helix bundle that is very stable and resistant to SDS denaturation (16, 17; reviewed in Refs. 18Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholarand 19Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Assembled core complexes are dissociated by a specific ATPase,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF),1 which is inhibited by NEM (15Söllner T. Bennet M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). The first clue to the function of the core complex came from the discovery that in presynaptic nerve terminals, SNAREs are the targets for botulinum and tetanus toxins (for reviews, see Refs. 20Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. Niemann H. Jahn R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar and21Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1995; 28: 423-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These toxins selectively inhibit synaptic vesicle fusion but do not interfere with the attachment of synaptic vesicles to the active zone. The toxins inhibit fusion independent of whether it is triggered physiologically by Ca2+ or artificially by hypertonic sucrose, suggesting a central function for SNAREs in fusion, although their precise role has remained elusive. In the current study, we have examined the role of SNARE core complexes in the regulation of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. For this purpose we used synaptosomes, a biochemical system that allows exploring multiple neurotransmitters and correlating release with the biochemical properties of the presynaptic terminal (9Lonart G. Janz R. Johnson K.M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Whittaker V.P. Lajtha A. Handbook of Neurochemistry. 2. Plenum Press, New York1969: 327-364Google Scholar). Our results reveal that PKC up-regulates the readily releasable pool of glutamate and norepinephrine, but not of GABA. A similar up-regulation of the readily releasable pool can be achieved non-physiologically by NEM, which increases core complex abundance and bypasses the PKC step, and also acts on GABAergic synapses. The data uncover distinct pathways in the regulation of release for different neurotransmitters and suggest that as a general mechanism, the readily releasable pool corresponds to vesicles with assembled core complexes. Synaptosomes were prepared by differential centrifugation from the rat hippocampal CA3 region (23Hajos F. Wilkin G. Wilson J. Balazs R. J.

Final pellets were resuspended on ice in 10 volumes of aerated (95% O2, 5% CO2) ice-cold KBH buffer, pH 7.4, composed of the following (in mm): NaCl, 118; KCl, 3.5; CaCl2, 1.25; MgSO4, 1.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; NaCO3, 25; HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10; and d-glucose, 11.5. Ca2+-free KBH buffer contained 0.1 mm EGTA instead of 1.25 mm CaCl2. To label the releasable neurotransmitter pool, synaptosomes were incubated for 5 min at 33 °C in KBH buffer with 0.2 μm3H-glutamate (24 Ci/mmol specific activity), 0.05 μm3H-GABA (89 Ci/mmol), or 0.4 μm3H-norepinephrine (12 Ci/mmol) together with 10 μm pargyline and 0.6 mm ascorbic acid. Labeled synaptosomes were trapped on a glass fiber filter (GF/B) in a superfusion chamber and superfused at 33 °C and 0.8 ml/min with aerated (95% O2/5% CO2) KBH buffer. To wash the synaptosomes and to apply various pharmacological agents, synaptosomes were superfused for at least 12 min with regular or Ca2+-free KBH buffer prior to stimulation. For DHPG treatments, synaptosomes were first superfused with Ca2+-free KBH without additions for 4 min, then with 30 μm DHPG or vehicle (0.1% distilled water) for 4 min, and finally with 30 μm DHPG or vehicle in Ca2+-containing KBH buffer for 4 min. To test the effects of phorbol esters, synaptosomes were superfused with Ca2+-free KBH buffer for 8 min, followed by 4 min with Ca2+-free KBH buffer containing 0.01–1.0 μmphorbol esters with or without staurosporine or bisindolylmaleimide during the entire 12-min initial superfusion period as indicated. At the end of the prestimulation period, two 1-min fractions were collected to determine the basal neurotransmitter efflux, and secretion was triggered by rapid switching of the superfusion lines for 30 s to either 25 mm KCl in Ca2+-containing KBH buffer or 0.5 m sucrose in Ca2+-free KBH buffer (9Lonart G. Janz R. Johnson K.M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For NEM treatments, synaptosomes were first superfused for 12 min with Ca2+-free KBH buffer without additions, then for 5 min with Ca2+-free KBH buffer with 10–100 μm NEM or vehicle (0,01–0.1% Me2SO), then for 2 min with Ca2+-free KBH buffer again without additions, and finally for 30 s with hypertonic sucrose. The superfusate was collected continuously throughout the experiment, and the3H-neurotransmitter content of individual fractions (0.8 ml) and of the synaptosomes was determined by scintillation counting at the end. 3H-neurotransmitter secretion was determined as fractional release rate (the fraction of transmitter secreted at any given time divided by the amount of transmitter remaining in the synaptosomes at that particular time). Total evoked3H-transmitter secretion was calculated from the area under the peak and compared with basal neurotransmitter secretion; statistical significance was evaluated with the Student's ttest. Fresh synaptosomes were incubated for 5 min at 35 °C in aerated KBH buffer, followed by a 10-min incubation in KBH buffer with NEM. Afterward, synaptosomes were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immediately analyzed by SDS-PAGE with or without boiling, followed by immunoblotting using mono- and polyclonal antibodies to SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin (9Lonart G. Janz R. Johnson K.M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To analyze the core complex by cross-linking, DSP was selected from 8 screened cross-linking agents, because it resulted in the clearest cross-linking of the core complex in synaptosomes. Synaptosomes were treated as above except that 0.3–1.0 mmDSP were added directly to intact synaptosomes during the last 5 min of incubation. Cross-linking was quenched by adding 0.2 volumes of 1.5m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 6% SDS. Samples were boiled for 5 min prior to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal syntaxin (I378) or SNAP-25 antibodies (I733) as described (25Lonart G. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 634-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE without reducing agents and by immunoblotting. Immunoblots were reacted with 125I-labeled secondary antibodies, and the 125I signal was quantified in a phosphoimager using a rectangle drawn across the entire width of the gel at the level of the core complex and of the monomer. An automatic integration method was then used to calculate the relative intensity of each band for a given lane to exclude observer bias. To ensure that the 80-kDa band observed corresponds to cross-linked core complex, samples were run in the presence of reducing agents (100 mmdithiothreitol), which cleave the cross-linker DSP and abolished the core complex band. To ensure linearity of the immunoblotting signal, we confirmed that amounts of 3 to 30 μg of protein per lane resulted in linear signals. In synaptosomes, activation of type I presynaptic glutamate receptors has been reported to up-regulate glutamate release in a PKC-dependent manner by enhancing Ca2+ influx during KCl depolarization (27Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sanchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1951-1958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Rodriguez-Moreno A. Sistiago A. Lerma J. Sanchez-Prieto J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1477-1486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, in cultured hippocampal neurons activation of PKC increases release by augmenting the readily releasable pool of glutamate in a process that does not involve Ca2+ influx (13Stevens C.F. Sullivan J.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 885-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we investigated the effect of DHPG, an agonist for type I metabotropic glutamate receptors, on glutamate release from synaptosomes. Release was triggered in parallel either by KCl depolarization in the presence of Ca2+ or by hypertonic sucrose in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig.1). DHPG had no significant effect on basal glutamate efflux but enhanced subsequent glutamate exocytosis evoked either by KCl depolarization or by hypertonic sucrose. The effect was not smaller for Ca2+-independent sucrose-evoked release than for Ca2+-dependent KCl-evoked release, suggesting that changes in Ca2+-channel properties are not a major factor in the potentiation of release and that activation of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors enhances the pool of readily releasable synaptic vesicles. Type I metabotropic glutamate receptors stimulate phospholipase C activity, which in turn activates PKC via production of diacylglycerol. Therefore we investigated whether PKC is involved in the up-regulation of the readily releasable pool observed upon DHPG treatment by directly stimulating PKC in synaptosomes with the phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) prior to triggering secretion with hypertonic sucrose. In these experiments, all manipulations (phorbol ester treatments, washes, and stimulation of release by hypertonic sucrose) were performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ to exclude the possibility that phorbol esters may cause Ca2+influx and thereby exert an indirect effect. PDBu by itself did not change basal glutamate efflux (Fig.2, A and B). PDBu treatment did, however, result in a strong enhancement of sucrose-triggered release; the enhancement was inhibited by the specific PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (29Bit R.A. Davis P.D. Elliott L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Keech E. Kumar H. Lawton G. Maw A. Nixon J.S. Vesey D.R. Wadsworth J. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Like PDBu, bisindolylamide had no effect on baseline glutamate release. An enhancement of secretion similar to that obtained with PDBu was also observed with the related phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 μm), which increased sucrose-evoked secretion by 232 ± 34% (n = 3; data not shown). The potentiation of the readily releasable pool by PDBu was dose-dependent and could not be obtained with an inactive isomer (α-PDBu) (Fig. 2 C). When we tested whether PDBu generally increased release from all synapses, we observed a strong enhancement of the secretion of another neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, whereas PDBu had no effect on the secretion of GABA (Fig. 3). The lack of effect on GABA release and the similar pharmacological findings in electrophysiological recordings (13Stevens C.F. Sullivan J.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 885-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) indicate that the effects of PDBu are specific and suggest differences in the molecular basis of the regulation of inhibitory and excitatory synapses. This result also provides independent support for the validity of the synaptosomal system in measuring the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. What is the mechanism by which PKC stimulates the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles? During synaptic vesicles exocytosis, the vesicular SNARE synaptobrevin-vesicle-associated membrane protein assembles into core complexes with the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25 (15Söllner T. Bennet M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). The core complexes are then dissociated again, either before or after fusion, by the ATPase NSF, which can be inhibited with the nonspecific sulfhydryl agent NEM. It is unknown precisely when SNARE core complex assembly occurs in exocytosis and whether it irreversibly leads to fusion. One possibility is that the readily releasable pool corresponds to a partially fused vesicle population that may have already fully assembled SNARE core complexes (18Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). If this was correct, enhancing the abundance of assembled core complexes should increase the size of the readily releasable pool. To test this hypothesis, we treated synaptosomes with NEM at several concentrations, washed the synaptosomes, and measured the effect of NEM treatment on the size of the readily releasable pool monitored as the amount of release evoked by hypertonic sucrose (Fig.4). As in the phorbol-ester experiments, all manipulations were performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ to exclude confounding effects of artifactual Ca2+ influx. Low concentrations of NEM had no acute effect on neurotransmitter efflux from the superfused synaptosomes, and only high NEM concentrations (100 μm) caused leakage, presumably because NEM is cytotoxic at this concentration. In the washing period after NEM application, baseline release was normal for all samples. However, when we subsequently triggered release with hypertonic sucrose, we observed a major enhancement of release as a function of NEM (Fig. 4). This increase was observed for all three neurotransmitters tested (glutamate, GABA, and norepinephrine) in contrast to phorbol esters, which were inactive for GABA (Fig. 3). One possible cause for the NEM-dependent increase in the readily releasable pool is that in resting nerve terminals, core complexes assemble and dissociate in a dynamic equilibrium without release of neurotransmitters. NEM would then disrupt this equilibrium by inhibiting core complex disassembly and thereby force vesicles into a state of assembled core complexes that increase the readily releasable pool of vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we studied the abundance of core complexes in synaptosomes as a function of NEM treatment. Synaptosomes were exposed to NEM for 10 min, with a chemical cross-linking agent (DSP) present during the last 5 min of treatment. The reaction was then stopped by addition of 6% SDS in 1.5m Tris-HCl, and the samples were boiled and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies to syntaxin (I378) or SNAP-25 (I733). Cross-linked core complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies, 125I-labeled secondary antibodies, and phosphoimager quantification. A dose-dependent increase in the signal of the core complex at 80 kDa was observed (Fig.5 A). Control experiments in which the samples were reduced prior to SDS-PAGE to cleave the cross-linker revealed that the 80-kDa band corresponds to a chemically cross-linked protein complex, and analysis of the cut-out 80-kDa band confirmed that it contains all three SNAREs (Ref. 9Lonart G. Janz R. Johnson K.M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and data not shown). Quantitation of the core complex signal confirmed that treatment of synaptosomes with NEM (10–100 μm) increased the steady-state abundance of core complexes in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 B) that approximately corresponded to the increase in the readily releasable pool observed under the same conditions (Fig. 4). Using synaptosomes, we have examined the relation between neurotransmitter release and the assembly of core complexes from synaptic SNARE proteins. We showed that treatments of synaptosomes with NEM or phorbol esters do not by themselves trigger neurotransmitter release but increase the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles available for subsequent release. This effect is likely to be physiologically important, because a similar increase in the readily releasable pool can be obtained upon stimulation of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. The most surprising result of our study, however, was the enhancement of the readily releasable pool by NEM, an inhibitor of the ATPase NSF. Although NEM is a rather toxic sulfhydryl reagent, it did not damage synaptosomes at low doses, for example by causing transmitter leakage or unresponsiveness to stimulation. Instead, low doses of NEM increased sucrose-evoked release of all neurotransmitters tested (glutamate, norepinephrine, and GABA). Furthermore, direct measurements showed that NEM increased the abundance of SNARE core complexes in synaptosomes. These data provide evidence that the assembly of SNARE complexes at the synapse is dynamic and regulates the amount of vesicles to undergo exocytosis. Based on this observation, we suggest as a working hypothesis that core complexes are assembled from SNAREs prior to fusion pore opening and that the degree of assembly determines the size of the readily releasable pool (see model in Fig.6). One possible mechanism that may underlie this process is that core complex assembly drives hemifusion as the physical correlate of the functionally defined “prefusion” reaction (18Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Our findings strongly agree with recent results obtained with anin vitro fusion system using yeast vacuoles (30Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that SNARE core complexes, although required for fusion, can be disassembled before a full fusion pore is formed. In chromaffin cells the use of a SNAP-25 antibody also revealed that core complex formation and fusion are temporarily separate events (31Xu T. Rammer B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, results from other systems appear to be more difficult to reconcile with our hypothesis. For example, fusion in permeabilized neuroendocrine cells is inhibited by botulinum and tetanus toxins at a late stage (32Banerjee A. Kowalchyk J.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20227-20230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 33Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.-C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Because the assembled core complex is resistant to toxin cleavage (16Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Blasi T. Link E. Cornille F. Roques B. Fykse E.M. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 17Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar), this result could be interpreted to mean that core complex assembly occurs very late in fusion. However, in neuroendocrine cells only a small percentage of vesicles are prefused; these prefused vesicles would be largely invisible in the biochemical assays used. Because fusion is fast, assembly of core complexes and Ca2+triggering of fusion could easily occur during the time of the biochemical assay. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the core complex, as observed in our NEM experiments, may allow cleavage even after initial core complexes have formed. Finally, the requirement of Ca2+ for core complex formation in permeabilized neuroendocrine cells (33Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.-C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) could be due to the known role of Ca2+ in the mobilization of secretory vesicles from the cytoskeleton (34Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaro J.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Robinson L.J. Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our findings support the idea that core complex assembly represents an important point of regulation in neurotransmitter secretion and that presynaptic plasticity can operate at the step of prefusion by regulating the size of the readily releasable pool. The effects of the activation of type I presynaptic glutamate receptors on the readily releasable pool suggest a positive feedback loop; secreted glutamate activates presynaptic receptors, which then increase the recruitment of vesicles for further exocytosis. Other presynaptic receptors, such as type III metabotropic glutamate receptors, may have opposing physiological effects (for example see Refs. 36Scanziani M. Gahwiler B.H. Charpak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12004-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 37Turner J.P. Salt T.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 481-491Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The finding that PKC inhibitors abolish the increase in the readily releasable pool induced by phorbol esters indicates that PKC may be a regulatory pathway for the readily releasable pool size. Although the molecular target of PKC is currently unknown, it is possible that PKC modulates NSF activity and thereby regulates core complex assembly or that phosphorylation of munc18 is involved (38Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kotani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2000; 12: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Independent of what the molecular target for PKC is, our results suggest that a hierarchy of regulatory events operating at distinct steps (prefusion and Ca2+-triggered fusion pore opening) modulate synaptic exocytosis in a manner that contributes to the extraordinary precision of synaptic transmission.

Full-Text PDF Open Access cyclin-dependent kinase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor vascular smooth muscle platelet-derived growth factor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate The cdks1 are a well conserved family of serine/threonine protein kinases (one in yeast and at least 8 in animals) which function in mitogenic signaling through their activation by the cyclins. This in turn leads to a cascade of events whereby the mitogen-stimulated cyclin D-dependent kinases phosphorylate Rb, causing release of inhibition of the transcription factor family known as E2F, and allowing S-phase specific gene transcription and subsequent progression through the G1/S transition (reviewed in Ref. 1.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5132) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression is finely regulated by the interplay between the cdks and the CKIs. Since the Cip/Kip family of CKIs (p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2), which regulate activity of the cyclin·cdk complex, have been shown to negatively regulate the process of cyclin-mediated cell cycle progression through inhibition of the cdks, the net result of induction or overexpression of the CKIs (particularly those in the Cip/Kip family) generally is cell cycle inhibition and growth suppression in VSM and other cell types (2.Matsushita H.

Consistent with this, the CKIs are down-regulated in response to a variety of mitogens and overexpression of these molecules leads to growth arrest (7.Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J.

Recently, however, there has appeared data implicating the CKIs in positive effects on cyclin/cdk activation (11.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 12.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), yet fibroblasts from p21-null and p27-null mice did not show disturbances in cell cycle progression (14.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), and antisense inhibition of p21Waf1/Cip1 in A431 cells only resulted in prevention of cell cycle arrest (15.Ohtsubo M. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We now show, for the first time, that p21Waf1/Cip1 serves a permissive role in PDGF-mediated VSM cell proliferation, such that its presence is required for the mitogenic effect of this growth factor. Human recombinant PDGF-BB was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 and cyclin D1, goat polyclonal cdk 2 and cdk 4, and rabbit polyclonal cyclin E antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG was obtained from Bio-Rad. LipofectinTM was obtained from Life Technologies (Rockville, MD). Reagents for the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system and [3H]thymidine were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents, including mouse monoclonal α-actin antibody, were from Sigma. Cultures of both A10 and A7r5 rat aortic VSM cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville MD). Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells were kindly supplied by Martha O'Donnell (16.O'Donnell M.E. Owen N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6132-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All of the cell lines were maintained as described (17.Weiss R.H. Maga E.A. Ramirez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1521-C1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were used between passages 15 and 25. The cells were growth-arrested by placing them in serum-free quiescence medium, exposed to growth factors as indicated, and [3H]thymidine incorporation assessed as described previously (18.Weiss R.H. Nuccitelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5608-5613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell proliferation was assessed by counting of adherent cells on 4 representative fields under ×100 magnification in each of 3 wells per experimental condition. Phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). The p21Waf1/Cip1 antisense vector was designed around the start codon of rat p21Waf1/Cip1, with the sequence 5′-GACATCACCAGGATCGGACAT-3′. The sense p21Waf1/Cip1sequence is 5′-ATGTCCGATCCTGGTGATGTC-3′. The scrambled random sequence control oligodeoxynucleotide was 5′-TGGATCCGACATGTCAGA-3′. For the lipofection procedure, cells were grown to 90% confluence, the appropriate concentration of oligodeoxynucleotide was mixed with 6.6 μl of LipofectinTM per ml of Opti-MEM medium and was added to the cells for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed and serum-free medium (without oligodeoxynucleotide) was added overnight, the medium was changed in the morning and the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for the times indicated. Cells were grown to confluence in 6-cm culture dishes and serum deprived. After transfection and or treatment with appropriate agonist, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer and the supernatant was Western blotted as described (17.Weiss R.H. Maga E.A. Ramirez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1521-C1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data has demonstrated that the CKIs, which have long been classified (as the acronym indicates) as growth inhibitors, also function under some conditions as positive regulators of cyclin·cdk complexes. The available studies addressing the role of CKIs in VSM cells have demonstrated negative effects of p21Waf1/Cip1only on cell cycle progression. We employed antisense techniques to examine the dependence of cell growth on p21Waf1/Cip1 in our VSM cell lines. The oligodeoxynucleotides used were generated around the ATG start codon using GenBank sequences and were screened for lack of stable secondary structures or stable homodimer formation (OligoTech software, Oligos Etc.). We used three independent controls in these experiments: (i) “dummy” transfection with Lipofectin but no DNA; (ii) random sequence oligodeoxynucleotide transfection; and (iii) sense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide transfection. VSM cells were transfected with the appropriate oligodeoxynucleotide or control overnight in serum-free medium, and the next day the cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB and DNA synthesis and cell number were assessed. Significant inhibition of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis occurred when the cells were transfected with antisense p21Waf1/Cip1, but not with sense p21Waf1/Cip1, dummy transfection (Fig. 1 A), or random sequence control (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the observed growth inhibition was specific to the antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide, we performed dose/response analysis. There was inhibition of DNA synthesis with increasing concentration of antisense p21Waf1/Cip1oligodeoxynucleotide up to 200 nm, with no effect of sense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig. 1 C). To demonstrate that this effect was not specific to the A10 cell line, we demonstrated a similar effect in a bovine VSM cell line (Fig.1 D) and in the A7r5 rat VSM cell line (data not shown). Changes in cell number were shown to parallel the alterations in DNA synthesis (Fig. 2).Figure 2VSM cell proliferation is inhibited by antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide. A10 VSM cells were transfected as in Fig. 1 C. After 18 h of PDGF incubation, the cells were counted by examining representative fields at ×100 magnification. The average number of cells in 4 random fields in each well was determined. Cell numbers are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three wells per data point. ▩, random sequence; ▨, anti-p21.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish whether the oligodeoxynucleotides crossed the cell membrane and entered the nucleus in order to inhibit p21Waf1/Cip1 protein production, cells were transfected with a fluorescein-tagged p21Waf1/Cip1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (with the same sequence as the p21Waf1/Cip1 antisense) and were examined for transfection efficiency. Upon examination by fluorescence microscopy, these cells demonstrated 100% transfection efficiency (Fig.3), as has been reported for this technique (19.Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). We next asked whether antisense transfection with p21Waf1/Cip1 antisense oligos indeed decreases p21Waf1/Cip1 protein levels. We employed the fact that PMA is a potent inducer of p21Waf1/Cip1 (20.Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Huang T.S. Duyster J. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4793-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to examine p21Waf1/Cip1 levels after antisense transfection. Since p21Waf1/Cip1 protein levels were induced in VSM cells between 2 and 6 h after PMA stimulation (Fig.4), we examined p21Waf1/Cip1levels in transfected cells after similar times of PMA stimulation. After transfection with appropriate oligodeoxynucleotide and subsequent overnight incubation in quiescent media, antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide caused significant attenuation of PMA-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 levels in VSM cells up to 6 h (Fig. 5). There was no effect of the p21Waf1/Cip1 sense control oligodeoxynucleotide on cellular p21Waf1/Cip1 levels (compare with Fig. 4).Figure 5PMA stimulated CKI induction is blunted in antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 transfected cells. A10 VSM cells were transfected with antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 or sense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide as described in the legend to Fig. 1. After overnight incubation, the cells were stimulated with PMA for the times indicated, lysed, and the lysates were Western blotted with p21Waf1/Cip1 antibody. The experiment shown is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To check for specificity of protein inhibition by the antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide, we examined protein levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 after transfection with antisense p21Waf1/Cip1oligodeoxynucleotide. In these experiments, we assessed the ability of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to inhibit maximally stimulated CKI expression (see Fig. 4), thus the cells were stimulated with PMA for 4 h at various times after overnight serum starvation. While antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 completely inhibited p21Waf1/Cip1 protein even after maximal stimulation with PMA, there was a slight decrease in p27Kip1 protein as well as with this oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig.6 A). This is likely due to sequence similarity between the two genes, as p21Waf1/Cip1shares 43% sequence identity with p27Kip1 in the cdk/cyclin-binding site (residues 27–88), located in the conserved N terminus (22.Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 23.Nomura H. Sawada Y. Fujinaga K. Ohtaki S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 191: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Levels of the VSM cell structural protein α-actin were not altered after transfection under identical conditions (Fig.6 B), demonstrating that the effect of antisense oligonucleotides on cell proteins was not a general inhibitory one. Furthermore, we do not believe that the slight p27Kip1inhibition is playing a significant role in mitogenic inhibition, in light of data from other investigators (24.Rivard N. L'Allemain G. Bartek J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18337-18341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) as well as our cyclin/cdk data discussed below. While the CKIs have been shown to be growth inhibitors in VSM cells (2.Matsushita H. Morishita R. Kida I. Aoki M. Hayashi S. Tomita N. Yamamoto K. Moriguchi A. Noda A. Kaneda Y. Higaki J. Ogihara T.

Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), yet previous studies have not shown inhibition of growth with interference of cyclin/cdk association. Since the cyclin D1/cdk 4 interaction occurs early after growth factor stimulation (reviewed in Ref. 26.Arellano M. Moreno S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and because this interaction is facilitated by p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 in vivo(11.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), we decided to examine this association as a possible mechanism of the permissive effect on growth of p21Waf1/Cip1 in VSM cells. Because other CKIs, such as p27Kip1, have been shown to affect cyclin E/cdk 2 interaction (12.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were transfected with p21Waf1/Cip1 antisense or sense oligodeoxynucleotide, allowed to grow overnight in serum-free media, and then stimulated for various times with PDGF-BB. The cells were subsequently immunoprecipitated with either cyclin D1 or cyclin E and immunoblotted with cdk 4 or cdk 2, respectively. Antisense p21Waf1/Cip1-transfected cells showed a marked decrease in association of cyclin D1 and cdk 4 at all times of PDGF stimulation, with no change in the cyclin E/cdk 2 interaction (Fig.7). Thus the inhibitory effect of antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide in VSM cells is likely by means of disruption in cyclin D1/cdk 4 interaction and thus prevention of activation of cdk 4 by cyclin D1. Aberrant proliferation of VSM-like cells is pathogenic for a variety of diseases, such as atherosclerosis and angioplasty restenosis (28.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9971) Google Scholar), as well as renal mesangial cell proliferation (29.Megyesi J. Price P.M. Tamayo E. Safirstein R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10830-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), thus the mechanism by which these cells are stimulated to grow will be important in designing antiproliferative therapies for treating these and other diseases. Published studies in VSM cells focus on the antiproliferative action of CKI overexpression (2.Matsushita H. Morishita R. Kida I. Aoki M. Hayashi S. Tomita N. Yamamoto K. Moriguchi A. Noda A.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and there are even some studies promoting the idea that pharmacological methods to increase p21Waf1/Cip1 may be useful in preventing the VSM cell proliferation seen after coronary angioplasty (31.Kusama H. Kikuchi S. Tazawa S. Katsuno K. Baba Y. Zhai Y.L. Nikaido T. Fujii S. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 143: 307-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32.Takahashi A.

Cardiol. 1996; 1: 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). Our data showing for the first time that inhibition of p21Waf1/Cip1efficiently blocks mitogen-stimulated VSM cell proliferation injects a note of caution in these pursuits, and might also explain the failure to find mutations in the gene encoding p21Waf1/Cip1 in human tumors (34.Shiohara M. el-Deiry W.S. Wada M. Nakamaki T. Takeuchi S. Yang R. Chen D.L. Vogelstein B. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1994; 84: 3781-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While much of the early work on the CKIs has focussed on their role as growth inhibitors, it had been somewhat puzzling that expression of these molecules was increased early after mitogen stimulation (20.Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Depoortere F. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led to more recent data showing the ability of some CKIs to take part in formation of the cyclin·cdk complexes, and thus to serve as assembly factors important for promoting cyclin/cdk association (11.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar,36.Hiyama H. Iavarone A. Reeves S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In support of this role for the CKIs, others have shown that assembly of cyclin D1/D2·cdk4 complexes was impaired in fibroblasts from mice lacking the genes encoding p21Waf1/Cip1 and/or p27Kip1 (14.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), and that both p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 actively promoted interaction between the cyclin Ds and their counterpart cdks by stabilizing this complex (11.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). However, primary fibroblasts from p21- and p27-null mice did not show overtly aberrant cell cycles, despite the finding by those investigators that overall cyclin D-dependent kinase activity was reduced below the assay limit of detectability, leading these authors to raise the possibility that the CKIs are not required for cell cycle progression (14.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown an increased growth rate of p21(−/−) as compared with wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (37.Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar), and no apparent G1 block in human colorectal cancer cells (38.Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). The difference of our data as compared with that in the mouse cells may well be due to cell type, but our finding of growth inhibition in cells lacking active p21Waf1/Cip1, we believe, better explains the “essential activator” role of p21 promulgated by that group (14.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since p21(−/−) mice appear to develop normally (37.Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that p21Waf1/Cip1 disruption only affects “adult” cells, or that redundant pathways for cell growth are not present in A10 cells. Nevertheless, our data is the first showing that the presence of these pleiotropic molecules is required for growth factor-mediated G1 progression in any cell type. Other investigators have shown that cells transfected with antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 lose their ability to become growth arrested by epidermal growth factor (15.Ohtsubo M. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this case, there was certainly no inhibition of DNA synthesis by the antisense construct, however, these cells are transformed and are thus quite different from our A10 VSM cells. In order to explain this and other extant data in this field, it has been hypothesized that, in the absence of Cip/Kip CKIs, the function of cyclin D/cdk 4 to titrate p21Waf1/Cip1 is no longer necessary, and in the case of experimental absence of these CKIs, cyclin E- and cyclin A-dependent kinases become sufficient to phosphorylate Rb and cause DNA synthesis to proceed (1.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5132) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be occurring in our VSM cell line, where the absence of p21Waf1/Cip1 leads to significantly diminished responsiveness to PDGF. While our antisense p21Waf1/Cip1 oligodeoxynucleotide clearly inhibits p21, there is also slight inhibition of p27Kip1 protein as well by this oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig.3). While this occurrence is likely due to the sequence similarity between the two genes (22.Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 23.Nomura H. Sawada Y. Fujinaga K. Ohtaki S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 191: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we do not believe that the slight amount of inhibition of p27Kip1 is actively inhibiting VSM cell growth in our experiments, since cyclin E/cdk 2 association is not affected (19.Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 27.Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar, 39.Ravitz M.J. Yan S. Herr K.D. Wenner C.E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1413-1416PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7). Furthermore, others have reported suppression of quiescence, not of G1-phase progression, in fibroblasts transfected with antisense p27Kip1 (24.Rivard N. L'Allemain G. Bartek J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18337-18341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In any case, our finding of unchanged α-actin protein levels in antisense p21-transfected cells argues against a general suppressive effect of these oligodeoxynucleotides (or of the process of transfection) on protein transcription. Very recent work has shown that lack of a functional gene encoding p21Waf1/Cip1 in transgenic mice ameliorates progression of chronic renal failure after partial renal ablation (29.Megyesi J. Price P.M. Tamayo E. Safirstein R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10830-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was found to be significantly increased in p21(−/−) animals, but the degree of mesangial expansion was not quantitated. While the decrease in progression of renal failure was assumed to be due to a more hyperplastic (rather than hypertrophic) reaction in the p21(−/−) animals, our new data may shed some light on this phenomenon by suggesting that the response in p21(−/−) animals may have been a result of decreased mesangial cell mitogenesis due to inhibition of p21Waf1/Cip1expression. This point of view is reinforced by others, noting that “all kidney growth parameters reported by Megyesi et al.(29.Megyesi J. Price P.M. Tamayo E. Safirstein R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10830-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) are lower in p21(−/−) mice compared with p21(+/+) mice” (40.Al-Awqati Q. Preisig P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10551-10553Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Indeed, since renal mesangial cells are modified VSM cells, our work could lead to novel approaches to therapy of renal ailments, as well as other proliferative diseases, employing inhibitors of the CKIs. We believe that a major importance of our work lies in its relevance and potential applications to diseases involving aberrant VSM (or similar type) cell proliferation, such as atherosclerosis, angioplasty restenosis, and renal disease. While the available research on the CKIs in VSM cells has focused on the induction of the Cip/Kip family of CKIs in the presence of antiproliferative situations (25.Fukui R. Shibata N. Kohbayashi E.

While much work in the area of inhibition of VSM cell proliferation (including our own) has been concentrated on the elements of the MAP/ERK and other cytoplasmic kinase cascades and their inhibitors, we believe that, in light of our data presented here, vascular biologists may now wish to focus more efforts on events further downstream in the mitogenic signaling cascades (i.e. in the nucleus), such as the cyclin/cdk/CKI signaling systems."

https://openalex.org/W3103940977,"When confined to two dimensions and exposed to a strong magnetic field, electrons screen the Coulomb interaction in a topological fashion; they capture and even number of quantum vortices and transform into particl es called `composite fermions'. The fractional quantum Hall effect occurs in such a system when the ratio (or `filling factor', $\nu$) of the number of electrons and the degeneracy of their spin-split energy states (the Landau levels) takes on particular values. The Landau level filling $\nu=1/2$ corresponds to a metallic state in which the composite fermions form a gapless Fermi sea. But for $\nu=5/2$, a fractional quantum Hall effect is observed instead; this unexpected result is the subject of considerable debate and controversy. Here we investigate the difference between these states by considering the theoretical problem of two composite fermions on top of a fully polarized Fermi sea of composite fermions. We find that they undergo Cooper pairing to form a p-wave bound state at $\nu=5/2$, but not at $\nu=1/2$. In effect, the repulsive Coulomb interaction between electrons is overscr eened in the $\nu=5/2$ state by the formation of composite fermions, resulting in a weak, attractive interaction."

Full-Text PDF Open Access endoplasmic reticulum protein-disulfide isomerase giardial PDI rapid amplification of cDNA ends glutathioneS-transferase bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor dithiothreitol transglutaminase Many secreted proteins have disulfide bonds that are crucial for their structure or function. It has long been known that although the necessary information for folding is dictated by the primary structure of a protein, this process can be exceedingly slow (1Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In vivo, the actions of specialized enzymes located in specific compartments of both bacterial and eukaryotic cells catalyze the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds. In Gram-negative bacteria, the crucial function of disulfide bond formation is sequestered within the periplasmic space between the inner and outer cell membranes and is catalyzed by a group of enzymes belonging to the Dsb (disulfide bond) family. These proteins have a single thioredoxin-like active site consisting of a pair of cysteines in a CXXC motif. In eukaryotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1is the only cellular compartment that is sufficiently oxidizing for disulfide bond formation. The ER has a high concentration of the enzymes and molecular chaperones involved in the folding and assembly of proteins (2Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ER-resident enzyme, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI; EC 5.3.4.1), catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Like Dsb proteins, PDI is a member of the thioredoxin superfamily, but has two thioredoxin-like active sites (CGHC) that are involved in disulfide bond formation and rearrangement reactions (3Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the case of the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia, it is likely that PDI activity plays a key role in the folding of outer surface proteins that are central to avoidance of the host immune system and survival of this parasite in the external environment (4Gillin F.D. Reiner D.S. McCaffery J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Specifically, the plasmalemma of the trophozoite is coated with an extremely cysteine-rich (12–16%) variable surface protein (5Nash T. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Gillin F.D. Hagblom P. Harwood J. Aley S.B. Reiner D.S. McCaffery M. So M. Guiney D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4463-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Of the variable surface proteins studied to date, all the cysteine residues are in intramolecular disulfide bonds that are not susceptible to reduction in the native protein (7Aley S.B. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This presents a formidable challenge for correct disulfide bond formation and variable surface protein folding in the ER. Interestingly, a large proportion of the cysteine residues are in a tetrapeptide CXXC motif that rarely corresponds to the thioredoxin family active-site sequence. 2F. D. Gillin and S. B. Aley, unpublished observations. In addition, the two major proteins of the extracellular cyst wall are cysteine-rich (8Mowatt M.R. Lujan H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol.

Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast to the variable surface proteins, the cyst wall proteins are linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds (9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Giardia is a biological fossil, with both eukaryotic and prokaryotic characteristics (11Sogin M.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4470-4477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This protozoan has an ER structure, but does not contain certain other internal organelles typical of eukaryotes, such as mitochondria and peroxisomes (13Soltys B.J. Falah M. Gupta R.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109 (, and references therein): 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike most other eukaryotes, Giardia uses cysteine instead of glutathione as the ER thiol redox buffer (14Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the evolution of thiol-disulfide exchange mechanisms in eukaryotes and because of their likely importance in giardial biology, we characterized genes encoding giardial PDIs (gPDIs). The hypothesis underlying this work was that gPDIs might reflect an early-diverging state of these enzymes in eukaryotic cells. We found three very different genes (gPDI-1, gPDI-2, and gPDI-3) that encode proteins of ∼26, 50, and 13 kDa with only one CGHC active site and so are unlike most other eukaryotic PDIs. However, this active site is identical in sequence to the two active sites found in eukaryotic PDIs and is distinct from the single active site of the Dsb proteins and thioredoxins (15Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The gPDIs can catalyze the shuffling of disulfide bonds and, interestingly, also display significant transglutaminase activity. This is the first report of PDIs with only one thioredoxin-like active site that have diverse enzymatic roles in protein cross-linking. A fragment of the gPDI-1 gene (clone cLM-12a-12t; GenBankTM/EBI accession number AQ049081) was identified from a random genome sequence survey (16Smith M.W. Aley S.B. Sogin M.L. Gillin F.D. Evans G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A segment was amplified from genomic DNA with primers PDI-5 (5′-GCC AGA GTA CGC TAA GGC C-3′) and PDI-3 (5′-TTG CGC CGT TAT AGT CGA G-3′), purified, and labeled with32P by random priming (Prime It II kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A full-length clone was identified from a genomic DNA library in λZap II (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). A clone expressing full-length gPDI-2 was isolated by screening a genomic DNA expression library (1–3-kilobase pair inserts) in λZap II with polyclonal antibodies prepared against a protein fraction of ∼49 kDa from a polyacrylamide gel segment (18Das S. Traynor-Kaplan A. Reiner D.S. Meng T.-C. Gillin F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21318-21325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gPDI-3 gene was identified by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with a degenerate oligonucleotide designed against the PDI active site. The complete gene was isolated by screening a λZap II genomic library (3–5-kilobase pair inserts) with a 183-base pair probe generated from genomic DNA with primers PDI-S:1 (5′-GAT CTG TCT GAT GAC GCT CCC GAG-3′) and PDI3-3′ (5′-CAC GTG GAA TCA CAG CCT CTG-3′). The double strand sequences of gPDI-1 and gPDI-2 were obtained by primer walking using the T7 Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and that of gPDI-3 by automated sequencing. 5′-RACE was performed using the 5′-RACE Version 2.0 system (Life Technologies, Inc.). For gPDI-1, oligonucleotide PDQ7 (5′-CCT GAA CGG CTT CTT CAT G-3′) was used as the first strand primer, and PDI-3 (see above) was used as the nested primer. For gPDI-2, oligonucleotide 974-P7 (5′-GAT CTC AAA CTG TTC CAT G-3′) was used as the first strand primer and oligonucleotide 974-2 (5′-TAT CGA GCT GAG GGC CT-3′) as the nested primer. For gPDI-3, oligonucleotide PDI3-3′ (see above) was used as the first strand primer, and PDI-31 (5′-AGC GTC ATC AGA CAG ATC GA-3′) as the nested primer. 3′-RACE was performed for gPDI-3 on cDNA generated from 1 μg of trophozoite total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo(dT) primer, SGS-10 (5′-CGA GCT GCG TCG ACA GGC (T)17-3′), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PDI-S:1 (see above) was used as the gene-specific primer. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. G. lambliatrophozoites (strain WB, ATCC 30957, clone C6) were cultivated and encysted as described (19Que X. Svärd S.G. Meng T.-C. Hetsko M.L. Aley S.B. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem.

Samples of total RNA (15 μg/lane) were fractionated on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gels, downward capillary-blotted in 20× SSC, and immobilized onto nylon membranes (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad) by baking in a vacuum oven for 1 h at 80 °C. For Northern hybridization, probes corresponding to the open reading frames of gPDI-1, gPDI-2, and gPDI-3 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified, gel-purified, and radiolabeled by random priming (Prime It II kit). Blots were prehybridized in 6× SSC, 5×Denhardt's solution, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 1 h at 65 °C. Hybridization at 65 °C was continued overnight in the presence of a mixture of the three gPDI probes. The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 15 min and then once at 60 °C for 15 min in 0.2× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The washed membrane was exposed to film overnight. Cellular protein was isolated from trophozoites and at different times during encystation (20Hetsko M.L. McCaffery J.M. Meng T.-C. Que X. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total protein/lane for gPDI-1, 20 μg for gPDI-2, and 15 μg for gPDI-3 (determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay) was separated on 4–20% gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose (20Hetsko M.L. McCaffery J.M. Meng T.-C. Que X. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because of its small size, gPDI-3 was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 70 V. Blots were reacted with protein A-purified rabbit anti-gPDI-1 and anti-gPDI-3 serum at 10 μg/ml and anti-gPDI-2 serum at 1:500 dilution. gPDI-1 and gPDI-2 analyses were developed with protein A-alkaline phosphatase, and gPDI-3 with protein A-peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). gPDIs were overexpressed as C-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins lacking the predicted N-terminal signal peptides. Each gene was amplified from Giardia genomic DNA (QIAGEN Blood and Cell Culture kit) with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into pGEX-KG (21Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) using XbaI and HindIII linkers. gPDI-1 was amplified with PDI1Q5′ (5′-CAT CTA GAG GTT GTC GAG TTA GGC-3′) and PDI1Q3′ (5′-TGA AGC TTA TGG AGC CAC TTC TC-3′). For gPDI-2, oligonucleotides PDI2-GEX-5′ (5′-TAT TCT AGA GGT CTT GGT TCT CA-3′) and PDI2-GEX-3′ (5′-ATA AAG CTT AGA AGT TCT CAT TGA GCA T-3′) were used. For gPDI-3, oligonucleotides PDI3MAL5′ and PDI3MAL3′ (see below) were used. The GST-PDI fusion proteins were overexpressed and purified on glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified preparations contained some free GST that did not interfere with the enzymatic activities. Antibodies against each recombinant GST-gPDI fusion protein were raised in New Zealand White rabbits as described (22Hattori K. Adachi H. Matsuzawa A. Yamamoto K. Tsujimoto M. Aoki J. Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33032-33038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Purification of anti-gPDI-1 and anti-gPDI-3 antibodies over a protein A-agarose column did not affect their reactivity.Giardia has neither glutathione nor GST (14Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and anti-GST antibodies did not interfere with detection of gPDIs in immunoblots or immunocytochemistry. Trophozoites were processed for cryosection immunoelectron microscopy, and polyclonal antibodies against each gPDI were detected with 5-nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (10McCaffery J.M. Faubert G.M. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant GST-gPDI-1, GST-gPDI-2, and GST-gPDI-3 fusion proteins were used in each assay. The ability of the recombinant gPDIs to catalyze the refolding of “scrambled” bovine pancreatic ribonuclease type III-A (Sigma; a measure of disulfide isomerization) was determined as described by Hawkins et al. (23Hawkins H.C. Blackburn E.C. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The PDI-catalyzed folding of reduced bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI; type I-P, Sigma; oxidative formation of native disulfide bonds) was measured as described (24Creighton T.E. Bagley C.J. Cooper L. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. Kemminck J. Sheikh A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1176-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in 0.2 m Tris-Cl containing 0.1 mm GSSG and 0.2 mm GSH. PDI purified from chick liver (25Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control in these assays. The ability of PDIs to reduce the disulfide bond between insulin chains with 0.33 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) or 1 mml-cysteine was measured as ΔA 650(26Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine PDI (PanVera, Madison, WI) and purified Escherichia coli DsbA protein (provided by Dr. J. Bardwell) (27Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 582-589Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (830) Google Scholar) were used as positive controls. gPDIs were subcloned into pMAL-P2 (New England Biolabs Inc.) for targeting to the periplasm of E. coli as C-terminal fusions to maltose-binding protein. The following oligonucleotides were used: for gPDI-1, PDI1-5′ (5′-GCT CTA GAA TCA CTCCTC TGC TCC TTG TG-3′) and PDI1–3′ (5′-TTC TGC AGT TAC TTGGCG TGG TTA TGG AG-3′); for gPDI-2, PDI2-5′ (5′-GCT CTA GAG- AGG TCT TGG TTC TCA CGC AA-3′) and PDI2–3′ (5′-CCC AAG CTTTTA CTT CTT GCG CTT CTC CTG-3′); and for gPDI-3, PDI3MAL5′ (5′-GCT CTA GAA TTG CCG GCC TCC TCC TCG TC-3′) and PDI3MAL3′ (5′-CCA AGC TTT TAC AGC CTC TGC TTG ATC CAC TC-3′). Constructs were electroporated into E. coli strain JCB571 (JCB570 dsbA::kan1) (27Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 582-589Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (830) Google Scholar). JCB570 (MC1000phoR zih12::Tn10) (27Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 582-589Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and JCB571 were grown in minimal medium without cysteine or methionine, and bacterial alkaline phosphatase activity was measured (28Humphreys D.P. Weir N. Mountain A. Lund P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28210-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling of gPDI was performed using an affinity probe specific for the proposed peptide-binding site of rat PDI (residues 451–476):125I-labeled monoiodo-N α-3- (4-hydroxyphenylpropionyl)-Asn-Lys-(N ε-p-azidobenzoyl)-Ala-NH2(29Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19210-19217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each gPDI was preincubated with the probe in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking moiety was activated by exposure to a short-wave source (254 nm, 8 watts) at 1 cm for 2 min. Affinity labeling was assessed by autoradiography of the samples after separation on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoreactivity to anti-rat PDI antisera was characterized after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Binding was identified using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by colorimetric detection with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Transglutaminase (TGase) activity of recombinant gPDIs was measured in a microtiter plate assay containing 200 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm DTT, and 10 mm CaCl2 or EDTA (30Mehta K. Chandrashekar R. Rao U.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at 55 °C for 1 h, and TGase conjugation of the amino group donor 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine to dimethylcasein was measured using alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a reporter. Our initial identification of putative gPDI gene fragments was based on the presence of a classical PDI active site: F(Y/F)APWCGHCK (15Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,31Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three PDI genes were isolated from Giardia (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, the three gPDIs have only one active site, each of which corresponds exactly to that of “classical” PDIs rather than to the active sites of thioredoxin or bacterial Dsb proteins (Fig. 1 B) (15Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Other short regions (VDCT and G(Y/F)PT) were also common to many other PDIs (Fig. 1 A). 3F. D. Gillin, unpublished observations. Little similarity between gPDI-1 and gPDI-2 was evident after the terminus of gPDI-3 (Fig. 1 A). Additionally, the three gPDI sequences have rather similar predicted N-terminal signal peptides, but only gPDI-3 has a potential KDEL-type signal for retention in the ER (KQRL). However, the C-terminal KRKK motif of gPDI-2 conforms to KKXX ER retention signal criteria (Fig. 1 A) (32Vincent M.J. Martin A.S. Compans R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 950-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The gPDIs differ greatly in the sizes of their predicted open reading frames and encoded polypeptides: gPDI-2 (50,431 Da) is similar in size to PDIs with two active sites from higher organisms (15Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 25Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With a predicted molecular mass of 25,846 Da, gPDI-1 is slightly smaller than the yeast Mpd1 and Mpd2 proteins (36.4 and 32.4 kDa) (33Tachikawa H. Takeuchi Y. Funahashi W. Miura T. Gao X.-D. Fujimoto D. Mizunaga T. Onodera K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Tachikawa H. Funahashi W. Takeuchi Y. Nakanishi H. Nishihara R. Katoh S. Gao X.-D. Mizunaga T. Fujimoto D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and similar to the bacterial Dsb proteins (DsbA is 21.5 kDa), which also have one active site (15Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 27Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 582-589Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (830) Google Scholar). gPDI-3, with a predicted molecular mass of 12,648 Da, is the smallest eukaryotic protein containing the PDI active site reported to date. Although vegetative trophozoites and encysting cells secrete different cysteine-rich outer surface proteins that must be folded in the ER (15Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), the levels of gPDI-1, gPDI-2, and gPDI-3 proteins did not change during encystation (Fig. 2 A). Northern analyses showed that early in encystation (5 h), the mRNA levels of each gPDI increased slightly, and they decreased late in encystation (48 h) (Fig. 2 B). The sizes of the gPDI-1, gPDI-2, and gPDI-3 transcripts (∼0.7, 1.3, and 0.35 kilobase pairs, respectively) were similar to those predicted by the open reading frames, suggesting that the untranslated regions were short, as is typical of other giardial transcripts (35Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the 5′-untranslated regions for gPDI-1, gPDI-2, and gPDI-3 were 3, 4, and 14 nucleotides, respectively, and each transcript begins in an AT-rich region, as do many other giardial genes (36Hilario E. Gogarten J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 128: 94-98Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For gPDI-1, a classical (AGTPurAAPyr) giardial polyadenylation signal (35Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AGTGAAT, was 8 nucleotides past the stop codon. For gPDI-2, it overlapped the TAA stop codon, which is not unusual for Giardia. gPDI-3 had a slightly divergent polyadenylation signal, and 3′-RACE analysis showed that the transcript was polyadenylated 20 nucleotides past the TGA stop codon (TGAttccacgtgtaaactatgctAAAAA … ). This supports the idea that the first position is the least stringent nucleotide in the polyadenylation signal (37Svärd S.G. Meng T.-C. Hetsko M.L. McCaffery J.M. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The particular thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity displayed by PDI is dependent on both the redox status of the substrate and the cellular milieu. We investigated the oxidant, reductant, and isomerization activities of the gPDIs. The ability to refold RNase that has been scrambled (reduced, denatured, and randomly refolded by reoxidation in air) is a common measure of protein-disulfide isomerization (23Hawkins H.C. Blackburn E.C. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28Humphreys D.P. Weir N. Mountain A. Lund P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28210-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recombinant gPDI-1, gPDI-2, and gPDI-3 each had significant activity in catalyzing the restoration of RNase activity (Fig.3 A). The catalysis of disulfide bond formation or oxidation by PDI can be quantitated by measuring the folding of reduced BPTI as the inhibition of trypsin hydrolysis. The rate-limiting step in the folding of BPTIin vitro is the isomerization of two-disulfide intermediates (24Creighton T.E. Bagley C.J. Cooper L. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. Kemminck J. Sheikh A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1176-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recombinant gPDI-2 showed a time-dependent increase in BPTI folding, whereas gPDI-1 and gPDI-3 had low to negligible activity (Fig. 3 B). In addition, microsomal PDI and cell-surface PDI can reduce disulfide bonds in the presence of a reducing agent as measured by the precipitation of reduced insulin chains (26Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). gPDI-2 and bovine PDI catalyzed the reduction of insulin with DTT more rapidly than DsbA (Fig. 3 C). Since Giardia lacks glutathione and uses cysteine as its major low molecular mass thiol (14Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we asked if cysteine could also support insulin reduction. gPDI-2 catalyzed the reduction of insulin with either DTT or cysteine. 4L. A. Knodler and F. D. Gillin, unpublished observations. gPDI-3 had a low level of activity only with DTT (Fig. 3 C), and gPDI-1 was inactive (Fig. 3 C).4 DsbA is an extremely efficient catalyst of disulfide bond formation in the bacterial periplasm, but has poor isomerase activity. E. coli dsbA− mutants have defects in the functioning of many proteins (including alkaline phosphatase, β-lactamase, and OmpA) that require disulfide bond formation in the periplasm for activity (15Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,27Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 582-589Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activity in the dsbA −mutant JCB571 is diminished between 5- and 58-fold (33Tachikawa H. Takeuchi Y. Funahashi W. Miura T. Gao X.-D. Fujimoto D. Mizunaga T. Onodera K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The gPDIs were cloned into the pMAL-P2 vector for targeting to the periplasmic space. gPDI-2 was able to partially complement thedsbA − mutant JCB571 (Fig.4). In addition, the assembly of bacterial flagella is dependent on disulfide-bonded proteins; hence,dsbA mutants are also defective in motility (27Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 582-589Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (830) Google Scholar). gPDI-2 was also able to restore motility to a dsbA −mutant.4 However, neither gPDI-1 nor gPDI-3 complementeddsbA − mutants (Fig. 4). Since a eukaryotic PDI must be capable of reoxidation by DsbB to observe complementation (39Ostermeier M. De Sutter K. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10616-10622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), these results for gPDI-1 and gPDI-3 are consistent with the enzymatic data in Fig. 3 B. PDI can have chaperone activity (3Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 30Mehta K. Chandrashekar R. Rao U.R. Mol.
