The presence of a Y body in macrophages of male origin was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. In those patients with a marrow donor of opposite sex the alveolar macrophages were shown to be of donor origin. The disappearance with time of host macrophages indicates a life-span, under the conditions, of approximately 81 days."

These vesicles are permeable to a variety of low molecular weight compounds, but not to oligo- and polysaccharides of molecular weight higher than 700. A protein complex participating in selective membrane permeability can be isolated by gel filtration in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The active fractions contain three major protein species. The Braun lipoprotein is not associated with this subset of outer membrane proteins."

The two activities, which could not be separated by electrophoresis, by sedimentation, or by gel filtration, were associated with a single monomeric protein of 28,000 daltons. To explain how a relatively small protein could have such diverse activities, it is proposed that one site on the enzyme can recognize interstrand spaces created either by depurination or by spontaneous terminal unwinding of a DNA duplex."

https://openalex.org/W1571614574,"We have studied the interaction of the host factor (HF) required for bacteriophage Qbeta RNA replication and of ribosomal protein S1, a subunit of Qbeta replicase, with Qbeta and R17 RNA. Both proteins bind to both Qbeta and R17 RNA; HF has a higher affinity than S1 for these phages RNAs. HF binds to a single site in R17 RNA located in the replicase cistron, and to two sites of Qbeta RNA, one of which is located approximately 60 nucleotides from the 6' end of Qbeta RNA. The three HF binding sites all have portions rich in adenylate residues; all are bound by HF when contained in oligonucleotides which are predicted to exist only in single-stranded form. S1 selects a single site in Qbeta RNA, also near the 6' end, but binds to a large number of sites in R17 RNA. These results suggest that HF and possibly S1, through their interaction with the 3'-terminal region of Qbeta RNA, are directly involved in the recognition of the 6' end of Qbeta RNA by Qbeta replicase. Under conditions where specific protein-R1M RNA complexes are formed, we have also tested host factor and S1 for cistron-specific interference with ribosome binding to R17 RNA. Although S1 and HF lower the efficiency of initiation complex formation as described previously, we detect no discrimination against any particular cistron. We therefore conclude that translational interference exhibited by the two proteins probably reflects simply their high affinity for RNA and certain defined polynucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1487743630,"mRNAs of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have modified 5' termini similar but not identical with those present in the higher eukaryotes. Poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from spheroplasts or from polysomes of cells labeled with [methyl-3H]methoionine or 32Pi contain methylated, blocked 5'-terminal structures of composition: m7G(5')pppAp and m7G(5')pppGp, occurring in a relative distribution of 75% and 25%, respectively. Furthermore there is no N6-methyladenosine nor any other methylated nucleoside in the entire molecule of poly(A)-containing RNA. Experiments with a mutant, temperature-sensitive for the transport of mRNA to cytoplasm, suggest that the methylation and addition of the blocking group take place in the nucleus and that the genetic lesion in the mutant does not affect these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1542637321,"It has been determined from steady state kinetic studies using the sulfide ion selective electrode that O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase catalyzes a Bi Bi Ping Pong reaction between O-acetyl-L-serine and sulfide. Both O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) and sulfide exhibit strong competitive substrate inhibition. A fit of all the data to the equation for the mechanism yields KOAS = 0.149 +/- 0.059 mM and KIOAS = 46.91 +/- 10.06 mM for O-acetyl-L-serine and KS2- = 0.066 +/- 0.004 mM and KIS2- = 0.013 +/- 0.006 mM for sulfide. Product inhibition studies varying either substrate at changing fixed levels of cysteine demonstrate that cysteine combines with enzyme at two places along the reaction sequence to produce inhibition with KiCys = 1.048 +/- 0.048 mM and KICys = 11.4 +/- 0.5 mM. Relatively high concentrations of acetate are required to produce inhibition and at least part of the acetate inhibition is due to ionic strength. However, the ability of acetate to reverse the spectral shift produced from the binding of O-acetyl-L-serine to enzyme and the isotope exchange between [14C]acetate and O-acetyl-L-serine does demonstrate that the O-acetyl-L-serine to acetate half-reaction is reversible. There is some doubt as to the specificity of acetate as a product inhibitor, since propionate can also be used to reverse the spectral shift. Spectral studies using ths spectral shift produced from binding O-acetyl-L-serine to enzyme confirms the assignment of a ping-pong mechanism since the spectral intermediate produced is alpha-aminoacrylic acid in Schiff base with pyridoxal phosphate and, therefore, the acetyl moiety has been beta eliminated. Isotope exchange has been demonstrated for both the O-acetyl-L-serine to acetate and sulfide to cysteine half-reactions which also confirms a ping-pong mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1553661888,"Many of the transition states that are formed from thiamin pyrophosphate in enzymic reactions are expected to have structures in which the thiazolium ring of thiamin pyrophosphate has lost most of its positive charge. We have synthesized thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate from the unphosphorylated compound. The sulphur-containing ring of thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate is uncharged, and thus the compound resembles these transition states. In agreement with the prediction from the transition state theory of reaction rates, thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate binds to Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.2.7.1) much more strongly than thiamin pyrophosphate itself. An upper limit for the value of the dissociation constant, calculated from the extent of inactivation of the enzyme by a low concentration of thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate, is 5 X 10(-10) M at 3 degrees in 0.5 mM MgCl2/10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6. The dissociation constant for thiamin pyrophosphate under similar conditions is about 10(-5) M. The kinetics of inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate are first order with respect to both enzyme and thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate; the value of the second order rate constant is 5.7 X 10(5) M-1 min-1 at 3 degrees in 0.5 mM MgCl2/10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6. An analysis of the decrease in the rates of inactivation caused by thiamin pyrophosphate indicates that thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate binds at the coenzyme sites. We have also synthesized thiamin thiothiazolone pyrophosphate and obtained very similar results with this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1571130748,"Nitrate reductase, released from the membrane fraction of Escherichia coli by a neutral heat treatment, was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme behaved as an associating-dissociating system, exhibiting concentration-dependent sedimentation constants which ranged from 24 S at high concentrations in the ultracentrifuge down to 10 S at low concentrations in sucrose gradients. The molecular weight determined at high concentrations by sedimentation equilibrium was 880,000 +/- 30,000. Large and small enzyme species were detected on polyacrylamide disc gels run with diluted samples of enzyme. The ratio of the two species was concentration-dependent and the dissociation was reversible. The purified enzyme appeared to be homogeneous and monodisperse in the ultracentrifuge, on sucrose gradients, during gel filtration on Bio-Gel and on polyacrylamide gels, but it had a heterogeneous subunit composition as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Enzyme species with different subunit compositions were partially resolved by gel filtration. The fractions with the highest specific activity contained subunits of 150,000 and 55,000 daltons in a ratio of approximately 1:1. Other fractions contained reduced amounts of the 55,000-dalton subunit and correspondingly increased amounts of 51,000-, 45,000-, and 10,000-dalton subunits, suggesting that the heterogeneity was the result of proteolytic degradation of the 55,000-dalton subunit. The enzyme contained approximately 12 non-heme irons, 12 acid-labile sulfides, 24 cysteine residues, and 1 molybdenum per 200,000 daltons."

Release of catecholamines has been associated widely with stress and lends itself to quantitation. Plasma epinephrine and norephinephrine, as well as lactate, were measured in 12 volunteers before, during, and after meditation. Values were compared with those obtained from controls matched for sex and age who rested instead of meditating. Essentially the same results were obtained for the two groups, which suggests that meditation does not induce a unique metabolic state but is seen biochemically as a resting state."

https://openalex.org/W1532131932,"Hen oviduct RNA polymerase II and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme and core enzyme were used to study the initiation of RNA synthesis on chromatin. In either the presence or absence of estrogenic stimulation, changes in the level of oviduct chromatin initiation sites as measured in the presence of either homologous or heterologous polymerases followed a similar pattern. Comparison of the initiation sited utilized by these enzymes on chick oviduct chromatin indicated that these enzymes compete with each other for the same initiation regions. In contrast to chromatin, however, the majority of the initiation sites on DNA which are utilized by the oviduct RNA polymerase II are different from those utilized by E. coli holoenzyem. These results suggest that chromatin proteins are involved in the selection of initiation sites on chromatin for RNA polymerases. The in vitro transcripts of these RNA polymerases on stimulated chick oviduct chromatin were analyzed by hybridization to a cDNA probe transcribed from ovalbumin mRNA. The relative concentration of ovalbumin sequences transcribed by these three polymerases was 4:1.5:1 for oviduct RNA polymerase II, E. coli core enzyme, and holoenzyme respectively. Therefore, the efficiency of transcribing a specific gene appears to depend on the interaction between RNA polymerase and chromosomal elements in the initiation region."

https://openalex.org/W1601761624,"In Escherichia coli the synthesis of phosphatidic acid from glycerophosphate involves first the intermediate formation of 1-acyl glycerophosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by the membrane-bound acyl-CoA(acyl-ACP):glycerophosphate acyltransferase. The 1-acylglycerophosphate is then converted to phosphatidic acid by acyl-CoA(acyl-ACP):1-acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase (Okuyama, H., and Wakil, S.J. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5197-5205). In vitro both acyltransferases utilize various saturated and unsaturated acyl-CoAs at comparable rates, resulting in the incorporation of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids into position 1 as well as position 2 of the glycerophosphate moiety. Thus, the specificities of acyltransferase systems as compared with regard to the maximal velocities for various acyl-AoAs, do not explain the positional distribution of the individual fatty acid in phospholipid molecules. The selectivities of the acyltransferases for acyl-CoAs are variable depending upon the acceptor concentration. In the presence of both palmitoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA and at low concentrations of the acceptors comparable to those found in vivo, the acylation at position 1 of glycerophosphate by acyl-CoA:glycerophosphate acyltransferase showed higher preference for palmitate, whereas the acylation at position 2 by acyl-CoA:1-acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase showed higher selectivity for oleate. In the presence of saturating amounts of the acceptors, the acylation at position 1 or position 2 was less selective for the acyl-CoAs. The ratios of saturated acyl-CoA to unsaturated acyl-CoA also affect the ratios of the fatty acids incorporated in vitro into positions 1 and 2 of phosphatidic acid; relatively more palmitate was incorporated when the proportion of palmitoyl-CoA among the acyl donors was higher and vice versa. Thus, highly selective positioning of various acyl-CoAs observed at lower concentrations of the acceptors in phosphatidic acid synthesis in vitro helps to explain the selective distribution of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at positions 1 and 2 of glycerophospholipids in the membranes. Another factor, the availability of acyl donors, affects the proportions of different molecular species of phosphatidic acid, which at least partly explains the variability of molecular species of phospholipids found in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1535710222,"DNA polymerase induced by bacteriophage T5 was purified and characterized using mainly circular duplex DNA of bacteriophage PM2 with single strand breaks formed by DNase I action. A purification procedure is described which has consistently yielded DNA polymerase preparations with only one detectable protein band after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of either native protein in Tris-glyase preparations utilized both denatured DNA and nicked DNA as primer-templates, although at 37 degrees the activity with denatured DNA was much greater. Polymerase activities with both kinds of primer-templates were shown to be associated with one phage-induced protein. DNA synthesis with nicked DNA as primer-template increased with increasing numbers of single strand breaks. Essentially all such breaks were repairable by ligase. Alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that synthesis occurred with the strand which had a single strand break as a primer yielding DNA longer than one phage DNA unit length. Newly synthesized DNA was covalently linked to the primer strand. Thus the synthesis very likely occurred by strand displacement; this is supported by electron micrographs shown in the Appendix."

https://openalex.org/W1525820081,"Suspensions of oviduct cells were prepared by subjecting oviduct tissue to sequential incubations with EDTA, alpha-chymotrypsin, and crude collagenase, followed by a final incubation with EDTA. Cells isolated in this way incorporate mannose from exogenous GDP-mannose into mannosyl-lipid, oligosaccharide-lipid, and glycoprotein(s). Based on several criteria, the mannosyl-lipid is identical with mannosyl-phosphoryldolichol. Similarly, the oligosaccharide-lipid appears to be identical with the oligosaccharide-lipid synthesized in vitro (Lucas, J. J., Waechter, C. J., and Lennarz, W. J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 1992-2002). In contrast, the glycoproteins are much lower in molecular weight than those labeled in cell-free preparations. Using intact oviduct cell suspensions it was found that: (a) exogenous GDP-mannose, not its breakdown products, serves as the direct mannosyl donor; (b) experiments using mixtures of known proportions of broken and intact cells, as well as studies with metabolic inhibitors, indicate that greater than 50% of the observed incorporation of mannose from GDP-mannose was catalyzed by enzymes associated with intact cells, rather than broken cells or membrane fragments; (c) incorporation of mannose from GDP-mannose into the mannosyl acceptors does not require energy and proceeds without significant uptake of GDP-mannose into trichloroacetic acid-soluble components of the cells; (d) under conditions where labeled guanosine incorporation into nucleic acids is readily detected, no incorporation of the guanosine moiety of [3H]GDP-mannose is observed. These results indicate that the enzymes catalyzing synthesis of lipid-linked intermediates involved in glycoprotein synthesis are not only associated with intracellular membranes, but with the plasma membrane as well."

The mutant enzyme resembles the wild type in thermal stability, pH optimum, salt activation, divalent metal ion requirement, inhibition by a sulfhydryl reagent, and apparent affinity for DNA. However, the mutant enzyme differs from the wild type in its 8-fold higher 3'-exonuclease activity and in its decreased apparent affinity for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Inhibition studies indicate that the exonuclease of the mutant enzyme is more vulnerable to physical and chemical modification than its wild type counterpart."

https://openalex.org/W1603619966,"Bottromycin A2 inhibited MS2 phage RNA-dependent protein synthesis as well as polyuridylic acid-(poly(U))- or polyadenylic acid (poly(A))-dependent polypeptide synthesis. When the ribosomal complex with N-acetyl-[14C]phenylalanyl-tRNA (N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA) at the A site was subjected to bottromycin A2, the release of N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA was observed while no release of N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA from the donor site was observed, indicating that the action of bottromycin A2 is specific to the A site of ribosomes. Due to bottromycin's capacity to release [14C]Phe-tRNA or N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA from the ribosomal acceptor site (A site), bottromycin A2 inhibited the nonenzymatic binding of N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA and elongation factor T (EF-T)-dependent binding if the concentration of EF-Tu-GTP-[14C]Phe-tRNA ternary complex was low. Our data are consistent with the possibility that the inhibition of overall polypeptide synthesis by bottromycin A2 is at least partly due to bottromycin A2's activity to release aminoacyl- or oligopeptidyl-tRNA from ribosomes. Among 10 antibiotics tested, bottromycin A2 and lincomycin released aminoacyl-tRNA from ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1519176310,"Bacteriophage T4 synthesizes proline and serine tRNA species which are derived from a common precursor RNA. The processing of this precursor RNA involves the replacement of a U-A-A terminus in serine tRNA by C-C-A prior to precursor cleavage. In the present work we have examined in detail the cleavage of T4 proline-serine precursor RNA by the previously identified ribonuclease P. Ribonuclease P accurately cleaves precursor RNA terminating in either C-C-A or U-A-A to generate the 5' termini characteristic of both mature tRNA species. These cleavages do not depend solely on the nucleotide sequence of the precursor RNA since isolated oligonucleotides spanning the cleavage sites are not substrates for the enzyme. Two types of experiments show that RNase P kinetically favors precursor RNA ending C-C-A over that ending U-A-A. Isolated preparations of precursor RNA containing the C-C-A sequence were cleaved more rapidly by RNase P than precursor RNA ending U-A-A. In addition, the serine tRNA generated by limited cleavage of a mixed population of precursor RNA ending C-C-A or U-A-A was enriched 3-fold in the C-A-A sequence relative to the starting material. Bacteriophage T4 proline-serine precursor RNA, in contrast to other tRNA precursors, accumulates in measurable amounts in wild type cells. This accumulation would appear to be a consequence of the requirement for the generation of the C-C-A sequence prior to RNase P cleavage. The enzymic specificity of RNase P in vitro therefore reflects the in vivo pathway for serine tRNA biosynthesis, where the C-C-A sequence is synthesized while the serine tRNA sequence is still a part of the large precursor RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1510499343,"Qbeta replicase is a complex of four nonidentical subunits readily dissociable into two subcomplexes: 30 S ribosomal protein S1 and the phage-coded polypeptide (Subunits I + II) and protein synthesis elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-Ts (Subunits III + IV). The affinity of the two subcomplexes for one another increases with increasing ionic strength. The enzyme is capable of initiation of RNA synthesis with synthetic templates only when in the low ionic strength conformation. Elongation of initiated polynucleotide chains is not affectedby ionic strength. Addition of Qbeta RNA to the enzyme also alters its quaternary structure: the EF-Tu-Ts cannot be covalently attached to the other enzyme subunits with bifunctional cross-linking reagents in the presence of RNA. This conformational change is not influenced by ionic strength. The addition of Qbeta RNA to the enzyme, does not result in the release of EF-Tu-Ts from the other enzyme subunits: whereas free EF-Tu-Ts binds GDP independently of salt concentration, this binding by Qbeta replicase is sensitive to high ionic strength and remains so in the presence of Qbeta RNA. Furthermore, RNA does not allow the release of EF-Ts from EF-Tu by GTP as measured by sensitivity of EF-Ts activity to N-ethylmaleimide."

A partial amino acid sequence of each of the three subunits is presented. The pure enzyme with a specific activity of 73 units/mg of dry protein has an absorbance index (E1% 1 cm at 278 nm) of 6.2. The amino acid composition of the native enzyme is presented. In addition, the amounts of adenine, phosphate, taurine (from cysteamine), and ribose, present as a bound cofactor of unknown structure, have been estimated.

Temperature shift experiments of infected cultures show dramatic changes in the rate of DNA synthesis, while the polymerase activity in extracts remains constant. Unlike most temperature-sensitive systems in which the lesion can be traced to an unstable enzyme, L141 provides a unique example in which the catalytic properties of the enzyme and the change in the nature of the template caused by the increased temperature combine to reduce the rate of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1540526475,"The dissociation into dimers of apotryptophanase has been studied from two points of view: the nature of the interactions which govern the dimer-tetramer equilibrium and the effect of dissociation on the functional properties of the enzyme. It is shown that the order in which different anions are able to shift the dimer-tetramer equilibrium is that of the Hofmeister series, thus showing that the main contribution to the interaction between two dimers is of hydrophobic nature. It is also shown that, when dimeric apotryptophanase is incubated in the presence of its cofactor and substrate, the kinetics of appearance of active molecules is of second order in enzyme and is independent of the pyridoxal-P concentration; its rate constant has been determined (5-10(4) M-1 S-1). These results indicate that the reassociation of dimers into tetramers is the rate-limiting step in the appearance of enzymatic activity, and that the tryptophanase dimer is not functional."

https://openalex.org/W1521526753,"It has been shown previously that the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to Escherichia coli K 12 tryptophanase brings about an important conformational change of the protein. The way in which this structural change is transmitted from holoprotomers to apoprotomers is investigated here, using hybrid molecules (between apoprotomers and irreversibly saturated holoprotomers). It is shown that the binding of two or three coenzyme molecules per tetramer stabilizes the whole molecule against thermal inactivation and cold-induced dissociation. The change in conformation induced on an apoprotomer by the proximity of three holoprotomers is described, using three structural probes: the kinetics of binding of the cofactor and of 5'-phosphopyridoxyl-tryptophan (an analog of an intermediate in the catalytic reaction), and the reactivity of the essential cysteines. The kinetic anticooperatively in the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is confirmed, some of its parameters are determined, and its mechanism is interpreted in relation to the coupling between the protomers."
