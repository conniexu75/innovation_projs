https://openalex.org/W2279402243,"Close-up view of the nuclear periphery Cell biologists would like to be able to visualize complexes inside cells at molecular resolution. Several limitations, however, have prevented the field from realizing this goal. The thickness of most cells precludes cryo-electron tomography, a technique which itself does not provide sufficient contrast. Mahamid et al. successfully combined recent advances on both fronts to analyze structures in situ at the periphery of the nucleus. Their images reveal features that inform our understanding of the native organization of nuclear pores and of the nuclear lamina. Science , this issue p. 969"

For many applications, only dilute aqueous solutions are needed. Freakley et al. report an improvement in the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide over using palladium-tin alloys. This catalyst still achieves selectivities of &gt;95%, like palladium-gold alloys, but is cheaper and can suppress reactions that decompose the product. Science , this issue p. 965"

https://openalex.org/W2278345709,"Defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) underlie a spectrum of human conditions, ranging from devastating inborn errors of metabolism to aging. We performed a genome-wide Cas9-mediated screen to identify factors that are protective during RC inhibition. Our results highlight the hypoxia response, an endogenous program evolved to adapt to limited oxygen availability. Genetic or small-molecule activation of the hypoxia response is protective against mitochondrial toxicity in cultured cells and zebrafish models. Chronic hypoxia leads to a marked improvement in survival, body weight, body temperature, behavior, neuropathology, and disease biomarkers in a genetic mouse model of Leigh syndrome, the most common pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease. Further preclinical studies are required to assess whether hypoxic exposure can be developed into a safe and effective treatment for human diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."

Direct measurements in the Amazon, however, show that production remains constant or increases in the dry season. To investigate this mismatch, Wu et al. use tower-based cameras to detect the phenology (i.e., the seasonal patterns) of leaf dynamics in tropical tree crowns in Amazonia, Brazil, and relate this to patterns of CO 2 flux. Accounting for age-dependent variation among individual leaves and crowns is necessary for understanding the seasonal dynamics of photosynthesis in the entire ecosystem. Leaf phenology regulates seasonality of the carbon flux in tropical forests across a gradient of climate zones. Science , this issue p. 972"

Superlubricity detected with atomic force microscopy appears in examples like sliding large graphite flakes or gold nanoclusters across surfaces. However, the origin of the behavior is poorly understood due to the lack of a controllable nano-contact. We demonstrate graphene nanoribbons superlubricity when sliding on gold with a joint experimental and computational approach. The atomically well-defined contact allows us to trace the origin of superlubricity, unravelling the role played by edges, surface reconstruction and ribbon elasticity. Our results pave the way to the scale-up of superlubricity toward the realization of frictionless coatings."
https://openalex.org/W2303706388,"Oocytes differentiate in diverse species by receiving organelles and cytoplasm from sister germ cells while joined in germline cysts or syncytia. Mouse primordial germ cells form germline cysts, but the role of cysts in oogenesis is unknown. We find that mouse germ cells receive organelles from neighboring cyst cells and build a Balbiani body to become oocytes, whereas nurselike germ cells die. Organelle movement, Balbiani body formation, and oocyte fate determination are selectively blocked by low levels of microtubule-dependent transport inhibitors. Membrane breakdown within the cyst and an apoptosis-like process are associated with organelle transfer into the oocyte, events reminiscent of nurse cell dumping in Drosophila We propose that cytoplasmic and organelle transport plays an evolutionarily conserved and functionally important role in mammalian oocyte differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2278535118,"The Pseudomonas fluorescens complex includes Pseudomonas strains that have been taxonomically assigned to more than fifty different species, many of which have been described as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) with potential applications in biocontrol and biofertilization. So far the phylogeny of this complex has been analyzed according to phenotypic traits, 16S rDNA, MLSA and inferred by whole-genome analysis. However, since most of the type strains have not been fully sequenced and new species are frequently described, correlation between taxonomy and phylogenomic analysis is missing. In recent years, the genomes of a large number of strains have been sequenced, showing important genomic heterogeneity and providing information suitable for genomic studies that are important to understand the genomic and genetic diversity shown by strains of this complex. Based on MLSA and several whole-genome sequence-based analyses of 93 sequenced strains, we have divided the P. fluorescens complex into eight phylogenomic groups that agree with previous works based on type strains. Digital DDH (dDDH) identified 69 species and 75 subspecies within the 93 genomes. The eight groups corresponded to clustering with a threshold of 31.8% dDDH, in full agreement with our MLSA. The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) approach showed inconsistencies regarding the assignment to species and to the eight groups. The small core genome of 1,334 CDSs and the large pan-genome of 30,848 CDSs, show the large diversity and genetic heterogeneity of the P. fluorescens complex. However, a low number of strains were enough to explain most of the CDSs diversity at core and strain-specific genomic fractions. Finally, the identification and analysis of group-specific genome and the screening for distinctive characters revealed a phylogenomic distribution of traits among the groups that provided insights into biocontrol and bioremediation applications as well as their role as PGPR."

Some activities, however, need to occur out of phase with the core clock. Liang et al. imaged changes in intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ in populations of neurons in the fruit fly brain. Although the underlying clock was synchronous, the rhythms of Ca 2+ changes corresponded with distinct timing of activities associated with activity of the particular neuronal populations. Proper coordination of these distinct phases required expression of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor and its receptor. Science , this issue p. 976"
https://openalex.org/W2276595334,"The complexity of quantum many-body systems originates from the interplay of strong interactions, quantum statistics, and the large number of quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom. Probing these systems on a microscopic level with single-site resolution offers important insights. Here we report site-resolved imaging of two-component fermionic Mott insulators, metals, and band insulators using ultracold atoms in a square lattice. For strong repulsive interactions we observe two-dimensional Mott insulators containing over 400 atoms. For intermediate interactions, we observe a coexistence of phases. From comparison to theory we find trap-averaged entropies per particle of $1.0\,k_{\mathrm{B}}$. In the band-insulator we find local entropies as low as $0.5\,k_{\mathrm{B}}$. Access to local observables will aid the understanding of fermionic many-body systems in regimes inaccessible by modern theoretical methods."

Chemists have resolved this shortcoming through the use of chiral conjugate bases. While the proton activates the substrate, the nearby counterion asymmetrically biases the space around it. Gatzenmeier et al. extend this approach to Lewis acid catalysis by silyl cations, which can activate a variety of substrates in complementary fashion to protons (see the Perspective by Dumoulin and Masson).

https://openalex.org/W2320871807,"Face recognition is used to prove identity across a wide variety of settings. Despite this, research consistently shows that people are typically rather poor at matching faces to photos. Some professional groups, such as police and passport officers, have been shown to perform just as poorly as the general public on standard tests of face recognition. However, face recognition skills are subject to wide individual variation, with some people showing exceptional ability—a group that has come to be known as ‘super-recognisers’. The Metropolitan Police Force (London) recruits ‘super-recognisers’ from within its ranks, for deployment on various identification tasks. Here we test four working super-recognisers from within this police force, and ask whether they are really able to perform at levels above control groups. We consistently find that the police ‘super-recognisers’ perform at well above normal levels on tests of unfamiliar and familiar face matching, with degraded as well as high quality images. Recruiting employees with high levels of skill in these areas, and allocating them to relevant tasks, is an efficient way to overcome some of the known difficulties associated with unfamiliar face recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2283529215,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public health and socio-economic issues in the 21st century globally. Assessment of TB treatment outcomes, and monitoring and evaluation of its risk factors in Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) are among the major indicators of the performance of a national TB control program. Hence, this institution-based retrospective study was conducted to determine the treatment outcome of TB patients and investigate factors associated with unsuccessful outcome at Dilla University Referral Hospital, southern Ethiopia. Five years (2008 to 2013) TB record of TB clinic of the hospital was reviewed. A total 1537 registered TB patients with complete information were included. Of these, 942 (61.3%) were male, 1015 (66%) were from rural areas, 544 (35.4%) were smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB+), 816 (53.1%) were smear negative pulmonary TB (PTB-) and 177(11.5%) were extra pulmonary TB (EPTB) patients. Records of the 1537 TB patients showed that 181 (11.8%) were cured, 1129(73.5%) completed treatment, 171 (11.1%) defaulted, 52 (3.4%) died and 4 (0.3%) had treatment failure. The overall mean treatment success rate of the TB patients was 85.2%. The treatment success rate of the TB patients increased from 80.5% in September 2008-August 2009 to 84.8% in September 2012–May 2013. Tuberculosis type, age, residence and year of treatment were significantly associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome. The risk of unsuccessful outcome was significantly higher among TB patients from rural areas (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.21–2.20) compared to their urban counterparts. Unsuccessful treatment outcome was also observed in PTB- patients (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.26–2.50) and EPTB (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.28–3.37) compared to the PTB+ patients. In conclusion, it appears that DOTS have improved treatment success in the hospital during five years. Regular follow-up of patients with poor treatment outcome and provision of health information on TB treatment to patients from rural area is recommended."

https://openalex.org/W2283502293,"The μ-opioid receptor (MOR, encoded by Oprm1) agonists are the mainstay analgesics for treating moderate to severe pain. Nerve injury causes down-regulation of MORs in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and diminishes the opioid effect on neuropathic pain. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the diminished MOR expression caused by nerve injury are not clear. G9a (encoded by Ehmt2), a histone 3 at lysine 9 methyltransferase, is a key chromatin regulator responsible for gene silencing. In this study, we determined the role of G9a in diminished MOR expression and opioid analgesic effects in animal models of neuropathic pain. We found that nerve injury in rats induced a long-lasting reduction in the expression level of MORs in the DRG but not in the spinal cord. Nerve injury consistently increased the enrichment of the G9a product histone 3 at lysine 9 dimethylation in the promoter of Oprm1 in the DRG. G9a inhibition or siRNA knockdown fully reversed MOR expression in the injured DRG and potentiated the morphine effect on pain hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury. In mice lacking Ehmt2 in DRG neurons, nerve injury failed to reduce the expression level of MORs and the morphine effect. In addition, G9a inhibition or Ehmt2 knockout in DRG neurons normalized nerve injury-induced reduction in the inhibitory effect of the opioid on synaptic glutamate release from primary afferent nerves. Our findings indicate that G9a contributes critically to transcriptional repression of MORs in primary sensory neurons in neuropathic pain.

https://openalex.org/W2278487427,"Antarctic residence holds many challenges to human physiology, like increased psycho-social tension and altered circadian rhythm, known to influence sleep. We assessed changes in sleep patterns during 13 months of overwintering at the German Stations Neumayer II and III from 2008 to 2014, with focus on gender, as many previous investigations were inconclusive regarding gender-based differences or had only included men.Time in bed, sleep time, sleep efficiency, number of arousals, sleep latency, sleep onset, sleep offset, and physical activity level were determined twice per month during seven overwintering campaigns of n = 54 participants (37 male, 17 female) using actimetry. Data were analyzed using polynomial regression and analysis of covariance for change over time with the covariates gender, inhabited station, overwintering season and influence of physical activity and local sunshine radiation.We found overall longer times in bed (p = 0.004) and sleep time (p = 0.014) for women. The covariate gender had a significant influence on time in bed (p<0.001), sleep time (p<0.001), number of arousals (p = 0.04), sleep latency (p = 0.04), and sleep onset (p<0.001). Women separately (p = 0.02), but not men (p = 0.165), showed a linear increase in number of arousals. Physical activity decreased over overwintering time for men (p = 0.003), but not for women (p = 0.174). The decline in local sunshine radiation led to a 48 minutes longer time in bed (p<0.001), 3.8% lower sleep efficiency (p<0.001), a delay of 32 minutes in sleep onset (p<0.001), a delay of 54 minutes in sleep offset (p<0.001), and 11% less daily energy expenditure (p<0.001), for all participants in reaction to the Antarctic winter's darkness-phase.Overwinterings at the Stations Neumayer II and III are associated with significant changes in sleep patterns, with dependences from overwintering time and local sunshine radiation. Gender appears to be an influence, as women showed a declining sleep quality, despite that their physical activity remained unchanged, suggesting other causes such as a higher susceptibility to psycho-social stress and changes in environmental circadian rhythm during long-term isolation in Antarctica."
https://openalex.org/W2293181095,"Recent data shows that fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) binds to and controls the function of the voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel with phenotypic outcomes on neuronal excitability. Mutations in the FGF14 gene in humans have been associated with brain disorders that are partially recapitulated in Fgf14–/– mice. Thus, signaling pathways that modulate the FGF14:Nav channel interaction may be important therapeutic targets. Bioluminescence-based screening of small molecule modulators of the FGF14:Nav1.6 complex identified 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB), a potent casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitor, as a strong suppressor of FGF14:Nav1.6 interaction. Inhibition of CK2 through TBB reduces the interaction of FGF14 with Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 channels. Mass spectrometry confirmed direct phosphorylation of FGF14 by CK2 at S228 and S230, and mutation to alanine at these sites modified FGF14 modulation of Nav1.6-mediated currents. In 1 d in vitro hippocampal neurons, TBB induced a reduction in FGF14 expression, a decrease in transient Na+ current amplitude, and a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of Nav channel steady-state inactivation. In mature neurons, TBB reduces the axodendritic polarity of FGF14. In cornu ammonis area 1 hippocampal slices from wild-type mice, TBB impairs neuronal excitability by increasing action potential threshold and lowering firing frequency. Importantly, these changes in excitability are recapitulated in Fgf14–/– mice, and deletion of Fgf14 occludes TBB-dependent phenotypes observed in wild-type mice. These results suggest that a CK2-FGF14 axis may regulate Nav channels and neuronal excitability.—Hsu, W.-C. J., Scala, F., Nenov, M. N., Wildburger, N. C., Elferink, H., Singh, A. K., Chesson, C.

https://openalex.org/W2286104098,"Background Recent advances in culture-independent approaches have enabled insights into the diversity, complexity, and individual variability of gut microbial communities. Objectives To examine the effect of oral administration of Saccharomyces (S.) boulardii and mode of delivery on the intestinal microbial community in preterm infants. Study Design Stool samples were collected from preterm newborns randomly divided into two groups: a probiotic-receiving group (n = 18) or a placebo group (n = 21). Samples were collected before probiotic intake (day 0), and after 2 and 6 weeks of supplementation. The composition of colonizing bacteria was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of fecal samples using the Ion 16S Metagenomics Kit and the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine platform. Results A total of 11932257 reads were generated, and were clustered into 459, 187, and 176 operational taxonomic units at 0 days, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks, respectively. Of the 17 identified phyla, Firmicutes Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were universal. The microbial community differed at day 0 compared with at 2 weeks and 6 weeks. There was a tendency for increased bacterial diversity at 2 weeks and 6 weeks compared with day 0, and infants with a gestational age of 31 weeks or higher presented increased bacterial diversity prior to S. boulardii administration. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria remained stable during the observation period, whereas Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased in abundance, the latter particularly more sharply in vaginally delivered infants. Conclusion While the mode of delivery may influence the development of a microbial community, this study had not enough power to detect statistical differences between cohorts supplemented with probiotics, and in a consequence, to speculate on S. boulardii effect on gut microbiome composition in preterm newborns."
https://openalex.org/W1955761229,"Microgravity, or an altered gravity environment different from the 1 g of the Earth, has been shown to influence global gene expression patterns and protein levels in cultured cells. However, most of the reported studies that have been conducted in space or by using simulated microgravity on the ground have focused on the growth or differentiation of these cells. It has not been specifically addressed whether nonproliferating cultured cells will sense the presence of microgravity in space. In an experiment conducted onboard the International Space Station, confluent human fibroblast cells were fixed after being cultured in space for 3 and 14 d, respectively, to investigate changes in gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in these cells. Results of the experiment showed that on d 3, both the flown and ground cells were still proliferating slowly, as measured by the percentage of Ki-67(+) cells. Gene and miRNA expression data indicated activation of NF-κB and other growth-related pathways that involve hepatocyte growth factor and VEGF as well as the down-regulation of the Let-7 miRNA family. On d 14, when the cells were mostly nonproliferating, the gene and miRNA expression profile of the flight sample was indistinguishable from that of the ground sample. Comparison of gene and miRNA expressions in the d 3 samples, with respect to d 14, revealed that most of the changes observed on d 3 were related to cell growth for both the flown and ground cells. Analysis of cytoskeletal changes via immunohistochemistry staining of the cells with antibodies for α-tubulin and fibronectin showed no difference between the flown and ground samples. Taken together, our study suggests that in true nondividing human fibroblast cells in culture, microgravity experienced in space has little effect on gene and miRNA expression profiles.-Zhang, Y., Lu, T., Wong, M., Wang, X., Stodieck, L., Karouia, F., Story, M., Wu, H.

As the oldest extant animals, sponges are good candidates for possessing remnants of the molecules responsible for this crucial evolutionary innovation. Cell adhesion in sponges is mediated by the calcium-dependent multivalent self-interactions of sulfated polysaccharides components of extracellular membrane-bound proteoglycans, namely aggregation factors. Here, we used atomic force microscopy to demonstrate that the aggregation factor of the sponge Desmapsamma anchorata has a circular supramolecular structure and that it thus belongs to the spongican family. Its sulfated polysaccharide units, which were characterized via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, consist preponderantly of a central backbone composed of 3-α-Glc1 units partially sulfated at 2- and 4-positions and branches of Pyr(4,6)α-Gal1→3-α-Fuc2(SO3)1→3-α-Glc4(SO3)1→3-α-Glc→4-linked to the central α-Glc units. Single-molecule force measurements of self-binding forces of this sulfated polysaccharide and their chemically desulfated and carboxyl-reduced derivatives revealed that the sulfate epitopes and extracellular calcium are essential for providing the strength and stability necessary to sustain cell adhesion in sponges.

Its sulfated polysaccharide units, which were characterized via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, consist preponderantly of a central backbone composed of 3-α-Glc1 units partially sulfated at 2- and 4-positions and branches of Pyr(4,6)α-Gal1→3-α-Fuc2(SO3)1→3-α-Glc4(SO3)1→3-α-Glc→4-linked to the central α-Glc units. Single-molecule force measurements of self-binding forces of this sulfated polysaccharide and their chemically desulfated and carboxyl-reduced derivatives revealed that the sulfate epitopes and extracellular calcium are essential for providing the strength and stability necessary to sustain cell adhesion in sponges. We further discuss these findings within the framework of the role of molecular structures in the early evolution of metazoans. Molecular clock estimates, paleobiogeochemical evidence, and the most widely accepted phylogenetic inferences place sponges (phylum Porifera) at the root of the metazoan tree as the oldest extant multicellular animals (1Fernàndez-Busquets X.

Such ancestry makes modern sponges suitable organisms for studying the cellular and molecular aspects of the evolution of multicellularity (5Fernàndez-Busquets X. Körnig A. Bucior I. Burger M.M.

Evol. 2009; 26: 2551-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A pivotal feature of metazoans is their cell adhesion molecular machinery, which directs the formation and maintenance of a distinctive multicellular morphology (6Knoll A. The multiple origins of complex multicellularity.Annu. Rev. Earth Planet Sci. 2011; 39: 217-239Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In most animals, protein interactions, such as those in the cell junctions of epithelia, mediate cell adhesion (7Abedin M. King N. Diverse evolutionary paths to cell adhesion.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 734-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); however, sponge multicellularity is sustained by a characteristic cell adhesion and recognition mechanism based on specific carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (8Jarchow J.

Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Carbohydrates have vast structural plasticity, ubiquitous distribution in vertebrate and invertebrate tissues, and are commonly associated with the cell surface (9Bucior I. Burger M.M. Carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions in cell recognition.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate self-adhesion is maintained by relatively weak forces that can increase in orders of magnitude upon the multimerization of individual epitopes into polysaccharides (10Spillmann D.

Some examples of specific carbohydrate self-interactions include the multivalent binding of Lewisx epitopes involved in the first steps of embryogenesis (11Eggens I. Fenderson B. Toyokuni T. Dean B.

In the marine sponge Microciona prolifera the AF is constructed by a protein core attached to two different carbohydrate units: a small 6-kDa glycan that mediates the interaction of the AF with putative receptors present in the cell membrane and a larger 200-kDa sulfated polysaccharide, which binds homophilically with identical units on the AFs of adjacent cells (13Bucior I.

Certainly, the multivalent self-interactions of sulfated polysaccharides from AFs mediate cell adhesion in sponges (17Bucior I. Burger M.M. Carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction as a major force initiating cell-cell recognition.Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assays using living sponge cells incubated in the presence of antibodies raised against AF glycans or in high concentrations of their homologous sulfated polysaccharides themselves demonstrated that these molecules must be physiologically available to promote cell adhesion (18Misevic G.N.

Two central features of this self-interaction process are calcium dependence and species specificity, as broadly demonstrated using cell-free techniques, including bead aggregation experiments, affinity chromatography, membrane blot assays, and force spectroscopy (e.g. Refs. 13Bucior I.

Quantitative and qualitative approach of glycan-glycan interactions in marine sponges.Biochimie. 2003; 85: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Studies using single-molecule force spectroscopy have shown that the average self-interaction forces of sulfated polysaccharides from AFs in the presence of calcium lies between 190 and 310 piconewtons, depending on the species studied (13Bucior I. Scheuring S. Engel A. Burger M.M. Carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction provides adhesion force and specificity for cellular recognition.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The binding forces between homologous sulfated polysaccharides from AFs are significantly stronger than between those from different species, confirming the specificity of those interactions (13Bucior I. Scheuring S. Engel A. Burger M.M. Carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction provides adhesion force and specificity for cellular recognition.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The chemical analysis of AF-sulfated polysaccharides revealed unique structures, with distinct sugar compositions and sulfation patterns for each species studied (e.g. Refs. 21Zierer M.S. Mourão P.A.

Porifera Research: Biodiversity, nnovation, and Sustainability. Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil2007: 653-659Google Scholar). Moreover, these sulfated polysaccharides present highly complex compositions, with several different sugars per motif, including acidic sugars such as pyruvated-galactose and hexuronic acid (23Vilanova E. Zilberberg C. Kochem M. Custódio M.R. Mourão P.A.S.

The presence of sulfate and carboxyl groups is an important chemical feature of these molecules because they represent sites for anionic charged ligands (24Lindahl U. Höök M. Glycosaminoglycans and their binding to biological macromolecules.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Currently the AF-mediated mechanism of sponge cell adhesion has been thoroughly characterized; however, the chemical nature of the homophilic and calcium-dependent interactions between their sulfated polysaccharides were only speculated (20Popescu O.

Therefore, to further investigate the epitopes involved in these interactions, we determined the self-binding capabilities of native and chemically modified (carboxyl-reduced and desulfated) sulfated polysaccharides purified from the marine sponge Desmapsamma anchorata (DaSP) using affinity chromatography, bead aggregation assays, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS). The supramolecular structure and self-binding force profile of the AF from D. anchorata (DAF) was described using AFM imaging and SMFS, and the complex and unique structure of its sulfated polysaccharide was fully determined using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Overall, the data obtained further elucidate the self-interaction mechanism in AF-sulfated polysaccharides, which are then discussed within the context of the role of early cell adhesion in the evolution of metazoans. The marine sponge D. anchorata was collected at Ilha Grande Bay, Brazil. Sponge samples collected for the extraction of sulfated polysaccharides were immediately fixed in 70% ethanol. Samples collected for the extraction of aggregation factors were transported to the laboratory immersed in seawater and maintained in an aquarium at 18 °C until further utilization. Fresh samples of D. anchorata were rinsed in calcium- and magnesium-free artificial sea water (CMFBSW) (0.49 m NaCl, 11 mm KCl, 7 mm Na2SO4, 2.1 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.4)), cut into small pieces, incubated in CMFBSW for 4 h at 4 °C, squeezed through a 210-mm nylon mesh, and then centrifuged to remove cells and large particles. Proteoglycans were precipitated by increasing calcium concentration to 30 mm. The gel-like precipitate was homogenized in CMFBSW supplemented with 20 mm Tris (CMFTSW) and 2 mm CaCl2, and proteoglycans were precipitated at 35,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Purification of aggregation factor was performed via centrifugation in a cesium chloride gradient (50% CsCl in CMFTSW + 2 mm CaCl2) at 38,000 × g for 48 h at 4 °C. Purified aggregation factor was dialyzed against CMFTSW + 2 mm CaCl2 and stored in 0.05 NaN3 for further utilization. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid kit (Sigma). Samples of D. anchorata were cut into small pieces, immersed three times in acetone, and dried at 60 °C. Total sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from the dried tissues (100 g) via extensive papain digestion. The extracts were partially purified via cethylpyridinium and ethanol precipitations, as described for other invertebrate tissues (28Vilanova E. Coutinho C. Maia G. Mourão P.A. Sulfated polysaccharides from marine sponges: conspicuous distribution among different cell types and involvement on formation of in vitro cell aggregates.Cell Tissue Res. 2010; 340: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Approximately 500 mg (dry weight) of crude extracts were obtained for each batch. These crude extracts (50 mg) were applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (Sigma) equilibrated with 5 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA (Sigma) and linked to a HPLC system (Shimadzu). The sulfated polysaccharide was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of 0 to 3 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml·min−1. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and checked via a metachromatic assay using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (28Vilanova E. Coutinho C. Maia G. Mourão P.A. Sulfated polysaccharides from marine sponges: conspicuous distribution among different cell types and involvement on formation of in vitro cell aggregates.Cell Tissue Res. 2010; 340: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and by measuring conductivity to estimate NaCl concentration. The fractions containing the sulfated polysaccharide were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. Purified DaSP (15 μg) and a mixture of standard glycosaminoglycans (dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin 6-sulfate; 5 μg of each; Sigma) were applied to an agarose (0.5%) gel. The electrophoresis was run for 1 h at 110 V in 0.05 m 1,3-diaminopropane acetate (pH 9.0). Sulfated polysaccharides in the gel were fixed with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide solution for 12 h, dried, and then stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 0.1:5:5 (v/v) acetic acid:ethanol:water. Molecular weight of purified DaSP (1 mg) was determined via gel permeation chromatography using a Superose 12 HR 16/70 column (GE Healthcare) linked to a HPLC system (Shimadzu) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.4). Dextrans with different molecular masses (300, 150, 60, and 25 kDa; Sigma) were used as standard molecular weight markers. The polysaccharides were eluted from the column using the equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min−1 and monitored by differential refractive index. The chemical analysis was performed as described elsewhere (19Vilanova E. Coutinho C.C. Mourão P.A. Sulfated polysaccharides from marine sponges (Porifera): an ancestor cell-cell adhesion event based on the carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction.Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, total hexose and pyruvated-sugar contents were estimated by the phenol-H2SO4 reaction and carbazole reaction, respectively. After acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharides (6.0 m trifluoroacetic acid for 5 h at 100 °C), sulfate was measured by the BaCl2-gelatin method. The percentage of different monosaccharides was estimated by gas-liquid chromatography of derivative alditol acetates. 1H and 13C one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra of native DaSP were recorded using a Bruker DRX 800 MHz apparatus (Bruker) with a triple resonance probe, as detailed previously (29Aquino R.S. Pereira M.S. Vairo B.C. Cinelli L.P. Santos G.R. Fonseca R.J. Mourão P.A. Heparins from porcine and bovine intestinal mucosa: are they similar drugs?.Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 103: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). About 20 mg of DaSP were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 99.9% deuterium oxide (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory). All spectra were recorded at 50 °C with HOD suppression by presaturation. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum was recorded with 16 scans. Two-dimensional 1H,1H COSY (correlation spectroscopy), NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy), TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy), 13C,1H multiplicity-edited HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence), and 13C,1H HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bound coherence) spectra were recorded using states-time proportion phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the indirect dimension. Phase-sensitive 1H,1H TOCSY spectra were run as previously described (30Bax A. Davis D.G. Practical aspects of two-dimensional transverse NOE spectroscopy.J. Magn.

Differences in α-fucose branch structures of sea cucumber fucosylated chondroitin sulfates do not affect their anticoagulant activity.Glycobiology. 2015; 25: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with 4046 × 400 points with a spin-lock field of 10 kHz and a mix time of 80 ms. 13C,1H HSQC spectra were run with 1024 × 256 points and globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulses for decoupling. 13C,1H HMBC spectrum was recorded with 1024 × 256 points, with a 60-ms delay for evolution of long-range couplings and was set with no decoupling during acquisition time. Chemical shifts are displayed relative to external trimethylsilylpropionic acid at 0 ppm for 1H and relative to methanol for 13C. Native DaSP (50 mg) was submitted to desulfation or carboxyl-reduction reactions. Desulfation of DaSP was performed via solvolysis (two rounds) in dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol (9:1, v/v) at 80 °C for 6 h, as previously described (32Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Solvolytic desulfation of glycosaminoglycuronan sulfates with dimethyl sulfoxide containing water or methanol.Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Reduction of the carboxyl groups present in pyruvated sugars was carried out using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-NaBH4 as previously described (33Taylor R.L. Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Stoichiometric reduction of uronic acid carboxyl groups in polysaccharides.in: Whistler R.L. Wolfrom M.L. BeMiller J.N. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. Vol. 7. Academic Press, New York1976: 149-151Crossref Google Scholar). Modified DaSP were concentrated using 100-kDa Amicon filtration units (Millipore) and then lyophilized. The effectiveness of these chemical modifications was checked via chemical analysis as described above. Native DaSP was coupled to Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) using a standard coupling procedure. Briefly, 50 mg of the native DaSP in 5 ml of coupling solution (50 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaHCO3 (pH 8.2)) were mixed with 3 ml of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-4B, and coupling was carried out as described by the manufacturer (Sigma). Affinity chromatographies were carried out using two different solutions: 10 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.0 supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. Native, desulfated, or carboxyl-reduced DaSP (1 mg of each) were applied to the column (3 ml), linked to a HPLC system (Shimadzu), and eluted using a linear gradient of 0 to 3 m NaCl at 0.5 ml·min−1. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and checked for hexose content (19Vilanova E. Coutinho C.C. Mourão P.A. Sulfated polysaccharides from marine sponges (Porifera): an ancestor cell-cell adhesion event based on the carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction.Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and by measuring conductivity to estimate NaCl concentrations. Briefly, 5 × 108 freshly sonified amidine-modified fluorescent latex beads (1 μm in diameter, Life Technologies) were incubated with native, desulfated, or carboxyl-reduced DaSP (2 mg·ml−1) in CMFTSW supplemented with 2 mg of EDAC (N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide; Sigma) and 1 mg of S-NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide; Sigma) overnight at 4 °C and then washed in CMFTSW. The coupling efficiency was determined by measuring the hexose content (19Vilanova E. Coutinho C.C. Mourão P.A. Sulfated polysaccharides from marine sponges (Porifera): an ancestor cell-cell adhesion event based on the carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction.Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) on the beads after reversing the EDAC/S-NHS cross-linking through acid hydrolysis. Approximately 107 beads coated with native or modified DaSP were diluted in 600 μl of CMFTSW supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA and incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking. Images of bead aggregates were acquired using an EVOS FL microscope (Life Technologies). The number of aggregates was calculated using the imaging analysis software Leica QWin (Leica). All of the assays were made in triplicate, and the number of aggregates was compared via analysis of variance using Origin-Pro 8.0 (OriginLab). DAF AFM imaging was acquired under ambient conditions in the tapping mode of operation using standard monolithic Si cantilevers Tap300AI (NanoAndMore) on a commercial instrument Multimode Nanoscope IIIa (Veeco). Substrate muscovite mica surfaces (Plano) were gas phase-silanized with aminopropyl triethoxysilane (Sigma) in a desiccator and overlaid with 50 μl of DAF solution (0.5 mg·ml−1) for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were washed with Milli-Q water and dried under N2 flow. A MFP-3D atomic force microscope (Asylum Research) was used to measure the self-binding forces between DAF and native and chemically modified DaSPs. DAF was adsorbed on gold-coated NPG cantilevers (Bruker), and gold substrates were prepared according to the template-stripped gold method (34Hegner M. Wagner P. Semenza G. Ultralarge atomically flat template-stripped Au surfaces for scanning probe microscopy.Surf. Sci. 1993; 291: 39-46Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar). DAF adsorption was performed overlaying the gold-coated cantilevers and substrates with a solution of 0.5 mg·ml−1 purified DAF in CMFTSW + 2 mm CaCl2 for 1–2 h at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2336609578,"It has been recognized that the rate-limiting function of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in glycolysis plays an important role in distributing glycolytic intermediates for anabolic and catabolic purposes in cancer cells. However, after analysis of the catalytic capacity of PKM2 relative to other glycolytic enzymes, the regulation range of PKM2 activity, metabolic flux control, and thermodynamics, we suggest that the PKM2-catalyzed reaction is not a rate-limiting step in cancer cell glycolysis. Hexokinase and phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), the first and third enzyme along the pathway, are rate-limiting enzymes that limit the overall glycolytic rate, whereas PKM2 and lactate dehydrogenase, the last two enzymes in the pathway, are for the fast removal of upstream intermediates to prevent the obstruction of the pathway. The argument is in accordance with the catalytic capacity of glycolytic enzymes, regulation range of enzyme activities, metabolic flux control, and thermodynamics.

Hexokinase and phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), the first and third enzyme along the pathway, are rate-limiting enzymes that limit the overall glycolytic rate, whereas PKM2 and lactate dehydrogenase, the last two enzymes in the pathway, are for the fast removal of upstream intermediates to prevent the obstruction of the pathway. The argument is in accordance with the catalytic capacity of glycolytic enzymes, regulation range of enzyme activities, metabolic flux control, and thermodynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2292256428,"Fetal nicotine exposure increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life. The present study tested the hypothesis that perinatal nicotine-induced programming of heart ischemia-sensitive phenotype is mediated by enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in offspring. Nicotine was administered to pregnant rats via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps from day 4 of gestation to day 10 after birth, in the absence or presence of a ROS inhibitor, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in drinking water. Experiments were conducted in 8 month old age male offspring. Isolated hearts were perfused in a Langendorff preparation. Perinatal nicotine treatment significantly increased ischemia and reperfusion-induced left ventricular injury, and decreased post-ischemic recovery of left ventricular function and coronary flow rate. In addition, nicotine enhanced cardiac ROS production and significantly attenuated protein kinase Cε (PKCε) protein abundance in the heart. Although nicotine had no effect on total cardiac glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) protein expression, it significantly increased the phosphorylation of GSK3β at serine 9 residue in the heart. NAC inhibited nicotine-mediated increase in ROS production, recovered PKCε gene expression and abrogated increased phosphorylation of GSK3β. Of importance, NAC blocked perinatal nicotine-induced increase in ischemia and reperfusion injury in the heart. These findings provide novel evidence that increased oxidative stress plays a causal role in perinatal nicotine-induced developmental programming of ischemic sensitive phenotype in the heart, and suggest potential therapeutic targets of anti-oxidative stress in the treatment of ischemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2294042060,"An important barrier for axon regeneration and recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is attributed to the scar that is formed at the lesion site. Here, we investigated the effect of mouse mast cell protease (mMCP) 6, a mast cell (MC)-specific tryptase, on scarring and functional recovery after a spinal cord hemisection injury. Functional recovery was significantly impaired in both MC-deficient and mMCP6-knockout (mMCP62/2) mice after SCI compared with wild-type control mice. This decrease in locomotor performance was associated with an increased lesion size and excessive scarring at the injury site. Axon growth-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and the extracellular matrix components fibronectin, laminin, and collagen IV were significantly up-regulated in MC-deficient and mMCP6–/– mice, with an increase in scar volume between 23 and 32%. A degradation assay revealed that mMCP6 directly cleaves fibronectin and collagen IV in vitro. In addition, gene expression levels of the scar components fibronectin, aggrecan, and collagen IV were increased up to 6.8-fold in mMCP6–/– mice in the subacute phase after injury. These data indicate that endogenous mMCP6 has scar-suppressing properties after SCI via indirect cleavage of axon growth-inhibitory scar components and alteration of the gene expression profile of these factors.—Vangansewinkel, T., Geurts, N., Quanten, K., Nelissen, S., Lemmens, S., Geboes, L., Dooley, D., Vidal, P.

https://openalex.org/W2281503230,"Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) are some of the most commonly treated infections in hospitals, and place heavy economic burdens on patients and society. Here we report the findings from an analysis of cSSTI based on a retrospective study which was conducted within the Chinese inpatient population. We focused our research on the analysis of the patient population, antibiotic treatment, clinical outcome and economic burden. The study population comprised 527 selected patients hospitalized between 2008 and 2013. Among the hospitalizations with microbiological diagnoses, 61.41% (n = 113) were diagnosed as infected with Gram-positive bacteria, while 46.20% (n = 85) were infected with Gram-negative bacteria. The most commonly found Gram-positive bacteria was Staphylococcus aureus (40.76%, n = 75), and the most common Gram-negative bacteria was Escherichia coli (14.13%, n = 26). About 20% of the Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant. The resistance rate of isolated Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli to penicillin was around 90%; in contrast, the resistance rate to vancomycin, linezolid or imipenem was low (<20%). A large percentage of patients were treated with cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, while vancomycin and imipenem were also included to treat drug-resistant pathogens. Over half of the hospitalizations (58.43%, n = 336) experienced treatment modifications. The cost to patients with antibiotic modifications was relatively higher than to those without. In conclusion, our study offers an analysis of the disease characteristics, microbiological diagnoses, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of cSSTI in four hospitals in Guangdong Province, and sheds lights on the current clinical management of cSSTI in China."
https://openalex.org/W2287562384,"The physical activity practice is highlighted as a strategy to health promotion and to avoid chronic diseases. In addition to individual factors, environmental characteristics in which people live, may offer opportunities or barriers in adopting healthy habits and this is related to the physical activity (PA) practice among individuals. The aim of this study is to investigate the associations between neighborhood environment and leisure-time physical activity in adults. This is a cross-sectional study, developed using the database of Surveillance System for Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey (VIGITEL 2008/2010) of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Individuals with the habit of practicing PA for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity PA or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity PA throughout the week in leisure time were classified as active in leisure time. To characterize the built and social environment we used georeferenced data of public and private places for physical activity, population density, residential density, homicide rate and total income of the coverage area of the basic health units. The covered area of the basic health units was used as context unit. For data analysis, we used multilevel logistic regression. The study included 5779 adults, 58.77% female. There was variability of physical activity in leisure time between area covered by the basic health units (Median Odds ratio = 1.30). After adjusting for individual characteristics, the increase of density of private places for physical activity (Odds ratios-OR = 1.31; 95% confidence interval-95% CI: 1.15 to 1.48) and the smaller homicide rate (OR = 0.82; IC95%: 0.70 to 0.96) in the neighborhood increased physical activity in leisure time. The evidence of this study shows that neighborhood environment may influence the physical activity practice in leisure time and should be considered in future interventions and health promotion strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2280354548,"The estimation of maturity and sex of fish stocks in European waters is a requirement of the EU Data Collection Framework as part of the policy to improve fisheries management. On the other hand, research on fish biology is increasingly focused in molecular approaches, researchers needing correct identification of fish sex and reproductive stage without necessarily having in house the histological know-how necessary for the task. Taking advantage of the differential gene transcription occurring during fish sex differentiation and gametogenesis, the utility of 5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA) and General transcription factor IIIA (gtf3a) in the molecular identification of sex and gametogenic stage was tested in different economically-relevant fish species from the Bay of Biscay. Gonads of 9 fish species (, Atlantic, Atlantic-chub and horse mackerel, blue whiting, bogue, European anchovy, hake and pilchard and megrim), collected from local commercial fishing vessels were histologically sexed and 5S and 18S rRNA concentrations were quantified by capillary electrophoresis to calculate a 5S/18S rRNA index. Degenerate primers permitted cloning and sequencing of gtf3a fragments in 7 of the studied species. 5S rRNA and gtf3a transcript levels, together with 5S/18S rRNA index, distinguished clearly ovaries from testis in all of the studied species. The values were always higher in females than in males. 5S/18S rRNA index values in females were always highest when fish were captured in early phases of ovary development whilst, in later vitellogenic stages, the values decreased significantly. In megrim and European anchovy, where gonads in different oogenesis stages were obtained, the 5S/18S rRNA index identified clearly gametogenic stage. This approach, to the sexing and the quantitative non-subjective identification of the maturity stage of female fish, could have multiple applications in the study of fish stock dynamics, fish reproduction and fecundity and fish biology in general."

Nuclear magnetic resonance of Skint-1 DV revealed a core tertiary structure conserved across the Skint family, but a highly distinct surface charge distribution, possibly explaining its unique function. Crucially, the CDR3-like loop formed an electrostatically distinct surface, featuring key charged and hydrophobic solvent-exposed residues, at the membrane-distal tip of DV.

We present a methodology and accompanying Stata and R commands (pcdsearch/Rpcdsearch) to help researchers in this task. We present severe mental illness as an example.We used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a UK Primary Care Database in which clinical information is largely organised using Read codes, a hierarchical clinical coding system.

The returned code-lists are reviewed and codes relevant to the condition of interest are selected. The final code-list is then used to identify patients.We identified 270 Read codes linked to SMI and used them to identify cases in the database. We observed that our approach identified cases that would have been missed with a simpler approach using SMI registers defined within the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework.We described a framework for researchers of Electronic Health Records databases, for identifying patients with a particular condition or matching certain clinical criteria.

https://openalex.org/W2282895509,"Insulin resistance and β cell dysfunction contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Unlike insulin resistance, β cell dysfunction remains difficult to predict and monitor, because of the inaccessibility of the endocrine pancreas, the integrated relationship with insulin sensitivity, and the paracrine effects of incretins. The goal of our study was to survey the plasma response to a metabolic challenge in order to identify factors predictive of β cell dysfunction. To this end, we combined (i) the power of unbiased iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification) mass spectrometry with (ii) direct sampling of the portal vein following an intravenous glucose/arginine challenge (IVGATT) in (iii) mice with a genetic β cell defect. By so doing, we excluded the effects of peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as those of incretins on β cells, and focused on the first phase of insulin secretion to capture the early pathophysiology of β cell dysfunction. We compared plasma protein profiles with ex vivo islet secretome and transcriptome analyses. We detected changes to 418 plasma proteins in vivo, and detected changes to 262 proteins ex vivo The impairment of insulin secretion was associated with greater overall changes in the plasma response to IVGATT, possibly reflecting metabolic instability. Reduced levels of proteins regulating redox state and neuronal stress markers, as well as increased levels of coagulation factors, antedated the loss of insulin secretion in diabetic mice. These results suggest that a reduced complement of antioxidants in response to a mixed secretagogue challenge is an early correlate of future β cell failure."

Regulation and coordination of DNA repair mechanisms is essential for maintaining genome integrity and proper cell function. Sumoylation is a post-translational protein modification critical for DNA damage repair, including repair of DNA single- and double-stranded breaks, interstrand cross-links, and nucleotide mismatches (1.Jackson S.P.

The best studied role of TDG is in base excision repair (BER), where it specifically recognizes G/U and G/T mismatches arising from spontaneous deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine, respectively. BER proceeds through a process involving glycosylase recognition of a specific DNA lesion and removal of the lesion to produce an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. TDG-mediated BER is of particular interest because of the observed product inhibition caused by high affinity binding of TDG to the AP site following base excision (7.Hardeland U. Bentele M.

Despite findings that sumoylation of TDG weakens its binding to abasic DNA in vitro, no studies have explored the question of whether this modification is needed for efficient substrate processing by TDG in vivo. This has been due in part to the redundant substrate specificities of the multiple mammalian DNA glycosylases and the absence of TDG specific activity assays (16.Krokan H.E. Bjørås M. Base excision repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a012583Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The recently discovered role for TDG in active DNA demethylation, however, provides the basis for developing an assay to selectively interrogate TDG activity. Specifically, DNA demethylation proceeds through an enzymatic pathway that involves the ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs) and TDG-initiated BER. The TET enzymes are a family of dioxygenases that iteratively oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to give 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and a final product of 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (5.Kohli R.M. Zhang Y. TET enzymes, TDG and the dynamics of DNA demethylation.Nature. 2013; 502: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Importantly, TDG is the only glycosylase that recognizes and excises 5-formylcytosine and 5caC from DNA (5.Kohli R.M. Zhang Y.

Taking advantage of TDG specificity for 5caC, we developed an in vivo assay to monitor TDG activity and explore requirements for TDG sumoylation and SUMO binding in BER. Our findings reveal that neither sumoylation of TDG nor SUMO binding by TDG are essential for its enzymatic activity under our in vivo assay conditions and thus raise questions about other mechanisms for relieving product inhibition and other possible functions for TDG sumoylation.

Enzyme kinetics experiments were performed using either single turnover conditions with a saturating TDG concentration, to obtain the maximal rate of 5caC base excision (kmax), or multiple turnover experiments with a saturating substrate concentration, to obtain the maximal rate of catalytic turnover (kcat), as described (18.Maiti A.

The reactions were performed at 37 °C in HEMN.1 buffer (0.02 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2). Reactions were initiated by adding concentrated TDG to buffered G·caC DNA substrate, and aliquots were removed at the desired time points and quenched with 50% (v/v) 0.3 m NaOH, 0.03 m EDTA. Quenched samples were heated for 15 min at 85 °C to quantitatively cleave the DNA backbone at abasic sites, and the resulting DNA fragments were resolved by anion exchange HPLC (21.Morgan M.T. Bennett M.T. Drohat A.C. Excision of 5-halogenated uracils by human thymine DNA glycosylase. Robust activity for DNA contexts other than CpG.J. Biol.

Single turnover experiments were performed with a substrate concentration of 0.5 μm and a saturating concentration of TDG (1.0 μm). Progress curves were fitted by nonlinear regression to Equation 1, fraction product=A(1−exp⁡(−kobst))(Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude, kobs is the rate constant, and t is the reaction time. Given the saturating enzyme conditions employed ([E] ≫ Kd; [E] > [S]), the observed rate constant reflects the maximal rate of product formation (kobs ≈ kmax) and is not influenced by E-S association or by product release or product inhibition. Previous studies show that TDG binds to DNA containing a G/U mispair with a Kd = 0.6 nm (22.Morgan M.T. Maiti A. Fitzgerald M.E. Drohat A.C. Stoichiometry and affinity for thymine DNA glycosylase binding to specific and nonspecific DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 2319-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the TDG catalytic domain exhibits 7-fold tighter affinity for G·caC relative to G/U DNA (23.Zhang L. Lu X. Lu J. Liang H. Dai Q. Xu G.L. Luo C. Jiang H. He C. Thymine DNA glycosylase specifically recognizes 5-carboxylcytosine-modified DNA.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Multiple turnover experiments were performed at 37 °C in HEMN.1 buffer (with 0.1 mg/ml BSA), using a limiting concentration of TDG (0.05 μm) and a saturating concentration of G·caC DNA substrate (1.0 μm). The linear portion of the progress curve (product concentration versus time) was used to obtain the initial velocity (v0). Under the saturating substrate conditions used here ([S] ≫ Km), the Michaelis-Menten equation simplifies such that v0 reports on the maximal rate of catalytic turnover (kcat = v0/[E]). Following the same approach, multiple turnover experiments were also performed in the presence of APE1. The reactions were initiated by adding TDG to HEMN.1 buffer (with 5 mm MgCl2) containing G·5caC substrate and APE1, and aliquots were removed and quenched as described above. For experiments collected with APE1, fitting was also limited to the linear region of the progress curve (< 20% product). HEK293T and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (DMEM-1×; Life Technologies) containing 4.5 g/liter d-glucose and l-glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% HEPES, phenol red, and antibiotics and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. For transient transfections, the cells were plated in 6-well plates with supplemented DMEM-1× culture media absent antibiotics. The Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) for transient overexpression or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) for transient knockdowns per manufacturer's instructions. RNAi oligonucleotides were used at final concentrations of 20 nm. TDG was cloned into the pcDNA3.0 expression vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag. TDG mutant constructs were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The TET1catalytic domain (residues 1,418–2,136) was inserted into the pLEXm expression vector and contains an N-terminal histidine tag (generously provided by R. Kohli, University of Pennsylvania). SENP1 was expressed in pEGFP-C1 vectors, as previously described (24.Cubeñas-Potts C. Goeres J.D. Matunis M.J. SENP1 and SENP2 affect spatial and temporal control of sumoylation in mitosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 3483-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. siRNA oligonucleotides used were as follows: (SENP1) 5′-UCCUUUACACCUGUCUCGAUGUCUU-3′; (SENP2) 5′-AUAUCUGGAUUCUAUGGGAUU-3′. The commercially available NC1 oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies) was used as a control. HEK293T cells were cultured in 6-well plates, washed with 1× PBS, and then lysed with 100 μl of modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCL, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1× SigmaFAST protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were sonicated to shear DNA, centrifuged (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min), and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Thermo Scientific). Prepared cell lysates were diluted with 5× SDS loading buffer (300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 500 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and incubated for 10 min at 96 °C. For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in 1× Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then incubated with respective primary antibodies. Antibodies were diluted in TBS-T with the following dilutions: 1:2,000 rabbit polyclonal anti-TDG (Genetex, GTX110473), 1:10,000 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma, F1804), 1:2,000 mouse monoclonal anti-His (GE Life Sciences, 27-4710-01), 1:2,000 mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz, sc-40), 1:5,000 mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (Clontech Living Colors, 632381), 1:5,000 rabbit monoclonal anti-SENP1 (Abcam, ab108981), 1:2,000 mouse monoclonal anti-γH2A.X (Millipore, 05–636), 1:5,000 mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma, T9026), and 1:1,000 rabbit anti-TET1 (ProSci Inc., 7733). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Luminata Western HRP Substrates, Millipore). U2OS cells were cultured on coverslips in 6-well plates. The cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 2% formaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then washed with PBS and permeabilized for 7 min at room temperature with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:250 rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG, GenScript, A00170; 1:250 mouse monoclonal anti-SUMO1, 21C7) (25.Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G.

After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with mouse α488 or rabbit α594 Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The cells were imaged using a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was purified from HEK293T cells using GeneJet genomic DNA purification kit per kit instructions for mammalian cell culture (Thermo Scientific). For 5caC analysis, gDNA was denatured by incubation with NaOH (0.4 m final) for 10 min at 95 °C. Immediately following heating, gDNA was neutralized with NH4OAc, pH 7.2 (final concentration, 1 m) and brought to a final concentration of 5 ng/μl. DNA concentrations were measured by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Prepared gDNA was subsequently spotted as indicated on nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm; Bio-Rad) using a Hybri-dot manifold dot blot apparatus (96-well; Invitrogen, Life Technologies) following standard procedures. The membranes were washed with 2× SSC buffer (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T and subsequently probed with 1:5,000 rabbit polyclonal anti-5caC (Active Motif, 61225). Signals were detected using fluorescent secondary antibodies, and intensities were measured and analyzed using an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). To confirm equal loading of gDNA, membranes were briefly incubated with methylene blue (0.02% methylene blue, 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2) at room temperature, destained with double-distilled H2O, and imaged. HEK293T cells were cultured in 6-well plates and washed with PBS and then lysed with 100 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1× SigmaFAST protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). After 30 min of incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and supernatant was saved as the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction. The remaining pellet was washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then resuspended with low salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm MgCl2) and supplemented with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and protease inhibitors. After 15 min of incubation on ice, the suspension was centrifuged (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining pellet was resuspended with 2× sample buffer, briefly sonicated, and saved as the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction. HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated expression constructs and analyzed for single and double-stranded DNA breaks using the single cell electrophoresis CometAssay® under alkaline conditions according to the manufacturer (Trevigen, Inc.). As a positive control, untransfected cells were treated with 100 μm hydrogen peroxide for 20 min prior to analysis. Images were collected using a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope. To explore the effects of sumoylation on TDG activity in vivo, we sought to develop a TET-TDG co-expression assay that takes advantage of the unique ability of TDG to excise TET-induced 5caC from DNA (17.He Y.F. Li B.Z. Li Z. Liu P. Wang Y. Tang Q. Ding J. Jia Y. Chen Z. Li L. Sun Y. Li X. Dai Q. Song C.X. Zhang K. He C. Xu G.L.

First, we transfected 293T cells with a plasmid coding for a His-tagged catalytic domain of human TET1 (TETCD) and analyzed 5caC production by dot blot analysis of purified gDNA using a 5caC-specific antibody. As expected, we observed a dose-dependent increase in 5caC levels with increasing levels of TETCD expression (Fig. 1B). Levels of 5caC detection peaked with intermediate TETCD expression, suggesting saturable levels of cytosine modification by TETCD. Importantly, these results also suggest that endogenous TDG activity is insufficient to repair and effectively reduce the levels of 5caC induced by TETCD expression. To investigate the ability of exogenously expressed TDG to excise 5caC in vivo, we next co-transfected 293T cells with plasmids coding for His-tagged TETCD and FLAG-tagged TDG. The cells were transfected so that they expressed a fixed level of TETCD and increasing levels of TDG, as revealed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C). As previously reported, two forms of TDG were detected in transfected cells: an unmodified form migrating at ∼65 kDa and a SUMO-modified form migrating at ∼80 kDa (12.Hardeland U. Steinacher R.

This analysis revealed a dose-dependent decrease in 5caC detection, indicative of dose-dependent TDG-mediated excision (Fig. 1C). Under maximum expression conditions, FLAG-TDG levels were ∼4 times above endogenous TDG, whereas relative levels of TETCD expression could not be determined because of the inability to detect endogenous TET1 (Fig. 1D).

Chromatin remodeling and histone post-translational modification (PTM) are critical factors in repairing DNA damage and maintaining genomic integrity, however, the dynamic changes of histone marks in response to solar UVR are not well characterized. Here we report global changes in histone PTMs induced by solar simulated UVR (ssUVR). A decrease in lysine acetylation of histones H3 and H4, particularly at positions of H3 lysine 9, lysine 56, H4 lysine 5, and lysine 16, was found in human keratinocytes exposed to ssUVR. These acetylation changes were highly associated with ssUVR in a dose-dependent and time-specific manner. Interestingly, H4K16ac, a mark that is crucial for higher order chromatin structure, exhibited a persistent reduction by ssUVR that was transmitted through multiple cell divisions. In addition, the enzymatic activities of histone acetyltransferases were significantly reduced in irradiated cells, which may account for decreased global acetylation. Moreover, depletion of histone deacetylase SIRT1 in keratinocytes rescued ssUVR-induced H4K16 hypoacetylation. These results indicate that ssUVR affects both HDAC and HAT activities, leading to reduced histone acetylation."

We evaluated that RDW was also associated with the leukoaraiosis; common radiological finding of brain and that has been strongly associated with risk of stroke and dementia. In the present study, we included 1006 non-stroke individuals who underwent brain MRI and routine complete blood count test including RDW. Fazekas scale was used to measure the severity of leukoaraiosis based on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image, and the severity was dichotomized to mild-degree (Fazekas scale: 0-1) and severe-degree leukoaraiosis (Fazekas scale: 2-3). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate independent risk factor for severe-degree of leukoaraiosis. Mean age of 1006 subjects was 64.34 ± 9.11 year, and mean of RDW was 12.97 ± 0.86%. The severe-degree of leukoaraiosis (Fazekas scale ≥ 2) was found in 28.83%. In the multivariate logistic regression, 4th quartile of RDW (> 13.3%) were significantly associated with the presence of severe-degree of leukoaraiosis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-2.92) compared to the 1st quartile of RDW (< 12.5%). The significance was not changed after adjustments for hemoglobin and other hematologic indices. These findings suggest that RDW is independently associated with severity of leukoaraiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2282426246,"Forest ecosystems can act as sinks of carbon and thus mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions. When forests are actively managed, treatments can alter forests carbon dynamics, reducing their sink strength and switching them from sinks to sources of carbon. These effects are generally characterized by fast temporal dynamics. Hence this study monitored for over a decade the impacts of management practices commonly used to reduce fire hazards on the carbon dynamics of mixed-conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Soil CO2 efflux, carbon pools (i.e. soil carbon, litter, fine roots, tree biomass), and radial tree growth were compared among un-manipulated controls, prescribed fire, thinning, thinning followed by fire, and two clear-cut harvested sites. Soil CO2 efflux was reduced by both fire and harvesting (ca. 15%). Soil carbon content (upper 15 cm) was not significantly changed by harvest or fire treatments. Fine root biomass was reduced by clear-cut harvest (60-70%) but not by fire, and the litter layer was reduced 80% by clear-cut harvest and 40% by fire. Thinning effects on tree growth and biomass were concentrated in the first year after treatments, whereas fire effects persisted over the seven-year post-treatment period. Over this period, tree radial growth was increased (25%) by thinning and reduced (12%) by fire. After seven years, tree biomass returned to pre-treatment levels in both fire and thinning treatments; however, biomass and productivity decreased 30%-40% compared to controls when thinning was combined with fire. The clear-cut treatment had the strongest impact, reducing ecosystem carbon stocks and delaying the capacity for carbon uptake. We conclude that post-treatment carbon dynamics and ecosystem recovery time varied with intensity and type of treatments. Consequently, management practices can be selected to minimize ecosystem carbon losses while increasing future carbon uptake, resilience to high severity fire, and climate related stresses."

Availability of large-scale genome data in the fungal kingdom encouraged us to identify and analyse the fungal MAPK gene family consisting of 173 fungal species. The analysis of the MAPK gene family resulted in the discovery of several novel activation loop motifs (T-T-Y, T-I-Y, T-N-Y, T-H-Y, T-S-Y, K-G-Y, T-Q-Y, S-E-Y and S-D-Y) in fungal MAPKs. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that fungal MAPKs are non-polymorphic, had evolved from their common ancestors around 1500 million years ago, and are distantly related to plant MAPKs. We are the first to report the presence of nine novel activation loop motifs in fungal MAPKs. The specificity of the activation loop motif plays a significant role in controlling different growth and stress related pathways in fungi. Hence, the presences of these nine novel activation loop motifs in fungi are of special interest."
https://openalex.org/W2285209545,"Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that regulates most cellular pathways and processes, including degradation of proteins by the proteasome. Substrate ubiquitination is controlled at various stages, including through its reversal by deubiquitinases (DUBs). A critical outcome of this process is the recycling of monoubiquitin. One DUB whose function has been proposed to include monoubiquitin recycling is USP5. Here, we investigated whether Drosophila USP5 is important for maintaining monoubiquitin in vivo. We found that the fruit fly orthologue of USP5 has catalytic preferences similar to its human counterpart and that this DUB is necessary during fly development. Our biochemical and genetic experiments indicate that reduction of USP5 does not lead to monoubiquitin depletion in developing flies. Also, introduction of exogenous ubiquitin does not suppress developmental lethality caused by loss of endogenous USP5. Our work indicates that a primary physiological role of USP5 is not to recycle monoubiquitin for reutilization, but that it may involve disassembly of conjugated ubiquitin to maintain proteasome function.

Our work indicates that a primary physiological role of USP5 is not to recycle monoubiquitin for reutilization, but that it may involve disassembly of conjugated ubiquitin to maintain proteasome function. Ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification of numerous proteins in the cell, where it is involved in the regulation of various processes ranging from DNA transcription to protein degradation. Three different classes of enzymes are responsible for carrying out this modification: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzymes), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and E3 (ubiquitin ligases) (1.Pickart C.M. Ubiquitin in chains.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Through the coordinated action of these proteins, a ubiquitin molecule is conjugated most commonly to a lysine residue of a substrate protein through an isopeptide bond. Because ubiquitin itself has seven lysine residues, which are available for isopeptide bond formation, and because ubiquitin moieties can also be connected “head to tail,” ubiquitin chains of different conformations are generated (2.Pickart C.M.

Depletion of USP5 orthologues in yeast and in mammalian cells leads to accumulation of unanchored ubiquitin chains and causes proteasomal inhibition (14.Amerik A. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. In vivo disassembly of free polyubiquitin chains by yeast Ubp14 modulates rates of protein degradation by the proteasome.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These and other findings place USP5 at the proteasome: before a protein is degraded by the proteasome, the ubiquitin chain signaling its degradation is removed en bloc by another DUB, RPN11/POH1, leaving unanchored polyubiquitin. USP5 processes this unanchored chain to yield monoubiquitin (3.Ristic G. Tsou W.L. Todi S.V.

Thus, this DUB is thought of as a ubiquitin recycler, helping to maintain a monoubiquitin pool for reutilization (7.Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S.

Because there is persistent demand for protein modification through ubiquitination, there is a constant need to generate monoubiquitin through recycling or through new synthesis via ubiquitin-encoding genes. It is not entirely clear whether a primary role for USP5 in vivo is monoubiquitin maintenance. Here, we tested this possibility in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, whose USP5 is necessary during development (16.Kovács L. Nagy O. Pál M. Udvardy A. Popescu O. Deák P.

We began our studies of Drosophila USP5 (DmUSP5) by comparing ubiquitin chain cleavage preferences between it and the human counterpart in vitro. We carried out deubiquitination reactions at 37 °C, optimal for human USP5, and 25 °C, optimal for Drosophila USP5, although the same results were also obtained at 37 °C (Fig. 1 and data not shown). We observed that DmUSP5 and human USP5 both hydrolyze unanchored polyubiquitin chains of different linkages (Fig. 1B). The recombinant proteases have different proficiencies: Lys11, Lys48, Lys63, and linear (head to tail) species were cleaved more rapidly than Lys6- and Lys29-linked diubiquitin. Both DUBs were also able to cleave rapidly di- and tetraubiquitin chains (Fig. 1B). We noticed that as Lys6 and Lys33 diubiquitin"
https://openalex.org/W2282795720,"Attractant-based traps are a cornerstone of detection, delimitation and eradication programs for pests such as tephritid fruit flies. The ideal trap and lure combination has high attraction (it brings insects to the trap from a distance) and high capture efficiency (it has a high probability of capturing the insect once it arrives at the trap). We examined the effect of an insecticide (DDVP) in combination with a pheromone lure (trimedlure) on capture of Ceratitis capitata using 1) digital images of surfaces of a Jackson trap analyzed via computer vision, and 2) counts of the number of flies caught in the trap and in the area under the trap. Our results indicate no significant difference in trap capture without or with insecticide (means ± SD = 324 ±135 and 356 ±108, respectively). However, significantly more dead flies were found around the trap with insecticide (92 ±53 with insecticide compared with 35 ±22 without), suggesting a possible decrease in trap efficiency due to mortality before insects enter the trap. Indeed, the average number of flies detected on all surfaces of the traps with insecticide was lower than that for lure-only (4.15±0.39 vs 8.30±1.18), and both were higher than control (no lure: 0.76 ±0.08). We found that the majority of fly sightings, 71% of the total, occurred on the inside panels of the lure-only traps, suggesting that increased efficiency of the Jackson trap may be obtained by adding a contact insecticide to those surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2286554833,"T cells have the remarkable ability to recognize antigen with great specificity and in turn mount an appropriate and robust immune response. Critical to this process is the initial T cell antigen recognition and subsequent signal transduction events. This antigen recognition can be modulated at the site of TCR interaction with peptide:major histocompatibility (pMHC) or peptide interaction with the MHC molecule. Both events could have a range of effects on T cell fate. Though responses to antigens that bind sub-optimally to TCR, known as altered peptide ligands (APL), have been studied extensively, the impact of disrupting antigen binding to MHC has been highlighted to a lesser extent and is usually considered to result in complete loss of epitope recognition. Here we present a model of viral evasion from CD8 T cell immuno-surveillance by a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) escape mutant with an epitope for which TCR affinity for pMHC remains high but where the antigenic peptide binds sub optimally to MHC. Despite high TCR affinity for variant epitope, levels of interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4) are not sustained in response to the variant indicating differences in perceived TCR signal strength. The CD8+ T cell response to the variant epitope is characterized by early proliferation and up-regulation of activation markers. Interestingly, this response is not maintained and is characterized by a lack in IL-2 and IFNγ production, increased apoptosis and an abrogated glycolytic response. We show that disrupting the stability of peptide in MHC can effectively disrupt TCR signal strength despite unchanged affinity for TCR and can significantly impact the CD8+ T cell response to a viral escape mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2279198076,"High-affinity binders are desirable tools to probe the function that specific protein−protein interactions play in cell. In the process of seeking a general strategy to design high-affinity binders, we found a clue from the βPIX (p21-activated kinase interacting exchange factor)−Shank PDZ interaction in synaptic assembly: three PDZ-binding sites are clustered by a parallel coiled-coil trimer but bind to Shank PDZ protein with 1:1 stoichiometry (1 trimer/1 PDZ). Inspired by this architecture, we proposed that peptide dendrimer, mimicking the ligand clustering in βPIX, will also show enhanced binding affinity, yet with 1:1 stoichiometry. This postulation has been proven here, as we synthesized a set of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric peptides and measured their binding affinity and stoichiometry with Shank PDZ domains by isothermal titration calorimetry, native mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance. This affinity enhancement, best explained by proximity effect, will be useful to guide the design of high-affinity blockers for protein−protein interactions."

In this study, we tried to study the necessity of the preventative long-segment surgery for the defected segment without slippage in treatment of multi-level spondylolysis patients from a biomechanical perspective.We established a bi-level spondylolysis model with pars defects at L4 and L5 segments, and simulated posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and pedicle screw fixation at L5-S1 level. Then we compared the biomechanical changes at L4 segment before and after surgery in neutral, flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial rotation position.The stress on L4 pars interarticularis was very similar before and after surgery, and reached the highest in axial rotation. The L3-L4 intradiscal pressure was almost the same, while L4-L5 intradiscal pressure changed a little in lateral bending (increase from 1.993 to 2.160 MPa) and axial rotation (decrease from 1.639 to 1.307 MPa) after surgery. The PLIF surgery caused a little increase of range of motion at adjacent L4-L5 and L3-L4 levels, but the change is very tiny (1 degree).The PLIF surgery will not cause significant biomechanical change at adjacent segment with pars defect in multi-level spondylolysis. On the contrary, excessive long-segment surgery will damage surrounding soft tissues which are important for maintaining the stability of spine. So a preventative long-segment surgery is not necessary for multi-level spondylolysis as long as there are no soft tissue degeneration signs at adjacent level."
