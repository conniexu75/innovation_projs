https://openalex.org/W2050291120,"The study of the organization of the brain for language has been based of necessity on investigations in man. The bulk of our information in this area has come from careful studies of patients suffering from isolated damage as a result of vascular disease, whose brains have, after death, been subjected to careful anatomical examination. Disorders of language resulting from brain damage, almost always on the left side, are called aphasias. Carl Wernicke, nearly 100 years ago. described the linguistic differences between aphasias resulting from damage in different anatomical locations and outlined a theory of the organization of language in the brain. Not only have Wernicke’s localizations stood up under repeated examinations but his theory has been the only one which has permitted the prediction of new phenomena, or has been able to account for new observations. Several remarkable disorders, such as isolated disturbances of reading and the symptomatology of the corpus callosum, are examples of the explanatory power of this theory."

https://openalex.org/W2081757987,"The heating of formaldehyde and ammonia yields a product that, on hydrolysis, is converted into seven amino acids: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, proline, valine, glycine, and alanine. Glycine is the predominant amino acid. Inasmuch as formaldehyde and ammonia have been identified as compounds in galactic clouds, these experimental results are interpreted in a cosmochemical and geochemical context."

Although the mechanisms may vary from one unit to another, the effect is always to make them fire more readily and to a wider range of visual inputs."

https://openalex.org/W2093362960,"THE exact neurophysiological role of dopamine is still unclear, but it has been implicated in the functioning of the extra-pyramidal motor system (EPS)1,2. Experiments on animals and humans, however, indicate that the smooth functioning of the EPS depends on a fine balance between several biogenic amines3–5. Nevertheless, deficiencies of brain dopamine resulting from degeneration of the substantia nigra seem to be associated with the extrapyramidal symptoms of Parkinson's disease1–6. In accordance with these observations, attempts have been made to raise brain dopamine levels in patients suffering from Parkinsonism. Dopamine itself cannot be used, for it is incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, and therefore dopamine precursors, in particular L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa), have been used7–10. Although such treatment apparently relieves the symptoms of hypokinesia, rigidity and posture, tremor is little affected and the necessity for large daily dosage and the side-effects of nausea and hypotension remain as serious drawbacks to the therapeutic use of L-dopa. Stock11 has recently suggested that 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine may be a potential anti-parkinsonism agent since this tyrosine hydroxylase cofactor may be deficient in patients suffering from Parkinsonism12."

https://openalex.org/W2092398876,"IN Jamaica the fifth instar larvae of the New World hawkmoth, Erinnyis ello, exhibit four basic colours: green, blue, green-grey and brown. The green, blue and green-grey larvae feed and rest on the leaves of their commonest food plant (Poinsettia pulcherrima). The brown larvae also feed on these leaves, but they rest for many hours during the day on the base of the trunk, sometimes several yards below where they feed1. All the larvae are preyed on during the day by wasps (Polistes crinitus) and to a very small extent by an anole (Anolis lineatopus). Because the wasps search for their prey only in the foliage of the Poinsettia bushes, the three forms staying constantly on its leaves suffer heavily from predation, as selection experiments in the wild have demonstrated1. By contrast, all the larvae which rest from time to time on the trunk of the food plant enjoy an almost complete freedom from predators."

https://openalex.org/W1607643976,"To determine the role of environmental factors in human health, studies on several population groups are essential, involving the most sophisticated techniques possible. The logistic and political problems associated with such studies, especially in developing countries, and the high cost of modern environmental biological investigations make it particularly desirable to avoid unnecessary duplication and waste of resources. For certain investigations an international research center would appear to have considerable advantages, provided that the organizational difficulties can be overcome. Not only can such an organization provide the human data necessary for calculating the balance between the benefits and harm of a given course of action but also it may stimulate the long-term routine laboratory studies so necessary as a basis for extrapolation from animals to man."
https://openalex.org/W2049804400,"THE Ichneumonidae (Hymenoptera) are a family of parasitic wasps (15,000 species in the world1) which deposit their eggs in larvae or pupae of other insects. Twelve genera can overwinter as free adults, and individuals of these genera may be found hibernating in rotten forest logs, between rocks and under moss carpets. It seems likely that species that survive the winter possess some physiological mechanism absent in non-hibernating species. Glycerol and sorbitol accumulate in a limited number of unrelated diapausing and non-diapausing insects subjected to temperatures resembling overwintering conditions2. This study was undertaken to see if (a) the overwintering ability of a group of closely related species is manifested by a common observable phenomenon, namely polyol accumulation, and (b) this phenomenon is restricted to those species which hibernate."
