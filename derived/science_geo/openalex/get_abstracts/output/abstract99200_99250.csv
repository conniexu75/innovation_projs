https://openalex.org/W2114859236,"The immunosuppressants rapamycin and FK506 bind to the same intracellular protein, the immunophilin FKBP12. The FKB12-FK506 complex interacts with and inhibits the Ca(2+)-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin. The target of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex has not yet been identified. We report that a protein complex containing 245 kDa and 35 kDa components, designated rapamycin and FKBP12 targets 1 and 2 (RAFT1 and RAFT2), interacts with FKBP12 in a rapamycin-dependent manner. Sequences (330 amino acids total) of tryptic peptides derived from the 245 kDa RAFT1 reveal striking homologies to the yeast TOR gene products, which were originally identified by mutations that confer rapamycin resistance in yeast. A RAFT1 cDNA was obtained and found to encode a 289 kDa protein (2549 amino acids) that is 43% and 39% identical to TOR2 and TOR1, respectively. We propose that RAFT1 is the direct target of FKBP12-rapamycin and a mammalian homolog of the TOR proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2092164532,"Glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins have been reported to reside in clusters collected over small membrane invaginations called caveolae. The detection of different GPI-anchored proteins with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies showed that these proteins are not constitutively concentrated in caveolae; they enter these structures independently after cross-linking with polyclonal secondary antibodies. Analysis of the cell surface distribution of the GPI-anchored folate receptor by electron microscopy confirms these observations. Thus, multimerization of GPI-anchored proteins regulates their sequestration in caveolae, but in the absence of agents that promote clustering they are diffusely distributed over the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2081319949,"Human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class I proteins of the major histocompatibility complex are largely dependent for expression on small peptides supplied to them by transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) protein. An inherited human deficiency in the TAP transporter was identified in two siblings suffering from recurrent respiratory bacterial infections. The expression on the cell surface of class I proteins was very low, whereas that of CD1a was normal, and the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells was affected. In addition, CD8+ alpha beta T cells were present in low but significant numbers and were cytotoxic in the most severely affected sibling, who also showed an increase in CD4+CD8+ T cells and gamma delta T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048754200,"Charybdotoxin (CTX) is a peptide of known structure that inhibits Shaker K+ channels by a pore-blocking mechanism. Point mutagenesis of all 30 solvent-exposed residues identified the part of the CTX molecular surface making contact with the receptor in the K+ channel. All close-contact residues are clustered in a well-defined interaction surface; the shape of this surface implies that the outer opening of the Shaker channel conduction pore abruptly widens to a 25 x 35 A plateau. A mutagenic scan of the S5-S6 linker sequence of the Shaker K+ channel identified those channel residues influencing CTX binding affinity. The Shaker residues making the strongest contribution to toxin binding are located close to the pore-lining sequence, and more distant residues on both sides of this region influence CTX binding weakly, probably by an electrostatic mechanism. Complementary mutagenesis of both CTX and Shaker suggests that Shaker-F425 contacts a specific area near T8 and T9 on the CTX molecular surface. This contact point constrains Shaker-F425 to be located at a 20 A radial distance from the pore axis and 10-15 A above the ""floor"" of the CTX receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1998931558,"2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) is an abundant protein of myelinating oligodendrocytes. We report that one of the alternatively spliced CNP mRNAs is also expressed in cultured oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In situ hybridization revealed a thin longitudinal column of CNP-positive cells in the ventral ventricular zone of the embryonic day 14 rat spinal cord, coincident in time and space with cells that express the platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor, another putative marker of the oligodendrocyte lineage. These data support the hypothesis that the oligodendrocyte lineage originates at a discrete location in the ventral ventricular zone of the embryonic day 14 rat spinal cord. We further report that transcripts encoding the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP/DM-20) are expressed in an unidentified population of neural progenitors in the ventricular zone abutting the floor plate. Our results support the idea that the ventricular zone is a mosaic of specialized progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1585678117,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor, expressed in liver, that binds with high affinity and endocytoses several structurally and functionally distinct ligands, including apolipoprotein E-activated beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and alpha 2-macroglobulin. Here using in situ hybridization and quantitative RNase protection assays, we show that LRP is also expressed throughout the brain. LRP message is particularly high in the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem. In addition, we demonstrate that a 39-kDa protein which copurifies with LRP and regulates the binding of other ligands to LRP is also expressed throughout the brain. Interestingly, expression of the 39-kDa message is approximately 100-fold of that found in liver, suggesting that the activity of LRP is more tightly regulated in brain tissue than in liver. Using primary cultures of isolated postnatal cortical neurons, [35S]methionine biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate the de novo biosynthesis of LRP, the 39-kDa protein, as well as tissue-type plasminogen activator. Finally, using radioligand binding as well as fluorescent ligand binding and uptake studies, we show that LRP is functional in cortical neurons. These results taken together thus demonstrate expression of functional LRP in neuronal cells and suggest a potential role for LRP in brain protein and lipoprotein metabolism, development, and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1571519589,"Epitope tagging and immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine the agonist-regulated internalization of human beta 2-adrenergic receptors in 293 cells. In the absence of agonist, receptors tagged with monoclonal antibody remain in the plasma membrane for > 1 h. In the presence of agonist, tagged receptors are endocytosed within 10 min. Endocytosed receptors are located in endosomes and can be recycled to the plasma membrane. In the prolonged presence of agonist, receptor endocytosis continues even after maximum sequestration of surface receptors (measured by radioligand binding to intact cells) has occurred. The process of receptor endocytosis requires cellular ATP and is temperature-dependent. At 4 degrees C, no agonist-induced redistribution of receptors located in the plasma membrane is observed. At 16 degrees C, agonist causes receptors to cluster in and around coated invaginations of the plasma membrane, but receptor endocytosis does not occur. Agonist treatment of cells at 16 degrees C, but not 4 degrees C, predisposes receptors to agonist-independent endocytosis upon warming to 37 degrees C. These studies suggest that: 1) beta 2-adrenergic receptors reside stably in the plasma membrane of untreated cells, while they continuously cycle between the plasma membrane and endosomes in the presence of agonist; 2) agonist regulates an early step in the endocytosis mechanism, which is associated with the redistribution of adrenergic receptors between distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane; and 3) later steps in the endocytosis mechanism do not require agonist and may utilize the same endocytic machinery that mediates the endocytosis of constitutively recycling receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1590184168,"Abstract Single channel analysis of artificial lipid planar bilayers reconstituted with wild-type human cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) revealed a 10.3 pS Cl- selective channel that was activated upon phosphorylation with protein kinase A. Gating of this channel was described by a simple kinetic model consisting of a single open burst state and two closed states. The open probability of CFTR channels in bilayers increased as a function of increasing Mg-ATP concentration and exhibited negative cooperativity, suggesting the interaction of two or more ATP binding sites in channel gating. Mg-ATP increased channel open probability by decreasing the duration of the long-lived closed state but had no effect on either the mean open time or the fast closed state. ADP inhibited channel opening by precisely antagonizing the effect of ATP, suggesting that ADP inhibits the CFTR channel by competing with ATP for binding. Poorly hydrolyzable ATP analogs such as AMP-PNP and ATP gamma S, polyphosphates such as pyrophosphate (PPi) and tripolyphosphate (PPPi), and orthovanadate failed to support channel activity alone. When applied in the presence of ATP, these compounds all caused the CFTR channel to lock into a prolonged open burst state. These data support a model in which hydrolysis of ATP leads to closure of channels that have been opened by ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1987824008,"A major histocompatibility complex class Ib protein, CD1d, is expressed by human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and is a ligand for CD8+ T cells. CD1d was found to be expressed on the surface of human IECs as a 37-kilodalton protein that was beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) independent with no N-linked carbohydrate. Transfection into a beta 2M- cell line confirmed that CD1d could be expressed at the cell surface in the absence of beta 2M. These data indicate that IECs use a specialized pathway for CD1d synthesis and that a beta 2M-independent class Ib protein may be the normal ligand for some intestinal T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1519825293,"Production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) by the NADPH oxidase of neutrophils is a major mechanism of bacterial killing and, in pathologic circumstances, tissue damage. Integrins and selectins participate in neutrophil adhesion but may also play a role in intracellular signaling. The role of L-selectin in ROI production and Ca2+ signaling in suspended neutrophils was examined using the DREG series of anti-L-selectin antibodies. NADPH oxidase activation was assessed in three ways: H2O2 production using either scopoletin or dihydrorhodamine and O2- production using cytochrome c. Alterations in [Ca2+]i were measured using Fura 2-AM and fluorescence spectrophotometry. Cross-linking of L-selectin with DREG and 2 degrees antibody did not trigger production of H2O2 by itself but significantly enhanced the subsequent response to two soluble activating agents; the formyl peptide formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Potentiation of the oxidative burst was observed using F(ab')2 fragments but not with irrelevant antibodies and was observed whether 2 degrees antibody was added before or after fMLP. Cross-linking of L-selectin also triggered a rise in [Ca2+]i, due, in part, to release from intracellular stores. The intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA blocked both the rise in [Ca2+]i and the potentiation of the oxidative burst in response to fMLP or TNF. We conclude that cross-linking of L-selectin induces intracellular signals, including release of Ca2+, which may contribute to potentiation of the oxidative burst."
https://openalex.org/W1561311926,"The cytoplasmic domains of integrin beta subunits are essential for the function of integrins in cell adhesion and signaling. A chimera combining the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the beta 1 integrin subunit with an irrelevant extracellular domain derived from L3T4 (murine CD4) was tested for its ability to interfere with integrin function. Expression of this construct in cultured human embryonic kidney cells under the control of the inducible metallothionein promoter resulted in cell rounding and detachment, and blocked cell adhesion mediated by the beta 1 and alpha v beta 5 integrins. Expression of the beta 1 chimera at basal levels interfered with the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 125-kDa protein induced by antibody-induced clustering of integrins. Induced expression of the chimera resulted in sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein, which could be enhanced by clustering of the chimera but was insensitive to clustering of integrins. These results demonstrate that the autonomously expressed beta 1 integrin cytoplasmic domain can act as a trans-dominant inhibitor of integrin function, presumably via competitive interactions with cytoplasmic components that are required for integrin-mediated cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1557290263,"To investigate the nature of proteins recognized by Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, a cDNA expression library was prepared from macrophages and screened with a probe representing the three SH3 domains of p47nck. Two clones were isolated, and one, designated SAKAP I (for Src A box Nck-associated protein I), contained the carboxyl-terminal half of the cbl proto-oncogene product. Studies in vitro demonstrated reactivity between SAKAP I and SH3 domains derived from a variety of molecules. Wide variations in this assay suggested a high degree of specificity inherent in SAKAP I binding. Moreover, it was possible to demonstrate an in vivo association between p47nck and p120c-cbl in HL60 cells. These findings suggest that proteins containing SH3 elements regulate Cbl function."
https://openalex.org/W2015655346,"We characterized inhibition of N-type Ca2+ and M current K+ channels in rat superior cervical ganglion neurons by angiotensin II (angioII) using the patch clamp. Of 120 neurons, 97 showed inhibition of ICa (mean 32%), which was slow in onset and very slow to reverse under whole-cell recording conditions. This inhibition was blocked by the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, attenuated by inclusion of 2 mM GDP-β-S in the pipette, mostly pertussis toxin insensitive, half-sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, and wholly voltage independent. With 20 mM instead of 0.1 mM BAPTA in the pipette, the inhibition was strongly attenuated; however, we detected no angioII-induced [Ca2+]i signal using the fluorescent indicator indo-1. IBa from cell-attached patches was reduced by bath-applied angioll (mean 33%), suggesting use of a diffusible cytoplasmic messenger. M currents were inhibited by angioll in 8 of 11 neurons (mean 50%) cultured overnight. Hence, a second agonist, angioll, may share the slow, second messenger-utilizing, pertussis toxin-insensitive signaling pathway used by muscarinic agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2113682801,"The cell-surface glycoprotein CD36 interacts with a large variety of ligands, including collagen types I and IV, thrombospondin, erythrocytes parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum, platelet-agglutinating protein p37, oxidized low density lipoprotein, and long-chain fatty acids. Its expression is restricted to platelets, monocytes, adipocytes, and some endothelial and epithelial cells and is regulated during cell activation, differentiation, and development. CD36 belongs to a novel gene family of structurally related glycoproteins that includes CLA-1 and the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein LIMPII. To advance our knowledge on the genomic organization and the regulation of the cellular expression of the genes of this family, we have investigated the structural organization of the human CD36 gene and of its 5'-proximal flanking region. The CD36 gene is encoded by 15 exons that extend more than 32 kilobases on the human genome. Interestingly, the CD36 mRNA 5'-untranslated region is encoded by three exons. The 3'-untranslated region is contained in two exons, whose expression pattern can originate two mRNA forms. The cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions predicted at both terminal ends of the polypeptide chain are encoded by single exons, while the extracellular domain is encoded by 11 exons. The transcription initiation site of the CD36 gene is located 289 nucleotides upstream from the translational start codon. Sequence analysis of the proximal 5'-flanking region of the gene reveals the existence of a TATA box appropriately located with respect to the transcription initiation site and several potential cis-regulatory elements that might contribute to the transcriptional regulation of the CD36 gene. Delineation of the structural organization of the CD36 gene may help in defining the boundaries of relevant structural and/or functional domains in CD36 and, by extension, in the other members of the family."
https://openalex.org/W1497693870,"A novel human serum protein with a molecular mass of 87,000 daltons was purified to homogeneity and subjected to amino acid sequence analyses. These sequences were used to design oligonucleotide primers and to isolate a full-length cDNA. The amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA shares strong similarity to albumin family members and shares the characteristic pattern of Cys residues observed in this family. In addition, the gene maps to chromosome 4 as do other members of the albumin gene family. Based upon these observations, we conclude that the 87,000-dalton protein, which we designate afamin (AFM), is the fourth member of the albumin family of proteins. Afamin cDNA was stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells and recombinant protein (rAFM) was purified from conditioned medium. Both rAFM and AFM purified from human serum react with a polyclonal antibody that was raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the deduced amino acid sequence of AFM."
https://openalex.org/W1528658828,"Technical difficulties in obtaining three-dimensional structures of intrinsic membrane proteins continues to limit understanding of their function. However, considerable insight can be gained from their two-dimensional topological arrangement in the lipid bilayer. Efficient molecular genetic approaches are available to discern the topology of prokaryotic but not of eukaryotic membrane proteins. The absolute asymmetry of the sidedness of their N-glycosylation was employed here to develop such a method using the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Insertion by in vitro mutagenesis of N-glycosylation consensus sequences (NXS/T) in predicted cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic loops between hydrophobic sequences capable of traversing the membrane established the membrane topology of CFTR. This provides the first experimental evaluation of the original topological model of CFTR based solely on hydropathy algorithms and a method which may be generally applicable for the in vivo evaluation of the topology of other mammalian membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1548926033,"Although recent data have demonstrated that the chimeric EWS-FLI-1 cDNA isolated from cases of Ewing's sarcoma can transform NIH 3T3 cells, little is known about the basis for this transformation. Since FLI-1 and EWS-FLI-1 contain an Ets domain, both proteins may act as sequence-specific transcription factors. Here the DNA binding properties of FLI-1 and EWS-FLI-1 have been examined. An epitope-tagging strategy was developed to determine the optimum DNA-binding sequence of FLI-1. The alignment of cloned binding sequences showed a consensus DNA-binding site of ACCGGAAG/aT/c. This consensus sequence shows greater specificity for sequence 5' of the GGAA core site than those of other Ets proteins. Using several truncated forms of FLI-1, we show that the Ets domain is necessary and sufficient for the DNA binding specificity of FLI-1. The EWS-FLI-1 protein displayed the same DNA binding specificity and affinity as FLI-1 did. Despite their DNA binding similarities, the EWS-FLI-1 translocation product is likely to have a distinct pattern of expression from that of FLI-1 since the translocation results in the replacement of the 5' regulatory region of Fli-1 with that of EWS. Consistent with this we found that Fli-1 mRNA expression in lymphocytes was high in quiescent cells and disappeared upon activation while EWS mRNA expression was low in resting cells and increased in activated T cells. In summary, our data suggest that EWS-FLI-1 might act through the same target genes normally regulated by FLI-1, and EWS-FLI-1-induced transformation may result from dysregulation of FLI-1 target genes during cell proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1573010690,"The receptor for the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel receptor superfamily. Point mutations in the gene encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the glycine receptor-channel complex (GlyR) have recently been identified in pedigrees with the autosomal dominant neurological disorder, startle disease (hyperekplexia). These mutations result in the substitution of leucine or glutamine for arginine 271. This charged residue is located near the ion channel region and is predicted to affect chloride permeation through the GlyR. We found little evidence for this role from the anion/cation selectivity and lack of pronounced rectification of currents flowing through recombinant human alpha 1 subunit GlyRs containing the startle disease mutations. We reveal, however, that the startle disease mutations profoundly disrupt GlyR function by causing 230-410-fold decreases in the sensitivity of receptor currents activated by the agonist glycine. Additionally, we report corresponding 56- and 120-fold reductions in the apparent binding affinity (Ki) of glycine to the mutant GlyRs, but no change in the binding affinity of the competitive antagonist, strychnine. Thus, startle disease reduces the efficacy of glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission by producing GlyRs with diminished agonist responsiveness. Our results show that startle disease mutations define a novel receptor activation site."
https://openalex.org/W1591316850,"Nodulin 26 is an integral symbiosome membrane protein of nitrogen-fixing soybean nodules. Nodulin 26 is a member of a family of structurally homologous membrane proteins with diverse transport functions. Thus, it has been proposed to be involved in symbiosome membrane transport. Despite this claim, there has not been any evidence that nodulin 26 has a transport activity. In this study, nodulin 26 was purified from soybean nodules by a non-denaturing protocol and was reconstituted into liposomes for channel studies in planar lipid bilayers. Nodulin 26 readily incorporated into bilayers, forming single channels with a maximum unitary conductance of 3.1 nanosiemens (nS) in a recording buffer of 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonate-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 M KCl. Nodulin 26 also exhibited multiple, discreet lower conductance states ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 nS. Nodulin 26 channels were voltage-sensitive. The maximal 3.1-nS state was preferentially occupied at lower applied voltages, whereas the lower conductance states were more frequently occupied at higher voltage potentials. Nodulin 26 channels transported both cations and anions, but showed a weak selectivity for anions. These results represent the first purification and functional characterization of the nodulin 26 channel and support a role for this protein in symbiosome membrane transport."
https://openalex.org/W1551519167,"OmpA protein of Escherichia coli outer membrane can produce diffusion channels when reconstituted into proteoliposomes (Sugawara, E., and Nikaido, H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2507-2511). The pore size is similar to that of the classical E. coli porins OmpF and OmpC, but the penetration rates of small solutes through the OmpA channel are about 50 times slower than that through the OmpF channel. Here we examined the possibility that only a small fraction of the OmpA molecules produces open channels. Unilamellar proteoliposomes were made so that each vesicle contained only a small number of OmpA molecules. These vesicles, containing 0.3 M urea within, were fractionated on a linear iso-osmolar density gradient made of urea and sucrose. This resulted in the clear separation of vesicles not containing any open channel, staying on top of the gradient, from those containing at least one open channel, sedimenting close to the bottom. Calculation using Poisson distribution indicated that only between 2 and 3% of the OmpA molecules contained open channel. The open form is estimated to allow the diffusion of L-arabinose at a rate comparable with that through the OmpF porin channel. The open and closed states were relatively stable properties of the protein. Denaturation of open form OmpA and its subsequent renaturation converted it into a nonfunctional or closed form, suggesting that the open and closed forms represent two alternative conformers of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2160911597,"The mechanism of oxidation of N omega-hydroxyl-L-arginine (NHA) by the iron-dioxygen complex in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is still uncertain. The uncertainty has not been helped by a lack of precision in the notation used to describe the oxidation states and electrical charges on the iron and oxygen in some of the suggested mechanisms. These problems of notation are addressed, and, in addition, a cyclic voltammetric measurement of the oxidation potential of NHA, namely +0.10 +/- 0.04 V versus normal hydrogen electrode, is used to argue that the sometimes postulated oxidation of NHA by the iron-dioxygen complex to form an intermediate radical cation, NHA.+, is very unlikely for thermodynamic reasons. Instead, it is suggested that this oxidation occurs by a thermodynamically favored abstraction of the hydrogen atom from the > C = NOH moiety of NHA to form an intermediate iminoxyl radical, > C = NO(.). A subsequent nucleophilic attack by the iron-hydroperoxide species formed by this H-atom abstraction on the carbon atom of the iminoxyl radical moiety leads to the production of nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline."
https://openalex.org/W1519847403,"To identify novel proteins capable of associating with the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase, we investigated whether Raf-1 could interact with the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of various signal-transducing molecules. In this report, we demonstrate that Raf-1 associated with the SH2 domain of Fyn (a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family) but not with the SH2 domains of phospholipase C-gamma 1, the p85 alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2. Unlike most SH2 domain interactions that require tyrosine-phosphorylated residues, the Raf-1/Fyn SH2 domain association was dependent on the serine phosphorylation of Raf-1. Our results also demonstrate that Raf-1 interacted with the SH2 domain of Src and that this interaction was destabilized by mutation of Arg175 found within the conserved SH2 domain FLVRES sequence. In addition, we show that inclusion of additional Src sequences containing the SH3 domain increased the association of Raf-1 with the Src SH2 domain. Finally, using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system, we show that coexpression of Raf-1 with full-length Fyn/Src resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of Raf-1 with Fyn/Src, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1, and the stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity. These results suggest that Raf-1 may form a functional complex with Fyn/Src mediated in part by SH2 domains and the serine phosphorylation of Raf-1."
https://openalex.org/W1520817333,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) regulates proliferation and differentiation of a variety of hematopoietic cell lineages through binding to the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R). Recently, we have demonstrated that IL-4 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including the IL-4R and also induces association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with the IL-4R. Since IL-4 induces tyrosine phosphorylation, we speculated that some tyrosine kinase may associate with the IL-4R. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-4 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein closely related to, or identical to the c-fes protooncogene-encoded protein tyrosine kinase (FES). Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylated FES or the closely related protein is found associated with the IL-4R. We also demonstrate that FES associates with the IL-4R in COS7 cells transfected with cDNA expression plasmids encoding these two proteins and in transfected COS7 cells IL-4 augments association of FES with the IL-4R and tyrosine phosphorylation of both FES and the IL-4R. Through a deletion analysis of the IL-4R we have identified a putative FES-binding site in the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-4R."
https://openalex.org/W1517922421,"The requirements for efficient translation termination are incompletely understood. Since the local context surrounding stop codons can influence the efficiency of translation termination, premature termination codons introduced by random mutation may not always terminate at the optimal efficiencies expected of naturally occurring stop codons. To investigate whether this could result in physiologically significant levels of read through, we examined the suppression of premature translation termination mutations within a sequence motif of the yeast Ste6 protein (Ste6p) that is highly conserved among members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. The human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is defective in individuals with the disease cystic fibrosis, is also a member of this protein family. The mutations examined in Ste6p were chosen because a premature termination codon at the corresponding residue of CFTR has previously been reported to cause less severe pulmonary involvement than some missense mutations, suggesting that low level suppression of this stop codon could be occurring. Our results indicate that these premature stop codons in Ste6p can be suppressed at frequencies as high as 10%. Characterization of this phenomenon using a beta-galactosidase read through assay system showed that a limited sequence context surrounding this site contained information that was sufficient to cause suppression of translation termination. Amino acid sequence analysis of the full-length translation products produced by read through of an amber codon demonstrated that termination suppression was mediated by near-cognate tRNA mispairing that resulted in the insertion of tyrosine, lysine, or tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W1483782840,"We have previously isolated detergent-resistant membrane complexes from lysates of cultured kidney epithelial cells. These structures are enriched in proteins anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol, which are localized to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells, and have a distinctive lipid composition. We now report that the membranes contain p62yes, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family. p62yes is the only major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the membrane complexes when they are isolated. Several proteins in the complexes can serve as substrates for phosphorylation by p62yes in vitro. The kinase is enriched at least 10-fold in the insoluble membranes compared to cellular membranes. p60c-src and p60v-src, which are highly homologous to p62yes, are not present in the complexes, even when the membranes are isolated from cells that overexpress the proteins. As p62yes is located near the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells in several tissues in vivo, interaction of the kinase with other components of a detergent-resistant membrane microdomain may play an important role in transmembrane signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1601221449,"mtDNA with a point mutation in the tRNA(Ile) gene at nucleotide position 4269 found in a patient with fatal cardiomyopathy and mtDNA with a point mutation in the tRNA(Arg) gene at 10410 found in a patient with Alpers disease were transferred cytoplasmically to rho zero HeLa cells (HeLa cells lacking mtDNA) to determine whether these novel mtDNA mutations in the tRNA genes are responsible for the defects in mitochondrial respiration function observed in these diseases. Cybrid clones (clones of rho zero HeLa cells with mtDNA from the patients) were isolated, and respiratory function and morphology of the mitochondria of the cybrid clones containing wild-type mtDNA and mutant mtDNA predominantly were compared. The results showed that accumulation of mutant mtDNA at 4269 alone without defects in the nuclear genome was sufficient to produce a disease phenotype, while mutant mtDNA at 10410 was not related to pathogenesis and reflected one of the rare polymorphic sites of human mtDNA. Moreover, we found that mitochondria in living cells were significantly swollen only when they contained predominantly the pathogenic mutant mtDNA, suggesting that the functional abnormality of mitochondria induced by pathogenic mtDNA mutations in tRNA genes is always associated with their swollen structure."
https://openalex.org/W1618330282,"Receptor tyrosine phosphatases (R-PTPases) have generated interest because of their suspected involvement in cellular signal transduction. The adaptor protein Grb2 has been implicated in coupling receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras. We report that a ubiquitous R-PTPase, R-PTP-alpha, is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated in vivo with the Grb2 protein. This association can be reproduced in stably and transiently transfected cells, as well as in vitro using recombinant Grb2 protein. Association requires the presence of an intact SH2 domain in Grb2, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of R-PTP-alpha. This observation links a receptor tyrosine phosphatase with a key component of a central cellular signalling pathway and provides a basis for addressing R-PTP-alpha function."
https://openalex.org/W1587914632,"alpha 2-Macroglobulin (alpha 2M)-methylamine binding to macrophages appears to involve two receptors. Binding of alpha 2M-methylamine to low density lipoprotein-related protein (LRP) results in cellular uptake and degradation, while binding to a newly described alpha 2M signaling receptor elevates intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and inositol phosphates. We now demonstrate that binding of lactoferrin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, and lipoprotein lipase to LRP on macrophages results in increased [Ca2+]i and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. Receptor-associated protein, which binds to LRP but not the alpha 2M signaling receptor, blocks the lactoferrin signal but has no effect on alpha 2M-methylamine signaling. The latter observation supports our hypothesis that a distinct signaling receptor binds alpha 2M-methylamine. We further demonstrate that the signaling events induced by lactoferrin may involve a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, while the alpha 2M signaling receptor appears to be coupled to a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein."
https://openalex.org/W3488583,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1C (PTP1C) was the first member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family demonstrated to contain the src homology 2 (SH2) domain. This enzyme is believed to play a role in regulating downstream signaling in hematopoietic cells since it was predominantly expressed in these cells. However, recent studies have revealed that the protein is expressed in other tissues as well. This report describes both the phosphorylation of PTP1C in non-hematopoietic cells treated with growth factors (in vivo) and incubation of purified PTP1C with a variety of protein kinases (in vitro). PTP1C was transiently phosphorylated in A431 and 293 cells and also when the purified enzyme was incubated with receptor protein tyrosine kinases. In vitro, the tyrosine-phosphorylated PTP1C underwent rapid auto-dephosphorylation, an effect which could be blocked by the addition of sodium vanadate. On the other hand, cells containing a PTP1C in which the catalytic site had been inactivated through mutagenesis, stably phosphorylated the phosphatase. These results suggested that PTP1C was responsible for its own auto-dephosphorylation. The sites of tyrosine phosphorylation were characterized from purified enzyme following treatment with insulin receptor kinase and from PTP1C expressed in 293 cells which had been stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor. Through the techniques of peptide mapping and microsequencing, Tyr538 was determined to be the major phosphorylation site. This result was confirmed in vivo through site-specific mutagenesis of PTP1C expressed in 293 cells; changing Tyr538 to Phe538 completely abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of the molecule. In addition, Tyr538 lies within the sequence ESEYGNI which can be correlated with the consensus sequence pYXNX associated with GRB2 binding. These results suggest that PTP1C plays a prominent role in growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction within both hematopoietic cells and tissues of non-lymphoid origin."
https://openalex.org/W1537508497,"We have previously shown that human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is able to inhibit serum-dependent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation of human monocytes and neutrophils in vitro, and to counteract the lethal effects of LPS challenge in vivo. Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is a serum protein which participates in LPS-mediated activation of cells (Tobias, P. S., Mathison, J., Mintz, D., Lee, J. D., Kravchenko, V., Kato, K., Pugin, J., and Ulevitch, R. J. (1992) Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 7, 239-245). We have proposed that BPI functions in a negative feedback loop which opposes this activation (Marra, M. N., Wilde, C. G., Collins, M. S., Snable, J. L., Thornton, M. B., and Scott, R. W. (1992) J. Immunol. 148, 532-537). We have now cloned and expressed recombinant forms of human BPI and LBP. Here we demonstrate that purified recombinant human LBP can replace the serum requirement for both LPS binding to human monocytes and LPS-mediated secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha from these cells. These activities of LBP are inhibited by a neutralizing anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody. We further demonstrate that purified recombinant human BPI can inhibit LBP-mediated LPS binding to cells and their subsequent activation. Comparison of the LPS binding properties of BPI and LBP in enzyme-linked immunosorbent type assays and in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay suggest that BPI has a stronger affinity for LPS than does LBP. Direct competition between BPI and LBP for LPS may explain the inhibition by BPI of the proinflammatory effects of LBP in the presence of LPS."
https://openalex.org/W1503632404,"The assembly of fibronectin fibrils involves the amino-terminal and cell adhesion domains of fibronectin as well as alpha 5 beta 1 integrins. Efficient binding of biotinylated or radioiodinated 70-kDa amino-terminal fragments occurred only if fibroblasts were plated on fibronectin or on 180- or 85-kDa cell adhesion fragments of fibronectin. On an 11.5-kDa fragment of fibronectin that included the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, but not the synergy site, binding was reduced 50-fold. Conformation of the 180-kDa fragment was important for direct binding interactions with the amino terminus of fibronectin. No binding was seen if cells were plated on type I collagen, vitronectin, RGD peptides or antibodies to alpha 5 beta 1 integrins. High affinity interactions between invasin and alpha 5 beta 1 integrin promoted low levels of binding. Monoclonal antibodies that blocked the function of either the RGD or the synergy site inhibited binding of 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragments to cells by approximately 60%. By fluorescence and interference reflection microscopy, biotinylated 70-kDa fragments were shown to co-localize with alpha 5 beta 1 integrins in focal adhesions. We propose that cell-mediated binding of the amino terminus of fibronectin involves interactions with both fibronectin and its alpha 5 beta 1 integrin receptor in an activated complex."
https://openalex.org/W1543013633,"The immunosuppressant FK-506 (tacrolimus) forms a complex with a ubiquitous intracellular receptor, FK-506 binding protein (FKBP12), and this complex inhibits the heterodimeric Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, an essential component of the T-cell receptor signal transduction pathway. Using a series of truncated calcineurin catalytic subunits, we show here that a region within the catalytic subunit that regulates phosphatase activity, the autoinhibitory domain, also regulates the Ca(2+)-dependent interaction of calcineurin with the FK-506.FKBP12 complex. Deletion of this domain produces constitutive activation of the phosphatase as demonstrated by transient transfection experiments in which expression of the truncated protein permitted Ca(2+)-independent induction of interleukin-2 transcription. Thus, deletion of the autoinhibitory domain is necessary and sufficient to constitutively activate calcineurin (CaN). Furthermore, CaN A467-492, an inhibitory peptide based on the autoinhibitory domain from calcineurin (ITSFEEAKGLDRINERMPPRRDAMP), inhibited dephosphorylation of the RII peptide substrate competitively with a Ki = 4 microM, consistent with binding of the autoinhibitory domain at the active site of the enzyme. To assess the role of the autoinhibitory domain in regulating the interaction of CaN with the FK-506.FKBP12 complex, we reconstituted wild type and mutant phosphatase heterodimers using in vitro transcribed and translated subunits. Association of the reconstituted calcineurin heterodimers with FKBP12 was dependent on FK-506. In the case of the wild type heterodimer, association with the FK-506.FKBP12 complex was also dependent upon Ca2+; however, mutant catalytic subunits, in which the autoinhibitory domains were deleted, associated with the drug-binding protein complex in the presence of 10 mM EGTA. These results indicate that the conserved autoinhibitory domain regulates both Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase activity and association with the FK-506.FKBP12 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1546819161,"The erythrocyte chemokine receptor is a cell surface protein that binds a wide array of chemokines including interleukin-8 (IL-8), melanoma growth stimulating activity (MGSA), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted). This protein has also been identified as the Duffy blood group antigen, a cell surface receptor for the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax. In the present study, we have identified a chemokine receptor-like binding protein in a human erythroleukemic cell line (HEL), which, based on its molecular properties, may be related to the erythrocyte chemokine receptor. Saturation binding studies with 125I-IL-8 revealed a single class of IL-8 binding sites in HEL cells with a KD of 7.4 +/- 1.9 nM and a receptor density of 12,818 +/- 965 binding sites/cell. In competition studies unlabeled IL-8 MGSA, MCP-1, and RANTES were fully able to inhibit the binding of 125I-IL-8 to HEL cells. Chemical cross-linking with radiolabeled IL-8 resulted in a cross-linked species of 60 kDa in membranes from HEL cells. The labeling was specific since it was inhibited by pre-incubation with 1 microM unlabeled IL-8 or MGSA. A monoclonal antibody (Fy6) to the human erythrocyte Duffy blood group antigen/chemokine receptor blocked the binding of IL-8 and other chemokines to the HEL cell chemokine receptor-like binding protein. Cell membranes from HEL cells and from erythrocyte ghosts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Fy6. The antibody bound to a molecule with a molecular mass of 50 kDa in HEL cell membranes and 40 kDa in erythrocyte ghosts. Northern blot analysis of mRNA revealed that the HEL chemokine-binding protein hybridized to a cDNA probe to the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1492472480,"Bacterial genes are commonly transcribed to form polycistronic mRNAs bearing reading frames whose respective translational efficiencies are not independently determined. As in many bacterial operons, expression of the atp genes of Escherichia coli is strongly influenced by translational coupling. The gene pair atpHA is tightly coupled, whereby atpA is translated at least three times more efficiently than atpH. However, there is no fixed stoichiometry of coupling: mutations in atpH lead to increases in the translation ratio (atpA/atpH) of up to approximately 40-fold. We have demonstrated that secondary structure sequestering the atpA translational initiation region (TIR) is important to the coupling mechanism in that it inhibits de novo translational initiation at the atpA start codon. Genetic and structural analyses indicate that this inhibitory structure can be induced to refold into a less inhibitory conformation either by introducing two single-base substitutions or as a result of ribosomes translating atpH. We propose a model in which the secondary structure of the atpA TIR acts analogously to a gating device in that it restricts de novo ribosomal initiation until it is switched into a more open conformation. This contrasts with the function of a stem-loop structure located immediately downstream of atpA and upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno region of atpG, which was found to inhibit translation, but not to mediate tight coupling. Results obtained using the specialized ribosome system of Hui and de Boer ((1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 4762-4766) indicate that primarily ribosomes reinitiating after termination on atpH are responsible for inducing refolding of the atpA TIR. The principle of alternative mRNA conformations with different functional properties embodied in the model presented here can only be fulfilled by certain types of structure. It is likely to operate in several steps of prokaryotic gene expression, underlying a range of regulatory events including transcriptional attenuation and translational activation."
https://openalex.org/W1555563546,"The integrin supergene family includes receptors for a variety of extracellular matrix as well as cell surface proteins. Integrin alpha 4 has been shown to play an important role in leukocyte adhesion and extravasation during immune and inflammatory reactions. One recognition sequence known to interact with alpha 4 is the Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) site contained in the connecting segment 1 region of fibronectin. Here we present evidence that shows that a conformationally restricted RGD-containing peptide is a potent inhibitor of cell adhesion mediated by alpha 4 beta 1, a receptor not convincingly documented to interact with RGD peptides. This peptide, 1-adamantaneacetyl-Cys-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Cys (disulfide bridge between residues 1-8), blocks Jurkat cell adhesion to connecting segment 1-containing peptides as well as cell adhesion to cytokine-activated endothelial cells. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to either vascular cell adhesion molecule-expressing cells or recombinant vascular cell adhesion molecule-coated plates was likewise inhibited by this peptide. Furthermore, alpha 4 beta 1 can bind directly to a cyclic RGD peptide immobilized to Sepharose. Integrins, alpha 5 beta 1, alpha v beta 3, alpha IIb/beta IIIa, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha v beta 1, alpha v beta 5, alpha v beta 6, and alpha 3 beta 1, have been shown to recognize the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence present in a variety of extracellular matrix proteins, and our data support the addition of alpha 4 beta 1 to this group. Further studies using molecular modeling of such cyclic RGD peptides could help in the design of more potent peptides or nonpeptide mimetics that could effectively block alpha 4-mediated activity and have potential application in a number of inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1593209973,"PAC1 is an IgM kappa murine monoclonal antibody that, like the Arg-Gly-Asp-containing ligand fibrinogen, binds to integrin alpha IIb beta 3 only on activated platelets. The unique binding properties of PAC1 may be determined by its large size, its multivalency, and by variable region sequences, including an Arg-Tyr-Asp at residues 100A-C in H-CDR3. To study the molecular determinants of PAC1 function, baculoviruses containing cloned cDNA for the Fd heavy and kappa light chains of PAC1 were used to co-infect Sf9 insect cells. Infected cells secreted a soluble, monovalent, 50-kDa Fab fragment that bound saturably to agonist-stimulated platelets but not to resting cells. Fab binding was inhibited > 85% by 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM RGDS, 1 mM fibrinogen gamma 397-411, or 12 microM fibrinogen, but not by 1 mM RGES. Compared to PAC1 IgM, a 60-fold higher molar concentration of PAC1 Fab was required for half-maximal binding to platelets or for half-maximal inhibition of fibrinogen binding. PAC1 Fab bound to an activated form of alpha IIb beta 3 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, but not to the resting form of the receptor in these cells or to alpha v beta 3 in human endothelial cells. Conversion of Asp100C to Glu by site-directed mutagenesis rendered the antibody inactive, indicating that the Arg-Tyr-Asp sequence in H-CDR3 is essential for PAC1 recognition of alpha IIb beta 3. Binding of fibrinogen or PAC1 IgM to platelets induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 140-kDa platelet protein, but binding of PAC1 Fab did not. These studies demonstrate that the specificity of PAC1 for activated alpha IIb beta 3 is determined by an integrin recognition sequence within H-CDR3. However, the strength of this binding interaction and the ability of PAC1 to trigger signaling in platelets also depend on antibody valency."
https://openalex.org/W1532815202,"A portion of the 5'-flanking region of the glycoprotein IIb (alpha IIb) integrin gene extending from -598 to +32 base pairs was isolated. This DNA segment is capable of driving low level base-line transcription in undifferentiated K562 cells. It also contains elements which direct the markedly increased expression observed following megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells with phorbol dibutyrate. Analysis of hybrid alpha IIb-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs indicates that at least three regions within the -598 to +32 region control differentiation-dependent alpha IIb transcription. Two enhancer elements as well as a silencer domain all regulate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcriptional activity in K562 cells. Gel mobility shift experiments revealed that nuclear binding proteins are able to interact with all three DNA regions. A small region lying between -124 and -99 bases is able to bind to nuclear proteins in undifferentiated cells but not in differentiated cells as evidenced by gel mobility shift and foot-printing studies and corresponds to the silencer element identified in the functional studies. Therefore, the tissue-specific expression of alpha IIb may be controlled transcriptionally by both positive and negative factors with the silencer element playing a major role in regulating differentiation-dependent expression."
https://openalex.org/W1592169634,"High level expression of a human polychlorinated biphenyl-binding protein (hPCB-BP; also termed uteroglobin or CC10) was achieved in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein (rhPCB-BP) constituted approximately 1% of total bacterial lysate proteins as judged from in vitro ligand binding assays using 4,4'-bis([3H]methylsulfonyl)-2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl. rhPCB-BP was purified to homogeneity in its native dimeric form. Saturation analysis experiments indicated a Kd of approximately 69 nM for the binding of 4,4'-bis([3H]methylsulfonyl)-2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl to rhPCB-BP. The average number of binding sites (Bmax) calculated from such experiments on purified rhPCB-BP was 49 nmol/mg of protein and is close to the theoretical value of 1 mol of ligand associating with 1 mol of dimeric protein. Purified rhPCB-BP was also found to cause a dose-dependent inhibition of the enzyme porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in vitro. Increasing the concentrations of calcium abolished the inhibition of PLA2 by rhPCB-BP, suggesting that the protein functions in vitro by sequestering Ca2+, an essential PLA2 cofactor. This notion was further supported by direct evidence that 45Ca2+ binds to rhPCB-BP. 1 mol of dimeric protein was also found to bind 2 mol of ruthenium red, an organic dye that detects Ca(2+)-binding proteins, with a Kd of 3 microM. This binding was inhibited by Ca2+, with an IC50 of 7 mM. Finally, it was demonstrated that the addition of a high affinity ligand for the protein had no effect on its ability to inhibit PLA2 under conditions of limiting concentrations of calcium, and the addition of Ca2+ did not affect the binding characteristics of the PCB ligand, suggesting that these two properties of the protein are independent. Our results strongly support the notion that ligand binding is a conserved feature of the homologous uteroglobin/PCB-BP/cc10 proteins in different species, whereas our results question the suggested role of these proteins as specific inhibitors of PLA2."
https://openalex.org/W1482697637,"Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) has recently been linked to signal transduction by cytokine receptors of the hematopoietin family. We have recently described a 116-kDa tyrosine kinase (p116) present in interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor complexes in human YT cells that showed functional characteristics of a JAK kinase. These included receptor association, rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation kinetics in response to ligand, and in vitro autophosphorylating tyrosine kinase activity (Kirken, R. A., Rui, H., Evans, G. A., and Farrar, W. L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22765-22770). Here we extend these observations by demonstrating structural homologies between IL-2-modulated p116 and prolactin-modulated JAK2 in the rat T cell line Nb2. These include similar net charge as determined by nonequilibrium pH gradient electrofocusing and related primary structure based upon phosphopeptide mapping of V8 protease-digested hyperphosphorylated proteins. This putative JAK kinase underwent marked tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7, lymphoid growth factors that use the common IL-2 receptor gamma-chain, but not in response to prolactin. Furthermore, polyclonal antisera to JAK1, JAK2, or tyrosine kinase 2 did not recognize either rat or human p116. However, we identified the IL-2-modulated p116 as the recently cloned novel leukocyte Janus kinase, L-JAK, using an antiserum to a peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of human L-JAK."
https://openalex.org/W1534985859,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor and induces catabolism of normal human very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) via LRP in vitro. Recent studies showed that the C-terminal domain of LPL can bind LRP in solid phase assays and inhibit cellular catabolism of two LRP ligands, activated alpha 2-macroglobulin and the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (Williams, S.E., Inoue, I., Tran, H., Fry, G. L., Pladet, M.W., Iverius, P.-H., Lalouel, J.-M., Chappell, D.A., and Strickland, D.K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 8653-8658). The current study investigated the potential for this region of LPL to promote cellular catabolism of VLDL via LRP. A fragment comprising the C-terminal domain of LPL (designated LPLC) was expressed in bacteria and found to promote cellular binding, uptake, and degradation of normal human VLDL in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were present whether LPLC was added simultaneously with 125I-VLDL or was prebound to cell surfaces prior to the assay. Mutations involving Lys407, Trp393, Trp394, or deletion of the C-terminal 14 residues reduced the effects of LPLC. Three LRP-binding proteins, the receptor-associated protein, lactoferrin, and a polyclonal antibody against LRP, competed for 125I-VLDL degradation induced by LPLC. Heparin or heparinase treatment of cells prevented LPLC-induced 125I-VLDL catabolism. Thus, cell-surface proteoglycans play an important role in this pathway. Interestingly, either LPLC or LPL when added in excess could block LPL-induced 125I-VLDL degradation presumably by interacting directly with LRP. However, unlabeled VLDL could not prevent catabolism of 125I-labeled LPLC or LPL. These data show that cellular fates for VLDL versus LPLC or LPL are divergent. This is probably due to independent catabolism of the latter via cell-surface proteoglycans. In summary, these in vitro studies indicate that a fragment of LPL corresponding to the C-terminal domain mimics the native enzyme with respect to induction of VLDL catabolism via LRP. Because LPLC lacks the catalytic site of native LPL, these studies establish that lipase activity is not required for LRP-mediated lipoprotein catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1588785302,"Using microsomal membrane vesicles derived from sheep cerebellum, we measured the rate of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux from 45Ca(2+)-loaded compartments during rapid perfusion with a medium containing InsP3 and various concentrations of free 40Ca2+ on the cytosolic side (pH 7.1, 5 mM Mg2+, in the absence of ATP at 20 degrees C). At 0.15 microM InsP3 and pCa 6.5, half-45Ca2+ release was attained within less than 200 ms. At low Ca2+ concentrations, the initial rate of 45Ca2+ release depended smoothly on InsP3 concentration, and InsP3 activated release with moderate positive cooperativity. Preliminary experiments performed at various free 40Ca2+ concentrations were consistent with a bell-shaped 40Ca2+ dependence of 45Ca2+ release. In the range of micromolar or higher free 40Ca2+ concentrations, the apparent inhibition of 45Ca2+ release was dependent on InsP3 concentration, and 45Ca2+ release for intermediate InsP3 concentrations was transient; under selected conditions, a second perfusion period, identical to the first one but separated from it by a short recovery period, was found to allow renewed 45Ca2+ efflux. At high Ca2+ concentration, fast reversible Ca(2+)-dependent desensitization of the channel, and not heterogeneity, was therefore responsible for the termination of InsP3-triggered 45Ca2+ efflux at submaximal concentrations of InsP3. At lower Ca2+ concentrations, a large fraction of the apparent activating effect of submicromolar 40Ca2+ concentrations on 45Ca2+ efflux that we had observed in the preliminary experiments proved to be the artifactual consequence of an inhibitory effect exerted by metal-free Ca2+ chelators on InsP3-dependent efflux at nanomolar 40Ca2+ concentrations. 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N'-N'-tetraacetic acid, EGTA, and fluo-3 were all effective inhibitors. When this inhibition was taken into account, a rise in free 40Ca2+ concentration from 30 to 300 nM only weakly enhanced 45Ca2+ fluxes in the presence of a low concentration of InsP3. As a result, submicromolar free 40Ca2+ appears to be only a poor activator of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release under these experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2135389965,"Stimulation of Aplysia bag cell neurons triggers elevation of cAMP and prolonged secretion of ELH neuropeptide. Using video-enhanced microscopy to track individual organelle movements in bag cell neurons, we find that organelle translocation consists of periods of movement interrupted by stationary episodes. cAMP elevation leads to a 2- to 3-fold enhancement of the average rate of organelle transport in both anterograde and retrograde directions. This effect does not result from alteration of the instantaneous velocity of organelle transport along microtubules, but rather from an increase in the proportion of time individual organelles spend in motion. Biochemical measurements also provided evidence that cAMP elevation promotes ELH peptide translocation from the somata into axons. Enhanced transport of ELH as a result of these effects may contribute to the replenishment of neuropeptide-containing vesicles at release sites during prolonged periods of secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1522746721,"Transfection of cDNA for a hepatocyte canalicular phosphoprotein, the rat liver canalicular bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase/cell CAM 105, confers bile acid efflux and ecto-ATPase activities on heterologous cells (Sippel, C. J., Suchy, F. J., Ananthanarayanan, M., and Perlmutter D. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2083-2091). Our previous studies have also indicated that there is a positive correlation between the degree of phosphorylation of this transporter and its bile acid efflux activity. In this study, we introduced site-specific mutations of amino acid residues within a protein kinase C-dependent (T502A, S503A) and a tyrosine kinase-dependent (Y488F) phosphorylation consensus sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of this transporter in order to map the sites that are phosphorylated in vivo and to examine the functional significance of each. COS cells were transfected with mutant and wild type constructs using the pCDM8 expression vector. Metabolic labeling and cell surface labeling showed that the mutant proteins were synthesized and delivered to the cell surface as efficiently as the wild type. Phosphoamino acid analysis using lysates of transfected cells showed that the T502A, S503A mutant contained [32P]phosphotyrosine, the Y488F mutant contained [32P]phosphoserine, and the wild type contained both 32P-labeled amino acids, proving that Ser503 and Tyr488 are the only amino acids phosphorylated in this system under control conditions. Bile acid transport activity was completely abrogated in cells transfected with the T502A, S503A mutant cDNA and was retained but altered in kinetic characteristics in cells transfected with the Y488F mutant cDNA, even though both of these constructs conferred ecto-ATPase activity to the same extent as the wild type cDNA. Taken together, these data show that the bile acid efflux activity of this transporter requires site-specific phosphorylation of Ser503 and is regulated by site-specific phosphorylation of Tyr488."

https://openalex.org/W1543153031,"Expression of the pyrBI operon, which encodes the subunits of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme aspartate transcarbamylase, is regulated primarily through a UTP-sensitive transcriptional attenuation control mechanism in Escherichia coli. In this mechanism, the extent of coupling between transcription and translation within the pyrBI leader region determines the level of p-independent transcriptional termination at an attenuator preceding the pyrB gene. A key feature in this mechanism is transcriptional pausing that occurs before the attenuator in the pyrBI leader region when UTP concentrations are low. In this study, we characterized in detail this UTP-sensitive transcriptional pausing in vitro. Our results show that pausing occurs, to different extents, before the addition of every uridine residue in the leader transcript. This pausing occurred only at low UTP concentrations (20-200 microM) that cause high levels of pyrBI expression in vivo. Transcriptional pausing did not occur in the pyrBI leader region at 20 microM CTP or ATP and only occurred strongly at one site at 20 microM GTP. We also demonstrated that NusA functions as a general enhancer of UTP-sensitive transcriptional pausing in the pyrBI leader region. Finally, we identified at the 3' end of the pyrBI attenuator a 3-base region at which termination occurs. Selection of termination sites within this region was shifted by varying the UTP concentration or including NusA in the transcription reaction mixture."
https://openalex.org/W1492217226,"Abstract Plus strand priming during retroviral reverse transcription requires specific cleavage within the polypurine tract of the viral genome by the reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H. Previously it has been shown that a 190-base RNA-DNA hybrid containing the Moloney murine leukemia virus polypurine tract can serve as a substrate for the priming reaction. To investigate the structural requirements for the reaction, a series of DNA oligonucleotides was hybridized to the 190-base single-stranded RNA and tested as substrates for RNase H. At low enzyme concentrations, the sites of cleavage are located 17-23 nucleotides from the 3'-end of the DNA oligonucleotide, consistent with the observations of others that binding of the DNA polymerase at a primer terminus fixes the position of cleavage by RNase H. At higher enzyme concentrations, additional cleavages are observed in the RNA 3' of these sites, but there is no preference for cleavage at the plus strand origin. In contrast to the results with DNA oligonucleotides, hybridization of RNA oligonucleotides containing the polypurine tract to the 190-base single-stranded DNA generates substrates that are cleaved at the origin and efficiently extended into DNA. An RNA oligonucleotide hybridized downstream of the polypurine tract is cleaved but not extended. These results support the view that RNase H cleavage to generate the plus strand primer is uncoupled from minus strand DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1593462429,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), also known as auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase delta, is involved in DNA replication and repair. Certain patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) produce autoantibodies to PCNA and the autoantibody-defined epitopes of PCNA have been inferred to be conformation-dependent. Based on antigenic properties of continuous primary structure peptides, compound peptides composed of covalently linked discontinuous sequences were synthesized and used as immunogens in rabbits. One compound peptide induced an antibody response to a nuclear antigen which demonstrated a cell cycle-related pattern of nuclear immunofluorescence with maximum expression in the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle associated with other features which simulated the conformation-dependent properties of lupus defined auto-epitopes. Other rabbit antibodies raised against different compound peptides did not show such properties and recognized epitopes which were continuous primary sequence regions. These results show that from analysis of antigenic sites on a protein, it might be possible to construct synthetic compound peptides which can mimic conformation-dependent epitopes recognized by spontaneously occurring autoantibodies."
