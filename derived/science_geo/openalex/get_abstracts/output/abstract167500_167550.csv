https://openalex.org/W2077044335,"Parkinson's disease involves the aggregation of α-synuclein to form fibrils, which are the major constituent of intracellular protein inclusions (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Occupational exposure to specific metals, especially manganese, copper, lead, iron, mercury, zinc, aluminum, appears to be a risk factor for Parkinson's disease based on epidemiological studies. Elevated levels of several of these metals have also been reported in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease subjects. We examined the effect of various metals on the kinetics of fibrillation of recombinant α-synuclein and in inducing conformational changes, as monitored by biophysical techniques. Several di- and trivalent metal ions caused significant accelerations in the rate of α-synuclein fibril formation. Aluminum was the most effective, along with copper(II), iron(III), cobalt(III), and manganese(II). The effectiveness correlated with increasing ion charge density. A correlation was noted between efficiency in stimulating fibrillation and inducing a conformational change, ascribed to formation of a partially folded intermediate. The potential for ligand bridging by polyvalent metal ions is proposed to be an important factor in the metal-induced conformational changes of α-synuclein. The results indicate that low concentrations of some metals can directly induce α-synuclein fibril formation.

Parkinson's disease thioflavin anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry Lewy body Lewy neurite Although clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD)1 were first described less than 200 years ago, there are reports of possible parkinsonian syndromes dating back thousands of years (1Duvoisin R.C. Neurol. Clin. 1992; 10: 310-316Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Gourie-Devi M. Ramu M.G. Venkataram B.S. J. R. Soc. Med. 1991; 84: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Today, PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Although a small percentage of patients are diagnosed before age 50, PD is generally considered an age-related disease, and 1% of the United States population over the age of 60 suffers from this disorder. PD is a slowly progressive disease that affects the neurons in the substantia nigra, a small area of cells in the mid-brain. Gradual degeneration of these cells causes a reduction in dopamine production. This, in turn, can produce one or more of the classic signs of Parkinson's disease: resting tremor; generalized slowness of movement (bradykinesia); stiffness of limbs (rigidity); and gait or balance problems (postural dysfunction). Some surviving nigral dopaminergic neurons contain cytosolic filamentous inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (3Lewy F.H. Lewandowski M. Handbuch der Neurologie. Springer, Berlin1912Google Scholar, 4Forno L.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites also are found in other brain regions and are associated with dementia with Lewy bodies, a common late-life dementia that is clinically similar to Alzheimer's disease (5Okazaki H. Lipkin L.E. Aronson S.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1961; 21: 422-449Google Scholar), in Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (6Trojanowski J.Q. Goedert M. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and in multiple system atrophy. Structurally, typical Lewy bodies appear as intracytoplasmic inclusions, 5–25 μm in diameter with a dense eosinophilic core and clearer surrounding halo. Ultrastructurally, they are composed of a dense core of filamentous and granular material that is surrounded by radially oriented filaments (7Duffy P.E. Tennyson V.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1965; 24: 398-414Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The major fibrillar material of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites was shown to be the presynaptic protein α-synuclein (8Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6030) Google Scholar, 9Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). The etiology of PD is unknown, but recent work (10Tanner C.M. Ottman R. Goldman S.M. Ellenberg J. Chan P. Mayeux R. Langston J.W. JAMA. 1999; 281: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) has shown that, except in extremely rare cases, there is no direct genetic basis for this disease. However, a positive correlation between the prevalence of PD and industrialization has been recognized (11Tanner C.M. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 49-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and this disorder is now considered likely to be an “environmental” disease. In fact, several studies have implicated such environmental factors as pesticides, herbicides, and heavy metals in the PD origin (11Tanner C.M. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 49-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 12Hirsch E.C. Brandel J.P. Galle P. Javoy-Agid F. Agid Y. J.

Woodham B.L. Board P.G. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1999; 53: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The possible involvement of heavy metals in the etiology of PD follows primarily from the results of epidemiological studies. For example, analysis of the PD mortality rates in Michigan (1986–1988) with respect to potential heavy metal exposure revealed that counties with an industry in the paper, chemical, iron, or copper related-industrial categories had significantly higher PD death rates than counties without these industries (19Rybicki B.A. Johnson C.C. Uman J. Gorell J.M. Movement Disorders. 1993; 8: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An epidemiological study (1987–1989) of Valleyfield, southern Quebec, Canada, established that an increased risk for PD is associated with occupational exposure to the three metals manganese, iron, and aluminum, especially when the duration of exposure is longer than 30 years (20Zayed J. Ducic S. Campanella G. Panisset J.C. Andre P. Masson H. Roy M. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 1990; 17: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A population-based case-control study in the Henry Ford Health System (Detroit, MI) suggested that chronic occupational exposure to manganese or copper, individually or to dual combinations of lead, iron, and copper, is associated with PD (16Gorell J.M. Johnson C.C. Rybicki B.A. Peterson E.L. Kortsha G.X. Brown G.G. Richardson R.J. Neurotoxicology. 1999; 20: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gorell J.M. Johnson C.C. Rybicki B.A. Peterson E.L. Kortsha G.X. Brown G.G. Richardson R.J. Neurology. 1997; 48: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Postmortem analysis of brain tissues from patients with Parkinson's disease gives further confirmation for the involvement of heavy metals in this disorder, in that a considerable increase in total iron, zinc, and aluminum content of the parkinsonian substantia nigra was observed when compared with control tissues (12Hirsch E.C. Brandel J.P. Galle P. Javoy-Agid F. Agid Y. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar,22Dexter D.T. Wells F.R. Lees A.J. Agid F. Agid Y. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. J.

Brain. 1991; 114: 1953-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of Lewy bodies in the parkinsonian substantia nigra revealed high levels of iron and the presence of aluminum (12Hirsch E.C. Brandel J.P. Galle P. Javoy-Agid F. Agid Y. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 24Dexter D.T. Carayon A. Javoy-Agid F. Agid Y. Wells F.R. Daniel S.E. Lees A.J. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. Brain. 1991; 114: 1953-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the substantia nigra of the PD brain is characterized by a shift in the Fe2+/Fe3+ratio in favor of Fe3+ and a significant increase in the Fe3+-binding protein, ferritin. In parallel, a significantly lower glutathione content is present (23Riederer P. Sofic E. Rausch W.D. Schmidt B. Reynolds G.P. Jellinger K. Youdim M.B. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Finally, it was shown that unilateral injection of FeCl3 into the substantia nigra of adult rats resulted in a substantial selective decrease of striatal dopamine (95%). As a result, dopamine-related behavioral responses were significantly impaired in the iron-treated rats. This supports the assumption that iron initiates dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (25Youdim M.B. Ben Shachar D. Riederer P. Eur. Neurol. 1991; 31 Suppl. 1: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms that lead to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain stem and particularly in the substantia nigra in PD patients are still unknown. However, oxidative stress is considered to be one of the possible reasons for the neuronal degeneration, resulting from the enhanced level of redox-active metal ions (copper or iron) within the substantia nigra (26Oestreicher E. Sengstock G.J. Riederer P. Olanow C.W. Dunn A.J. Arendash G.W. Brain Res. 1994; 660: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Kienzl E. Puchinger L. Jellinger K. Linert W. Stachelberger H.

In fact, metal-induced oxidant stress can damage critical biological molecules and initiate a cascade of events including mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, and a rise in cytosolic free calcium, leading to cell death. It is known that oxidative stress is manifested by increased metal accumulation (which promotes free radical formation), decreased antioxidant levels (which protect against free radical formation), and oxidative damage, factors characteristic of the affected brain regions in PD (26Oestreicher E. Sengstock G.J. Riederer P. Olanow C.W. Dunn A.J. Arendash G.W. Brain Res. 1994; 660: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Several observations have implicated α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of PD. First of all, α-synuclein was shown to be a major fibrillar component of LBs and LNs (8Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6030) Google Scholar, 9Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). Second, two different missense mutations in the α-synuclein gene, corresponding to A53T and A30P substitutions in α-synuclein, have been identified in a small number of kindreds with autosomal-dominantly inherited, early onset PD (30Polymeropoulos M.H.

Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schöls L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). Finally, the production of wild type α-synuclein in transgenic mice (32Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar) or of wild type A30P and A53T in transgenic flies (33Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar) leads to motor deficits and neuronal inclusions reminiscent of PD. α-Synuclein is a small (14 kDa), highly conserved presynaptic protein, of unknown function, that is abundant in various regions of the brain (34Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of α-synuclein is characterized by six imperfect repeats (KTKEGV) within the N-terminal region (residues 1–95), as well as by an acidic C-terminal region (residues 96–140) (35Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 38Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Structurally, purified α-synuclein belongs to the rapidly growing family of natively unfolded proteins, which have little or no ordered structure under physiological conditions (39Weinreb P.H. Zhen W.G. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 40Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol.

Natively unfolded proteins are characterized by a unique combination of low overall hydrophobicity and large net charge (42Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). The aggregation behavior of recombinant α-synuclein has been studied in vitro. Both the whole protein as well as its 1–87 and 1–120 truncated forms are readily able to assemble into filaments, with morphologies and staining characteristics similar to those extracted from disease-affected brain (40Uversky V.N.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) The kinetics of fibrillation are consistent with a nucleation-dependent mechanism (48Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S.

Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), with the critical early stage of the structural transformation of the protein involving a partially folded intermediate (40Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10733-10744Google Scholar). Several possible mechanisms for metal-stimulated fibrillation of α-synuclein can be envisaged. The simplest would involve direct interactions between α-synuclein and the metal, leading to structural changes in α-synuclein, and resulting in the enhanced propensity to aggregate. Little is currently known about the effect of elevated concentrations of metal ions on the structural properties and aggregation behavior of α-synuclein, although most hypotheses favor a role of metal-induced oxidative damage. However, it has been reported that α-synuclein aggregation is facilitated in the presence of Cu2+ (51Paik S.R. Shin H.J. Lee J.H. Chang C.S. Kim J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and that Al3+ may induce structural perturbations in this protein (52Paik S.R. Lee J.H. Kim D.H. Chang C.S. Kim J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Here, we present the results of a systematic analysis of the effect of various metal ions (monovalent, bivalent, and trivalent) on the structural and aggregation properties of human recombinant α-synuclein in vitro. Metal ions, especially polyvalent ones, can directly and dramatically accelerate the rate of α-synuclein fibrillation. They also induce a conformational change, which leads to a partially folded intermediate, which we propose is the critical precursor to fibrils. Thioflavin T (ThT) and 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) were obtained from Sigma. LiCl, KCl, NaCl, CsCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, ZnCl2, CuCl2, MnCl2, CdCl2, AlCl3, CoCl2, CoCl3, FeCl3, and FeSO4 were from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. All other chemicals were of analytical grade from Fisher. Human recombinant α-synuclein was produced and purified as described earlier (40Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10733-10744Google Scholar). The chloride salts of the metal ions Li+, K+, Na+, Cs+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Co3+, Al3+, and Fe3+ were initially prepared in stocks of 100 mm with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. Appropriate aliquots of these stocks were added to the protein solution. The reactions were held for ∼45 min at room temperature, prior to initiating the fibril incubation at 37 °C (see below). Solutions of 0.5 ml of α-synuclein at pH 7.5 in 10 mm Tris buffer were stirred at 37 °C in glass vials with micro stir bars. Protein concentrations were kept at 70 μm. Fibril formation was monitored with thioflavin T fluorescence (53Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar); aliquots of 10 μl were removed from the incubated sample and added to 1.0 ml of 20 μm ThT in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The presence of fibrils was confirmed by EM (negative staining with uranyl acetate). The kinetics of α-synuclein fibrillation are sigmoidal, defined by an initial lag phase, a subsequent growth phase in which ThT fluorescence increased, and a final equilibrium phase, where ThT fluorescence reached a plateau indicating the end of fibril formation. ThT fluorescence measurements were plotted as a function of time and fitted to a sigmoidal curve using the empirical Equation 1 (54Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), F=(Fi+mit)+(Ff+mft)1+e(t−t50)τEq. 1 where F is the fluorescence intensity, and t50 is the time to 50% of maximal fluorescence. Thus, the apparent rate constant, kapp, for the growth of fibrils is given by 1/τ, and the lag time is taken as t50 − 2τ. CD spectra were obtained with an AVIV 60DS spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ) using α-synuclein concentration of ∼35 μm. Spectra were recorded in a 0.01-cm path length cell from 250 to 190 nm with a step size of 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1.5 nm, and an averaging time of 10 s. For all spectra, an average of 5 scans was obtained. CD spectra of the appropriate buffers were recorded and subtracted from the protein spectra. Fluorescence measurements were performed in semimicro quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with a 1-cm excitation light path using a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (Instruments S.A., Inc., Jobin Yvon-Spex). The light source was a 150-watt xenon lamp. Tyrosine fluorescence was excited at 275 nm and monitored in the range from 290 to 350 nm. Protein concentration for the intrinsic fluorescence measurements was kept at about 3.5 μm, unless otherwise mentioned. Acrylamide quenching studies of intrinsic fluorescence were performed by adding aliquots from a stock solution of the quencher into a cuvette containing the protein solution. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for dilution effects. Fluorescence quenching data were analyzed using the general form of the Stern-Volmer equation, taking into account not only the dynamic but also static quenching (55Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 2: I0I=(1+KSV[Q])eV[Q]Eq. 2 where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher; KSV is the dynamic quenching constant; V is a static quenching constant; and [Q] is the quencher concentration. A stock solution of 1 mm ANS was prepared in distilled, deionized water. The concentration of the dye was determined by its absorption at 350 nm. The [ANS]/[α-synuclein] ratio in all experiments was kept equal to 5. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C in 1-ml semi-micro quartz cuvettes (Hellma, Germany) with a 1-cm excitation light path. Emission spectra were recorded from 400 to 600 nm with excitation at 350 nm in increments of 1 nm, an integration time of 1 s, and a slit width of 1 nm for both excitation and emission. Data were processed using DataMax software. ThT fluorescence was recorded immediately after addition of protein aliquots to the ThT mixture from 470 to 560 nm with excitation at 450 nm, an increment of 1 nm, an integration time of 1 s, and slits of 5 nm for both excitation and emission. For each sample the signal was obtained as the ThT intensity at 482 nm from which was subtracted a blank measurement recorded prior to addition of α-synuclein to the ThT solution. All data were processed using DataMax/GRAMS software. UV absorbance spectra of α-synuclein in the presence or absence of metal ions were monitored in semimicro quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with a 5-mm light path using a HP-8452A diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard). Mature fibrils, formed in the presence of Al3+, were pelleted and washed extensively and then examined for the presence of aluminum using ICP-MS. Analysis was performed with a Finnigan MAT Element instrument. We have previously shown that the structural transformations of natively unfolded α-synuclein leading to a partially folded intermediate and formation of the nucleus represent two key kinetic steps in the process of fibrillation of this protein (40Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10733-10744Google Scholar). Thus, α-synuclein fibrillation may be minimally presented by the following Scheme 1,UN↔I↔Nucl→FSCHEME 1 where UN, I, Nucl, and F correspond to natively unfolded conformation, partially folded intermediate, fibril nucleus, and fibril, respectively. This model suggests that factors shifting the equilibrium in favor of the intermediate and/or nucleus will facilitate fibril formation. Hence, an increase in protein concentration is predicted to increase the concentration of the intermediate and thus the rate of fibrillation. The kinetics of fibril formation were monitored using the thioflavin T assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The effect of α-synuclein concentration on the kinetics of fibril formation at 37 °C is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Ashows that at a given protein concentration the changes in ThT fluorescence intensity follow a characteristic sigmoidal curve,i.e. an initial lag phase, a subsequent exponential growth phase, and a final equilibrium phase. This curve is consistent with a nucleation-dependent elongation model of fibril formation (48Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol.

Fig. 1 A shows that an increase in the protein concentration resulted in a decrease in the lag time and an increase in the rate constant for fibril growth. Fig. 1 B illustrates that there is an inverse linear correlation between the logarithm of α-synuclein concentration and the duration of lag time. This observation may reflect an important aspect of the kinetics of nucleus formation. In fact, the formation of the aggregation-prone partially folded intermediate might represent the rate-limiting step in α-synuclein nucleation, and this process might be the first-order one. This would mean that the key partially folded intermediate, once formed, oligomerizes very rapidly to form insoluble fibrils. Fig.1 C shows that there is also a linear dependence of the first-order rate constant for fibril growth (elongation) on the protein concentration. The kinetics of elongation have been shown to follow first-order kinetics for other proteins, including amyloid β-protein and insulin (54Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S.

The simplest explanation for this fact is that increasing protein concentration leads to increasing numbers of fibrils, due to increasing concentration of nuclei. Solutions of α-synuclein, stirred at 37 °C at pH 7.5, formed fibrils over a period of days to weeks, depending on the protein concentration (see Fig. 1), ionic strength, and the agitation rate of the incubation solution (data not shown). Under the standard assay conditions used (low ionic strength, moderate agitation), the lag was >2 weeks for 35 μm α-synuclein. In order to determine whether metal ions could directly affect the fibril formation of α-synuclein, we monitored the rate of formation of fibrils in the presence of mono-, di-, and trivalent cations as the chloride salts. The presence of 2 mm of AlCl3, FeCl3, CoCl3, or CuCl2 induced fibrils at pH 7.5 with a ≤1-day lag (Fig.2). Thus in the presence of these cations the rate of fibril formation was dramatically faster (>50-fold) than in their absence. With several other di- and trivalent metal ions the rate of fibril formation was also significantly enhanced (Fig. 2). In contrast, with monovalent ions, and zinc, magnesium, and calcium, no fibrils were observed in the first 100 h, indicating that these cations had minim"

Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). In all eukaryotic molybdenum enzymes studied so far molybdenum is chelated by the so-called molybdenum cofactor (Moco)1 (2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). According to additional molybdenum ligands, the enzymes are devided into two subgroups: enzymes with a dioxo-molybdenum center like nitrate reductase and sulfite oxidase carry two oxygen atoms at the molybdenum, while those with a monooxo-molybdenum center possess only one oxygen atom and a terminal sulfur atom instead of the second oxygen atom (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, aldehyde oxidase (AO; EC1.2.3.1) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH; EC 1.1.1.204) belong to this latter group of molybdenum enzymes (3Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Crit. Rev. Plant. Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Crossref Google Scholar). During the last decade, plant mutants have been described for Arabidopsis (aba3(4Schwartz S.H. Leon-Kloosterziel K.M. Koornneef M. Zeevaart J.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar)), tomato (flacca (5Marin E. Marion-Poll A. Plant Physiol.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)) that completely lack the activities for AO and XDH but show normal activities for nitrate reductase. In crude extracts of these plant mutants, the activities of AO and XDH could be restored in vitro by anaerobic treatment with sulfide/dithionite, and thus it was proposed that these plants are defective in the final sulfuration step for AO and XDH. All of these mutants show reduction or total loss of seed dormancy, have a wilty phenotype, and are impaired in stress response, which is typical for the lack of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). It was described that AO catalyzes the last step of ABA biosynthesis, the conversion of abscisic aldehyde to ABA (7Zeevaart J.A.D. Hooykaas P. Hall M.A. Libbenga K.R. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plant Hormones. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1999: 189-207Google Scholar). InArabidopsis, four AOs are known (8Sekimoto H. Seo M. Kawakami N.

In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, a mutation in themaroon-like locus (ma-l) impairs the activities of AO and XDH, while the activity of sulfite oxidase is unaffected (11Wahl R.C. Warner C.K.

Here we report the cloning, purification, and biochemical characterization of Arabidopsis ABA3. ABA3 is a two-domain protein with an N-terminal NifS-like sulfurase domain and a C-terminal domain that might be involved in recognizing the target enzymes. We established a fully defined in vitro system, which demonstrated that the purified recombinant protein is able to activateArabidopsis AO by using l-cysteine as sulfur donor. We also show that the expression of the aba3 gene is inducible by drought stress leading to increased AO activities. A. thalianaseeds were grown in pots containing low nutrient soil in an AR-36LArabidopsis growth chamber (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA) at 16 h light/8 h darkness, 20 °C, 70% relative humidity. For drought stress experiments, soil was completely removed from the roots prior to incubation under normal conditions in the chamber for 4 h (loss of fresh weight about 50%). Total RNA was prepared as described previously (16Logemann J. Schell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar); mRNA was prepared using the Oligotex mRNA Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Arabidopsis RNA was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and oligo-d(T)18-BamHI primer. RT-PCR was performed on a PCR-Express gradient cycler (Hybaid, Heidelberg, Germany) by using the Proof-SprinterTM kit (Hybaid). Degenerated primers were ABA3-Deg.1+ (5′-CCT ACT GGC CTG GGC GCT CTG CTT GT-3′) and ABA3-Deg.2− (5′-AAA TGC AGC ACA GGA CTT GAT TGGGTA-3′); specific primers were ABA3–5′-UTR (5′-CGT CGG CGA TTT TTC AGA GAT TAC CAG-3′) and ABA3–3′-UTR (5′-CAA TGG TAT ACA GGT CCA GTA ACA G-3′). All RT-PCR-generated cDNAs were directly ligated to pGEM-T Easy (Promega). aba3 cDNA was used as template for PCR to remove 5′- and 3′-UTRs and to generateBamHI sites at each end (aba3-start-BamHI/NcoI, 5′-TTT CTT GGA TCC ATG GAA GCA TTT CTT AAG GAA TTC-3′;aba3-stop-BamHI, 5′-CAC AAG CGG ATC CTT ATT CAA TAT CTG GAT TAA CTT CTT CCC C-3′). The resulting 2.5-kilobase pair PCR fragment containing the total coding region was subcloned into pQE80 (Qiagen). Sequence analysis was performed with the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit on an ABI Prism 310 cycle sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) with a pop 6 polymer. Northern analysis was performed as described previously (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 20 µg of total ArabidopsisRNA. For detection the Gene Image CDP-Star detection module kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. Full-length aba3cDNA probes were labeled by PCR with fluorescein-11-dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For overexpression,aba3-cDNA was cloned into pQE80 (Qiagen) resulting in a N-terminal 6×His tag fusion. Protein expression was performed inEscherichia coli DH5α. Cells carrying the expression construct were grown aerobically at 37 °C up to anA600 of 0.5–0.6, followed by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside before cultivation was continued for 8 h at 30 °C. Overexpression of recombinant 6×His-tagged Arabidopsis AOα in the yeast Pichia pastoris (kindly provided by T. Koshiba, Tokyo, Japan) was performed as described previously (18Koiwai H. Akaba S. Seo M. Komano T. Koshiba T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant ABA3 and AOα was performed on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-superflow matrix (Qiagen) under native conditions at 4 °C. For further purification ABA3 was subjected to anion exchange chromatography using an UNO Q-1 column (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A). Protein samples were applied to the column and eluted with buffer A followed by a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. Plant material was squeezed at 4 °C in 2 volumes of extraction buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.5), sonificated, and centrifuged. AO activity was detected by activity staining as described previously (19Koshiba T. Saito E. Ono N. Yamamoto N. Sato M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). XDH activity in plant crude extracts was visualized as described for AO activity, but containing 300 µm hypoxanthine as substrate in 250 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.5. Nitrate reductase activity was determined as described previously (20Scheible W.R. Gonzalez-Fontes A. Morcuende R. Lauerer M. Geiger M. Glaab J. Gojon A. Schulze E.D. Stitt M. Planta. 1997; 203: 304-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Determination ofl-cysteine desulfurase activity of recombinant ABA3 as well as inhibition of ABA3 activity by thiol-specific alkylation withN-ethylmaleimide were performed as described for NifS (15Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The in vitro reconstitution of recombinant AOα by ABA3 was performed aerobically in a total volume of 0.4 ml of 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0. AOα (80 µg) was incubated with ABA3 (160 µg) in the presence of 1 mml-cysteine for 1 h at 30 °C, followed by activity staining with indole-3-carboxaldehyde as substrate. Inactivation of recombinant AOα by KCN treatment and anaerobic reconstitution of AO/XDH by sulfide and dithionite were performed as described previously (21Akaba S. Seo M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Sekimoto H. Kamiya Y. Furuya N. Komano T. Koshiba T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis aba3 mutants were proposed to be affected in molybdenum enzyme activation because of their lack in AO and XDH activities while activity of NR is preserved (4Schwartz S.H. Leon-Kloosterziel K.M. Koornneef M. Zeevaart J.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To clone theaba3 gene, degenerated primers were derived from highly conserved regions in bovine mcsu (GenBankTMAB036422), Drosophila maroon-like (mal, GenBankTMAF162681), and Aspergillus hxB(GenBankTMAF128114) and yielded an 809-bp RT-PCR fragment from A. thaliana leaf mRNA. Sequence analysis of this fragment showed strong similarities to the previously mentioned genes on peptide level, and it matched to the genomic BAC clone F19K19/AC011808 of Arabidopsis chromosome 1, which then was analyzed by exon/intron prediction software (ORNL Grail (compbio.ornl.gov/Grail-1.3/) and GenScan (genes.mit.edu/GS/)). Information about transcription initiation and termination was used to create primers for 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, and RT-PCR was performed to amplify full-length cDNAs of aba3. The 2460-bp coding sequence of the resulting cDNA (GenBankTMAF325457) consists of 21 exons with an average size of 117 bp. The aba3 gene includes a region of 5737 bp (F19K19 position 79194/ATG to position 73458/TAA) with an average intron size of 164 bp, and genomic DNA hybridization showed that it represents a single copy locus (data not shown). In addition to the 2460-bp open reading frame we also identified various mRNA splice forms, which all follow the gt/ag splice rules, leading to truncated forms of the protein if translated (data not shown). We found that in the case of alternative splicing at least two splice events occur in each affected mRNA, mainly in the 3′-region. The deduced ABA3 protein consists of 819 amino acids and shows a two-domain structure (Fig.1A). The N-terminal domain has homologies to bacterial NifS proteins that are known as PLP-dependent sulfurtransferases (15Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In this domain, we identified highly conserved binding motifs for PLP and for persulfide (Fig. 1A) and a putative RNA recognition motif known from ABA response proteins. The C-terminal domain lacks meaningful homologies to any other functionally described proteins in eukaryotes; however, the data base reveals significant homologies to a group of bacterial proteins, with a few of them showing 2Fe/2S-binding signatures within a ferredoxin-like domain (E. coli, GenBankTMAAC74033 and Vibrio cholerae, GenBankTMAAF96821). Conclusions derived from this observation will be discussed below. We analyzed theArabidopsis mutants aba3.1, aba3.2, and a novel T-DNA-tagged mutant line 13.5 (provided by A. Marion-Poll, INRA, Versailles, France), presenting a similar phenotype. In all three mutants, AO and XDH activities could be restored by anaerobic treatment with sulfide and dithionite (data not shown), indicating that the same locus is affected. For molecular analysis of the mutants we cloned the aba3mutant alleles by RT-PCR and genomic PCR. We found that the mutation inaba3.1 resides in a substitution of G to A on cDNA position 1406, resulting in the exchange of a glycine by glutamic acid within a highly conserved region located in the C-terminal domain at amino acid position 469 (Fig. 1A). For aba3.2(Fig. 1B) and 13.5 (Fig.1C), more complex mutations were found. In both cases splice sites are affected within the NifS-like domain, leading to truncated open reading frames of the aba3 transcript. Sequence analyses of aba3-homologous mutants in humans (13Ichida K. Matsumura T. Sakuma R. Hosoya T. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and cattle (14Watanabe T. Ihara N. Itoh T. Fujita T. Sugimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21789-21792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) localized the mutations within the NifS-like domain, while in fly mutants intragenic complementation was observed (22Finnerty V. Ashburner M. Novitski E. The Genetics and Biology of Drosophila. Academic Press, New York1976: 721-766Google Scholar). Taken together, mutations can be found in the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains, showing that both domains are essential for the sulfurase function of ABA3. RNA blotting of samples from different organs of Arabidopsisplants showed that aba3 was expressed in all organs tested with highest levels in leaves and roots of adult plants (data not shown). After exposing whole plants to dehydration for 4 h, increased amounts of aba3-mRNA were observed in the leaves (Fig. 2A). Additionally, increased activity levels of AOs were detectable (Fig.2B), which underlines the physiological importance of ABA3 for the plant to cope with drought stress. Because significant amounts of desulfo forms of AO and XDH are present in plants at each time, one might suggest that increased expression of ABA3 and subsequent sulfuration of desulfo-AO/XDH under stress is a fast way of adaptation to new environmental conditions. ABA3 was recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel-NTA chromatography, exchange chromatography and gel filtration to more than 90% homogeneity (data not shown). The purified protein was yellow in color, indicating the presence of a bound chromophore, which might be PLP as known for NifS and NifS-like enzymes (15Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis gave a molecular mass of 95 kDa for recombinant ABA3, which corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of 92.6 kDa. ABA3 is proposed to transfer a sulfur from a yet unknown source to AO and XDH. To test whether ABA3 uses in vitro one of the sulfur-containing amino acids as substrate, we added these amino acids to separate samples of purified ABA3 and looked for changes in the visible spectra of the protein. When using l-cysteine, we found a shift of 14 nm in the major absorbance as it was published for NifS (15Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by a coupled assay (15Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) in which the formation of l-alanine is measured. By using this assay we showed that in the presence of DTT, ABA3 converted up to 65% of the given l-cysteine to l-alanine, while only 3% was converted without DTT (Fig.3A). Obviously the reductant DTT has to release the persulfide from ABA3 for maintainingl-cysteine degradation, so that it can be assumed that in the absence of desulfo-AO/XDH, DTT serves as a substitute for an appropriate acceptor. In general, the enzymatic activity of ABA3 in the absence of its native acceptors appears to be very slow (conversion of 1.5 mol of l-cysteine/mol of ABA3/min, Fig.3A). Based on primary sequence comparison to NifS enzymes and to eukaryotic Moco sulfurases, an active site cysteine appears to be involved in catalysis and therefore should be sensitive to alkylating reagents. When we pretreated ABA3 with the thiol-specific alkylating reagentN-ethylmaleimide in a molar ratio of 1:4 (ABA3:N-ethylmaleimide; Fig. 3B), we found an inhibition of l-cysteine desulfurase activity of about 71%, indicating that an active site SH group actually must be involved in catalysis. In summary, the following observations lead us to suggest that ABA3 catalyzes a reaction similar to bacterial NifS: (i) ABA3 contains a PLP binding motif highly conserved among eukaryotes and bacteria, (ii) ABA3 contains a conserved sequence motif including an invariant cysteine that in the case of NifS was shown to bind the intermediate persulfide responsible for sulfurtransfer from cysteine to the target; thiol-specific alkylation of ABA3 inhibited this sulfurtransfer, (iii) purified ABA3 has a yellow color and showed a NifS-like change in absorbance in the presence of l-cysteine, and (iv) ABA3 has a cysteine desulfurase activity. To finally prove that ABA3 has a Moco sulfurase function and is able to transfer sulfur from cysteine to AO and XDH, we developed a fully defined in vitro assay with Arabidopsis AO as target. For this assay, isoform AOα encoded by AAO-1 cDNA was recombinantly expressed and purified from P. pastoris (18Koiwai H. Akaba S. Seo M. Komano T. Koshiba T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the assay, 80 µg of purified recombinant AOα and 160 µg of recombinant ABA3 were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C under aerobic conditions in the presence of 1 mml-cysteine. Variations of this assay were performed with partially KCN-inactivated AOα protein. For subsequent determination of AO activity we did not use a spectrophotometric assay but chose the more sensitive in situ staining after native PAGE, using indole-3-carboxaldehyde as substrate. The results shown in Fig. 3C depict that AOα as prepared from Pichia has a basal activity that could be enhanced by ABA3 in the presence of l-cysteine and that ABA3 reconstituted the AO activity of KCN-treated AOα protein in the presence of l-cysteine. This ABA3-mediated activation of AOα was as efficient as the chemical activation by anaerobic treatment of inactivated AOα with sulfide and dithionite (Fig.3C).

Our experiments show that purified ABA3 is able to activate AO in a defined in vitro system using l-cysteine as sulfur donor. The data obtained provide a first hint that the reaction type of ABA3 is similar to that of bacterial NifS involving an active site (most probably the invariant Cys430) that is sensitive to alkylation. Whether or not, also under in vivoconditions, l-cysteine is the native sulfur donor remains to be determined. Finally we have to discuss how ABA3 can distinguish between its correct targets (=enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family) and its incorrect targets (=enzymes of the sulfite oxidase family). Here the 2Fe/2S centers may be an important distinction, because the former family of enzymes possesses 2Fe/2S centers, while the latter group of enyzmes lacks them. It could well be that ABA3 recognizes its correct group of target enzymes on their FeS center binding fold. Keeping in mind that the C-terminal domain of ABA3 shows homologies to bacterial proteins that carry 2Fe/2S centers, one might speculate that the C-terminal domain of ABA3 is involved in recognizing this important property of its target molybdenum enzymes. Further experiments will show whether this assumption is correct. We thank A. Marion-Poll (Versailles, France) for providing aba3 mutants, T. Koshiba (Tokyo, Japan) for providing the AOα-overexpressing Pichia strain, and J. Zeevaart (East Lansing, MI) for kindly donating ABA-aldehyde. We are grateful to V. Finnerty and G.

https://openalex.org/W2076163606,"Detergent-stable multimers of α-synuclein have been found specifically in the brains of patients with Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show that recombinant α-synuclein forms multimers in vitro upon exposure to vesicles containing certain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) acyl groups, including arachidonoyl and docosahexaenoyl. This process occurs at physiological concentrations and much faster than in aqueous solution. PUFA-induced aggregation involves physical association with the vesicle surface via the large apolipoprotein-like lipid-binding domain that constitutes the majority of the protein. β- and γ-synucleins, as well as the Parkinson’s disease-associated α-synuclein variants A30P and A53T, show similar tendencies to multimerize in the presence of PUFAs. Multimerization does not require the presence of any tyrosine residues in the sequence. The membrane-based interaction of the synucleins with specific long chain polyunsaturated phospholipids may be relevant to the protein family’s physiological functions and may also contribute to the aggregation of α-synuclein observed in neurodegenerative disease.

In a previous study of α-synuclein’s interaction with phospholipids, we incidentally observed that exposure of recombinant α-synuclein to phosphatidylinositol stimulates the formation of stable apparent multimers that are maintained throughout SDS gel electrophoresis (2Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositols play a critical role in vesicle cycling at presynaptic terminals, where α-synuclein is particularly enriched. Moreover, factors that stimulate multimerization of α-synuclein may have a direct role in promoting neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, we set out to characterize more thoroughly the basis for the enhancement of synuclein multimerization by specific phospholipids. The human α-synuclein cDNA used in this study was the generous gift of M. Irizarry. Human β- and γ-synuclein cDNAs were cloned from an adult human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). The canary α-synuclein cDNA was originally cloned from mRNA representing a portion of the canary telencephalon (9George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). For bacterial expression, these cDNAs were subcloned into pET28(a) (Novagen), which directs inducible expression under a T7 lac promoter. All mutant forms of human and canary α-synuclein were constructed by long polymerase chain reaction-based techniques using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene), 5′-phosphorylated primers, and subsequent re-circularization of polymerase chain reaction products by T4 ligase. The correct DNA sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Relative to wild type human α-synuclein, the mutant constructs are described as follows: Δ3, residues 9–43 deleted (retains SYN303 epitope at N terminus); Δ3′, residues 2–42 replaced by a single residue, Ala; Δ4, residues 43–56 deleted; Δ5, residues 56–102 replaced by a single residue, Glu; Δ6, residues 103–130 deleted; Δ7, residues 130–140 deleted; A30P, residue Ala30 replaced by a single residue, Pro; A53T, residue Ala53 replaced by a single residue, Thr. Relative to canary α-synuclein, in mutant construct Y4F, residues Tyr39, Tyr128, Tyr136, and Tyr139 were each replaced by a single residue, Phe.

Clostripain (Sigma) was activated in 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2 at 22 °C for 3 h and then incubated with purified, recombinant canary α-synuclein or human β-synuclein at 37 °C for 2 h. Clostripain and undigested synuclein proteins were removed by passage through a Centricon 10 filter (Amicon). β-Synuclein C-terminal fragment was purified sequentially by reversed-phase chromatography (POROS-R2; PerSeptive Biosystems), anion exchange chromatography (POROS-HQ, PerSeptive Biosystems), and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Canary C-terminal fragment was purified by size exclusion (Superdex 75; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant human α-synuclein was purified from bacteria and exposed to vesicles prepared from a base of synthetic POPC, following conditions previously described (2Davidson W.S. Jonas A.

The protein/vesicle mixtures were then fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting with the H3C monoclonal antibody (9George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F.

Smaller amounts of apparent trimers and even larger multimers were also sometimes evident, especially with prolonged incubations, after which immunoreactivity would appear in the stacking gel. Upon size exclusion chromatography of synuclein PIP2 mixtures, both monomeric and multimeric forms of synuclein eluted with SUV fractions (Fig. 1), indicating a stable and specific physical association with membrane surfaces of high curvature (2Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). In parallel incubations using vesicles containing several other synthetic phospholipids, only monomeric synuclein eluted, as free protein with neutral phospholipids and with SUV fractions when acidic phospholipids were used (not shown; see Ref. 2Davidson W.S.

We reasoned that the apparent selectivity of multimerization for PI and PIP2 might be attributable to the lipid head group (phosphoinositol), the lipid acyl chains, or some combination of both. The PI and PIP2 used in these studies were purified from animal sources and thus bear a heterogeneous mix of acyl groups (TableI). To test for sensitivity to acyl chain composition, we compared the response to PI derived from either bovine liver or soy. Liver PI, but not soy PI, induced a large amount of α-synuclein dimer and detectable trimer after 12 h (Fig. 2 A). Soy PI is abundant in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) tails of 18 carbons (linoleoyl and linolenoyl) but lacks the longer chain PUFAs characteristic of animal-derived phospholipids (Table I). Soy PI is also deficient in the intermediate length saturated acyl chain, stearoyl.Table ICompositions (mol %) of experimental vesicles containing natural source phospholipidsVesicle designation:Brain PIP2Liver PISoy PIHead group PC929292 PI88 PIP28Acyl group Palmitoyl (16:0)4646.148.4 Stearoyl (18:0)2.73.30.7 Oleoyl (18:1)4746.946.5 Linoleoyl (18:2)0.53.8 Linolenoyl (18:3)0.6 Eicosatrienoyl (20:3)0.8 Arachidonoyl (20:4)2.61.4 Docosahexaenoyl (22:6)0.2 Other1.90.80.2Vesicles were prepared (2Davidson W.S.

For each acyl group, the number of carbons and unsaturated bonds is given in parentheses, following standard conventions. Since soy PI was less effective at inducing multimerization and was especially deficient in arachidonoyl and stearoyl (Table I), we tested the hypothesis that the presence of these acyl chains in the phospholipid vesicles is sufficient to induce multimerization. As Fig. 2 B demonstrates, multimerization did not occur when synuclein was exposed to acidic vesicles containing only palmitoyl and oleoyl acyl chains (lanes labeled —). However, when synuclein was incubated with POPC vesicles supplemented with both stearoyl and arachidonoyl (by inclusion of 10% SAPC), robust multimerization occurred. Inclusion of stearoyl chains alone did not induce multimerization (Fig. 2 B, SOPC), whereas arachidonoyl inclusion alone was sufficient (Fig. 2 B,PAPC). We also tested another long chain PUFA acyl group with a different arrangement of unsaturated bonds, docosahexaenoyl (Fig. 2 B, SDPC). This acyl chain was as effective as arachidonoyl at inducing multimerization of α-synuclein, indicating a potentially general role for long chain polyunsaturated acyl groups in triggering α-synuclein multimer formation. In a related experiment (Fig. 2 C), we tested whether PUFAs alone (as free fatty acids) can cause the same effect as PUFA-containing phospholipids. Incubation of α-synuclein with free AA at 10–100 μm (lanes 3–6) caused little if any acceleration of multimerization compared with that observed for α-synuclein in buffer with no AA (lanes 1 and 2). At 1 mm (above the critical micellar concentration for AA), robust multimerization occurred (lanes 7 and 8). This concentration dependence suggests that PUFAs exert their effects on synuclein when organized as either a micellar (free fatty acid) or vesicular (phospholipid) surface. As a further test of the role of surface association in PUFA-dependent multimerization, we compared arachidonoyl-containi"

The establishment of pregnancy depends on successful implantation, where a complex series of interactions occurs between the heterogeneous cell types of the uterus and blastocyst. Although a number of genes are implicated in embryo-uterine interactions during implantation, genetic evidence suggests that only a small number of them are critical to this process. To obtain a global view and identify novel pathways of implantation, we used a dual screening strategy to analyze the expression of nearly 10,000 mouse genes by microarray analysis. Comparison of implantation and interimplantation sites by a conservative statistical approach revealed 36 up-regulated genes and 27 down-regulated genes at the implantation site. We also compared the uterine gene expression profile of progesterone-treated, delayed implanting mice to that of mice in which delayed implantation was terminated by estrogen. The results show up-regulation of 128 genes and down-regulation of 101 genes after termination of the delayed implantation. A combined analysis of these experiments showed specific up-regulation of 27 genes both at the implantation site and during uterine activation, representing a broad diversity of molecular functions. In contrast, the majority of genes that were decreased in the combined analysis were related to host immunity or the immune response, suggesting the importance of these genes in regulating the uterine environment for the implanting blastocyst. Collectively, we identified genes with recognized roles in implantation, genes with potential roles in this process, and genes whose functions have yet to be defined in this event. The identification of unique genetic markers for the onset of implantation signifies that genome-wide analysis coupled with functional assays is a promising approach to resolve the molecular pathways required for successful implantation.

Sik similar protein epidermal growth factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen major histocompatibility complex Early loss of pregnancy is a significant clinical problem for women and their health care providers. Successful embryo implantation depends upon bi-directional communication between the blastocyst and the uterus. Recent advances in our ability to define complex biochemical and genetic pathways have begun to unfold the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of implantation (1Carson D.D. Bagchi I.

Development. 1996; 122: 2687-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Implantation is defined as a process by which the blastocyst makes the first physical and physiological contact with the maternal uterine luminal epithelium. Under the influence of ovarian steroid hormones, an optimal “window” for implantation is created when the activated state of the developing blastocyst overlaps with a brief period of uterine receptivity (12Psychoyos A. Greep R.O. Astwood E.G. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Washington, DC1973: 187-215Google Scholar, 13Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In pregnant mice, removal of preimplantation estrogen secretion by ovariectomy postpones the onset of implantation and induces blastocyst dormancy (14Yoshinaga K. Adams C.E. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1966; 12: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A single injection of estrogen can reactivate the signaling network resulting in implantation in the progesterone (P4)-primed uterus. This model, termed “delayed implantation,” has provided insights into the cellular communication pathways between the uterine and embryonic cell types and led to the identification of embryo-induced uterine genes that correspond to early steps in the establishment of pregnancy (2Paria B.C. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Dey S.K. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The blastocyst and uterus generate various factors during implantation, but it is likely that the molecular “cross-talk” between them involves many more yet unknown factors. Indeed, it is more realistic to view the process of implantation as a condition of equilibrium in the up-regulation and down-regulation of a diverse set of genes. Identification of other essential regulatory steps is necessary to further understand the biologic basis for the establishment of pregnancy or the underlying causes of pregnancy failures. In this respect, two recent reports highlight gene expression profiling in the post-implantation period (15Yoshioka K. Matsuda F. Takakura K. Noda Y. Imakawa K. Sakai S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Popovici R.M. Kao L.C. Giudice L.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3510-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, no such analysis at the onset of implantation has been reported. To address this issue, we employed two complementary strategies using murine GeneChip Expression Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) to determine global gene expression profiles during implantation in mice. The first approach compared RNAs from implantation and interimplantation sites to identify genes that are specifically up- or down-regulated at the implantation site. A second analysis compared RNA from P4-primed pregnant uteri with delayed implantation with that of P4-primed uteri after estrogen activation. Several genes with known expression status at the implantation site were detected. In addition, cell-specific expression patterns in the implantation and interimplantation sites were observed for four candidate genes, confirming the validity of this approach. Mice with delayed implantation expressed a large number of genes associated with immunity or immune responses. The suppression of these genes at the implantation site also suggests that this site is immunologically privileged during early pregnancy and that modulation of the immune response is an active process during implantation. There were 81 genes whose expression was affected in both analyses. These results suggest that pan-genomic gene expression profiles are a promising approach for the identification of markers of uterine receptivity during implantation and that multiple screening strategies yield a distinct set of candidate genes that appear to be critical in early pregnancy. All experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards for the care and use of animals. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation or were anesthetized for survival surgery with avertin. Adult virgin CD-1 female mice were mated with fertile males of the same strain to induce pregnancy (day 1 = vaginal plug). Increased stromal vascular permeability at the site of initial contact of the blastocyst with the uterine luminal epithelium is the first visible sign of the implantation process (11:00–12:00 p.m. on day 4) and can be monitored by an intravenous injection of a blue dye (12Psychoyos A. Greep R.O. Astwood E.G. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Washington, DC1973: 187-215Google Scholar, 13Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Development. 1994; 120: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the first analysis, implantation and interimplantation sites were divided by sharp dissection at 11:00–12:00 p.m. on day 4 (n = 12 mice). Uterine segments included uterine myometrium, stroma, and epithelium. Implantation sites also included blastocysts. Because there are normal variations in the timing of implantation, only those uteri with uniformly distinct blue bands were included, whereas regions with embryo crowding were discarded (Fig.1). In the second analysis, P4-primed uteri of mice with delayed implantation were compared with P4-treated uteri after estrogen activation. To induce delayed implantation, pregnant females were ovariectomized on the morning of day 4 of pregnancy (9:00 a.m.) and given daily subcutaneous injections of P4 (2 mg/mouse in 0.1 ml of sesame oil) from days 5 through 7 (13Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 14Yoshinaga K. Adams C.E. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1966; 12: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To terminate delayed implantation and induce blastocyst activation, a single subcutaneous injection of estradiol-17β (25 ng/mouse in 0.1 ml of oil) was given to one group of animals at the same time as P4 injection on the third day of delay (day 7). Whole uteri (n = 6) were collected from each of these two groups 12 h after the last injection of steroids. Uterine tissues were flash frozen at the time of dissection and stored at −80 °C. Specimens of implantation and interimplantation regions and of delayed and activated uteri were separately pooled, and total RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. An additional RNA cleanup step was performed using the Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) RNeasy total RNA isolation kit. Total RNA (10 μg) from each group was used to generate cDNA using the Superscript Choice system (Life Technologies). First-strand synthesis was performed using a T7-(dT)24 primer (Sigma-Genosys, Woodlands, TX). The resulting cDNA was used to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA via in vitro transcription using the ENZO BioArray HighYield RNA transcript labeling kit (Affymetrix, Inc.). The cRNA was fragmented in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 100 mm potassium acetate, and 30 mmmagnesium acetate, final concentration) by heating to 94 °C for 35 min. The quality of each cRNA preparation was assessed by analysis with a Test2 array (Affymetrix, Inc.), and all preparations met Affymetrix's recommended criteria for use on their expression arrays. Each cRNA (15 μg) preparation was used to inoculate murine U74A GeneChip expression arrays (Affymetrix, Inc.), and the hybridization, staining, scan, and analysis were conducted per recommended protocols. An Affymetrix software filter was applied to mask transcripts with incorrect orientation in the public data bases. Although numerous expressed sequence tags were differentially expressed, only those transcripts with known identities are reported herein. Three replicate hybridizations were performed using each of the four pooled RNA samples (implantation, interimplantation, delayed, activated) to establish the reproducibility of our results. Alterations in RNA transcript levels were analyzed using the Affymetrix Analysis Suite 4.0 software. Differences in levels of fluorescence intensity, which represents levels of hybridization, between the 25 base pair oligonucleotides and their mismatches, were analyzed by multiple decision matrices to determine the presence or absence of gene expression and to derive an average difference score representing the relative level of gene expression. Background and noise corrections account for nonspecific binding and minor variations in hybridization conditions. Values for the mean and standard deviation of the three replicate average difference scores were calculated for each gene on the GeneChip. Comparison between groups was performed by Student’s t test (p < 0.05 considered significant). The -fold change in expression between groups was calculated from the mean average difference scores. A second approach was used to verify the identification of differentially expressed genes. Affymetrix algorithms produced statistical decisions for an increase or decrease in expression when comparing the hybridization results of any two samples. Thus, paired comparisons of three replicate hybridizations resulted in nine possible outcomes for a single analysis (e.g. implantation versus interimplantation). Transcripts with statistically significant expression (by t test) that were also differentially expressed in four or more of the nine pair-wise comparisons (increase or decrease) were considered candidates for further evaluation. Others have used this counting approach using somewhat higher cut-off points (18Jin H. Yang R. Awad T.A. Wang F. Li W. Williams S.P. Ogasawara A. Shimada B. Williams P.M. de Feo G. Paoni N.F. Circulation. 2001; 103: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, at higher threshold levels, we noted that a number of genes, known to be expressed at the implantation site, were excluded. In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (17Das S.K. Wang X.N. Paria B.C. Damm D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Development. 1994; 120: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled cRNA probes were generated for Sik-SP, Bip,Cyp1b1, and ptgerep4 (EP4) with the appropriate polymerases (19Yang Z.M.

Hybridization intensity to the arrays was uniform for housekeeping genes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and cyclophilin and a large number of ribosomal proteins, indicating that the expression data in the array hybridization experiments are consistent with other standards for studying gene expression. The relative levels of gene expression at the implantation and interimplantation sites were first compared by plotting the average difference values for one individual array hybridization experiment against another and determining the presence or absence of gene expression for the entire array (Fig. 2). Genes that were considered absent or marginally expressed were widely dispersed (black points), whereas genes that were declared present in both hybridizations were tightly grouped (red points). An increase of more than 2-fold in the average difference score indicated genes with significantly higher expression at the implantation site (above the curve) or at the interimplantation region (below the curve) (Fig. 2). These results show that a vast majority of the genes on the chip have similar expression patterns (present, absent, or marginal) and their relevance to implantation is questionable. A small number of genes were present in both (red points) or present in one but marginal or absent in the other (blue points) that also had greater than a 2-fold difference in the level of expression. These genes were considered as potential candidates for further evaluation. Surprisingly, a symmetrical distribution of these candidate genes was observed, suggesting that an equal number of genes are up-regulated in the implantation and interimplantation regions. Genes with statistically significant differences in expression at implantation versus interimplantation sites were identified by comparison of replicate hybridizations and by a statistical decision for an increase or a decrease in gene expression. By t test alone, there were 293 up-regulated and 370 down-regulated genes at the implantation site. A second statistical approach was performed to provide an additional objective analysis. We used a threshold value of four of the nine possible outcomes, which resulted in 49 up-regulated and 60 down-regulated genes and included several known genes that are expressed during implantation or are considered biologically relevant to the implantation process. A combination of t test and counting approaches identified 36 genes that were up-regulated at the implantation site and 27 genes that were down-regulated (TablesI andII).Table IGenes with significantly increased expression at the implantation siteGeneBank™ No.Gene descriptionChangeFunctional category-foldX83601Pentraxin-related gene5.76Inflammatory/primary responseY11666Hexokinase II3.16EnzymeX59769Interleukin 1 receptor, type II1-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.3.07ReceptorAF091432Cyclin E22.88Cell cycleM63801Connexin 43 (α-1 gap junction)1-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.2.58Structural proteinM14223Ribonucleotide reductase M2 subunit2.55DNA/chromatin-relatedX62154Mcm 3 homolog2.14DNA/chromatin-relatedM20658Interleukin 1 receptor, type I1-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.2.12ReceptorL40406Heat shock protein, 105 kDa2.07ChaperoneM35970Tumor metastatic process-associated protein (NM23)2.02NeoplasiaD55720Karyopherin (importin) α22.02Protein processing/transportJ04627NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase1.94EnzymeX01756Cytochrome c, somatic1.91EnzymeX72310Transcription factor Dp 11.90Transcription factorM95604Snail homolog1.83Transcription factorM81445Connexin 26 (β-2 gap junction)1-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.1.82Structural proteinAF053232SIK similar protein1-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.1.79Calcium-relatedZ29532Follistatin1-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.1.77Growth factor/cytokineM61007CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β1.75Transcription factorU14648Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 101.72RNA processingM31885Inhibitor of DNA binding 11.69DNA/chromatin-relatedL26320Flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN-1)1.66DNA/chromatin-relatedD26089Mcm 4 homolog (cdc21)1.65DNA/chromatin-relatedZ67748Spermidine synthase1.61EnzymeX56045RAN binding protein 11.60Protein processing/transportX56304Tenascin C1-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.1.60Structural proteinD85904Apg-21.59ChaperoneM31418Interferon-activated gene 2021.55Growth factor/cytokineU97327Calcyclin binding protein1.54Calcium-relatedAF041476BAF53a1.54DNA/chromatin-relatedJ05479Calcineurin catalytic subunit1.54Calcium-relatedX91656Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 3 (SRp20)1.53RNA processingU27830mSTI11.52ChaperoneJ04633Heat shock protein 861-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.1.49ChaperoneX57800Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)1.45Cell cycleAJ002387BIP1-aGenes with known expression during the peri-implantation period.1.40Calcium-related, chaperoneRNAs from implantation and interimplantation sites were obtained for GeneChip hybridization.

Differentially expressed genes were identified by two statistical methods. By definition, genes with decreased expression at the implantation site also have increased expression in the interimplantation region (see Fig. 3). Differentially expressed genes were categorized based on the best available information regarding their biologic functions. Genes with multiple functions were assigned to a single category. Many genes that are known to be associated with the implantation process fall into categories similar to the genes we detected with increased expression at the implantation site, including growth factors/cytokines and their receptors, transcription factors, genes encoding structural proteins, or genes associated with cell proliferation. We also observed up-regulation of a group of calcium-related genes, including Bip, Sik similar protein (Sik-SP 1), and calcineurin- and calcyclin-related proteins. Genes encoding Bip and Sik-SP showed highly localized expression at the implantation site, confirming our array results (Fig. 3). These genes are of interest, because calcium is an essential modulator of enzyme functions and signal transduction, and there is evidence that genes involved in calcium regulation play an important role during implantation (21Das S.K.

Previous efforts to identify novel genes during the peri-implantation period have primarily focused on the implantation site, with less attention paid to genes that are expressed at the interimplantation region. Genes with increased expression at the interimplantation site may act to guide the blastocyst to specific sites for implantation or be important for embryo spacing. Aberrant expression of these genes may be as detrimental to implantation as the loss of genes that are expressed at the implantation site. In our gene array experiments, we observed a 5-fold decrease in levels of Cyp1b1 expression at the implantation site. Cyp1b1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 system that converts primary estrogens to their active metabolites, catecholestrogens, which are important for blastocyst activation (20Paria B.C. Lim H. Wang X.N. Liehr J. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5235-5246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In situ hybridization showed that Cyp1b1 is restricted to the subepithelial stroma of the interimplantation region (Fig. 3), in agreement with the decreased expression levels seen in the array experiments. A similar expression pattern was noted for the prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype, EP4, which showed a nearly 2-fold decrease by gene array. The overall diversity of genes with this pattern of expression suggests that further investigation of interimplantation-specific genes is warranted. To identify genes that are up-regulated at the time of blastocyst activation for implantation, RNAs from P4-primed delayed implanting uteri and P4-primed uteri after estrogen treatment were obtained for comparative analysis. Scatterplot analysis of genes considered absent or present showed that overall gene expression patterns in delayed and activated uteri were closely correlated (Fig. 2). The tight distribution of overall expression is similar to that seen in the implantation versus interimplantation analysis. The overall similarity of the two different scatterplots is not surprising, because the ultimate outcome, implantation, is similar in both models and the experiments were designed to be complementary and provide a dual approach to identify novel implantation-specific genes.

https://openalex.org/W2126645075,"CLIC1 (NCC27) is a member of the highly conserved class of chloride ion channels that exists in both soluble and integral membrane forms. Purified CLIC1 can integrate into synthetic lipid bilayers forming a chloride channel with similar properties to those observed in vivo. The structure of the soluble form of CLIC1 has been determined at 1.4-Å resolution. The protein is monomeric and structurally homologous to the glutathioneS-transferase superfamily, and it has a redox-active site resembling glutaredoxin. The structure of the complex of CLIC1 with glutathione shows that glutathione occupies the redox-active site, which is adjacent to an open, elongated slot lined by basic residues. Integration of CLIC1 into the membrane is likely to require a major structural rearrangement, probably of the N-domain (residues 1–90), with the putative transmembrane helix arising from residues in the vicinity of the redox-active site. The structure indicates that CLIC1 is likely to be controlled by redox-dependent processes.

A 62-kDa homologue of p64 is crucial to osteoclast function as it forms the chloride channel that facilitates the acidification of the ruffled border in bone resorption (15Schlesinger P.H. Blair H.C.

An unusual feature of the CLIC family of ion channels is that they exist in both soluble and integral membrane forms. In this they are similar to the other intracellular ion channels like the annexins and BCL-xL as well as some of the bacterial toxins. The manner by which CLIC proteins form a transmembrane (TM) chloride ion channel remains speculative. It has been suggested that there is either one (5Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B.

Studies with FLAG epitope-tagged CLIC1 suggest that when it is integrated into the plasma membrane the amino terminus is on the outside, and the carboxyl terminus is on the cytoplasmic side (12Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To date, nothing is known about the structure of any chloride ion channels at an atomic level. We have solved the crystal structure of the soluble form of CLIC1 (NCC27) at 1.4-Å resolution. The structure demonstrates that CLIC1 is a structural homologue of the GST superfamily and that it has an intact glutathione (GSH) binding site. This site closely resembles that of glutaredoxin in that it appears to have a redox-active cysteine (Cys24), which is capable of forming a covalent mixed disulfide with glutathione. The glutaredoxin-like GSH binding site is conserved in all CLICs suggesting that their chloride ion channel activity may be under the control of redox-active signaling moleculesin vivo. A recombinant GST-CLIC1 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pGEX-4T-1 vector system and purified as described previously (5Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M.

The protein used in this study is a point mutant form of CLIC1 (E151G), which was inadvertently generated by polymerase chain reaction infidelity. Briefly, the fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-S-Sepharose (AMRAD-Pharmacia), where it was cleaved with biotin-labeled thrombin (Novagen). The thrombin was removed with a streptavidin-agarose affinity matrix, and CLIC1 was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex G75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) where it ran as a monomer. Protein was dialyzed and concentrated to 10–20 mg/ml using a vacuum dialysis system (Sartorius). In addition to the point mutation, the final product contained two additional residues at the amino terminus (Gly-Ser) that formed part of the thrombin cleavage site in the fusion construct (5Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Crystals of CLIC1 were grown by sitting or hanging drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein (5–20 mg/ml with 0.5% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside) with reservoir buffer consisting of 14–18% polyethylene glycol monomethylether 5000, 0–30 mm ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Crystals were sensitive to temperature; hence, all manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Crystals appeared within 1 week, after which they were transferred to a cryoprotectant by a series of transfers to a final solution consisting of reservoir buffer plus 10% polyethylene glycol 400 and 200 mg/ml glucose. Diffraction data were collected in house at 100 K on a DIP2030 imaging plate system mounted on a Nonius rotating anode generator using CuKα radiation and focusing mirrors. Two crystal forms were produced: P1 with lattice dimensions a = 42.52 Å, b = 45.19 Å, c = 71.27 Å, α = 102.79°, β = 100.21°, and γ=110.88°; and P21 with lattice dimensions a = 46.69 Å, b = 60.93 Å, c = 90.11 Å, and β = 92.27°; they diffracted to 2.0 and 2.4 Å, respectively. A monoclinic crystal underwent a lattice transition to P21with a = 45.18 Å, b = 55.14 Å, c = 88.96 Å, and β = 90.0° and diffracted to 1.4-Å resolution. A data set was collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline BL-9.1 with an x-ray wavelength of λ = 0.98 Å on a MAR on-line image plate detector. A 2.3 Å data set was collected from the same crystal to ensure data completeness at low resolution. All data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Rotation functions (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Several derivative data sets were collected from the P21β = 92° crystal form by soaking it in 0.5 mmHgCl2 for between 2 h and 2 weeks at 4 °C (TableI). Twelve mercury sites with varying occupancies were located by difference Patterson and difference Fourier methods using the CCP4 suite of programs (27Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Phases generated from three mercury derivatives (varying in soak time) were used to generate a DM (28Cowtan K. Joint CCP 4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) modified map at 2.8-Å resolution (Table I). The map was of sufficient quality to allow the main chain to be traced using the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). A model was built consisting of residues Pro6–Leu148 and Lys166–Lys241. This model was then used as a molecular replacement model for the 1.4-Å resolution P21β = 90° data set. The program wARP was used to refine the phases (30Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wARP map showed clear density for all residues from Pro6 to Lys241 for each monomer in the asymmetric unit. The model was built in program O and refined using REFMAC5 (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). wARP was then used to build in water molecules. A similar procedure was used to solve the structure of the 2.0-Å resolution P1 data set.Table IPhasing statistics at 2.8 ÅDataCdit1-aSoak time in 0.5 mm HgCl2.Complete1-bCompleteness of the data.Rsym1-cRsym = Σ‖Ii−〈Ii〉‖/ΣIi.Red.1-dAverage redundancy.I/ςRiso1-eRiso=Σ‖FPH−FP‖/Σ‖FP‖.Rcullis1-fRcullis = Σ∥FPHobs‖−‖FPHcalc∥/Σ∥FPH‖−‖FP∥.Sites1-gNumber of mercury sites.PhP1-hPhasing power = Σ‖FH‖/Σ∥FPHobs‖−‖FPHcalc∥.Native98.00.0453.518.0(90.2)1-iValues in parentheses refer to the high resolution shell (2.9–2.8 Å).(0.143)(6.5)Hg12 wk99.90.0577.223.350.420.55 /0.421-jSlash separates acentric and centric values.122.0 /3.61-jSlash separates acentric and centric values.(100)(0.24)(5.2)Hg21 day96.40.0443.414.80.210.76 /0.57121.4 /2.8(96.2)(0.15)(6.2)Hg33 days96.90.0473.821.20.410.49 /0.45113.5 /2.1(86.6)(0.21)(8.4)1-a Soak time in 0.5 mm HgCl2.1-b Completeness of the data.1-c Rsym = Σ‖Ii−〈Ii〉‖/ΣIi.1-d Average redundancy.1-e Riso=Σ‖FPH−FP‖/Σ‖FP‖.1-f Rcullis = Σ∥FPHobs‖−‖FPHcalc∥/Σ∥FPH‖−‖FP∥.1-g Number of mercury sites.1-h Phasing power = Σ‖FH‖/Σ∥FPHobs‖−‖FPHcalc∥.1-i Values in parentheses refer to the high resolution shell (2.9–2.8 Å).1-j Slash separates acentric and centric values. Open table in a new tab For the 1.4-Å resolution data, the final model consists of residues Pro6 to Lys241 for each monomer in the asymmetric unit plus 660 water molecules. The crystallographicR-factor is 0.138 with R-free 0.178 (32Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). The two monomers in the asymmetric unit are nearly identical with the A monomer slightly more ordered as evidenced by B-factors and difference maps. Differences are observed around Pro90, which is cis in the A monomer but appears to be in two states (cis and trans) in the B monomer. This alternate conformer of Pro91 results in the presence of two states for helices h1 and h3 in the B monomer. This may indicate some plasticity in the molecule, which is described under “Results and Discussion.” Another region of flexibility is the extended loop from Pro147 to Gln164. This has several regions of poor side chain density in the A monomer, and the density is generally weaker in the B monomer. The point mutation E151G resides in this loop.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of the β = 92° form were soaked with 5 mm GSSG in stabilization buffer. 1.75-Å resolution data sets were collected at SSRL (at 100 K) using a Quantum-4 CCD camera (ADSC) for native and GSSG-soaked CLIC1 crystals. These were processed as per the native form (Table II). The structure of the native state was determined by molecular replacement using the refined 1.4 Å structure as a starting model. In the β = 92° crystal form, monomer B is disordered compared with monomer A. The crystal structure was modeled by TLS refinement as implemented in the program REFMAC5 (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) followed by coordinate and B-factor refinement using REFMAC5 as per the 1.4 Å structure. The final model consisted of residues Pro6–Pro147 and Arg165–Lys241 in monomer A and residues Pro6–Cys89, Arg92–Leu99, Ser103–Pro147, and Arg165–Lys241 in monomer B. 2Fo − Fc maps showed excellent electron density for monomer A with broader density for portions of monomer B due to the angular disorder. This is reflected in the relatively small number of well defined water molecules and the high crystallographic R-factors. Refinement statistics are shown in Table II. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the PDB (accession code 1K0O). To determine the effect of the soaking GSSG into the crystals, difference Fourier maps were generated by subtracting the experimental amplitudes and calculating phases based on the refined β = 92° native structure. The only difference density observed at 4ς was in the vicinity of Cys24 in each monomer. Difference electron density was stronger and showed better definition in monomer A, in keeping with the protein density. The structure of the glutathione complex was solved and refined as per the native, β = 92° where glutathione atoms were excluded from initial stages of refinement. Finally, glutathione was docked into the difference density in monomer A only and the refined as per the native structure (Table II). As per the native form, monomer A showed excellent electron density while monomer B showed regions with broad features. This is reflected in the refinement statistics (Table II). Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the PDB (accession code 1K0N). To determine the number of covalent glutathione-CLIC1 adducts and their respective equilibrium constants,Kox = ([RSSG][GSH])/([RSH][GSSG]), CLIC1 (1 mg/ml in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with various ratios of [GSH]/[GSSG] from 1:10 to 2:1 (Table IV). In each case the concentration of GSSG was 5 mm except in the 2:1 sample where the concentration of GSH was 5 mm. The protein was then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and analyzed by mass spectrometry on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR) in positive ion mode using a caffeic acid matrix with external calibration using β-lactoglobulin-A (operated by Dr. Anne Poljak at the Ray Williams Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University of New South Wales, Sydney). Each sample was analyzed in duplicate, and the percentages of glutathione-adducted CLIC1 molecules were determined by calculating the relative areas under each peak in the spectrum for the doubly charged species as this gave greater resolution than the singly charged species. The mass spectrometry data was fitted to four and six independent binding site models with individual equilibrium constants,Kox, which were evaluated by minimizing the χ2 between the distribution of observed and calculated oxidized species.Table IVFormation of glutathione-CLIC1 adducts[GSH]/[GSSG]Observed glutathione bound per CLIC101234% total protein (% calculated on six-site model)0.06134029120.113 (3)4-aNumbers in parentheses are % of total protein calculated on the six-site model.15 (21)34 (36)23 (28)16 (11)0.216 (9)42 (40)31 (34)11 (13)0 (3)0.541 (31)44 (49)15 (17)0 (3)0 (0)1.047 (51)41 (41)12 (7)0 (1)0 (0)2.059 (69)32 (28)8 (2)0 (0)0 (0)4-a Numbers in parentheses are % of total protein calculated on the six-site model. Open table in a new tab Single-channel recordings from lipid bilayers were obtained using the tip-dip method (34Coronado R. Latorre R. Biophys. J. 1983; 43: 231-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In brief, patch-clamp pipettes (Garner Glass 7052) were made using a P97 Sutter puller (Novato, CA) decorated with Sylgard (Dow Corning) and fire-polished to a tip diameter of 1–1.5 μm and 5–7-megaohm resistance. The same solution (140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6) was used both in the bath and in the pipette. As soon as the pipette tip reached the bath solution a phospholipid monolayer (phosphatidylcholine; Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Birmingham, AL) was spread on the surface. Repetitive solution dipping of the electrode was continued until the pipette resistance reached a value higher than 5 gigaohms. Purified recombinant CLIC1 protein was then added to the bath to reach a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Axopatch 1D and pCLAMP 7 (Axon Instruments, Inc., Novato, CA) were used to record and analyze single-channel currents. Current recordings were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 800 Hz. As a control, we performed patch-clamp electrophysiology on inside-out patches of a CLIC1-expressing CHO cell line using standard methods as reported previously (12Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The structure of the soluble form of CLIC1 (point mutant E151G) has been determined in two crystal forms at 1.4-Å (P21, β = 90°) and 1.75-Å (P21, β = 92°) resolution, respectively (Fig.1, see Tables I and II for details regarding structure determination and refinement). In each crystal form, the protein is monomeric albeit with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In the 1.4 Å structure, clear electron density was seen for all residues from Pro6 to Lys241, while in the second form, residues Leu148–Arg165 are disordered. For the most part, all structures are identical (r.m.s.d. of 0.34 Å between the A and B monomers of the 1.4 Å structure compared with r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å between the A monomers in the β = 90° and β = 92° crystal forms) with slight alterations observed in the loop region (Pro147–Gln164) at the foot of the molecule (Fig. 1, A or B, bottom right). This region extends from the body of the protein, and its structure is likely to be more susceptible to alterations caused by crystal packing. There is also evidence for plasticity within the structure (see below). Ψ-Blast searches (35Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

The inhibitory effects of K+ on apoptosome formation are antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by cytochrome c. These studies support the hypothesis that the normal intracellular concentrations of K+ act to safeguard the cell against inappropriate formation of the apoptosome complex, caused by the inadvertent release of small amounts of cytochrome c.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). The activation of caspases is a central and key event in apoptotic cell death. During both death receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated apoptosis, large caspase-activating complexes are formed, which recruit and activate the effector caspases (3Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In receptor-mediated apoptosis, such as CD95/Fas/APO-1, receptor ligation and trimerization induce the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex, located at the cell membrane, which recruits procaspase-8, via the FADD/MORT1 adaptor molecule (4Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar).

Apaf-1, the first identified mammalian homologue of CED-4, is an ∼130-kDa protein that contains an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain, a CED-4 homology region, and a C-terminal domain containing multiple WD-40 repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (9Zou H.

The kinetics, mechanism, and regulation of apoptosome formation are still not fully understood. Initial studies suggested a requirement for dATP/ATP hydrolysis, since nonhydrolyzable analogues, such as ATPγS,1 were incapable of activating Apaf-1 (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 13Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies using highly purified Apaf-1 have shown that dATP is not hydrolyzed and that nonhydrolyzable β,γ-methylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate can support apoptosome formation (16Jiang X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31199-31203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c facilitates dATP binding to Apaf-1, possibly by inducing a conformational change, which exposes dATP binding sites (16Jiang X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31199-31203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Initial studies showed that cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 in a 2:1 stoichiometry with high affinity (Ka = 1011m−1) that is markedly reduced (Ka = 4 × 107m−1) in the presence of normal intracellular K+ concentrations [K+]i (17Purring C.

A. 2000; 97: 11928-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These findings imply that the ionic conditions in the cell may regulate cytochrome c binding to Apaf-1, thereby modulating apoptosome formation. Interestingly, [K+]i has been proposed to regulate the apoptotic process, since normal levels suppress caspase activation and DNA fragmentation (19Hughes F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), suggesting that a threshold level must be reached before caspase activation and associated events can be activated. Since cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation is antagonized by increasing ionic strength (21Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Slater A.F.G. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it is possible that the regulatory control point is the formation of the apoptosome complex. Previously, we had shown in THP.1 cell lysates that dATP activation produces two apoptosome complexes with approximate molecular masses of ∼1.4 MDa and 700 kDa (11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The smaller ∼700-kDa complex is the most active caspase-processing complex and predominates in apoptotic cells (11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22Almond J.B. Snowden R.T. Hunter A. Dinsdale D. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We now show that normal [K+]i strongly inhibits the formation of this apoptosome complex and that high levels of cytochrome covercome this inhibition. We propose that the normal ionic environment of the cell protects against apoptosome formation unless a critical threshold of cytochrome c is exceeded, which then allows assembly and activation of the ∼700-kDa complex. In effect, this provides a safety mechanism, which guards against inappropriate activation of the caspase cascade. Human monocytic tumor cells (THP.1) were grown in RPMI 1640 media with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell lysates prepared (100,000 × g supernatants) from control and apoptotic cells were prepared as described previously (10Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol.

Apoptotic cell death was assessed by increased annexin V binding and flow cytometry in THP.1 cells treated for 6 h with various stimuli including etoposide (20 μm) (a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor) or TPCK (75 μm) (a chymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibitor), TLCK (200 μm) (a trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor) plus cycloheximide (100 μm), and staurosporine (0.5 μm) (a protein kinase c inhibitor) as described previously (23Sun X.-M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Caspase activation in control lysates was induced by incubation (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C with 2 mmdATP and 2 mm MgCl2 (10Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The [K+] and [Na+] of lysates and assay buffers were determined using an ion-selective electrode and an Abbot Aeroset Clinical Analyzer (Abbots Diagnostic Division, Maidenhead, UK). DEVDase activity (i.e. primarily caspase-3 and -7) of lysates or column fractions was measured fluorimetrically (λex/λem = 405/510 nm) at 37 °C in 96-well plates in 200 μl of assay buffer (20 μmbenzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, 100 mm HEPES, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.0) using a Wallac Victor 1420 Multilabel counter. The 96-well plates were assayed for 10 cycles, and cleavage rates were determined by linear regression. The protease activities were expressed as either pmol/min/mg of protein or pmol/min/fraction. Lysates were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 6 columns using either an FPLC (HR 10/30 column) or SMART (PC 3.2/30 column) protein purification system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The columns were eluted at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, 5 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Column flow rates and fraction volumes are shown in the appropriate figures. The columns were calibrated with protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), including blue dextran, thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and bovine heart cytochrome c (Sigma) as indicated in the figures. The biological activity of the apoptosome complexes as assessed by their ability to process and activate effector procaspases was assayed as previously described (11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots were incubated with procaspases (25 μg of protein) for 30 min before assaying for DEVDase activity. The procaspases (“free caspases”) were obtained following fractionation of control lysates by gel filtration on a preparative (26/60) Hi-Prep S300 Sephacryl high resolution column. These fractions, which contained procaspase-3, -7, and -9, were concentrated in Vivaspin 4 (Vivascience, Lincoln, UK) concentrators (10-kDa cut-off) to a final concentration of 12.5 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C prior to use. Recombinant Apaf-1L baculovirus was kindly provided by Dr. E. Alnemri (13Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Sf21 insect cells were cultured in Grace’s medium supplemented with 10% insect-specific fetal calf serum, 1% Glutamax, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2% Pluronic F-68 (all materials were from Life Technologies). Amplified viral stock (50 ml) was used to infect 500 ml of cells at a density of 2 × 106/ml. Cells were harvested 44 h postinfection, and a S100 lysate was prepared essentially as previously described (12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 18Purring-Koch C. McLendon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11928-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 5 volumes of lysate buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 μm aprotinin, and 1 m ethanol). The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min and then lysed with a Dounce homogenizer (pestle type B). The cell lysate was clarified by a two-step centrifugation procedure at 15,000 rpm for 30 min (Beckman J2-MC) and 40,000 rpm (100,000 × g) in a Beckman L8–80M ultracentrifuge for 30 min, respectively. The resultant S100 (50 ml) was applied to a 5-ml Ni2+-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, West Sussex, UK) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using an AKTA protein purification system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted sequentially with buffer A (20 mmHEPES, 0.1 mm DTT, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0); A plus 1 m NaCl and 20 mmimidazole, followed by stepwise elution with buffer A supplemented with 40 mm, 160 mm, and 500 mmimidazole. Individual fractions were analyzed for protein and Apaf-1 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Western blotting. Apaf-1-containing fractions were also assayed for their ability to activate effector procaspases by incubating with 2 mm dATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm cytochrome c, and 25 μg of procaspases. Staining with Coomassie Blue confirmed that the Apaf-1 was pure. The recombinant protein was supplemented with 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C in 100-μl aliquots at a concentration of (80 μg/ml). Most reagents, including antibodies to caspase-3, -7, and -9, were obtained from the indicated sources (10Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Protein samples (∼20 μg) were resolved on 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and antibody binding was detected as described previously (11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition, a monoclonal antibody specific for holocytochrome c was obtained from R & D systems (Oxford, UK). This antibody is specific for amino acid sequence 60–63, which surrounds the heme group of the human, rat, and mouse native cytochrome, and it does not cross-react with apocytochrome c. Caspase activation has been modeled in vitro by incubating HeLa or THP.1 cell lysates with dATP or ATP in the presence of cytochrome c(10Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the effects of K+ and Na+ on dATP-dependent caspase activation. Control lysates were routinely activated with 2 mm dATP at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Under these conditions, the Na+ and K+ concentrations of the reaction medium were 38 and 26 mm, respectively. Supplementing the lysate with increasing [Na+] or [K+] markedly inhibited caspase activation, and final concentrations of 80–90 mm K+ or Na+ totally blocked caspase activation (Fig. 1 A), in agreement with previous studies (19Hughes F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 21Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Slater A.F.G. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This inhibition was not a direct effect on the caspases, because studies on recombinant caspase-3 and -7 have shown that their activity is not markedly affected by ionic strength (26Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Also, once activated, the DEVDase activity of dATP activated lysates was essentially unaffected by NaCl (data not shown). Thus, the inhibitory effect of K+ and Na+ on caspase activation is not on the activity of the caspases per se but rather on an upstream event, preceding caspase-3 and -7 activation. We speculated that this inhibition was due either to an inhibition of apoptosome function (i.e. the ability to recruit, cleave, and activate caspase-9 and the effector caspases) or an inhibition of apoptosome formation. As previously reported following dATP activation of THP.1 cell lysates (11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), Apaf-1 forms predominantly two large apoptosome complexes with masses of ∼1.4 MDa and ∼700 kDa. The latter complex is a functional apoptosome complex, since it is considerably more active at processing procaspase-9 and -3. We therefore prepared active ∼700-kDa apoptosome complexes from dATP activated lysates following Superose 6 chromatography and assayed their caspase activating activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 1 B). The caspase-activating activity of the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex was relatively insensitive to Na+ inhibition and even exhibited maximal activity at 90–100 mm NaCl (Fig. 1 B), a concentration that totally inhibited dATP-dependent caspase activation in lysates (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the ability of Na+/K+ to inhibit effector caspase processing is not due to the inhibition of apoptosome function. We then investigated the possibility that inhibition was due to disruption of Apaf-1 oligomerization by using Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography to detect apoptosome formation. In unactivated control lysates, Apaf-1 eluted as a monomeric protein (Fig. 1 C, fractions 18–23), whereas after dATP treatment most of the Apaf-1 was associated with the ∼1.4-MDa (Fig. 1 C, fractions 5–8) and ∼700-kDa complexes (Fig. 1 C, fractions 8–14). In the presence of K+ or Na+, the formation of the ∼700-kDa complex was completely abrogated, whereas the assembly of the ∼1.4-MDa complex was much less affected. We have also confirmed this effect in Jurkat cell lysates, demonstrating that this is not a cell type-specific phenomenon (27Thompson G.J. Langlais C. Cain K. Conley E.C. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A significant proportion of the Apaf-1 remained as the monomeric protein (Fig. 1 C, fractions 17–22) when caspase activation was inhibited by K+ or Na+. This may be explained by our earlier observations of the different kinetics of formation of the two Apaf-1 complexes (11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The ∼700-kDa complex is formed rapidly, exhibiting saturation kinetics within ∼5–10 min, while the ∼1.4-MDa complex is formed more slowly not reaching a maximum until 30 min after initiation of oligomerization. Assembly of the two apoptosome complexes appears to be mediated by two separate and independent processes, since abrogation of formation of the ∼700-kDa complex did not markedly affect formation of the ∼1.4-MDa complex. The slower rate of formation of the larger complex means that in the time frame used not all of the Apaf-1 was oligomerized, thereby resulting in some Apaf-1 remaining as free monomeric Apaf-1 (Fig. 1 C, fractions 17–22). Previously, we had demonstrated the formation of caspase-activating apoptosome complexes in apoptotic cells (11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22Almond J.B. Snowden R.T. Hunter A. Dinsdale D. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order for active apoptosome complexes to form intracellularly, it was apparent that some cellular factors must overcome the inhibitory effects of the [K+]i. As activation of caspases requires dATP/ATP and cytochrome c, we varied these parameters to try and overcome the inhibitory effects of K+. Varying the dATP/ATP (0.1–8 mm) concentration did not abrogate the inhibitory effects of KCl (data not shown). THP.1 lysates usually do not need exogenous cytochrome c to undergo dATP-dependent caspase activation, presumably because the cell lysis technique releases sufficient mitochondrial cytochrome c to support Apaf-1 oligomerization (10Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This conclusion was supported by the observations that the addition of exogenous cytochrome c produced only a very small increase in caspase activation (Fig. 2 A) and also because significant amounts of cytochrome c were detected in control and apoptotic lysates using antibodies, which recognize either apo and holo forms of the protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Cytochrome c is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as the apo (non-heme-containing) form and transported into mitochondria, where heme is inserted to form holocytochrome c, which is retained in the intermembrane space (28Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since only holocytochrome c and not the apo form supports dATP-dependent activation of caspases in cell lysates (21Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Slater A.F.G. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar), we analyzed control lysates with a holocytochrome c-specific antibody. Little or no holocytochrome c was detected in control cell lysates (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) either because the concentration of the protein was below the detection limits of the antibody or the antibody failed to recognize the holocytochrome c. To resolve this, we analyzed lysates from cells undergoing chemically induced apoptosis where cytochrome crelease is an integral feature of cell death (8Von Ahsen O. Waterhouse N.J. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All of these apoptotic stimuli induced apoptosis in THP.1 cells as previously described (24Zhu H.J. Fearnhead H.O. Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and this was accompanied by the release of significant quantities of holocytochrome c from the mitochondria (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 3–5). These results showed that the antibody was detecting the release of holocytochrome c in apoptotic cells and suggested that the concentration of holo form in the control lysates was very low. These low levels of holocytochrome c may only support caspase activation if the [K+] is also low. Higher concentrations of K+ would be predicted to antagonize cytochrome c binding to Apaf-1, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for formation of the apoptosome. Conversely, by increasing the concentration of cytochrome c, it should be possible to reverse the inhibitory effects of K+. Consequently, we found that varying the concentration of added cytochrome c from 0 to 32 μm significantly but not completely reversed the inhibition of caspase activation by 100 mm KCl (Fig. 3 A). Cytochrome c (≥8 μm) caused a maximum reversal of inhibition, restoring caspase activation to ∼70–80% of the uninhibited control reaction. Suppression of caspase activation with higher concentrations of K+ (150 mm) required even higher concentrations of cytochrome c, which partially (∼50%) overcame the inhibition. To determine whether these higher concentrations of cytochrome c also restored formation of the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex, lysates were again fractionated before and after dATP activation. In control unactivated lysate, almost all of the Apaf-1 eluted as a monomer (Fig. 3 B, fractions 18–22), whereas, after dATP activation, Apaf-1 oligomerized to produce the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex (Fig. 3 B, fractions 8–14), which was markedly inhibited in the presence of K+. However, in the presence of cytochrome c, Apaf-1 oligomerization to form the ∼700-kDa complex was largely restored (Fig. 3 B, fractions 8–14,bottom panel). To confirm that the restored ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex was functionally active, we analyzed the column fractions for caspase-activating activity (Fig. 3 C). Column fractions from control lysates had negligible caspase-activating activity, whereas those from the dATP-activated lysate exhibited significant caspase-activating activity, which predominantly eluted with the ∼700-kDa complex (Fig. 3 C, fractions 5–7) in agreement with our previous studies (13Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In KCl-treated lysates, none of the column fractions contained caspase-processing activity (Fig. 3 C). However, the addition of cytochrome c to KCl-inhibited lysate restored caspase-activating activity, which again eluted exclusively with the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex (Fig. 3 C, fractions 8–14). These results demonstrated that normal [K+]i inhibited the formation of the functional ∼700-kDa apoptosome and that this inhibition could be reversed with increasing concentrations of cytochrome c. To determine whether KCl directly inhibited the interactions of cytochrome c and Apaf-1, we utilized a more defined system, namely recombinant Apaf-1 and cytochrome c. Recombinant Apaf-1 in the absence of dATP and cytochrome celuted predominantly as a monomer (Fig. 4 A, fractions 18–23). However, after Apaf-1 was incubated with dATP and cytochrome c, it eluted predominantly as an ∼600–700-kDa complex (Fig. 4 A, fractions 10–14) together with much smaller amounts of a larger sized complex (∼1.4–2 MDa). The size of the recombinant apoptosome complex was smaller than the ∼700-kDa complex isolated from dATP-activated lysates by Superose-6 gel filtration (see “Discussion”). Nevertheless, the recombinant apoptosome was functional, as judged by its ability to process caspase-9 to its p35 active form and to activate the DEVDase activity of effector caspases (Fig. 4, A and B). These results showed that it was possible to form an active apoptosome complex using only Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and dATP in agreement with previous studies (12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 13Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Formation of the recombinant active apoptosome complex was almost totally inhibited by 150 mm KCl (Fig. 4, A and C), and the recombinant Apaf-1 inhibited by KCl eluted as a complex of about 300–500 kDa (Fig. 4 A, fractions 14–19) and also as the monomeric protein (Fig. 4 A, fractions 20–25). This concentration of KCl completely inhibited caspase activation, which could not be reversed even with high concentrations of cytochrome c (40 μm). Lower KCl concentrations (50 mm) also inhibited caspase-activating activity, but this was partially reversed by increased concentrations of cytochrome c (Fig. 4 C). Previous studies have established that the normal [K+]i, inhibits apoptosis and cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation (19Hughes F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 21Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Slater A.F.G. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We now provide an insight into the mechanism of this inhibition. First, in cell lysates, where the concentration of holocytochrome c is low, normal [K+]i completely blocks formation of the ∼700-kDa apoptosome (Fig. 1 C). In cell lysates, this inhibition is abrogated by increasing concentrations of cytochrome c (Fig. 2). In this respect, recent studies have shown that the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c from apoptotic cells is both rapid and complete, resulting in cytosolic concentrations of ∼10 μm (30Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 31Waterhouse N.J. Goldstein J.C. Von Ahsen O. Schuler M. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Since the intermembrane space occupies between 1 and 3% of the total cell volume and contains 0.5–5 mm cytochrome c (32Forman H.J. Azzi A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 374-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the cytochrome c concentration of an apoptotic cell could range from 5 to 150 μm (31Waterhouse N.J. Goldstein J.C. Von Ahsen O. Schuler M. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the potential cytosolic concentrations of cytochrome c, which are achievable in an apoptotic cell, are capable of overcoming the inhibitory effects of [K+]i, thus allowing formation of the active apoptosome complex. Our data are compatible with K+ competing for the same binding sites on Apaf-1 as cytochrome c, although the kinetics of inhibition are not truly competitive, since both the Vmax and Km appear to be altered (Fig. 3 A). This may in part be due to the formation of a larger complex, which comprises inappropriately oligomerized Apaf-1 (33Bratton S.B. Walker G. Roberts D. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When measured at physiological [K+]i, the binding affinity of cytochrome c to Apaf-1 is only 4 × 107m−1 (18Purring-Koch C. McLendon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11928-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, in the normal intracellular milieu, high concentrations of cytochrome c are required to bind to Apaf-1 and form the active apoptosome complex. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that during apoptosis significant amounts of cytochrome c have to be released from the intermitochondrial membrane space in order to overcome [K+]i inhibition of apoptosome formation. These data suggest that there must be a threshold level for cytochrome c that has to be exceeded before the apoptosome is formed. This would provide a mechanism to safeguard against inappropriate activation of the caspases caused by the inadvertent release of small amounts of cytochrome c. Alternatively, dATP activation of cell lysates may not fully reflect the mechanism of caspase-9 activation in cells undergoing apoptosis. Thus, Apaf-1 might oligomerize in apoptotic cells at concentrations of potassium that prevent apoptosome formation in vitro, and this may be facilitated by molecules derived from other cellular organelles, such as mitochondria, which are perturbed during the initiation of apoptosis. Using recombinant Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and dATP, we have shown formation of a large (∼600–700-kDa) caspase-activating apoptosome complex in agreement with earlier studies (12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 13Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This complex is smaller than the ∼700-kDa complex isolated from dATP-activated lysates (Fig. 1 C; Ref. 11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), which is to be expected given that it has been assembled in the absence of caspase-9 and other potential apoptosome-binding proteins, which may be present in the normal lysate. The apoptosome complex has been estimated to be between ∼700 and 1400 kDa (11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and while gel filtration chromatography is capable of separating two large complexes from monomeric Apaf-1 (see Fig. 3; Ref. 11Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), it does not give totally precise values for the Mr of the complex. Invariably, calibration is carried out with large globular standard proteins, and exact sizing depends on the assumption that the apoptosome is also a globular protein. Gel filtration chromatography gives fairly broad peaks, and the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex we have observed in cell lysates essentially spans a molecular mass range from around 600 to 900 kDa, with the apex of the peak eluting slightly earlier than the thyroglobulin (669 kDa) protein marker. This is ∼700 kDa, and interestingly we have found that the 20 S (∼700-kDa) proteasome, which is not globular, co-migrates with the most active apoptosome complex (data not shown). Thus, the exact size and stoichiometry of the apoptosome complex(es) remain to be determined. The binding site for cytochrome c on Apaf-1 has not been determined. Expression and functional analysis of Apaf-1 isoforms show that only those with an extra WD-40 repeat can bind cytochrome c, self-associate, and activate caspase-9 (34Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the binding site on Apaf-1 for cytochrome c may be in the WD-40 repeat region or at the very least is conformationally regulated by these domains. Mutational epitope studies show that the cytochrome c binding site on Apaf-1 is different from that observed with various electron transfer proteins (35Yu T. Wang X. Purring-Koch C. Wei Y. McLendon G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13034-13038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In these proteins, the lysine-rich interface close to the heme pocket is the main determinant for binding, whereas cytochrome c binding to Apaf-1 not only involves this interface but also requires an opposite surface of the molecule. This suggests that Apaf-1 essentially wraps around cytochrome c, and presumably this causes major conformational changes in Apaf-1, allowing it to oligomerize in the correct manner. However, it is clear from our data that cytochrome c-dependent oligomerization of Apaf-1 is inhibited markedly by KCl and only partially reversible with excess cytochrome c. In addition, the recombinant apoptosome complex does not appear as active as a caspase-processing complex as that formed in lysates, although the Apaf-1 concentrations were approximately equivalent. This suggests that the reconstituted apoptosome system does not fully mimic apoptosome formation, which is observed in cell lysates. Taken together, this suggests that other as yet unidentified proteins, such as chaperones or heat shock proteins (36Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), may be required for folding/oligomerization of the complex for optimal activity. In conclusion, our data suggest that the [K+]iacts to safeguard the cell against inappropriate caspase activation by the accidental release of small quantities of cytochrome c. The [K+]i antagonizes cytochrome cbinding to Apaf-1, and it is only when cytochrome c reaches a critical threshold level that this inhibition is overcome and Apaf-1 oligomerization initiated. During apoptotic cell death, the [K+]i decreases to around 70 mm (19Hughes F.M. Bortner C.D. Purdy G.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30567-30576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), when lower levels of cytochrome c would initiate apoptosome formation. This suggests that controlling the concentration of [K+]i is an important regulatory mechanism for ensuring the appropriate activation of the apoptosome complex. This may act in concert with additional cellular defense mechanisms such as the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (15Bratton S.B. Walker G. Srinivasula S.M. Sun X.M. Butterworth M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) or heat shock proteins, which limit the activation of caspases once the apoptosome is formed (36Saleh A.

https://openalex.org/W2079788104,"STK15 is an Aurora/Ipl-1 related serine/threonine kinase that is associated with centrosomes and induces aneuploidy when overexpressed in mammalian cells. It is well known that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of kinases are important for regulation of their activity. But mechanisms by which STK15 activity is regulated have not been elucidated. We report that STK15 contains two functional binding sites for protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1), and the binding of these proteins is cell cycle-regulated peaking at mitosis. Activated STK15 at mitosis phosphorylates PP1 and inhibits PP1 activity in vitro. In vivo, PP1 activity co-immunoprecipitated with STK15 is also reduced. These data indicate that STK15 inhibits PP1 activity during mitosis. Also, PP1 is shown to dephosphorylate active STK15 and abolish its activity in vitro. Furthermore, we show that non-binding mutants of STK15 for PP1 are superphosphorylated, but their kinase activities are markedly reduced. Cells transfected with these non-binding mutants manifest aberrant chromosome alignment during mitosis. Our results suggest that a feedback regulation through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events between STK15 kinase and PP1 phosphatase operates through the cell cycle. Deregulation of this balance may contribute to anomalous segregation of chromosomes during mitotic progression of cancer cells.

Reversible phosphorylation of proteins by protein kinases and protein phosphatases regulates these events, and alterations in the phosphorylated state of proteins have effects on mitotic progression (1Vandre D.D. Centonze V.E. Peloquin J. Tombes R.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 577-588PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nigg E.A. Blangy A. Lane H.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whereas protein kinases have been studied well, relatively less is known about protein phosphatases that act antagonistically to kinases. In many cases except for the regulation of cdk1, it remains to be shown how phosphorylation regulates target proteins including regulatory proteins themselves. STK15 (also known as BTAK, Aurora-A) is a human serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the Drosophila aurora andSaccharomyces cerevisiae Ipl1 kinase family, and both are essential for chromosome segregation and centrosome functions (3Zhou H.

Overexpression of STK15 induces increased numbers of centrosome, aneuploidy, and transformation of the cells (3Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat.

On the other hand, both loss-of-function by the addition of antibody against pEg2, the Xenopus orthologue of STK15, and overexpression of a dominant-negative kinase-inactive pEg2 cause defects on centrosome separation and mitotic spindle stabilization (7Roghi C.

Cell Res. 2000; 258: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These data suggest that STK15 plays critical roles in regulation of centrosome functions. Furthermore it has been reported that CDC20 and kinesin-related proteins associate with STK15, although their physiological functions have not yet been elucidated (9Farruggio D.C. Townsley F.M.

Recently, it has been shown that in S. cerevisiae andCaenorhabditis elegans ipl1/aurora kinase phosphorylates histone H3 and a kinetochore protein Ndc10, suggesting that these interactions regulate chromosome condensation and kinetochore-microtubule interactions, respectively, acting in opposition to type 1 protein phosphatase Glc7/PP11 (11Biggins S.

In mammals, there are four isoforms of protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1α, PP1γ1, PP1γ2, and PP1δ) (14Sasaki K. Shima H. Kitagawa Y. Irino S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The activity and subcellular compartmentalization of these PP1 isoforms are controlled by their association with a variety of regulatory subunits (15Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is known that these regulatory subunits have a common motif -(R/K)(V/I)XF- to associate with PP1, and mutation in this motif disrupts the association (17Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G.

Requirement of PP1 in mitosis has been shown from genetic studies in S. cerevisiae,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus nidulans,and Drosophila, in which mutants show defects in spindle organization, chromosome condensation, and segregation (19Black S.

Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PP1 activity by drug treatment or injection of antisense oligonucleotides indicates that PP1 plays a regulatory role in microtubule dynamics during transitions into and out of mitosis and cytokinesis (25Tournebize R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1846-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PP1 is also prerequired for nuclear lamina assembly via the protein kinase A anchoring protein AKAP149 (27Steen R.L. Martins S.B. Tasken K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PP1 activity is inactivated by Cdc2 phosphorylation in early to mid-mitosis (28Dohadwala M. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P.

The genetic and biochemical findings on PP1-interacting proteins described above can partly explain the complex mutant phenotypes but not all. In this paper we present evidence that STK15 interacts with PP1 via functional binding domains within STK15 in vivo and in vitro, and this binding is higher at mitosis compared with interphase. These data indicate that interaction between these proteins is cell cycle-regulated. In addition, mitotic active STK15 phosphorylates PP1, and this phosphorylation reduces PP1 activity. On the other hand, PP1 dephosphorylates hyperphosphorylated active STK15 that results in loss of STK15 activity. Furthermore, we indicate that this interaction is necessary for activation of STK15 and that transient transfection of PP1 non-binding mutants of STK15 induces aberrant chromosome alignments at mitotic metaphase at higher rate compared with those of wild type STK15 and kinase-inactive STK15 mutant. Our results suggest that a feedback regulation through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles exists between STK15 kinase and PP1 phosphatase and that overexpression of STK15 leads to deregulation of this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance causing aberration of this normal feedback regulation in cancer cells. The findings further suggest that aberrant STK15 expression affects an unknown STK15-PP1-mediated regulatory pathway in mitosis to induce mitotic anomalies in cancer cells. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For synchronization at the G1/S boundary, HeLa cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block and release (31Stein G.S. Borun T.W. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 292-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were blocked for 16 h with 2.5 mm thymidine, released from the block by three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with fresh medium. After 8 h, cells were re-incubated for 16 h with 2.5 mmthymidine. For synchronization at the M phase, cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h and then mitotic cells were collected by shake-off. At each time point cells were fixed with 70% ethanol at −20 °C, treated with RNase, stained with propidium iodide, and then analyzed with EPICS XL-MCL (Coulter Corp.) in the MultiCycle program (Phoenix Flow Systems). Full-length STK15 cDNA was isolated from a BT474 cDNA library (3Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis using polymerase chain reaction was performed to make a kinase-inactive (Lys → Arg) mutant and non-binding (NB) mutants, respectively. In STK15 (Lys → Arg) the codon for lysine 162 (AAA) was mutated to arginine (AGA). In STK15 (NB) the codon for phenylalanine 165 (TTT) or phenylalanine 346 (TTC) was mutated to alanine (GCC), respectively. To produce GST and GFP fusion protein, full-length STK15 cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). An N-terminal FLAG tag was added by polymerase chain reaction to full-length STK15 cDNAs, and then FLAG-tagged cDNA fragments were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). To produce GST and Myc fusion PP1 α, γ1, and δ protein, each cDNA of PP1 isoforms kindly provided by Dr. H. Nakagama was subcloned into pGEX4T-1 vector and pcDNA3.1 Myc/His vector (Invitrogen). GST-PP1 isoforms and GST-STK15 proteins were produced in BL21 pLys bacteria according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads was used for pull-down assay and activity assay. For in vitro kinase assay, the proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione solution in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-STK15 constructs and Myc-PP1 constructs using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h of incubation, cells were extracted with lysis buffer (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm okadaic acid, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin). After gentle sonication, lysate was incubated for 30 min on ice and followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. 250–500 μg of cell lysate was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 6 μl of anti-STK15 antibody-protein G-agarose or 10 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-protein G-agarose (Sigma), and the immunocomplex was washed 4 times with lysis buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, endogenous PP1 and exogenously expressed Myc-PP1 constructs were probed with anti-PP1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and c-Myc monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH), respectively. For in vitro kinase assay, immunocomplex was washed 4 times with IP washing buffer (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EGTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then washed 3 times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol).In vitro kinase assays to dephosphorylated β-casein, GST-PP1α, -γ1, and -δ were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer containing 5 mm cold ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by addition of sample buffer, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by drying of the gel and autoradiography. For detecting the binding of STK15 to PP1, 5 μg each of GST-PP1α, GST-PP1γ1, and GST-PP1δ bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was mixed with 1 mg of cell lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times with lysis buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-STK15 antibody. For detecting the binding of PP1 to GST-STK15 WT, GST-STK15 Lys → Arg, and NB, the same condition was used except that 2 mg of cell lysate was used and probed with anti-PP1 antibody. Immunoprecipitated SKT15 from mitotic cell lysate was washed with IP washing buffer and then washed 4 times with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35 for PP1, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol for PP2A). The immunocomplex was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 0.5 units of PP1 (New England Biolabs) or 0.5 units of PP2A (Promega) and then washed 5 times with kinase buffer, and subsequently an in vitro kinase assay to dephosphorylated β-casein was performed as described above. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-STK15 antibody, followed by autoradiography. Phosphatase activity of PP1 associated with anti-STK15 immunocomplex and in vitrophosphorylated GST-PP1α, -γ1, and -δ by STK15 was measured by using 32P-labeled myelin basic protein (32P-MBP) as the substrate according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). After beads were washed 5 times with phosphatase buffer, beads were incubated for 10–30 min at 30 °C in phosphatase buffer containing 50 mm32P-MBP. The reactions were stopped by 20% trichloroacetic acid precipitation. After removing the precipitated protein and beads by centrifugation, the relative phosphatase activity was determined by the amount of soluble 32P release. HeLa cells growing on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips were transiently transfected with pEGFP empty vector and pEGFP-STK15 constructs for 16 h. Immunostaining was performed as described (3Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were used for staining phosphorylated histone H3 and DNA, respectively. Anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. C. David Allis. To study the regulation of phosphorylation of STK15, we searched STK15 amino acid sequence and found two similar motifs to consensus motif for binding to PP1 (Fig. 1 A). To investigate whether STK15 interacts with PP1 and if the two motifs identified are responsible for interaction with PP1, we constructed FLAG-tagged mutants in which phenylalanine 165 and phenylalanine 346 in the putative consensus motifs were substituted to alanine, respectively. After transient transfection into HeLa cells, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of nocodazole. The expressed tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-STK15 antibody and anti-PP1 antibody that recognizes all the PP1 isoforms. In nocodazole-treated cells arrested at mitosis, the interaction to PP1 of both F165A (NB1) and F346A (NB2) mutants was significantly decreased compared with wild type (WT) and kinase-inactive mutant (Lys → Arg) (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the differences in the degree of interactions between WT, Lys → Arg, and the non-binding mutants with PP1 were minimal in the exponentially growing cells, although WT indicated higher interaction to PP1 than mutants (Fig. 1 B). To confirm further the role of the consensus binding motifs in the interaction, pull-down assays were performed using bacterially expressed GST fusion STK15 proteins. GST and the GST fusion proteins were incubated with mitotic extracts, and the PP1 bound to fusion proteins was immunoblotted with anti-PP1 antibody. Fig. 1 C clearly shows that GST-NB1 and GST-NB2 failed to interact with PP1. These results show that STK15 interacts with PP1 through the functional binding domains, and STK15 kinase activity is not necessary for this interaction. To assess precisely if this interaction is cell cycle-dependent, HeLa cells synchronized by a double thymidine block and release protocol were analyzed. Whereas protein expression, phosphorylation, and activity of STK15 peak at mitosis and decline during exit from mitosis through G1 (Fig.2 A), protein expression of PP1 in the cell cycle progression of HeLa cells was constant (Fig.2 B). Similar expression pattern of PP1 protein has been earlier reported in other cell types (32Liu C.W. Wang R.H. Dohadwala M. Schonthal A.H. Villa-Moruzzi E. Berndt N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29470-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Endogenous STK15 was immunoprecipitated with anti-STK15 antibody, and the immunocomplex was immunoblotted with anti-PP1 and anti-STK15 antibodies. Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1 B, PP1 binding to STK15 increased with cell cycle progression to mitosis (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, this interaction seems to be correlated with the appearance of hyperphosphorylated STK15 that has kinase activity (Fig.2 A). To investigate the role of STK15 phosphorylation in PP1 interaction, mitotic extracts were prepared in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid, NaF, and EDTA), and the amount of immunoprecipitated PP1 was compared. As shown in Fig. 2 C, when STK15 was dephosphorylated in the absence of phosphatase inhibitor (indicated by arrow), the interaction was decreased compared with the phosphorylated form of STK15 detected in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor (indicated by arrowhead). This indicates that phosphorylated active STK15 interacts with PP1 more effectively than inactive STK15. Paradoxically, however, we detected similar quantitative binding between STK15 and PP1 at 8, 9, and 12 h post-thymidine release, despite the fact that STK15 was predominantly seen in active hyperphosphorylated form at 8 and 9 h post-release unlike the hypophosphorylated form detected at 12 h post-release (Fig. 2 A). At 12 h post-release only 4% of cells are in G2/M phase of mitosis compared with 74 and 37% of cells in G2/M phase at 8 and 9 h post-release. The reason why this interaction is still high in vivo at 12 h post-thymidine release when almost 88% of the cells have progressed to G1 phase after mitosis remains to be elucidated. There are four isoforms of PP1 (PP1α, PP1γ1, PP1γ2, and PP1δ) in mammals. To examine which isoform interacts to STK15, pull-down assay was performed using bacterially expressed GST fusion PP1α, PP1γ1, and PP1δ. GST and each GST fusion protein were incubated with mitotic extracts and then STK15 bound to fusion proteins was immunoblotted with anti-STK15 antibody. Fig.3 shows STK15 is able to interact to all PP1 isoforms. Similar result was also obtained using Myc-tagged constructs of all the PP1 isoform-transfected cells (data not shown). These results taken together indicate that STK15 interacts with PP1 both in vivo and in vitro, and this interaction is regulated in cell cycle-dependent manner. To investigate the biochemical significance of interaction between STK15 and PP1, we first examined whether PP1 dephosphorylates STK15 and, if so, the effect on kinase activity. Immunoprecipitated STK15 from mitotic extracts was incubated with purified PP1 and PP2A, respectively, and in vitro kinase assay was subsequently performed. Interphase extract and mitotic extract were used as positive control to confirm phosphorylation status of STK15. Whereas incubation with PP2A did not affect phosphorylation status and kinase activity of STK15 similar to control reaction, PP1 caused significant dephosphorylation and inactivation of STK15 (Fig.4). We didin vitro kinase assay to test if active hyperphosphorylated STK15 from mitotic cells can phosphorylate PP1 using GST-PP1 proteins as substrates. To detect phosphorylation, assay was performed in the presence of sodium vanadate or okadaic acid to prevent GST-PP1 from dephosphorylating hyperphosphorylated STK15. Active STK15 from mitotic cells phosphorylates all the isoforms of GST-PP1 in vitro in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, but we could never detect phosphorylation of PP1 in the absence of these inhibitors (Fig. 5 A). These data indicate that STK15 may phosphorylate common serine and/or threonine residues in all the isoforms. Next, to examine the effect of STK15-mediated phosphorylation on PP1 activity, PP1 assay was performed using32P-labeled MBP as substrate. For this objective, we used interphase extract as negative control because interphase extracts have less STK15 kinase activity than mitotic extracts. STK15 immunoprecipitated from both extracts were reacted with GST-PP1α in the presence of okadaic acid, immediately followed by extensive washing to remove okadaic acid, and then GST-PP1α activity was assayed. As shown in Fig. 5 B, activity of GST-PP1α reacted with mitotic STK15 was decreased about 25% in comparison with interphase STK15. Furthermore, to examine if this decrement was directly because of phosphorylation by STK15, we transfected WT and Lys → Arg constructs to HeLa cells, respectively. PP1 activity present in immunocomplex that was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody was measured in the presence of 2 nm okadaic acid to inhibit PP2A activity. PP1 activity bound to WT was decreased about 25% compared with that of Lys → Arg mutant (Fig. 5 C). We next measured PP1 activity bound to endogenous STK15 derived from interphase and mitotic extracts. PP1 activity bound to mitotic STK15 was decreased compared with that of interphase STK15 (Fig. 5 D). Because it is known that Cdk1-phosphorylated PP1 at threonine 320 results in inhibition of PP1 activity, we examined whether STK15 phosphorylates the same site using mutant GST-PP1α substituted at position 320 from threonine to alanine. We detected similar phosphorylation signals from both normal and mutant fusion proteins in the presence of active mitotic STK15 (data not shown). These results suggest that STK15 phosphorylates PP1 at different site(s) from Cdk1, and its phosphorylation leads to inhibition of PP1 activity at mitosis. Based on the results from Fig. 4, we speculated that both NB mutants might be more phosphorylated compared with WT at mitosis and display higher kinase activity. To address the effect of reduced interaction for PP1 on the kinase activity and phosphorylation status of STK15, we performed immunoblotting and in vitrokinase assay of immunoprecipitated NB mutants from mitotic extract. As expected, both NB mutants were more phosphorylated compared with WT and Lys → Arg (Fig. 6, lanes 2and 3). Surprisingly, both hyperphosphorylated (indicated byarrow) and super-phosphorylated (the slowest migrating top band indicated by arrowhead) NB mutants together had much less kinase activity than that detected for the WT form, which displayed strong kinase activity, as expected (Fig. 6). This result provides evidence that inhibitory phosphorylation sites exist in STK15 and that dephosphorylation of these sites by PP1 is required for activation of STK15. Next, to study whether overexpression of NB mutants affects mitotic progression, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells transiently transfected with pEGFP-NB mutants was performed. Interestingly, NB mutant-transfected cells frequently demonstrated misalignment of chromosomes at metaphase plate compared with control empty vector and WT-transfected cells (Fig.7 A, panels B, F, J, andN). GFP-NB mutants showed similar centrosome localization as in WT-transfected cells (Fig. 7 A, panels E, I, andM) with no apparent influence on phosphorylation of histone H3 (Fig. 7 A, panel C, G, K, and O). The proportions of cells showing aberrantly aligned chromosomes in the NB mutant-transfected cells were, however, significantly increased compared with those of WT and Lys → Arg-transfected cells (Fig.7 B). These results indicate that interaction between STK15 and PP1 is involved in regulation of chromosome alignment/segregation at metaphase. STK15 and its related kinases have been implicated in regulating equal segregation of chromosomes during mitotic cell division cycle. The mechanisms underlying activation of STK15 through phosphorylation and regulation of centrosome as well as mitotic microtubule functions by activated STK15, however, remain to be elucidated. In this paper, we present the first evidence in human cells that (i) STK15 interacts with PP1 via consensus binding domains, and this interaction is necessary for STK15 activation; (ii) activated STK15 at mitosis phosphorylates PP1 which leads to reduction in PP1 phosphatase activity; (iii) dephosphorylation of STK15 by PP1 causes inhibition of its kinase activity; and (iv) interaction between STK15 and PP1 is involved in regulating chromosome alignment/segregation at metaphase. We demonstrated that non-binding mutant STK15 is highly phosphorylated at mitosis, resulting in significant inhibition of its kinase activity. This result implies two points. First, single or multiple inhibitory phosphorylation sites as well as activation site(s) exist on STK15. Second, these sites phosphorylated by unknown inhibitory kinase(s) are dephosphorylated by PP1 at mitosis, leading to STK15 activation. This idea is supported by a report by Walter et al. (33Walter A.O. Seghezzi W. Korver W. Sheung J. Lees E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4906-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) which shows that threonine 288 residue on STK15, only phosphorylated in interphase but not in mitosis, can be dephosphorylated by PP1 in vitro (33Walter A.O. Seghezzi W. Korver W. Sheung J. Lees E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4906-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although Thr-288 appears to be at least one candidate responsible for preventing STK15 activation in interphase, we cannot exclude the possibility of the existence of other inhibitory phosphorylation sites as well. Further studies are needed to identify both activation and inhibitory phosphorylation sites and to elucidate their functional significance during cell cycle progression. It is known that PP1 is phosphorylated at threonine 320 by Cdk1 and is inactivated through G2/M transition during mitosis (28Dohadwala M. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,30Kwon Y.G. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2168-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that this inactivation is necessary for maintaining the microtubule dynamics through inactivation of unidentified proteins. In this study we showed that phosphorylation of PP1 by STK15 at still unidentified site(s) can inhibit PP1 activity. This implies that STK15 kinase is involved in negative regulation of PP1 in addition to Cdk1 kinase. Taken together, our observations suggest that a feedback regulation through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles exists between STK15 kinase and PP1 phosphatase. Genetic studies in yeast have shown that Ipl1 kinase acts in opposition to Glc-7/type 1 phosphatase. Recently, Ndc10 and histone H3 have been identified as the common target proteins for Ipl1 kinase and Glc-7 phosphatase (11Biggins S. Severin F.F. Bhalla N. Sassoon I. Hyman A.A. Murray A.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 12Sassoon I. Severin F.F. Andrews P.D. Taba M.R. Kaplan K.B. Ashford A.J. Stark M.J. Sorger P.K. Hyman A.A.

Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Ndc10 is a component of CBF3 kinetochore protein complex, and reversible phosphorylation of Ndc10 by Ipl1 and Glc-7 plays an important role in the attachment of kinetochores to mitotic spindles (11Biggins S. Severin F.F. Bhalla N. Sassoon I. Hyman A.A. Murray A.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 12Sassoon I. Severin F.F. Andrews P.D. Taba M.R. Kaplan K.B. Ashford A.J. Stark M.J. Sorger P.K. Hyman A.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We observed abnormal chromosome alignment at metaphase in non-binding mutant-transfected cells. This indicates the possibility that STK15 and PP1 regulatory feedback mechanism is involved in regulating kinetochore/microtubule attachment in human cells. Because we did not investigate the phosphorylation status of kinetochore proteins in this study, further studies are required to elucidate this possibility. On the other hand, reversible phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 by Ipl1 and Glc-7 is considered to be crucial for chromosome condensation/decondensation (13Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In C. elegans it was reported that AIR-2, an orthologue of human AIM-1/Aurora-B kinase that regulates cytokinesis (34Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), but not AIR-1, an orthologue of human STK15/Auorora-A kinase, is involved in the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (13). Recently, it has shown (35Murnion M.E. Adams R.R. Callister D.M. Allis C.D. Earnshaw W.C. Swedlow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26656-26665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) that Xenopus Aurora-B kinase regulates phosphorylation of histone H3 in concert with chromatin-associated PP1. These findings indicate that chromosome condensation through phosphorylation of histone H3 by Aurora-B kinase but not Aurora-A kinase is evolutionarily conserved. Immunofluorescence detection of histone H3 phosphorylation on misaligned chromosomes of NB mutant-transfected cells, as reported in this study, reinforces the idea that STK15/Aurora A is not the primary kinase involved in phosphorylating histone H3 during G2/M phase. There are four PP1 isoforms in mammalian cells, and their subcellular localizations are different at mitosis. PP1α is localized to centrosome; PP1γ is associated with mitotic spindles, and PP1δ associates with chromosomes (16Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Such different subcellular localization of various isoforms of PP1 might explain why mutants in PP1 and inhibition of PP1 by chemical drugs show complex phenotypes with condensed chromosomes, formation of abnormal spindles, chromosome separation malfunction, and defect of cytokinesis (19Black S. Andrews P.D. Sneddon A.A. Stark M.J. Yeast. 1995; 11: 747-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Ohkura H. Kinoshita N. Miyatani S. Toda T. Yanagida M.

Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). STK15 binds with all the isoforms examined in vitro. Our previous study has shown that STK15 is localized to the centrosome (3Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). This suggests that STK15 could indeed associate with PP1α in vivo. In addition, it is possible that STK15 may also interact with PP1δ as STK15 might be involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment mentioned above. Our results have revealed that STK15 shows strong binding to PP1 at metaphase and also during early stages of interphase, although its kinase activity peaks only during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This apparent paradox can be explained by the fact that PP1 bound to activated STK15 at G2/M phase has reduced phosphatase activity that helps remove the inhibitory phosphates on STK15 to keep it activated, whereas stoichiometric over-representation of activated bound PP1 helps keep STK15 inactive during early interphase. It is also likely that still unidentified additional proteins play a key role in the feedback regulation of STK15 kinase and PP1 phosphatase activities. In this paper we present evidence that the interaction between STK15 and PP1 is necessary for STK15 kinase activation, and the two enzymes inhibit each other both in vivo and in vitro. STK15 is overexpressed in various cancers, and such overexpression induces oncogenic transformation in mammalian cells. On the other hand, PP1 isoforms are also found to be overexpressed in various cancers, which is taken as evidence for a positive role of PP1 in tumorigenesis (14Sasaki K. Shima H. Kitagawa Y.

The findings reported in this paper offer an interesting lead toward elucidating the pathway responsible for causing mitotic anomalies in STK15 overexpressing cancer cells. We thank Dr. H.

It has been proposed that shortly after initiation, negative transcription elongation factors act upon RNA polymerase II to cause production of short transcripts (2Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).

Another factor required for DRB sensitivity, DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), was purified based on its ability to reconstitute DRB sensitivity in a partially purified transcription system (16Wada T.

DSIF is composed of the 14-kDa Spt4 subunit (p14) and the 120-kDa Spt5 subunit (p160) (17Yamaguchi Y. Narita T. Inukai N. Wada T. Handa H. J. Biochem.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2970-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). KOW repeats are also found in the Escherichia coli elongation control protein NusG (20Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Ouzounis C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 425-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NusG binds the prokaryotic RNA polymerase and is required for certain specific termination and anti-termination activities (21Li J. Horwitz R. McCracken S. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6012-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Sullivan S.L. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 989-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Saturating amounts of NusG also enhance the elongation rate of the E. coli RNA polymerase by ∼20% (23Burova E. Hung S.C. Sagitov V. Stitt B.L. Gottesman M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1388-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies of the yeast, fruit fly, and zebrafish homologs of Spt5 have also linked these proteins to the regulation of transcription elongation (24Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 25Guo S. Yamaguchi Y. Schilbach S. Wada T. Lee J. Goddard A. French D. Handa H. Rosenthal A.

Depletion of DSIF from HNE greatly reduces the DRB sensitivity of that extract without significantly affecting the ability of RNA polymerase II to generate long transcripts (16Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Depletion of P-TEFb from a HNE eliminates DRB sensitivity and greatly reduces the ability of RNA polymerase II to generate long transcripts (8Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of both DSIF and P-TEFb from an extract restores the ability of RNA polymerase II to make long transcripts while eliminating the DRB sensitivity of that extract (15Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A dose-dependent add-back of purified DSIF and P-TEFb reconstitutes DRB-dependent elongation control (15Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that P-TEFb functions to reverse the negative activity associated with DRB sensitivity and that this negative activity is dependent on the presence of DSIF. The expression of a dominant negative form of DSIF in HeLa cells increased the expression level of each of four reporter genes severalfold (18Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Watanabe D. Takagi T. Hasegawa J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8085-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that DSIF is involved in general repression of transcription. The search for factors required for the reconstitution of DRB sensitivity in a partially purified transcription assay led to the discovery of a third factor, negative elongation factor (NELF) (27Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). NELF consists of four subunits. The smallest of these, NELF-E, was cloned and found to contain repeats of the dipeptide Arg-Asp (RD repeats), an RNA recognition motif, and a leucine zipper at the C-terminal end (27Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of NELF-E from an HNE significantly reduced the DRB sensitivity of that extract, while an add-back of purified NELF restored the DRB sensitivity to original levels. Using a deoxycytosine-tailed template assay, the effect of combining DSIF and NELF together with purified RNA polymerase II was tested (27Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, transcription was nearly completely inhibited. When DSIF and NELF were added to polymerases that had been paused on a tailed template, further elongation was also significantly reduced (27Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To further study the role of DSIF, NELF, and P-TEFb in elongation control, an assay using isolated RNA polymerase II elongation complexes was utilized. With this system, elongation control mediated by P-TEFb was reproduced in both a crude system, incorporating a HeLa nuclear extract and in a highly purified system, using only purified factors. We found that DSIF and NELF work cooperatively to decrease the elongation rate of the polymerase by increasing the time it spends at pause sites. The original elongation rate of the polymerase was restored by the addition of P-TEFb to the assay. We also show that NELF functionally competes with TFIIF in the presence of DSIF. Generation of pET constructs for the expression of both human Spt4 and Spt5 with an N-terminal His tag is described elsewhere (16Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Baculovirus expression and purification of P-TEFb (Cdk9 and cyclin T2a) are described by Peng et al. (8Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (A-1205) and FLAG peptide (F-3290) were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant human TFIIF was purified as described in Peng et al. (28Peng J. Liu M. Marion J. Zhu Y. Price D.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). E. coli DE3 cells transformed with plasmids expressing Spt4 and Spt5 were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Because the expression of Spt5 had a negative effect on the growth of the cells, ampicillin selection was maintained by washing the cells in fresh medium several times during growth. When a liter of culture reached an absorbance of 0.5 absorbance units, it was induced with 400 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After a 3-h induction, cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% of a saturated solution of PMSF in isopropyl alcohol), and sonicated. The lysate was spun at 50,000 × g for 40 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in urea buffer (25 mm HEPES, 100 μm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 6 murea). The urea-extracted pellet was spun at 15,000 ×g for 30 min. 3.2 mm CaCl2 was added to complex the EDTA immediately before loading onto a 4-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 6m urea, 5 mm imidazole) and eluted with wash buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Purified Spt5 was combined with an approximately 10-fold excess of purified Spt4 and dialyzed into renaturation buffer (25 mm HEPES, 15% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 100 μm EDTA, 0.1% PMSF saturated in isopropyl alcohol, and 1 mm DTT). Renatured Spt4 and Spt5 (DSIF) was loaded onto a Mono Q column equilibrated with 150 mm HGKEDP (HEPES (pH 7.6), 15% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% of a saturated solution of PMSF in isopropyl alcohol). DSIF eluted at 400 mm KCl during a gradient from 150 to 800 mm HGKEDP. We found that the activity of purified DSIF decreased each time a sample was frozen and thawed due to precipitation. Because of this, all samples were frozen and thawed only once. To assist in the purification of the complete NELF protein, NELF-E was FLAG-tagged at the N terminus and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS to generate pCMV-FLAG-NELF-E. Stably transfected HeLa S3 cells were selected and maintained in the presence of 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Large, mycoplasma-free cultures were grown in Joklik’s medium containing 5% calf serum by the National Cell Culture Center. 50 liters of cells were spun down, washed with PBS, and snap frozen for transportation. Cells were resuspended into isotonic lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% PMSF-saturated isopropyl alcohol, and 1 mm DTT) and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was spun at 4000 × g for 10 min, and the cytoplasmic fraction was removed. The nuclear fraction was used to prepare a HeLa nuclear extract using the same protocol used earlier for the generation of Drosophila Kc cell nuclear extract (29Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3244-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NELF was purified from both the cytoplasmic fraction and from 10% of the HNE as described below. The rest of the HNE was used for in vitrotranscriptions. The cytoplasmic fraction from 12 liters of the cells was brought to a NaCl concentration of 500 mm and loaded onto a 3-ml column of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel. The column was washed with 15 volumes of high salt buffer (25 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% PMSF-saturated isopropyl alcohol, and 1 mm DTT) and again with 5 volumes of low salt buffer (25 mm HEPES, 15% glycerol, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm EDTA). NELF was eluted with 5 ml of low salt buffer containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Further purification of NELF was obtained by chromatography on a 1-ml Mono Q column. The column was equilibrated with 150 mmHGKEDP with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and eluted with a 20-ml gradient to 1m HGKEDP with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The NELF complex eluted at 360 mm. A DNA template containing the full cytomegalovirus promoter was generated by polymerase chain reaction of the pGL2CMV plasmid with a 5′-biotinylated primer to produce a 1387-base pair product. The DNA was incubated with streptavidin-labeled superparamagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280) according to the manufacturer’s protocol to generate an immobilized template with a 548-nt runoff. For each experiment early elongation complexes were generated in one large reaction, isolated, and aliquoted into individual elongation reactions. For each final elongation reaction needed, 8 μl of preincubation mixture containing 200 ng of template and 1.6 μl of HNE was incubated with 20 mmHEPES, 60 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm DRB for 10 min at room temperature (28Peng J. Liu M. Marion J. Zhu Y. Price D.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transcription was initiated during a 30-s pulse with the addition of ATP, GTP, and UTP to 500 μm and 5 μCi of [α-32P]CTP for each final elongation reaction. Elongation was halted by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm. Complexes associated with the immobilized template were stringently washed three times with HKS (20 mm HEPES, 1 mKCl, and 1% Sarkosyl), two times with HKB (20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), and resuspended in HKB. Extension of transcripts in early elongation complexes was carried out in 19-μl reactions by first mixing the isolated complexes with HNE or purified factors in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.1 units/μl RNasin (Promega). After 3–5 min, elongation was resumed by the simultaneous addition of NTPs to 500 μm and MgCl2 to 7 mm. Reactions were allowed to elongate for the indicated amounts of time at room temperature and were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of Sarkosyl Stop Solution (100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Sarkosyl, 200 μg/ml tRNA). RNA preparation and analysis on 6% denaturing gel was described previously (29Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3244-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further our understanding of elongation control by P-TEFb, we developed an in vitro transcription system in which factors could be added back to isolated early elongation complexes. The attachment of the template to magnetic beads through a biotin-streptavidin linkage allows for the isolation of the early elongation complexes. The template is incubated with HNE to form preinitiation complexes on the CMV immediate early promoter. Upon the addition of nucleotides, including limiting [α-32P]CTP, RNA polymerase II initiates and generates transcripts predominately less than 25 nt in length. The elongating polymerases are halted and stripped of associated factors by repeatedly washing with buffer containing 1 m KCl and 1% Sarkosyl and resuspended in transcription buffer without nucleotides. The addition of nuclear extract to such complexes has been demonstrated to reconstitute P-TEFb-dependent elongation control (28Peng J. Liu M. Marion J. Zhu Y. Price D.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we use isolated elongation complexes to determine whether highly purified DSIF, NELF, and P-TEFb could reconstitute elongation control in a similar manner. We first examined the kinetics of RNA polymerase II elongation in the presence of a nuclear extract added back to early elongation complexes in the absence or presence of DRB as diagrammed in Fig. 1 A. Previous work, which is briefly described in the Introduction, strongly indicates that DRB sensitivity observed in reconstituted transcription assays is due exclusively to the inhibition of P-TEFb (1Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 4Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 8Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 12Peng J. Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13855-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). After add-back of HNE, the early elongation complexes were chased for 0, 20, 30, 50, 80, 130, 210, or 340 s (Fig. 1 B). At the first few time points, little difference was observed in the elongation potential of the transcription complexes with or without DRB present. At longer time points, DRB reduced the elongation potential of a large fraction of the polymerases. This kinetic delay to the function of P-TEFb suggests that the kinase only functions on complexes that have either traveled a certain distance down the template or that P-TEFb requires a certain period of time to function. In the presence of DRB, complexes continued elongation, but at a much slower rate. The kinetics of elongation and the timing of P-TEFb function seen here match what was found previously using a system in which initiation and elongation were not separated by isolation of the early elongation complexes (2Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that the add-back assay faithfully reconstitutes appropriate kinetic aspects of elongation control. The two subunits of DSIF, Spt4 and Spt5, were both expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Fig. 2 A. Cells transformed with the Spt5 pET vector reproducibly caused slow growth, suggesting that expression of human Spt5 is toxic to E. coli. The resulting loss of the expression plasmid was minimized by maintaining ampicillin selection with several fresh medium changes during growth. This allowed a significant increase in the final level of expressed protein. The majority of both the Spt4 and Spt5 proteins produced in E. coli was insoluble, but both proteins were solubilized in the presence of 6 m urea. Each subunit was individually purified over a nickel column in the presence of urea. The purified subunits were renatured together by dialysis, and the soluble fraction was loaded onto a Mono Q column. Free Spt4 flowed through the column and the DSIF heterodimer eluted at 400 mm KCl (Fig. 2 B). To obtain the complete NELF protein, NELF-E, the smallest subunit, was FLAG-tagged at its N terminus and stably transfected into HeLa S3 cells. Anti-FLAG M2 antibodies were used to affinity-purify NELF-E-containing complexes from both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures” and outlined in Fig. 3 A. The majority of the NELF was present in the cytoplasmic fraction, and no difference was seen in the properties of NELF isolated from either the cytoplasmic or nuclear fraction (data not shown). Because of an excess of the apparent 52-kDa NELF-E subunit in the isolated material, the NELF complex was further purified by chromatography on Mono Q (Fig. 3 B). NELF eluted at 360 mm KCl. Under the conditions used, the intact NELF complex separated from free NELF-E and a few other proteins that associated with the NELF complex during affinity purification. The presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 throughout purification increased NELF activity and also prevented precipitation of the protein during purification and storage at −80 °C. Although the original purification of the NELF complex reported the presence of five subunits co-eluting with NELF activity (27Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), recent protein sequence analysis indicates that the same gene encodes two of these subunits, NELF-C and NELF-D. 2T. Wada, Y. Yamaguchi, and H. Handa, manuscript in preparation. As seen in Fig. 3 B, purification of NELF on Mono Q partially resolves two different complexes that differ in the form of the NELF-C/D subunit with the complex containing the lower mobility C-form eluting first. This resolution of the two forms may not have been observed in the original purification of NELF, because the Mono Q column was used at an early stage in the purification before the subunit composition could be seen. We tested the activity of the two NELF fractions, 31 and 32, that differ in NELF-C/D composition but found no differences in activity in our add-back transcription assay (data not shown). In an attempt to reconstitute the negative elongation activity observed with HNE, the effect of adding purified DSIF and purified NELF to isolated early elongation complexes was tested (Fig. 4). Transcripts in the isolated complexes were elongated for 5 min in the presence of 0, 6, 13, 25, 50, or 100 ng of DSIF and 5 ng of NELF or with 0, 0.6, 1.3, 2.5, 5, or 10 ng of NELF and 50 ng of DSIF. At the concentrations used in this assay, DSIF or NELF added individually had no observable effects on the elongation rate. When both of these factors were added together, a negative effect was observed on approximately half of the polymerases (Fig. 4). We were unable to find conditions in which all polymerases were affected by DSIF and NELF (see “Discussion”). Using saturating concentrations of DSIF and NELF, polymerases that were affected by these factors elongated at one-third the rate of the unaffected polymerases. A maximal reduction in the rate of DSIF and NELF affected polymerases occurred when ∼50 ng of DSIF and 5 ng of NELF were added (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Increasing the concentrations of DSIF or NELF above these values did not affect the percentage of polymerases that were affected by these factors. When DSIF was added at a 10-fold higher concentration than the highest concentration tested in Fig. 4, all polymerases increased their rate of elongation by ∼20% (data not shown). This stimulatory activity was independent of NELF. Concentrations of NELF up to 15-fold higher than those used here had no effect on the elongating polymerase in the absence of DSIF. Because independent purifications resulted in DSIF preparations that had specific activities that differed by up to a factor of 5, it is likely that only a fraction of the DSIF in any of these samples was active. In contrast, separate purifications of NELF had very similar specific activities (data not shown). To determine whether the negative activity of DSIF and NELF could be reversed, increasing amounts of P-TEFb (0, 25, 50, 100, or 200 ng) were added back to isolated elongation complexes in reactions containing 50 ng of DSIF and 5 ng of NELF. As the level of P-TEFb increased, the ability of the polymerase to generate longer transcripts was restored (Fig. 5). The transcripts generated with the highest level of P-TEFb were on average slightly shorter than those seen in the absence of any added factors. This was not changed by the addition of even higher levels of P-TEFb (data not shown). This would be expected if the hig"
https://openalex.org/W1524217205,"A family of five β1,3-galactosyltransferases has been characterized that catalyze the formation of Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ and Galβ1,3GalNAcβ linkages present in glycoproteins and glycolipids (β3GalT1, -2, -3, -4, and -5). We now report a new member of the family (β3GalT6), involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. The human and mouse genes were located on chromosomes 1p36.3 and 4E2, respectively, and homologs are found inDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike other members of the family, β3GalT6 showed a broad mRNA expression pattern by Northern blot analysis. Although a high degree of homology across several subdomains exists among other members of the β3-galactosyltransferase family, recombinant enzyme did not utilize glucosamine- or galactosamine-containing acceptors.

This product, Galβ1,3Galβ is found in the linkage region of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Ser), indicating that β3GalT6 is the so-called galactosyltransferase II involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis.

Presumably, GalTII should be distinct from GalTI based on linkage (β1,3 versus β1,4) and substrate differences (galactose versus xylose). GalTII catalyzes the formation of Galβ1,3Gal linkage; therefore, it belongs to a family of β1,3-galactosyltransferases. Five members of this family have already been described (13Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M. Hollingsworth M.A. Hassan H. Schwientek T. Nielsen P.A. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 88: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). None of the β3GalT enzymes characterized to date have activity with galactose-terminated oligosaccharide acceptors, suggesting that another member of the family must exist in order to catalyze the formation of the linkage region of glycosaminoglycans. In this report, we describe the identification of GalTII and show that it is the sixth member of confirmed β1,3-galactosyltransferases. This enzyme was actually identified in a previous publication but was designated a β1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase because of a clerical error (22Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96 (Correction (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 11673–11675): 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the expressed protein catalyzes the formation of Galβ1,3Gal linkages. The protein sequence is a close homolog of other β1,3-galactosyltransferase, and orthologs are present inDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes, consistent with the idea that this enzyme is broadly distributed as might be expected for an enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), COS-7, and HeLa S3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL61, CRL-1651, and CCL2.2). CHO cells were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity in Ham’s F-12 growth medium or F-12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1:1, v/v) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G. COS-7 and HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The human and mouse GalTII cDNAs were isolated from λ-phage libraries of human fetal brain cDNA (CLONTECH) and mouse newborn brain cDNA (Stratagene) using as a probe a PCR fragment derived from the expressed sequence tag AA150140. The PCR fragment was amplified from human genomic DNA by primers 5′-GCGACTACTACCTGCCCTACG-3′ and 5′-CTCCCTTCTCTGGCAAGCACT-3′. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]CTP (Hartmann Analytics, Braunschweig,Germany) by random priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The full-length human and mouse cDNAs were expressed with the Bac-to-Bac (Life Technologies) baculovirus Sf9 insect cell system (15Hennet T. Dinter A. Kuhnert P. Mattu T.S. Rudd P.M. Berger E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNAs flanked by Eco RI adaptors derived from the λ-phage inserts were subcloned into the pFastbac1 vector (Life Technologies). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by site-mediated transposition as recommended by the manufacturer. The full-length cDNA was also cloned in pcDNA3.1(+) at the Bam HI and Xho I sites and expressed as a soluble secreted form using the pFLAG-CMV-1 vector (Sigma). An Eco RI-Xba I fragment isolated from a partial human βGalTII cDNA truncated after the transmembrane domain was ligated into pFLAG-CMV-1 opened with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and the secreted enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The conditioned media and beads were mixed end-over-end overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. The beads were washed twice with 10 ml of 20% (v/v) glycerol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) to achieve a ∼50% (v/v) slurry. The immobilized enzyme was stable at 4 °C for at least 4 months. GalTII mRNAs were detected by Northern blot analysis using commercially available multiple tissues poly(A)+ RNA blots (CLONTECH). A probe, derived from the human GalTII cDNA between nucleotides 616 and 983, was labeled and hybridized to the poly(A)+ RNA blots. Blots were washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C, dried, and exposed to film for 4 days at −70 °C between intensifying screens. Glycosyltransferase activity was investigated with radioactive forms of UDP-galactose, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc and various acceptor saccharide substrates, including Galβ-O-p-nitrophenyl (NP), GlcNAcβ-O-NP, and GalNAcβ-O-NP (Sigma), and Xylβ-O-benzyl (Bn), Xylβ-O-naphthol, GalNAcβ-O-Bn, Galβ-O-napthalenemethanol (NM), GlcNAcβ-O-NM, Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Bn, Galβ1,3Galβ-O-NM, Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ-O-NM, Galβ1,3GalNAcα-O-NM, and GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ-O-NM (23Sarkar A.K.

When expressed in COS-7 cells, the standard reaction (25 μl) contained 5 μl of protein A bead slurry (50%) containing immobilized enzyme, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.3 μCi of UDP-[1-3H]galactose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 150 μm UDP-galactose, 5 mmacceptor, 15 mm MnCl2, and 50 mmKCl. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction products were diluted with 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (100 mg; Waters). After washing the cartridge with 5 ml of water, the products were eluted with 50% methanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. Twenty small scale enzymatic assays were performed in parallel for 4 h using Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Bn as substrate and nonradioactive UDP-galactose as donor. After the clean up on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, the product was separated from the large amounts of unreacted disaccharide acceptor by silica gel chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol (10:3, v/v). Samples were analyzed on silica gel 60 aluminum-backed high performance thin layer chromatography plates (Merck). A section of the plate was stained with α-naphthol reagent and heated at 110 °C for 5 min to detect the product (26Siakotos A.N. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1965; 42: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The disaccharide substrate and purified trisaccharide product were repeatedly exchanged in D2O (100%; Sigma) with intermediate lyophilization. The trisaccharide was dissolved in a final volume of 40 μl of 100% D2O and transferred into a 40-μl nanocell. The disaccharide standard was dissolved in a final volume of 0.6–0.7 ml and transferred to a 5-mm tube (Wilmad 528-PP).1H NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian Unity Inova 500-MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. A SUN Microsystems Ultra-10 computer running Varian’s VNMR software (version 6.1B) controlled data acquisition. Chemical shifts are relative to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate; they were typically measured relative to the residual acetate peak (δ 1.908 ppm at 22–30 °C and pD 6–8) and compared with literature values (27Wieruszeski J.M.

Two small interfering RNAs (siRNA GalTII-A and -B) were designed to target GalTII based on the method of Elbashir and co-workers (32Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2000; 411: 494-498Crossref Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). siRNA GalTII-A targeted nucleotides 461–482 numbered from the start codon (AY050570, sense: 5′-GGCGGACGACGACUCCUUCTT-3′; antisense: 5′-GAAGGAGUCGUCGUCCGCCTT-3′). siRNA GalTII-B targeted nucleotides 65–87 (sense: 5′-GCACGCGACGCUGGCGCGCTT-3′; antisense: 5′-GCGCGCCAGCGUCGCGUGCTT-3′). As a control for nonspecific effects of siRNA, oligonucleotides were designed to target mouse lamin A (mLaminA) using nucleotides 260–280 (NM019390; sense: 5′-GAAGCAGCUUCAGGAUGAGAU-3′; antisense: 5′-CUCAUCCUGAAGCUGCUUCUU-3′). siRNAs were obtained from Genset Oligos (Paris), and the complementary oligonucleotides were annealed as described previously (32Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2000; 411: 494-498Crossref Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). For each 30-mm culture dish of cells, 12 μl of the 20 μm stock siRNA duplex was mixed with 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). This mixture was gently added to a solution containing 12 μl of Oligofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 48 μl of Opti-MEM. After 20 min at room temperature, 128 μl of Opti-MEM was added. This solution was gently overlaid onto 10–20% confluent HeLa S3 cells, which had been previously washed with Opti-MEM. After 5 h, 2 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 30% fetal calf serum was added without removing the transfection media. Four days later, the cells were treated with trypsin and reseeded in 30-mm dishes. Three rounds of siRNA transfection were required to decrease glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis as determined by35SO4 incorporation (33Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused form of GalTII was prepared by amplifying the full-length cDNA from the original pcDNA3.1(+) clone. AnEco RI restriction site at the 5′-end (5′-GCAGGAATTCTATAGCCACATTCCC-3′) and Bam HI restriction site at the 3′-end (5′-CTGGATCCTCCCTTCTCTGGCAGCAC-3′) were introduced. After digestion with the appropriate enzymes, the fragment was inserted in frame with GFP at the C terminus in pEGFP-N1. Cells grown on 24-well glass microscope slides were transfected with pEGFPN1-GalT II using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (34Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar), fixed for 1 h with 2% paraformaldehyde in 75 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Primary rabbit antibodies against α-mannosidase II and CALNUC (medial and cis Golgi markers, respectively) were a gift from M. G. Farquhar (University of California, San Diego). The antiserum was diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated with fixed cells in a humid chamber for 1 h. After several washes, the cells were incubated with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain nuclei and a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 1% BSA. The coverslips were washed several times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, CA). Images were captured with a Photometrics CCD mounted on a Nikon microscope adapted to a DeltaVision (Applied Precision, Inc.) deconvolution imaging system. The data sets were deconvolved and analyzed using SoftWorx software (Applied Precision, Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station. A large family of β1,3-galactosyltransferases has been described based on expressed sequence tags exhibiting a high degree of homology and by use of PCR-based cloning strategies (13Amado M.

Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24794-24799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to GlcNAcβ-based acceptors, β3GalT5 is also capable of transferring galactose to the terminal GalNAc unit of the globoside Gb4 (20Zhou D. Henion T.R. Jungalwala F.B. Berger E.G. Hennet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22631-22634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In a search for additional family members, we used the mouse β3GalT1, -2, and -3 (15Hennet T. Dinter A. Kuhnert P. Mattu T.S. Rudd P.M. Berger E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) protein sequences to query the expressed sequence tag division of GenBankTM, and the fragment AA150140 was identified. This fragment was used as a probe to isolate the corresponding full-length cDNAs from human and mouse libraries, which corresponded to open reading frames encoding proteins of 329 and 325 amino acids, respectively. This cDNA was previously associated with a β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity (22Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96 (Correction (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 11673–11675): 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but the actual sequence responsible for the glucosaminyltransferase activity reported previously is encoded by AF092050 and AF092051. These correct designations have been posted in the GenBankTM data base. As shown below the cDNA actually encodes a β1,3-galactosyltransferase that participates in the formation of the linkage region of glycosaminoglycans. As the newest confirmed member of the β3GalT family, it is designated β3GalT6. However, in this paper it will be referred to as GAG GalTII after the nomenclature used in the proteoglycan field (1Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, GAG GalTII shows extensive homology to four other members of the human β1,3-galactosyltransferase family that have confirmed preferences for GlcNAc-terminated oligosaccharides. Like the other β1,3-galactosyltransferases, GAG GalTII has a typical type II transmembrane orientation. The tentative transmembrane domain consists of 19 amino acids starting at residue 12 from the N terminus. In the transmembrane domain, the GAG GalTII has a cysteine residue that is conserved in mouse, human, and C. elegans (Fig.2). Interestingly, β3GalT1, β3GalT5, and the homologous Drosophila protein Brainiac also contain Cys residues in their putative transmembrane domains, but the function of these residues is unknown. One possibility is that they may affect the oligomerization of the protein as recently reported for α2,6-sialyltransferase I (36Qian R. Chen C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28641-28649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain is followed by a segment rich in Ser, Pro, Ala, and Gly, which has been described as the “SPLAG” domain in other transferases (37Shworak N.W. Liu J.A. Petros L.M. Zhang L.J. Kobayashi M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5170-5184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and presumably represents a stem region that determines the distance between the catalytic domain and the membrane. All of the other motifs identified previously in the β3GalTs presumably define essential folds in the catalytic domain (13Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M.

These were also found in similar locations in GAG GalTII, but the conserved cysteine residues are either absent or located differently.Figure 2A ClustalX alignment of human β3GalT6 proteins with the putative orthologs in murine (AY050569), C. elegans (AAF-60408), and Drosophila melanogaster (AAF59065).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The chromosomal location of human and mouse GAG GalTII was determined using both the public genome data base and the partially annotated mouse genome. Human GalTII maps to chromosome 1p36.3 and occupies a similar position on the mouse chromosome at 4E2. Inspection of the sequence indicates that GalTII, like the other members of the β3GalTs, is encoded by a single exon in the human, but its organization in the mouse genome is unclear from the existing annotated data base. However, the gene appears to contain multiple exons inD. melanogaster and C. elegans. GalTII mRNA is expressed broadly across both human and mouse tissues (Fig.3 and Ref. 22Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96 (Correction (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This pattern differs from the expression profiles of the other β3GalTs, which tend to be restricted to specific tissues (13Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M.

The presence of multiple transcripts suggests that additional exons exist encoding 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. Differences in nucleotide and amino acid sequences were used to measure the evolutionary relationship of GalTII and the other members of the β3GalT family (Fig. 4). Both dendrograms indicated a “starburst” relationship among the human β3GalT genes; i.e. all members of the family are relatively equidistant from each other (the internodal distances have high bootstrap support). This observation suggests that the β3GalT family emerged early in evolution and has not undergone recent duplications and radiations. Human GalTII has undergone progressive variation in sequence, diverging as much from earlier phylogenetic forms as from other members in the family. All of the previously described β3GalTs transfer galactose from UDP-galactose to glycans or glycoconjugates containing terminal β-linked GlcNAc or GalNAc residues. GAG GalTII, however, lacks this activity (Table I), and instead the recombinant enzyme prefers glycans with a terminal β-linked galactose residue or simple β-galactosides. In particular, GalTII reacted with Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Bn more strongly than any of the other substrates. A plot of activity versus acceptor concentration yielded an apparent K m value of ∼5.7 mm (Fig. 5). The enzyme also showed a strict requirement for UDP-galactose, failing to transfer sugar from UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc.Table IAcceptor specificity of GalTII fusion proteinSynthetic acceptorEnzyme activitypmol /h /ml mediumMonosaccharides (5 mm) Xylβ-O-Bn, -O-naphtholND Galβ-O-NM18 Galβ-O-p NPND GalNAcβ-O-Bn, -O-p NPND GlcNAcβ-O-NM, -O-p NPNDDisaccharides (5 mm) Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Bn84 Galβ1,3GalNAcα-O-NM 6 Galβ1,3Galβ-O-NM 1 Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ-O-NM 4 Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ-O-NMND GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ-O-NMND Manα1,6Manα-O-C10NDThe galactosyltransferase activity was assayed in vitro using UDP-[3H]Gal together with various acceptor substrates as described under “Materials and Methods.” ND, not detectable; NM, naphthalenemethanol; Bn, benzyl; pNP, para-nitrophenol; C10, O-decenyl (CH2)8CH=CH2.

Structural characterization by one-dimensional 1H NMR of the enzymatic product formed using Galβ1,4Xyl-O-Bn as substrate showed that GAG GalTII forms a Galβ1,3Gal linkage (TableII and Fig.6). Comparison of 1H NMR of the galactosylated product (Fig. 6 B) and the substrate (Fig.6 A) showed the addition of a peak at δ 4.605 (3 J 1,2 = 8.0 Hz). A similar peak at δ 4.615 (3 J 1,2 = 7.8 Hz) was observed previously for the corresponding l-serine glycoside (Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xyl-O-Ser; see Table II), indicative of an additional sugar residue in the β-configuration. Evidence of the newly formed Galβ1,3Gal linkage was evident from a shift in the Gal-2 H-4 peak at δ 3.910 (3 J 3,4 = 3.0 Hz) in the acceptor to a peak at δ 4.189 (3 J 3,4 = 3.0 Hz) in the product, confirming a β1,3-linkage.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether GalTII was actually involved in glycosaminoglycan formation, siRNAs were generated to two different oligonucleotides segments of the human sequence. One round of transfection of HeLa cells only marginally inhibited glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, as measured by 35SO4 incorporation into the chains. However, a second round of transfection increased the level of inhibition, and by the third cycle a 6–10-fold reduction in synthesis was observed (207 cpm/μg of protein versus 25 and 37 cpm/μg of protein for GalTII-A and GalTII-B, respectively; Fig. 7). Digestion of the residual [35S]glycosaminoglycans showed that siRNA to GalTII inhibited both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate synthesis, consistent with the idea that siRNA had silenced a gene early in the pathway. To determine the subcellular location of GAG GalTII, green fluorescent protein was fused to the C terminus, and the chimeric protein was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Fig. 8). By deconvolution microscopy, the tagged enzyme was detected in a punctate distribution in a perinuclear region overlapping to a greater extent with α-mannosidase II, a marker of the medial Golgi (36Qian R. Chen C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28641-28649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), than with CALNUC (nucleobindin), which has been localized to thecis-Golgi cisternae and cis- Golgi network (37Shworak N.W.

Prior studies indicate that GalTI (β4GalT7) and glucuronosyltransferase I (the enzymes that generate the precursor for GalTII and that acts on its product, respectively) are localized similarly (40Pinhal M.A.S.

Xylosyltransferases have recently been identified, but their localizations have not yet been established (2Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Immunological evidence suggests that this reaction occurs in an earlier endoplasmic reticulum compartment (41Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Flay N. Kearns A.E. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11105-11112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that GAG synthesis initiates in the endoplasmic reticulum and then linkage region assembly is completed in the medial Golgi. In this report, we have identified the cDNA for GAG GalTII and report that it is the previously described β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (22Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96 (Correction (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This enzyme is part of a gene family that encodes at least six β1,3-galactosyltransferases involved in glycoprotein, glycolipid, and proteoglycan processing. These enzymes in fact contain a motif in common with other β1,3-glycosyltransferases. One of the enzymes, β3GalT3, has been shown to also transfer GalNAc in β1,3-linkage to globosides (42Okajima T.

In contrast to these enzymes, GAG GalTII (β3GalT6) preferentially acts on Galβ1,4Xyl, which is found in the linkage region of glycosaminoglycans. Furthermore, silencing of the gene by siRNA blocked glycosaminoglycan assembly in vivo, verifying the identity of this cDNA as GAG GalTII. Its localization to the medial Golgi along with GalTI and GlcATI is consistent with the idea that linkage region formation takes place in this compartment."

However, the mechanisms by which these cytokines promote disease have not been fully elucidated. In order to identify novel molecular mediators of allergy, a comparison was made of the bronchoalveolar lavage, which demonstrated that the Ym2 protein was abundantly up-regulated in the lung during the development of allergy. Low levels of the Ym1 isomer were also detected. Importantly, neither Ym1 nor Ym2 has been characterized previously in the context of allergic pulmonary inflammation. Western immunoblot showed that enhanced expression of these proteins was dependent on CD4+T cells and IL-4 or IL-13 signaling via the IL-4Rα subunit. In addition, intratracheal instillation of IL-13 into naive mice was sufficient to induce expression. Ym1 is homologous to eosinophil chemotactic factor L. However, only weak eosinophil chemotaxis was observed in response to Ym protein in both in vitro and in vivo assays. By contrast, the homology of Ym1 and Ym2 to proteins associated with tissue remodeling, together with the previous findings that Ym1 is homologous to chitinase and binds heparin sulfate and GlcN oligomers (chitobiose, chitotriose, and chitotetraose), strongly suggests these proteins play an important role in airway wall remodeling in the allergic lung.

Roche W.R. Roberts J.A. Holgate S.T. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 139: 806-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The acute but reversible bronchospasm and airways obstruction observed in asthmatics is underpinned by morphological alterations to the bronchial mucosa that are orchestrated by CD4+ T helper 2 lymphocytes (Th2 cells) and their cytokines. Mouse models of Th2 cell-induced allergic pulmonary disease have provided an invaluable tool for dissecting the discrete molecular mechanisms that potentiate the underlying inflammation in asthma. In congruence with asthma, allergic mice exhibit a Th2 cell biased response in the lung with elevated levels of interleukin (IL)1-4, IL-5, and IL-13, an eosinophilic-rich infiltrate, mucus hypersecretion, airways hyperreactivity (AHR) to cholinergic challenge, and increased serum levels of antigen-specific IgE (reviewed in Ref. 2Webb D.C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 contribute to the pathophysiology of allergic pulmonary disease, neither cytokine is obligatory (7Webb D.C. McKenzie A.N.J. Koskinen A.M.L. Yang M. Mattes J. Foster P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Hogan S.P. Matthaei K.I. Young J.M. Koskinen A. Young I.G. Foster P.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1501-1509PubMed Google Scholar), particularly in BALB/c mice, which, like asthmatics, have an inherent bias toward Th2 responses. We demonstrated recently (7Webb D.C. McKenzie A.N.J. Koskinen A.M.L. Yang M. Mattes J. Foster P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) that although a deficiency in either IL-4 or IL-13 was insufficient to ablate AHR and eosinophilic extravasation into the pulmonary tissues, a deficiency in both cytokines was required to reduce pulmonary eosinophilia and AHR to base-line levels. The functions of IL-4 and IL-13 are often linked through their common usage of the IL-4Rα subunit to activate downstream signaling moieties (reviewed in Ref. 15Murata T. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the IL-4Rα subunit, a fundamental mediator of IL-4 and IL-13 responses, appears to be a key regulator of asthma pathophysiology. In an effort to elucidate the downstream mediators that affect the development of IL-4- and IL-13-induced disease in the murine lung, we examined the proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) that were up-regulated during allergic inflammation. In this investigation, we demonstrate that the Ym2 protein (16Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) is abundantly expressed in the allergic lung in a manner that is critically dependent on CD4+ T cells and on IL-4- or IL-13-mediated signaling via the IL-4Rα subunit. Lower levels of Ym1, an isomer of Ym2, could also be detected. In addition, expression of these proteins is up-regulated when IL-13 is instilled directly into the lungs of naive mice, and this correlates with previous findings (9Wills-Karp M. Luyimbazi J. Xu X.

In contrast to reports suggesting that ECF-L, which is identical to Ym1, is an eosinophil chemokine (18Owhashi M. Nawa Y. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl.

However, the presence of this protein in the allergic lung in conjunction with its ability to bind heparin (21Chang N.-C.A. Hung S.-I. Hwa K.-Y. Kato I. Chen J.-E. Liu C.-H. Chang A.C. J. Biol.

IL-13 gene knockout (IL-13−/−) mice were generated from 129 × C57Bl/6 mice (24McKenzie G.J. Emson C.L. Bell S.E. Anderson S. Fallon P. Zurawski G. Murray R. Grencis R. McKenzie A.N.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) that were backcrossed for 5 generations onto the BALB/c strain. IL-4Rα−/− mice were generated from BALB/c embryonic stem cells as described previously (25Noben-Trauth N. Shultz L.D. Brombacher F. Urban J.F.J. Gu H. Paul W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Wild type mice were obtained from a similar number of backcrosses of the same genetic background. Equal numbers of male and female mice (3–6 per group) were sensitized at 6–8 weeks of age by intraperitoneal injection with 50 μg of ovalbumin (OVA) mixed with 1 mg of Alhydrogel (CSL Ltd., Parkville, Australia) in 0.9% sterile saline. Nonsensitized mice received 1 mg of Alhydrogel in 0.9% saline. On days 12, 14, 16, and 18, all mice were aeroallergen-challenged with OVA as described previously (12Foster P.S. Hogan S.P. Ramsay A.J.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 1501-1509PubMed Google Scholar). Mice that were saline-sensitized and OVA-challenged are referred to as nonallergic mice and OVA-sensitized and -challenged mice as allergic mice. Additionally, wild type BALB/c mice (WT) or IL-13−/− mice were either treated with isotype control antibody (1 mg of βGL113), anti-IL-4 antibody (1 mg of 11B11), or anti-IL-5 antibody (1 mg of TRFK5) by intraperitoneal injection 24 h before sensitization and then weekly throughout the experimental period. To deplete CD4+ T cells, mice were treated with 1 mg of antibody clone GK1.5 or with 1 mg of βGL113 antibody for control mice 8 days before intraperitoneal sensitization and then weekly throughout the experimental period. Twenty four h after the last challenge, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected by flushing the airways 2 times with 1 ml of PBS. Eosinophilic inflammation of the airways was characterized by enumeration of May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained cytospins of BALF cells and histological examination of Carbol’s Chromotrope and stained hematoxylin tissue sections. To determine the efficiency of T cell depletion, the spleens from 2 mice per group were removed, pushed through a sieve to give a single cell suspension, and washed in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum. Two × 105splenocytes were removed and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated GK1.5 and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, which demonstrated a mean of 98% depletion of CD4+ T cells. For the IL-13 studies, naive mice were anesthetized with intravenous Saffan (Schering-Plough, New South Wales, Australia), and 10 μg of recombinant IL-13 (gift from D. Donaldson, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) diluted in 20 μl of PBS, or PBS only for controls, was delivered intratracheally via a 24-gauge catheter (Terumo). The BALF was collected after 48 h. For the in vivo assay using purified Ym protein, WT mice were sensitized twice intraperitoneally with OVA 12 days apart to induce a peripheral blood eosinophilia. After a further 7 days, 10 μg of purified Ym protein, or PBS for controls, was instilled intratracheally in a total volume of 20 μl. Intratracheal delivery was repeated after a further 24 h. Histological analysis was then conducted 24 h later. These experiments were conducted in sensitized mice to examine function of the Ym proteins in mice predisposed to Th2 immunity and allergic disease. Mice were treated according to Australian National University Animal Welfare guidelines and were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility. Cell-free BALF supernatants were boiled in sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and run on 4–12% NU-PAGE gels following the manufacturer’s recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). To identify the Ym protein, an appropriate band was excised from the gel and subjected to N-terminal sequencing using Edman chemistry (Biomolecular Resource Facility, Australian National University, Australian Capital Territory, Australia). For comparison of Ym expression in cytokine-deficient mice, BALF samples were concentrated, and 40 μg of protein was loaded per lane. Western immunoblots were performed on BALF proteins that were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Multiphor Novablot semidry transfer system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20) and probed with a 1/1000 dilution of rabbit anti-Ym1 antibody and then with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated antibody (Sigma). The alkaline phosphatase was detected with stabilized Western Blue substrate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For time course RT-PCR, lung tissue was obtained from WT mice that were OVA-sensitized and had received 0, 2, or 4 OVA aerosols. RNA was purified using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and Superscript enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.). The presence of mRNA specific for the Ym protein was detected by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CTGATCTATGCCTTTGCTGG and the reverse primer 5′-CACAGATTCTTCCTCAAAAGC for 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. These primers were designed from the sequence of the gene encoding ECF-L (GenBankTMD87757) and hybridize at positions 170 and 510, respectively. RT-PCR for the β-actin housekeeping gene was used to control for RNA variation. For sequence analysis, the reading frame encoding the Ym protein was amplified by RT-PCR of RNA purified from the inflammatory cells in the BALF of allergic WT mice. High fidelity PCR of reverse transcribed oligo(dT) RNA was performed with the forward primer 5′-CATGGCCAAGCTCATTCTT and the reverse primer 5′-TCAATAAGGGCCCTTGCAAC, which hybridize at positions 10 and 1195, respectively, of ECF-L (the methionine start codon and reverse stop codon are in bold). The resultant PCR fragment was A-tailed and cloned into the plasmid vector pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). Five clones were then sequenced at least twice, independently, using the PRISM Ready Reaction Dye-Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing reagents and an Applied Biosystems automated sequencing system model 373A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with SP6 and T7 primers, which hybridize to vector sequences, and internal primers based on the sequence of ECF-L. Cell-free BALF supernatant from allergic mice was concentrated with a Centriprep 50 microconcentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA), buffer exchanged into 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and then applied to a Q5 anion exchange column with a 1 ml/min flow rate controlled by a Bio-Logic microprocessor (Bio-Rad). The Ym protein eluted at 0.55 m NaCl of a 0–1 mlinear gradient as determined by SDS-PAGE. Appropriate fractions were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in PBS with a TSK G3000SW column (Tosoh Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Fractions containing the Ym protein were pooled and concentrated. The yield was ∼2 μg per mouse, and only one band was detectable on SDS-PAGE stained with Colloidal Coomassie (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) suggesting a high degree of purity. N-terminal sequence analysis and reaction with a polyclonal antibody prepared against recombinant Ym1 confirmed the identity of the purified protein. A Ym1/pGEM-T clone was used as a template for high fidelity PCR with the forward primer 5′-GTACAGCTGGGATCCTCCTACCAG and the reverse primer 5′-CTCCTCTCAATAGGATCCCTTGCAAC. The triplets in bold encode the N-terminal tyrosine of the mature protein and the reverse stop codons, respectively. The underlined BamHI restriction sites were used to clone the PCR product into the vector pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which expressed Ym1 as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein under the control of a tac promoter. Orientation of the insert was determined by HindIII and EcoRV digests of sites that occur in Ym1 and the vector, respectively. The Ym1/GST fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli was predominantly found in inclusion bodies. Recombinant bacteria were washed in PBS, disrupted in a Ribi cell Fractionator (Sorvall, DuPont), and resuspended in PBS with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100. Inclusion bodies were then pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and solubilized in 0.1 mTris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 6 m guanidine HCl by stirring at room temperature for 3 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The Ym1/GST fusion protein in the supernatant was then refolded by diluting 1/50 into 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m arginine, 2 mm EDTA, and 6 mm oxidized glutathione and mixed at 8 °C overnight. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was then concentrated with a PM10 membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 60 pounds/square inch. Insoluble material was removed with a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and then the Ym1/GST protein was purified by SEC in PBS with a TSK G3000SW column. Purity was visually determined on SDS-PAGE to be greater than 95%. Antibodies were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by immunization with 100 μg of Ym1/GST fusion protein emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant. Two booster doses of 100 μg of protein in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant were administered at 4 and 6 weeks after the initial dose. Serum was collected 2 weeks after the last injection. Eosinophils, which were obtained by flushing the peritoneal cavity of IL-5 transgenic mice (supplied by L. Dent, University of Adelaide, South Australia, Australia (26Dent L.A. Strath M. Mellor A.L. Sanderson C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1425-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar)), were washed in PBS. The peritoneal cells (2 × 105cells/well comprising 30.5% eosinophils) in RPMI supplemented with 100 ng/ml purified IL-5 (gift from I. G. Young, JCSMR, Australian National University, Australian Capital Territory, Australia) were added to the top chamber of a 5-μm pore 24-well Transwell plate (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). Eotaxin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or the native purified Ym protein was added to the bottom chambers, and the plates were then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Migrated cells were collected from the bottom of the Transwell chamber, counted, and stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa to differentiate eosinophils. In order to identify proteins that were specifically induced during allergy, a comparison was made of the BALF from OVA-sensitized mice before and after 2 and 4 OVA aerosols (Fig. 1 A). The expression of a protein of ∼40 kDa was increasingly apparent on SDS-PAGE depending on the number of aerosols received. This protein was excised from the gel and subjected to N-terminal Edman chemistry, which identified the sequence YQLM XYYTSWAK. Residue five was ambiguous, but the low levels of dehydroxyalanine suggested the possibility of a cysteine residue. This sequence had identity with two proteins. The first, Ym1, was originally deposited in GenBankTM (accession numberM94584) as an unpublished entry and more recently characterized as a novel mammalian lectin that is transiently expressed by murine peritoneal macrophages during parasite infection (21Chang N.-C.A. Hung S.-I. Hwa K.-Y. Kato I. Chen J.-E. Liu C.-H. Chang A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17497-17506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The second protein, ECF-L (GenBankTM accession number D87757), was characterized as a murine lymphocyte-derived eosinophil chemotactic factor produced by CD8+ T cells in response to Toxicaris canis infection (19Owhashi M. Arita H. Niwa A. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Owhashi M. Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Notably, several genes encoding isotypes of Ym1 (classified as types 2–4) have been identified and partially characterized (16Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the Ym isotype expressed in allergic BALF could not be determined from the initial N-terminal analysis. Because it was apparent from SDS-PAGE that the expression of the Ym protein was up-regulated in the allergic lung, we performed RT-PCR to determine whether its incidence in BALF was associated with the enhanced exudate of serum proteins into the pulmonary fluid as a result of allergic inflammation or whether Ym was expressed in situ. Similar to the protein profile, a faint DNA band corresponding to the Ym protein could be detected in mice that had not been OVA aerosol-challenged (Fig. 1 B). However, expression was highly up-regulated after 2 and increasingly so after 4 aerosols. Western immunoblot using an antibody specific for recombinant Ym1 also demonstrated progressively enhanced expression of Ym protein in the BALF (Fig. 1 C). As the Ym1 homologous protein, ECF-L, has been associated with eosinophil chemotaxis (19Owhashi M. Arita H. Niwa A. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Owhashi M. Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we also compared the development of eosinophilia in the peripheral blood (Fig. 2 A) and BALF (Fig. 2 B) with Ym protein expression in allergic mice. The enhanced recruitment of eosinophils to the lung during allergy paralleled the pulmonary expression of the Ym protein.Figure 2Comparison of the numbers of blood and airway eosinophils during the development of allergic inflammation.Samples from 3 to 4 OVA-sensitized mice per group were collected after 4, after 2, and before OVA aerosols. Peripheral blood smears (A) and cytospins from BALF (B) were stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa for the enumeration of eosinophils. Values represent the mean ± S.E. per group percentage of blood eosinophils or of total airway eosinophils, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isotypes of Ym have been identified previously but have not been linked to the pathophysiology of allergic disease. Therefore, sequence analysis of the reading frame encoding the Ym protein was performed to determine which isotype was up-regulated in response to allergy. The ym gene was amplified by high fidelity RT-PCR, cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and sequenced. Interestingly, one clone was identical to the sequence of Ym1 (and ECF-L), whereas the other four clones were homologous (except for two amino acids see Fig. 3) to the sequenced part of the gene encoding residues 204–393 that has been identified as isotype Ym2 (16Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alignment of the complete sequences of the 398 amino acids comprising Ym1 and Ym2 are shown in Fig. 3. Overall these isotypes demonstrated 91.7% identity, varying by 33 amino acids. In order to determine whether the ratio of Ym1 to Ym2 clones was an accurate representation of their overall expression, digestion of the PCR product from allergic lung (four OVA aerosols) with ScaI restriction endonuclease was performed. The differences in sequence between Ym1 and Ym2 result in a ScaI site in Ym1 but not in Ym2 at the triplet encoding residue Ala-288. ScaI digestion of the PCR product derived from the Ym1/pGEM clone was used to control for digestion efficiency. Whereas the PCR from the Ym1 clone was completely digested with ScaI (Fig. 4, lane 3), the PCR from total lung was only partially cut (Fig. 4, lane 1) suggesting that the major Ym isotype expressed in the allergic lung was Ym2.Figure 4ScaI digest of the RT-PCR product encoding the Ym protein. The gene encoding the Ym protein was amplified from the BALF of allergic mice by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers. This PCR product was then purified and digested with ScaI. For comparison, the PCR product from the Ym1/pGEM-T clone was similarly amplified by PCR, purified, and digested. The Thr-288 → Ala difference in Ym2 removes the ScaI site present in Ym1. Digestion with ScaI only partially cut the PCR product from allergic lung (lane 1) compared with the undigested control (lane 2), suggesting the predominant Ym isotype in allergic lung was Ym2. In contrast, PCR of the plasmid encoding Ym1 was fully digested with ScaI (lane 3), compared with the undigested control (lane 4).Kb, kilobase pairs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SDS-PAGE of the Ym protein purified by ion exchange chromatography and then SEC HPLC revealed a single protein band. However, if a second ion exchange step was introduced before SEC, a small shoulder (Fig. 5 A, peak 1) as well as a major peak of 260 nm absorbance were observed (Fig. 5 A, peak 2). Both peaks contained a protein of similar molecular weight (Fig. 5 B) that reacted with the Ym1 antibody on a Western immunoblot (Fig. 5 C). The two bands were excised from SDS-PAGE and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis, which, in contrast to the earlier analysis, extended beyond the 16th residue of the mature protein. This identified an isoleucine as the 16th residue in the protein from the shoulder (peak 1), and this corresponds to the sequence of Ym1. In contrast, the 16th residue in the major peak was a threonine, corresponding to Ym2. Therefore, by comparison of the area under the peaks, and consistent with RT-PCR analysis, Ym2 appears to be the major Ym isomer expressed in the allergic murine lung. Notably, when the Ym protein was routinely purified, this second ion exchange HPLC step was not performed, leaving the mixture of isomers intact for the chemotaxis assays. In addition, despite the polyclonal antibody being raised against Ym1, it reacted equally with the two isomers. Allergic responses are intimately regulated by CD4+ T cells and the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 (7Webb D.C. McKenzie A.N.J. Koskinen A.M.L. Yang M. Mattes J. Foster P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) which both signal via the IL-4Rα subunit (reviewed in Ref. 27de Vries J. J. Allergy Clin.

Analysis of the reconstituted nucleosome core particles using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and DNase I footprinting showed that H2A.Z nucleosome core particles were almost structurally indistinguishable from its H2A.1 or native chicken erythrocyte counterparts. While this result is in good agreement with the recently published crystallographic structure of the H2A.Z nucleosome core particle (Suto, R. K., Clarkson, M J., Tremethick, D. J., and Luger, K. (2000) Nat. Struct. Biol. 7, 1121–1124), the ionic strength dependence of the sedimentation coefficient of these particles exhibits a substantial destabilization, which is most likely the result of the histone H2A.Z-H2B dimer binding less tightly to the nucleosome. Analytical ultracentrifuge analysis of the H2A.Z 208-12, a DNA template consisting of 12 tandem repeats of a 208-base pair sequence derived from the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus 5 S rRNA gene, reconstituted oligonucleosome complexes in the absence of histone H1 shows that their NaCl-dependent folding ability is significantly reduced. These results support the notion that the histone H2A.Z variant may play a chromatin-destabilizing role, which may be important for transcriptional activation.

To lower the energy of activation and display a template more amenable for expression, the nucleus uses several mechanisms to biochemically alter the nature of histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions. These mechanisms include post-translational modifications, nucleosome remodeling complexes, and the introduction of histone variants into the octameric core (for current reviews, see Refs. 1Wolffe A.P. Guschin D. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 102-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Histone variants are nonallelic isoforms of the major H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 proteins that interact through inherent histone fold domains in nucleosomes throughout the genome (for current reviews, see Refs. 4Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar and 5Hayes J.J. Hansen J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet.

By inserting variant histones into the octamer noncovalent interactions between the players are altered, possibly creating particles with modified stability or functional novelty. This epigenetic feature may be utilized to silence nonessential genes in differentiated tissues or to lower the binding constants of replication, transcription, and repair machinery in active chromatin.H2A.Z is an H2A subtype that has been identified in organisms as diverse as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Jackson J.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The protein displays 60% homology with H2A and 90% homology between species. Mutagenic assays have demonstrated that H2A.Z is essential for development in yeast (10Jackson J.D. Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3811-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and for viability in Tetrahymena (11Liu X. Li B. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Initial immunochemical characterization of this protein uncovered that H2A.Z is exclusive to transcriptionally active domains in Tetrahymena(14Allis C.D. Ziegler Y.S. Gorovsky M.A. Olmsted J.B. Cell. 1982; 31: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Wenkert D. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 2107-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Stargell L.A.

Recently H2A.Z has been observed to be located at yeast promoters and to display a redundant role with ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes (17Santisteban M.S. Kalashnikova T. Smith M.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and interact directly with transcriptional machinery during gene expression (18Adam M. Robert F. Larochelle M. Gaudreau L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6270-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, the functional dynamics of H2A.Z enrichment in active chromatin remains enigmatic as other studies describe H2A.Z deposition to have a nonspecific (19Leach T.J. Mazzeo M. Chotkowski H.L.

Kamakaka R.T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).The characterization of the H2A.Z nucleosome crystal structure by Suto and colleagues (21Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) provides a snapshot of histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions within the nucleosome core particle containing this histone variant. Divergent amino acid residues in H2A.Z octamers conform to similar nucleic acid-binding sites as native octamers (22Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6786) Google Scholar) and do not distort the superhelical path of DNA around the nucleosome perimeter (21Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Despite this lack of effect on the DNA trajectory, it appears that internal protein-protein interactions are affected. Substitution of H2A Gln104 by Gly104in H2A.Z destabilizes the 2(H2A.Z-H2B)-(H3-H4)2association and presents an opportune particle for DNA activation (13Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R.E. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Santisteban M.S. Kalashnikova T. Smith M.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Also the molecular surface of the variant nucleosome displays a novel acidic patch and a divalent cation-binding site, which may facilitate the rearrangement of higher order structure through internucleosomal electrostatic interactions or the recruitment of remodeling factors (21Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, these observations are only speculative as it is difficult to determine the direct implications of H2A.Z for chromatin from static crystallographic images.To address this problem we have reconstituted nucleosome core particles and oligonucleosome arrays containing major histone H2A.1 variant and variant histone H2A.Z and have characterized the ionic strength dependence of these complexes by analytical ultracentrifugation. These experiments provide the first clues into the folding dynamics of H2A.Z mononucleosome and chromatin complexes.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have used recombinant human H2A.Z and H2A.1 histone variants to reconstitute nucleosome core particles and 208-12 nucleosome arrays. Fig. 1, A and B, display the electrophoretic nature of the histone component of these particles.H2A.Z octamers were reconstituted onto random sequence 146-bp DNA fragments obtained from chicken erythrocyte nucleosomes. The generated particles are shown in Fig. 2 A. As it can be seen in this figure, histone octamers consisting of H2A.1 or H2A.Z are equally able to produce mononucleosome particles with identical electrophoretic mobility. The slightly lower electrophoretic mobility of these complexes when compared with native (purified) chicken erythrocyte mononucleosomes (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) can be ascribed to differences in the ionic strength of the sample buffer. Indeed the fraction of free DNA that is present in lane 2 of the Fig. 2 A (see white arrow) also exhibits a similar extent of mobility retardation when compared with the same DNA template used for the reconstitution of these particles (see Fig. 2 A,lane 5). The structural similarity between reconstituted H2A.1 and H2A.Z nucleosome core particles and to native chicken erythrocyte particles can be further depicted from the DNase I footprints which are shown in Fig. 2 B.Figure 2A, native (4%) polyacrylamide gel of H2A.Z-containing (lane 2) and H2A.1-containing (lane 3) reconstituted nucleosome core particles. Lane 4 is native chicken erythrocyte nucleosome core particles, and lane 5 corresponds to the 146-bp DNA obtained from these native particles and which was used in the reconstitution of the complexes shown in lanes 2 and 3. Lane 1 is a DNA marker obtained by digesting pBr 322 with HhaI. The white arrow points to the presence of a small fraction of free DNA.

This result is not surprising, and it was to be anticipated from the recently determined crystal structure of H2A.Z nucleosomes (21Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), which showed that the overall structure of this particle was similar to that of a nucleosome core particle that did not contain this unique histone H2A variant (22Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6786) Google Scholar).The apparent lack of a significant structural difference between H2A.Z and native nucleosome core particles consisting of the two major histone H2A isoforms (H2A.1 and H2A.2) is intriguing. Indeed, in contrast to H2A.1/H2A.2 variants, histone H2A.Z has been shown to be essential for survival in organisms phylogenetically as diverse as Tetrahymena (11Liu X. Li B. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (12van Daal A. Elgin S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R.E. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It has been determined by substitution experiments with H2A.1 homologous regions that the indispensable portion of histone H2A.Z maps to the carboxyl-terminal of the molecule (13Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R.E. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Interestingly enough, of all core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), H2A is the only histone with a prominent carboxyl-terminal “tail” extending beyond the histone fold (39Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The COOH domain also introduces inherent functional novelty in the case of three other histone H2A variants. H2A-Bbd is a recently identified protein that displays a truncated carboxyl-terminal tail and is enriched in active chromatin (40Chadwick B.P. Willard H.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), H2AX contains a carboxyl-terminal DNA-dependent protein kinase/ataxia telangiectasia mutated consensus recognition sequence (SQE) and is a phosphorylation substrate during double strand break DNA repair (41Downs J.A.

Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).In the case of the major H2A.1 and -2 subtypes, the carboxyl terminus has been shown to play an important role in the stability of the nucleosome core particle. Cleavage of the last 15 COOH-terminal amino acids of this region by an endogenous chromatin-bound protease (44Eickbush T.H. Watson D.K. Moudrianakis E.N. Cell. 1976; 9: 785-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) has been shown to substantially lower the affinity of the histone H2A-H2B dimer for the H3-H4 tetramer (45Eickbush T.H. Godfrey J.E. Elia M.C. Moudrianakis E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18972-18978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon these observations, it is reasonable to assume that H2A isoform substitution within the nucleosome may have functional and/or structural implications for chromatin nucleoprotein folding dynamics in vivo.Alterations of nucleosome core particle stability in solution can be monitored by changes in their conformation resulting from variations of the ionic strength within the range of salt concentrations where histones still remain bound to DNA (≤0.6 m NaCl) (32Ausió J.

Biol. 1985; 186: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Changes in the ionic environment of the nucleosome under these conditions are physiologically relevant as they can mimic, to a large extent, the changes in the ionic environment resulting from interactions with other protein complexes such as RNA polymerase or chromatin-remodeling complexes (3Aalfs J.D.

A dynamic equilibrium exists between the constitutive histone octamer and the nucleosomal DNA (32Ausió J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which besides the ionic strength is also dependent on many other physical parameters such as temperature and sample concentration.With this in mind, we decided to characterize the ionic strength dependence of the sedimentation coefficient of reconstituted H2A.1 and H2A.Z nucleosomes. The results of such analysis are shown in Fig. 3 A. They indicate that H2A.1 nucleosomes behave in a way that is almost indistinguishable from native nucleosome core particles. In contrast, although H2A.Z reconstituted nucleosome core particles exhibit a very similar sedimentation coefficient at low salt (≤0.1 m NaCl), this parameter displays a characteristic declining trend to a sedimentation coefficient value of 8.3 S at 600 mm NaCl. This drop in the S value is clearly indicative of a conformational change of the nucleosome core particle. Integral distribution analysis (38van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) shows that at 0.6 m NaCl, about 30–40% of the H2A.Z nucleosome core particles sediment at 8.3 S, 30% sediment at 5.4 S, and the remaining 30% sediment with intermediate values (see Fig. 3 B). This is in contrast to reconstituted H2A.1 nucleosomes, which under the same conditions exhibit a 9.4 S (70%), 5.4 S (15%), and 15% component of intermediate sedimenting particles (see Fig. 3 B) in what is almost indistinguishable from native nucleosome core particles (32Ausió J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Ausió J. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 5.4 S value corresponds to free nucleosomal DNA, which is reversibly dissociating from the nucleosome core particle (32Ausió J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). While the conformational change in the native and H2A.1 nucleosome core particles corresponding to 9.4 S at 0.6m NaCl is not yet clearly understood (52Bauer W.R. Hayes J.J. White J.H. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the value of 8.3 S observed with H2A.Z nucleosome core particles under the same conditions could be accounted for by partial H2A-H2B depletion. We have experimentally determined the sedimentation velocity coefficient of a nucleosome core particle deficient in one H2A-H2B dimer to be 8.6 S and that of the nucleosome core particle lacking both dimers to be 6.9 S, whereas the sedimentation coefficient of free 146-bp DNA was determined to be 5.2 S. 2J. Ausió, unpublished results. These values are in good agreement with similar experimental values reported by other groups (53Read C.M. Baldwin J.P. Crane-Robinson C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4435-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that the decrease in sedimentation observed in the case of the H2A.Z nucleosome core particle corresponds to the progressive loss of particle integrity (H2A.Z-H2B dissociation).Figure 3A, ionic strength-dependent variation of the sedimentation coefficient s20,w of H2A.Z-containing (●) and H2A.1-containing (○) reconstituted nucleosome core particles in comparison to native chicken erythrocyte nucleosome core particles (▵).

H2A.Z particles displayed an increased electrophoretic mobility compared with the unmodified patterns of its major H2A and native nucleosome counterparts following concentration (see Fig. 4). This observation corroborates the ultracentrifuge analysis and indicates that the H2A.Z nucleosome core particles have a reduced stability. The results are in very good agreement and support the crystallographic data that pointed to the existence of a “subtle destabilization of the interaction between the (H2A.Z-H2B) dimer and the (H3-H4)2 tetramer” in the crystal structure (21Suto R.K.

However, as the salt was titrated to 150 mm, the increase in the sedimentation coefficient of the 208-12 H2A.Z reconstituted complexes was consistently lower than that of the 208-12 complexes reconstituted with either H2A.1 octamers or native histone octamers (28Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods. 1998; 14: 333-342Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in H2A.1 or in native histone 208-12 complexes, a plateau was reached at 100–150 mm NaCl but at a (10%) lower average sedimentation coefficient value (34 S) (see Fig. 5 B). The increase in sedimentation coefficient of the 208-12 reconstituted complexes under these conditions reflects an increase in the folding of the complexes (31Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ausió J. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 54Hansen J.C. Ausió J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The very similar values of the sedimentation coefficients of H2A.1 and H2A.Z reconstituted 208-12 complexes at low salt was to be expected from the similarity of the sedimentation coefficient values of the nucleosome core particles under the same conditions (see Fig. 3 A), which suggest that both species of nucleosome core particles have a very similar conformation at this low salt. The reason for the inability of the 208-12 H2A.Z nucleosome arrays to fold to the same extent as the H2A.1 counterpart (as indicated by the lower sedimentation coefficient values observed in this later instance) is not clear. However, it could possibly be attributed to novel internucleosomal electrostatic interactions resulting from the H2A.Z-H2B dimer acidic patch, which was observed in the crystal structure of the H2A.Z nucleosome core particles (21Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that this does not preclude the formation of the 40–50 S higher folding structures (see Fig. 5 C), which are observed for 208-12-mers reconstituted with native core histones under physiological ionic strength conditions of 100–150 mm NaCl and which have also been well characterized in the presence of divalent ions such as magnesium (55Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 149-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).When the results described above are considered together, the data suggest that histone variant H2A.Z has a destabilizing effect on both intranucleosomal histone-histone interactions and at the internucleosomal level. Such destabilization is consistent with the physiological roles attributed to this variant, especially its participation in the regulation of transcription through its enrichment at promoter sites and redundancy with nucleosome remodeling complexes (17Santisteban M.S. Kalashnikova T. Smith M.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and in recruitment of RNA polymerase II (20Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Such instability of the nucleosome core particle complexes possibly resulting from the loss of H2A.Z-H2B dimers could facilitate the movement of the RNA polymerase complex through the nucleosomal DNA during transcriptional elongation (56van Holde K.E. Lohr D.E. Robert C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2837-2840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the future, it will be"

In this work, we identified several cis- and trans-elements that regulate expression of the three adult fast MyHC genes. Despite multiple DNA-binding motifs for well characterized muscle transcription factors upstream of all three fast MyHC genes, expression of MyoD/Myf-5, calcineurin, or NFAT3 had different effects on the three promoters. MyoD or Myf-5 overexpression preferentially activated the IIb promoter, whereas NFAT or activated calcineurin overexpression preferentially activated the IIa promoter. Calcineurin had a 50–100-fold stimulatory effect on the IIa promoter, and the known downstream effectors of calcineurin (myocyte enhancer factor-2 and NFAT) cannot completely account for this activation. Finally, we identified two elements critical for regulating MyHC-IId/x expression: a 130-base pair enhancer element and a CArG-like element that inhibited IId/x promoter activity in vitro.

Leinwand L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Of the eight isoforms, four are expressed in adult skeletal muscle: type I or slow MyHC and three fast isoforms, IIa, IId/x, and IIb. Greater than 90% of the MyHC in adult skeletal muscle is composed of these latter three gene products. The three adult fast MyHC isoforms are expressed in different types of skeletal muscle fibers that have different physiological characteristics, with IIA fibers being smaller, slower, and more oxidative; IIB fibers typically being the largest, fastest, and most glycolytic; and IID/X fibers falling between these extremes (2Talmadge R.J. Roy R.R. Edgerton V.R. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1993; 5: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A greater understanding of the mechanisms regulating MyHC gene transcription would provide tremendous insights into how these individual fiber types are established and maintained.Several axes of regulation exist for the members of the MyHC gene family, including tissue-specific (muscle versusnon-muscle), muscle type-specific (striated versus smooth muscle), fiber type-specific (fast versus slow), and fiber subtype-specific (fast IIa versus IId/x versusIIb). Many of these regulatory decisions are likely to be determined by different transcription factor-binding motifs within the upstream promoter regions of the different MyHC genes. For example, the adult fast MyHC-IIa, -IId/x, and -IIb genes undoubtedly share similar pathways for conferring muscle-specific and fast fiber-specific expression; but because they are expressed in distinct fiber subtypes (IIA, IID/X, and IIB), they must also have unique regulatory circuits as well. However, because there are no data directly comparing the sequence or physiological regulation of the three adult fast MyHC gene regulatory regions, nothing is known about the mechanisms that regulate the differential expression of these genes in distinct fast fiber subtypes.Of the three adult skeletal fast MyHC genes, only the promoter region of the mouse MyHC-IIb gene has been analyzed to date (11Diagana T.T.

In addition, mutation of the proximal AT-rich element AT-1 abolishes MEF-2 binding and greatly reduces promoter activity (12Lakich M.M. Diagana T.T. North D.L. Whalen R.G. J. Biol.

These studies have established that members of the MRF and MEF-2 families of myogenic transcription factors appear to be necessary for high-level, muscle-specific expression of the MyHC-IIb gene.More recently, progress has been made in elucidating the cis-regulatory sites that contribute to slow versus fast muscle gene expression. One pathway that appears to play a role in specifying slow fiber-specific gene expression is the calcineurin pathway (17Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4545-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates and allows nuclear transport of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activatedT-cells) transcription factors (17Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). NFAT can then bind to and activate the slow fiber-specific gene promoters (17Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). A recent report also implicated MEF-2 transcription factors in calcineurin-dependent, slow fiber-specific gene expression (19Wu, H., Naya, F. J., McKinsey, T. A., Mercer, B., Shelton, J. M., Chin, E. R., Simard, A. R., Michel, R. N. Bassel-Duby, R., Olson, E. N., and Williams, R. S. (2000)EMBO J. 1963–1973.Google Scholar). Other elements, including the CACC box (20Esser K. Nelson T.

However, the role of these elements has been largely unexplored with respect to the MyHC gene family.Thus, a considerable amount of research has been done on the role of various muscle-specific transcription factors and on the factors specifying slow versus fast fiber gene expression. To date, however, there have been no data on the regulation of fiber-specific gene expression within the IIA, IID, and IIB fast fiber subtypes. Although members of the MyHC family are the only genes to date that have distinct fast fiber isoforms, other muscle-specific genes show a quantitative difference in expression between different fast fiber subtypes (23Gunning P.

Understanding the factors regulating the differential expression of the three adult fast MyHC genes should provide insights into the subspecialization of different fiber types.The purpose of this work was to isolate and compare the activities of the upstream promoter regions of the three adult fast MyHC genes and to begin to dissect the factors responsible for their differential expression. We have isolated the upstream regulatory regions of the mouse MyHC-IIa, -IIb, and -IId/x genes and show that ∼1 kb is sufficient to direct high-level, muscle-specific expression in vitro. Moreover, the promoters showed differential levels of activity in vitro (IId > IIb > IIa), and the relative expression levels were identical to the expression pattern of the endogenous MyHC genes. We have identified several cis- and trans-regulatory elements with distinct effects on each of the adult fast MyHC promoter regions that may play a role in determining fiber-specific gene expression in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn the past 10 years, many studies have examined the cis-regulatory elements regulating expression of individual members of the MyHC gene family. The upstream promoter regions of the α- and β-cardiac MyHCs have been extensively characterized both in vitro and in vivo (3Gustafson T.A. Markham B.E. Bahl J.J. Morkin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In many cases, cis- and trans-regulatory elements have been identified that are necessary for muscle-specific and even fast versus slow fiber-specific gene expression. Although these studies have provided invaluable insights into the regulation of individual MyHC isoform genes, there have been no data to date that have directly compared either the promoter sequences or the activities of the different MyHC isoform promoters in the same physiological context. Such a comparison is necessary if the elements conferring the sophisticated in vivo expression patterns of the adult fast MyHC genes are to be identified.In this study, we isolated and sequenced the upstream promoter regions of the mouse MyHC-IIa and MyHC-IId/x genes and, along with the previously characterized mouse MyHC-IIb gene (14Takeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16957-16967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have provided the first data directly comparing the sequences and activities of these promoter regions in vitro. These data provide the initial basis for determining the regulatory circuits conferring differential expression of these three genes in distinct muscle fiber types and conferring responsiveness to different physiological stimuli such as altered muscle activation and loading in vivo. As a prelude to studying these complex in vivo conditions, we have first attempted 1) to determine the putative cis-regulatory elements both common to and distinct for each adult skeletal fast MyHC gene; 2) to examine the expression pattern of the three adult fast MyHC promoters in muscle and non-muscle cell types in vitro; and 3) to begin to identify specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements that may direct differential expression of the three adult fast MyHC genes.Comparison of the activities of ∼1 kb of each of the MyHC promoters in myoblasts, myotubes, and non-muscle cell lines revealed that 1) this length of promoter region was sufficient to confer muscle-specific expression; 2) the activities of all three promoters were much greater in differentiated C2C12 myotubes than in myoblasts (Fig. 2 A); and 3) differential expression of the three adult skeletal muscle promoters was observed in C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 2 A) in the order IId/x > IIb > IIa, which correlates with the endogenous MyHC isoform expression pattern in these cells (Fig.2 C). Together, these observations support the contention that ∼1 kb of upstream promoter contains the regulatory element(s) sufficient to confer muscle-specific, differentiation-sensitive, and differential expression of the three adult skeletal fast MyHC genes in vitro.Several elements are conserved in the proximal promoter regions of the three adult fast MyHC upstream promoter sequences. One in particular is the AT-rich motif at approximately −200 bp in all three MyHC upstream promoter sequences that shares 20 of 20 nucleotides among all three fast MyHC genes, but is not found in other members of the MyHC gene family. It is attractive to speculate that it may be involved in conferring fast fiber-specific expression of the MyHC genes. Deletion of this 20-bp element in the context of the 1-kb promoters resulted in a significant and equivalent decrease in expression of all three fast MyHC promoters in vitro (Fig. 3), consistent with the hypothesis that this element is necessary for high-level expression of all three adult fast promoters in vitro. This element reportedly binds to members of the MEF-2 family of transcription factors (12Lakich M.M. Diagana T.T. North D.L. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15217-15226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MEF-2C resulted in an identical 2-fold increase in promoter activity for all three adult fast MyHC constructs when cotransfected into L-cells (Fig. 7 A). Binding of MEF-2 to this element may therefore be critical to the specification of fast fiber-specific expression of all three MyHC genes. However, searches of several fast muscle promoter regions, including muscle creatine kinase, fast troponin C, and myosin light chain-1/3f, failed to find any sequences matching this 20-bp sequence from the MyHC genes (data not shown); so even if this AT-rich region is responsible for activating fast fiber-specific MyHC gene expression, other fast fiber-specific genes do not appear to share this same pathway.Another element that is somewhat conserved is the CArG-like element at approximately −100 bp in all three adult fast MyHC promoters (Fig. 1). For IIb, this sequence is a perfect consensus for binding of SRF, which has previously been implicated in striated muscle-specific gene expression (7Knotts S. Rindt H. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31275-31282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that deletion of this element would have a preferential effect on IIb promoter activity compared with IIa or IId/x promoter activity. Surprisingly, the IIb promoter was the least affected by deletion of this element; its activity was essentially unchanged, whereas the activity of the IIa promoter was decreased by 5-fold, and that of the IId/x promoter was increased by 6-fold (Fig. 4). Both the IIa and IId/x promoters contain base pair substitutions that should greatly reduce or totally eliminate SRF binding (32Leung S. Miyamoto N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Miwa T. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2803-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Rivera V.M.

Together, these data suggest that SRF is probably not involved in this process and suggest that some other transcription factor is binding in this region and having differential effects on MyHC gene expression. The differential effect on IIa versusIId/x expression suggests that this element and its cognate binding protein may be involved in suppressing MyHC-IId/x expression in IIA fibers. The homology among the three adult fast MyHC promoters extends both upstream and downstream of the core CArG-like element. A recent study elegantly demonstrated that the flanking “arms” of the CArG/serum response element are critical for conferring the specific effects of this element (38Naya F.J. Wu C. Richardson J.A. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 2045-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since these flanking regions were also deleted in this construct, it is possible that they play a role in the function of this element.Approximately 1 kb of upstream promoter was also sufficient to produce differential responses to MRFs and calcineurin/NFAT. Cotransfection with a MyoD or Myf-5 overexpression construct significantly increased MyHC-IIb promoter activity, but not IIa or IId/x promoter activity (Fig. 5). MyoD cotransfection increased IIb promoter activity such that it was significantly greater than IIa or IId promoter activity (TableI). This preferential effect on the IIb promoter was particularly surprising given that sequence analysis of the IId/x promoter revealed seven potential E-boxes, compared with two for the IIa promoter and two for the IIb promoter. Thus, the absolute number of potential MyoD-binding sites per se does not affect the sensitivity of these promoters to the MRF family members. Conversely, cotransfection with an activated form of calcineurin resulted in an increase in the activities of all three fast MyHC promoters, but the effect was most dramatic on the IIa promoter, with a 100-fold activation (Fig. 6). Since type IIA fibers typically are closer to slow type I fibers in their contractile and biochemical properties, it is possible that the MyHC-IIa gene is regulated more similarly to a slow fiber-specific gene. Our results also demonstrate a prominent role for the MEF-2- and proximal NFAT-binding sites in conferring calcineurin responsiveness of the MyHC-IIa promoter, although even with both of these elements removed/mutated, the IIa promoter still retained substantial sensitivity to calcineurin overexpression. Thus, the MEF-2- and NFAT-binding sites cannot completely account for the activation of IIa promoter activity by calcineurin. Regarding the differential responsiveness of the three adult fast MyHC promoters to MRF and calcineurin signaling, we have also observed a preferential effect of these factors on endogenous MyHC isoform expression such that MyoD overexpression resulted in a preferential increase in MyHC-IIb protein expression, whereas calcineurin overexpression resulted in a preferential increase in MyHC-IIa protein expression. 2D. L. Allen and L. A. Leinwand, unpublished observations. Together, these data suggest that the balance between these two signaling pathways may play a role in the fiber-specific expression of the three adult fast MyHC genes.Deletions to between −600 and −300 bp resulted in a significant decrease in the differential expression pattern of the three adult skeletal fast MyHC promoters in vitro. These data support the conclusion that elements between −600 and −300 bp are responsible for conferring high-level and differential expression in muscle cells. Sequence analysis revealed that this deletion would eliminate two NFAT sites and two E-boxes in the IIa promoter, two NFAT sites in the IIb promoter, and four NFAT sites and seven E-boxes in the IId/x promoter. Given the differential sensitivity of the three adult fast promoters to members of these two transcription factor families, it is possible that the loss of these sites was responsible for the loss of differential expression, although it is possible that as yet unidentified regulatory pathways are also important.Moreover, 5′-deletions in the IId/x promoter suggested that the region between −600 and −450 bp is necessary for the high-level activity of this promoter in vitro (Fig. 9). This region corresponds almost exactly with one that is highly conserved between the mouse and human IId/x promoters (data not shown). An internal deletion of this 130-bp region resulted in a 5-fold decrease in IId/x promoter activity compared with the full-length construct (Fig. 10), in agreement with the 5′-deletion data above. Moreover, addition of this 130-bp region of the IId/x promoter to the 300-bp IIb promoter resulted in a significant increase in promoter activity. Together, these data demonstrate that this 130-bp region is both necessary and sufficient to confer high-level expression in vitro. Deletion of any 30 bp within this region resulted in a decrease in IId/x promoter activity, but to different extents. Deletion 30-1 or 30-3 resulted in a 5-fold decrease in IId/x promoter activity, similar to that obtained by deletion of the entire 130-bp region, whereas deletion 30-2 decreased IId/x promoter activity by only 50% (Fig. 10). However, deletion of the final 30 bp of this region resulted in a massive decrease in IId/x promoter activity, reducing activity by ∼100-fold (Fig. 10). Together, these data suggest that, whereas all parts of this 130-bp element appear to be necessary for high-level IId/x promoter activity, this final 30-bp element, which we have termed a Δ-box for its effect on IId/x activity, is absolutely critical. Examination of the sequence of this region revealed no binding sites for currently identified muscle-specific transcription factors; however, TRANSFAC analysis (37Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) identified possible binding sites for members of the SOX and ternary complex factor family of transcription factors. These factors are known to play roles in diverse developmental processes (40Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), but have not been directly implicated in muscle-specific gene expression. Alternatively, it is possible that other, as yet unidentified transcription factors are involved in this process. We are currently undertaking studies to identify the factor(s) binding to this region. The sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MyHC)1 gene family consists of eight known isoforms, each encoded by separate genes exhibiting a complex pattern of spatial and temporal regulation (1Weiss A. Leinwand L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Of the eight isoforms, four are expressed in adult skeletal muscle: type I or slow MyHC and three fast isoforms, IIa, IId/x, and IIb. Greater than 90% of the MyHC in adult skeletal muscle is composed of these latter three gene products. The three adult fast MyHC isoforms are expressed in different types of skeletal muscle fibers that have different physiological characteristics, with IIA fibers being smaller, slower, and more oxidative; IIB fibers typically being the largest, fastest, and most glycolytic; and IID/X fibers falling between these extremes (2Talmadge R.J. Roy R.R. Edgerton V.R. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1993; 5: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A greater understanding of the mechanisms regulating MyHC gene transcription would provide tremendous insights into how these individual fiber types are established and maintained. Several axes of regulation exist for the members of the MyHC gene family, including tissue-specific (muscle versusnon-muscle), muscle type-specific (striated versus smooth muscle), fiber type-specific (fast versus slow), and fiber subtype-specific (fast IIa versus IId/x versusIIb). Many of these regulatory decisions are likely to be determined by different transcription factor-binding motifs within the upstream promoter regions of the different MyHC genes. For example, the adult fast MyHC-IIa, -IId/x, and -IIb genes undoubtedly share similar pathways for conferring muscle-specific and fast fiber-specific expression; but because they are expressed in distinct fiber subtypes (IIA, IID/X, and IIB), they must also have unique regulatory circuits as well. However, because there are no data directly comparing the sequence or physiological regulation of the three adult fast MyHC gene regulatory regions, nothing is known about the mechanisms that regulate the differential expression of these genes in distinct fast fiber subtypes. Of the three adult skeletal fast MyHC genes, only the promoter region of the mouse MyHC-IIb gene has been analyzed to date (11Diagana T.T. North D.L. Jabet C. Fiszman M.Y. Takeda S. Whalen R.G. J.

Because the transcription factor NFκB blocks cell death, including neuronal apoptosis, we have investigated the ability of PEDF to exert its effects via NFκB activation. PEDF induced an increased phosphorylation of IκBα, decreased levels of IκB proteins, and translocation of p65 (RelA) to the nucleus followed by a time-dependent increase of NFκB-DNA binding activity in both immature and mature neurons. The protective effects of PEDF against both induced apoptosis and glutamate toxicity were blocked by the addition of either the IκB kinase inhibitor BAY 11-7082, which inhibits the phosphorylation of IκB, orN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, which blocks proteosome degradation of IκB, demonstrating that NFκB is required for the neuroprotective effects of PEDF. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic genes for Bcl-2, Bcl-x, and manganese superoxide dismutase was observed in PEDF-treated immature but not mature neurons. Up-regulation of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA was long-lasting in mature neurons.

These observations suggest that the responses of CGCs to PEDF may vary as neural differentiation proceeds, possibly because of changes in signal transduction pathways or gene expression as a function of cell maturity. The signal transduction pathways that mediate the cell survival-promoting actions of neurotrophic factors are being worked out, and in many cases activation of transcription factors is involved.

In this study, we have examined the potential role of NFκB in the neuroprotective effects of PEDF. BAY 11-7082 andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) were obtained from Calbiochem. All culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies. Polyclonal antibodies against p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50, p52, IκBα, and IκBβ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA. An antibody against phospho-IκBα was from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly MA. The PEDF used in this study was prepared as previously described (25Becerra S.P. Palmer I. Kumar A. Steele F. Shiloach J. Notario V. Chader G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23148-23156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a truncated recombinant expression construct (Asp-44–Pro-418) from the human PEDF cDNA was expressed inEscherichia coli, purified from the bacterial inclusion bodies, stored, and added in urea buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 4 m urea). An equivalent volume of urea buffer was added to all control/untreated samples. The addition of a urea extract of E. coli not transfected with the PEDF gene had no activity (3Taniwaki T. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Sugita Y. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Analysis of PEDF for content of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide demonstrated undetectable levels (<0.05 endotoxin units/ml at the lowest dilution of PEDF used in assays) using the Limulus amebocyte lysate method (Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA). CGCs were prepared from 8-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) as previously described (3Taniwaki T. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) using a protocol approved by the NINDS/NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. Cells were plated in serum-containing medium (Eagle's basal medium with 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml gentamycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) in poly-l-lysine-coated 10-cm dishes, 8-well chamber slides, or 96-well plates at 3.5 × 105 cells/cm2and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Cytosine arabinoside was added on DIV1 at a final concentration of 10 μm. On DIV7, the cerebellar granule cell cultures consisted of >98% neurons (stained with anti-neuron specific enolase antibody), <1% astrocytes (stained with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody), and <1% microglia (stained with anti-OX42 antibody) (3Taniwaki T. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts for the EMSAs were prepared by a mini-extraction protocol (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed with a commercial kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two or 5 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with a32P-labeled DNA sequence containing the AP-1, CRE, or NFκB binding site. The DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound oligonucleotide by electrophoresis through native 6% polyacrylamide gels using 25 mm Tris base, 25 mm borate, 0.5 mm EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Competition experiments were performed by co-incubation with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in the DNA-protein binding reaction. For supershift analysis, 2 μl of antibody were preincubated with nuclear proteins for 30 min at 4 °C before the binding reaction. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes used in EMSAs were as follows (only the sense strand is indicated): NFκB, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′; CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein), 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′; OCT-1, 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′. After experimental treatments, CGCs were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed by incubating in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were then incubated in permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice. To block the nonspecific antibody binding, cells were incubated in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 h. Next, cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-p65 antibody at a dilution of 1:200 at 4 °C overnight followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope with a 100× objective (488-nm excitation and 510-nm emission). The cells were scraped and resuspended in 0.75 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm 4-nitrophenylphosphate, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1 mmbenzamidine, 75 μl of protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation for 20 min on ice, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein (10 μg) from cell lysates was boiled in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed under reducing conditions in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific binding was inhibited by incubation in 20 mmTris, pH 7.4-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 6% nonfat dried milk for 2 h. Primary antibodies against IκBα, IκBβ, phospho-IκBα, and p65 were diluted 1:1000, 1:1000, 1:2000,and 1:1000 in TBST containing 5% milk and exposed to membranes overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the blots were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:10,000. Immunoreactive IκBα and IκBβ were detected with the diaminobenzidine staining kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and phospho-IκBα and p65 were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescent protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay using thein situ cell death detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, CGCs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, and then cells were incubated in permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice. The cells were then incubated with TUNEL reaction medium at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, cells were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) for 5 min. DNA fragmentation was evaluated using a laser confocal microscope. TUNEL-positive cells were counted in 2–6 randomly selected fields from two different chambers. 600–1200 cells were scored for each treatment. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was calculated as the number of TUNEL-positive cells divided by the total number of cells (propidium iodide-stained cells). Cell survival was measured with the MTS cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) using cells in 96-well plates. Briefly, the CGCs were incubated in a CO2 incubator for 2 h with MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H- tetrazolium, inner salt) and phenazine methosulfate (final concentrations, 333 μg/ml MTS and 25 μm phenazine methosulfate). LDH, a stable cytoplasmic enzyme present in all cells, is rapidly released into the cell culture medium after damage to the plasma membrane. To measure LDH activity released from CGCs, we used a commercially available cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For measurement of released LDH, culture medium was collected and centrifuged to remove contaminating cells and cellular debris. To assay total LDH activity, 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100 were then added to the wells, and the cells were incubated for 30 min. The percentage of LDH release was calculated as LDH in the culture medium divided by total LDH (cellular plus medium LDH). For the actual assay, 100 μl of each sample were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate, 100 μl of LDH assay reagent were added to each well and incubated for up to 30 min at room temperature, and the absorbance of samples was measured at 490 nm. Total RNA was extracted from CGCs according to the manufacture's instructions for TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies). Two μg of total RNA were converted to first strand cDNA using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR analysis. The PCR amplification mixture, in a final volume of 25 μl, consisted of 1× TaqDNA polymerase buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 μm each specific primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cycle number was chosen such that amplification of the products was in the linear range with respect to the amount of input cDNA. Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 94 °C for denaturation, 30 s at 60 °C for annealing, and 60 s at 72 °C for extension. The PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide after agarose gel electrophoresis and photographed using Polaroid film type 667. Cyclophilin was used as the non-changing control RNA. The actual sequences of specific primers are as follows: nerve growth factor (NGF) sense, 5′-CCAAGGGAGCAGCTTTCTATCCTGG-3′, and antisense 5′-GGCAGTGTCAAGGGAATGCTGAAGT-3′; brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) sense, 5′-AGCCTCCTCTGCTCTTTCTGCTGGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTTTTGTCTATGCCCCTGCAGCCTT-3′; glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) sense, 5′-ATGAAGTTATGGGATGTCGTGGCTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTAAGAAAGCATTCCGCTAAACGGT-3′; Bcl-2, sense, 5′-CTCGTCGCTACCGTCGTGACTTCG-3′, antisense, 5′-CAGATGCCGGTTCAGGTACTCAGTC-3′; Bcl-x sense, 5′-AGGCTGGCGATGAGTTTGAACTGCG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGCTCTAGGTGGTCATTCAGGTAGG-3′; Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) sense, 5′-GACCTGCCTTACGACTATGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GACCTTGCTCCTTATTGAAGC-3′; and cyclophilin sense, 5′-TGGACCAAACACAAATGGTT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGATCTTCTTGCTGGTCTT-3′. For statistical analysis, data were compared by 1-way analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least square difference. To determine whether PEDF affects NFκB transcriptional factor activity, the level of NFκB binding to DNA was analyzed using EMSA in CGCs treated with or without PEDF. PEDF was added at 7 nm, a concentration previously reported to prevent death of CGCs after exposure to low K+/serum-free medium or glutamate (4Taniwaki T. Hirashima N. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Etcheberrigaray R. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Araki T. Taniwaki T. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two NFκB binding bands were detected using nuclear extracts derived from CGCs at DIV2, whereas three bands were detected in cells at DIV8 (Fig.1, A and B). Time course studies showed that NFκB binding activity increased within 1 h in immature CGCs (DIV2), with a maximal effect observed 2 h after PEDF treatment (Fig. 1 A). A similar rapid induction was observed in mature CGCs (DIV8), but this induction was sustained for at least 6 h after PEDF treatment (Fig. 1 B). Induction of NFκB binding activity was observed over a concentration range of 0.5–10 nm PEDF (Fig. 1 C). The addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled NFκB oligonucleotide, but not AP-1, CRE, or OCT-1 oligonucleotides, displaced the binding (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Characterization of the NFκB binding activity in nuclear extracts of cerebellar granule neurons. A, specific inhibition of DNA-protein complex formation by NFκB sequence motif. CGCs (DIV8) were treated with PEDF (7 nm) for 4 h, after which nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NFκB DNA-protein complex formation in the absence or presence of unlabeled oligonucleotides (100-fold molar excess) containing the NFκB, AP-1, CRE, or OCT-1 consensus sequences as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B and C, identification of NFκB-binding protein in nuclei of CGCs treated with PEDF. CGCs at DIV2 (B) and DIV8 (C) were treated with PEDF (7 nm) for 2 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated for 1 h with antibodies to the indicated NFκB/Rel proteins. Binding to the NFκB probe was then assessed by EMSA. Thearrowheads indicate PEDF-induced NFκB DNA-protein complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To elucidate the nature of the NFκB complex activated by PEDF, we performed antibody supershift analysis using nuclear extracts from both immature and mature neurons. As shown in Figs. 2,B and C, the addition of p50 antibody resulted in an almost complete loss of both the lower and upper bands of the NFκB complex, whereas antibody to p65 (RelA) reduced the amount of the upper complex without affecting the lower one. In contrast, antibodies against RelB, cRel, or p-52 did not cross-react with the NFκB-DNA complex. These analyses suggest that the PEDF-treated neurons contain nuclear NFκB·Rel complexes composed predominantly of p50/p65 heterodimer and p50/p50 homodimer. Interestingly, the p65/p50 heterodimer was markedly increased in mature neurons (Fig.2 C) relative to immature neurons (Fig. 2 B). NFκB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by a member of the IκB family of inhibitory proteins. When cells are exposed to activators of NFκB, these IκB proteins undergo sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, thereby allowing the translocation of dimeric complexes of NFκB to the nucleus. To examine whether activation of NFκB by PEDF requires IκB degradation by proteosomes, we analyzed the expression level of IκB proteins in PEDF-treated neurons using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, PEDF caused a time-dependent decrease in both IκBα and IκBβ protein levels. Furthermore, rapid phosphorylation of IκBα protein was observed in PEDF-treated CGCs (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, p65 levels in whole cell lysates of PEDF-treated cells were not changed over a 6-h period (Fig. 3 C). To provide further evidence that IκB phosphorylation was required and that proteosomes were involved in PEDF-induced NFκB activation, CGCs were treated with 10 μm BAY 11-7082, which inhibits IκB kinase activity and subsequently inhibits the nuclear translocation of NFκB (28Pierce J.W. Schoenleber R. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S.A. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), or with 10 μm proteosome inhibitor ALLN, which interferes with IκB proteolysis (29Milligan S.A. Owens M.W. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Schow S.R. Joly A. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 175: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 D, pretreatment with either BAY-11-7082 or ALLN inhibited the ability of PEDF to activate NFκB. These results suggest that PEDF-induced NFκB activation requires IκB phosphorylation and degradation via the proteosomes. To further demonstrate activation of NFκB protein, immunohistochemistry was used to show nuclear translocation (Fig.3 E). Untreated or PEDF-treated CGCs were fixed and stained with antibody to p65. Under basal conditions, no nuclear staining for p65 was observed. However, 2 h after PEDF exposure, neuronal nuclei were labeled with the p65 antibody. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis revealed that PEDF induces expression in both immature and mature neurons of IκBα mRNA (Fig. 6), which has been shown to be regulated by NFκB (31Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). CGCs undergo apoptosis when they are switched from medium containing serum and 25 mm KCl to serum-free medium containing 5 mm KCl (32D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 33Yan G.M. Ni B. Weller M. Wood K.A. Paul S.M.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although glutamate toxicity can cause both apoptotic and necrotic neuronal death (35Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar) depending on the cell type, we have found that under the conditions used in this paper to induce glutamate-mediated death, the death occurs by a necrotic process. Because PEDF can protect CGCs against both K+/serum deprivation (5Araki T. Taniwaki T. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and glutamate toxicity (4Taniwaki T. Hirashima N. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Etcheberrigaray R. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether PEDF-induced NFκB activity is required for both of these neuroprotective effects of PEDF. We therefore tested the effect of IκB kinase and proteosome inhibitors on low K+/serum-free-induced apoptosis and on glutamate toxicity. When DIV2 cells were switched to serum-free medium containing 5 mm K+, ∼50% of the cells were TUNEL-positive 6 h later, indicative of apoptotic death (Fig.4, A and B). Neuronal death caused by low potassium was almost completely prevented by a 20-h preincubation with 7 nm PEDF. The neuroprotective effect of PEDF was completely blocked by the addition of either ALLN (10 μm) or BAY 11-7082 (10 μm) 30 min before the addition of PEDF (Fig. 4, A and B). As already reported (5Araki T. Taniwaki T. Becerra S.P. Chader G.J. Schwartz J.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), PEDF did not protect CGCs against induced apoptosis at DIV8 (data not shown). Neither ALLN nor BAY 11-7082 affected CGC survival when added alone. Similar results were obtained when DIV8 CGCs were exposed to 100 μm glutamate for 1 h (Fig.5). Results from both the MTS assay (Fig.5 A) and the LDH release assay (Fig. 5 B) revealed that the neuroprotective effect of PEDF against glutamate toxicity was also completely blocked by the IκB kinase and proteosome inhibitors, whereas the inhibitors had no effect when added alone. These results suggest that PEDF-induced NFκB activity is directly involved in its neuroprotective effects against both induced apoptosis and glutamate toxicity. NFκB plays important roles in regulating the expression of various genes in both the nervous system and the immune system (36Mattson M.P. Culmsee C., Yu, Z. Camandola S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, little is known about NFκB-regulated genes that are associated with anti-apoptotic effects in the nervous system.

Specificity and relative potency of the motif interactions were evaluated by ligand dissociation rate and the stability of chimeras of transcriptional intermediary factor 2 with full-length and truncated androgen or glucocorticoid receptor.

Expression of the L XXLL motifs as a fusion protein with the glucocorticoid receptor resulted in loss of agonist-induced receptor destabilization and increased half-time of ligand dissociation. The NH2- and COOH-terminal interaction inhibited binding and activation by transcriptional intermediary factor 2.

The AR shares with other steroid receptors an overall structural arrangement that includes a COOH-terminal ligand binding domain, central DNA binding region, and a less well conserved NH2-terminal region (Fig. 1). Within these domains are two major transactivation regions, activation function 1 in the NH2-terminal region and activation function 2 (AF2) in the ligand binding domain. The NH2-terminal activation function 1 region, although not well defined, requires androgen binding for transcriptional activity and appears to be critical for AR-mediated gene activation. The AF2 region in the ligand binding domain forms a putative hydrophobic binding site for the L XXLL motifs of p160 coactivators (1Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 10McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar), which are associated with histone acetyltransferase activity and can recruit CREB-binding protein, pCAF, and other coactivators required for chromatin modification (11Chen H.

Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar).The contribution of the AF2 region to AR-mediated transcriptional activity is unclear. Androgen-dependent transcriptional activity of an AR DNA and ligand binding domain fragment (AR-(507–919)) was only observed in cells that overexpressed TIF2 or SRC1 (12He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), which suggests that the AR AF2 inefficiently recruits p160 coactivators. We also showed recently that AF2 in the AR ligand binding domain can function in addition as a binding site for the AR NH2-terminal region. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the androgen-induced interaction between the AR NH2- and COOH-terminal (N/C) domains is mediated by two L XXLL-related sequences in the AR NH2-terminal region (see Fig. 1). These are FQNLF (F XXLF motif) at residues 23–27 and WHTLF (W XXLF motif) at residues 433–437 (13He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the presence of androgen, the F XXLF motif interacts with the AR AF2 in the ligand binding domain, whereas interaction of the W XXLF motif remains to be characterized (12He B. Kemppainen J.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the N/C interaction is selectively induced by ligands that have AR agonist activity in vivo, such as the high affinity, biologically active androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and the lower affinity anabolic steroids. In striking contrast, the N/C interaction is not induced by ligands that bind the AR and cause its nuclear transport but fail to induce AR-mediated gene activation in vivo (14Kemppainen J.A. Langley E. Wong C.I. Bobseine K. Kelce W.R. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 440-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The N/C interaction therefore appears to be critical for AR function in vivo as further evidenced by the association of the androgen insensitivity syndrome with single amino acid mutations that disrupt the N/C interaction (12He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 15Langley E. Kemppainen J.A.

We investigated to what extent the AR AF2 recruits p160 coactivators in the presence and absence of the N/C interaction in wild-type and mutant AR. Second, we took advantage of the observation that the agonist-induced N/C interaction (16Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), which was also reported for estrogen receptor α (17Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the progesterone receptor (18Tetel M.J. Giangrande P.H. Leonhardt S.A. McDonnell D.P.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeras were created in which the three L XXLL motif region of TIF-2 was fused to the NH2-terminal region of AR and GR. TIF-2 was shown previously to increase the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors through interaction of its L XXLL motifs with the AF2 region of nuclear receptors (3Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S.

The effects of an imposed N/C interaction in the TIF2(L XXLL)3glucocorticoid receptor chimeras were determined by measuring rates of ligand dissociation and protein degradation. The results indicate that two functional effects of the N/C interaction are agonist-induced receptor stabilization and inhibition of p160 coactivator recruitment.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence indicate that the agonist-induced N/C interaction between the L XXLL-like sequences23FQNLF27 and433WHTLF437 in the AR NH2-terminal region and the AF2 region in the AR ligand binding domain is specific for AR and required for functional activity. The N/C interaction is critical to AR function, because AF2 mutations that disrupt the N/C interaction without affecting the equilibrium ligand binding affinity cause the androgen insensitivity syndrome, whereas mutations that disrupt p160 coactivator binding without affecting the N/C interaction have wild-type activity (12He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 15Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The N/C interaction slows ligand dissociation and increases AR stability yet interferes with p160 coactivator recruitment. Like the L XXLL motifs of p160 coactivators (1Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 5Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), the AR F XXLF motif forms an amphipathic α-helix that interfaces within the hydrophobic groove of AF2.Results of experiments with chimeric receptors indicate the AR N/C interaction has greater specificity and potency compared with the interaction of AF2 with the L XXLL motifs of p160 coactivators. In previous studies, AR/GR chimeras only slightly increased ligand dissociation half-times (19Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the F XXLF motif interacts less well with the GR AF2 than this region interacts with the TIF2-derived L XXLL motifs. In unpublished studies, 2B. He and E. M. Wilson, unpublished material.glutathione S-transferase affinity matrix assays showed that TIF2 L XXLL motif-containing fragments interact with the estrogen receptor α ligand binding domain, whereas the AR F XXLF fragment does not.The AR AF2 region only weakly recruits p160 coactivators compared with the AF2 region of the progesterone or glucocorticoid receptor. This relatively weak interaction is further hindered by the N/C interaction. The hinge region of AR (residues 628–646) was reported to contribute to the low transcriptional activity of AR AF2 (34Wang Q. Lu J.H. Yong E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7493-7499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However in our unpublished studies,2 deletion of hinge residues 624–647 only minimally increased AR AF2 transcriptional activity of a GAL4 fusion protein with the AR ligand binding domain expressed in HeLa cells and resulted in a similar increase in the N/C interaction. The lower transcriptional activity of the AR AF2 region relative to other nuclear receptors more likely results from sequence divergence-induced structural differences and by the N/C interaction.One functional consequence of the agonist-induced AR N/C interaction may be to present a novel surface to attract AR-specific coactivators. A LIM domain, heart-specific protein FHL2 (35Chan K.K. Tsui S.K.W. Lee S.M.Y. Luk S.C.W. Liew C.C. Fung K.P. Waye M.M.Y. Lee C.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) is a reported AR coactivator that interacts with full-length AR but not with the NH2- or COOH-terminal region (36Müller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schüle R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), suggesting it recognizes an N/C interaction-induced conformation. The AR N/C interaction may contribute to the recognition of weaker androgen response elements whose regulation is androgen-specific (37Scheller A. Hughes E. Golden K.L. Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24216-24222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Most steroid receptors undergo ligand-induced down-regulation resulting from ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by the proteosome. Rates of receptor degradation have been correlated with activation potency (38Molinari E. Gilman M. Nastesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and activation domains and degradation signals can overlap (39Salghetti S.E. Muratani M. Wijnen H. Futcher B. Tansey W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Proteosome-mediated degradation of estrogen receptor α (29Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was linked with coactivator recruitment and transcriptional potency. Mutations in the estrogen receptor α AF2 region at residues critical for coactivator recruitment stabilized the receptor (41Lonard D.M. Nawaz Z. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 939-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that p160 coactivator interaction with ligand-bound receptors is required for receptor degradation. The thyroid hormone receptor is also rapidly degraded by the proteosome (30Dace A. Zhao L. Park K.S. Furuno T. Takamura N. Nakanishi M. West B.L. Hanover J.A. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but ligand-dependent degradation of retinoid X receptor did not require transcriptional activity or interaction with p160 coactivators (42Osburn D.L. Shao G. Seidel H.M. Schulman I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In our unpublished studies2 AR degradation is mediated by the proteosome; however, in contrast to most nuclear receptors, AR and the vitamin D receptors (43Arbour N.C. Prahl J.M. DeLuca H.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) undergo agonist-induced stabilization. For the vitamin D receptor, inhibition of ubiquitin-proteosome-mediated degradation amplified the transcriptional response (43Arbour N.C. Prahl J.M. DeLuca H.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Li X.Y. Boudjelal M. Xiao J.H. Peng Z.H. Asuru A. Kang S. Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 833-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For AR, it remains to be established whether in vivo transcriptional activity at certain androgen response elements requires the N/C interaction or the resulting agonist-induced increase in AR stability. The 5-fold reduced dissociation half-time of bound dexamethasone and reversal of the dexamethasone-induced decrease in GR levels in the TIF2-GR chimeras dramatically demonstrated the influence of the N/C interaction on receptor stabilization. This artificial N/C interaction in GR resulted in ligand dissociation and stability properties similar to those of wild-type AR.Dose-response transcription assays where TIF2 is transiently overexpressed as shown here indicate that the AR N/C interaction blocks AF2 recruitment of p160 coactivators. Transcriptional inhibition is predicted for other p160 coactivators such as SRC1 that interact with AF2 through L XXLL motifs. It is not known, however, to what extent inhibition of p160 coactivator recruitment by the N/C interaction limits the activity of these coactivators in vivo. Neither is it known how the interaction of other coactivators such as p300/CREB-binding protein or ARA70 with the AR is affected by the N/C interaction. Previous studies indicated that mutation of lysine 720 reduced the interaction of p160 coactivators with AF2, but this mutant AR retained full transcriptional activity (12He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The corresponding lysine in mouse estrogen receptor α (lysine 366) was required for p160 coactivator recruitment and estrogen receptor α transcriptional activity (46Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).p160 coactivator overexpression in transient transfection experiments (12He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and possibly in vivo in some disease states (47Gregory C.W. He B. Johnson R.T. Ford O.H. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4315-4319PubMed Google Scholar) may increase steroid receptor transcriptional activity. This was shown for AR where coactivation by TIF2 was mediated by the AR NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions (12He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 48Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However these types of studies do not address whether p160 coactivators increase AR activation when coactivators are present at normal physiological levels. We showed recently that TIF2 and SRC1 are almost undetectable in human benign hyperplastic prostatic tissue compared with greatly increased levels in recurrent prostate cancer (47Gregory C.W. He B. Johnson R.T. Ford O.H. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4315-4319PubMed Google Scholar). In recurrent prostate cancer, overexpression of p160 coactivators may effectively compete for the N/C interaction through their interaction with the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains.N/C interdomain interactions have been reported for other steroid and nuclear receptors; however, the potency and functional consequences differ. Intracellular phosphorylation of the A/B NH2-terminal domain of PPAR-γ reduced ligand binding affinity (49Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Interactions between the hinge-amino-terminal regions of the progesterone receptor contributed to dimerization and increased activation (50Tetel M.J. Jung S. Carbajo P. Ladtkow T. Skafar D.F. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1114-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas GR seems to lack an N/C interaction based on ligand dissociation (19Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and direct interaction assays (51Spanjaard R.A. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 12-16PubMed Google Scholar). Functional synergism between the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains was also reported (52McInerney E.M. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10069-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 53Tasset D. Tora L. Fromental C. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For estrogen receptor α and β, agonist-induced synergism was mediated by p300/CREB-binding protein and TIF2 binding to the NH2-terminal region (54Kobayashi Y. Kitamoto T. Masuhiro Y. Watanabe M. Kase T. Metzger D. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15645-15651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 55Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, in unpublished studies2 we could not demonstrate direct NH2- and COOH-terminal domain interactions for estrogen receptor α in glutathione S-transferase affinity matrix studies. CREB-binding protein and SRC1a were reported to enhance the AR N/C interaction through an indirect mechanism where coactivators act as adapters between activation function 1 and AF2 (56Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The glutamine-rich region of SRC1e at residues 1053–1123 interacted with AR NH2-terminal residues 360–494, suggesting SRC1 acts as a bridging molecule to mediate the N/C interaction (33Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). p160 coactivators also reportedly increased the AR N/C interaction, suggesting the N/C interaction is indirect. However, the identification of F XXLF and W XXLF motifs in the AR NH2-terminal region (13He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) that bind the AF2 region of the ligand binding domain (12He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) provides strong evidence that the AR N/C interaction is direct. Moreover, transcriptional assays indicate that the agonist-induced N/C interaction interferes with the recruitment of p160 coactivators.The AR F XXLF-AF2 N/C interaction is specific for the biologically active androgens testosterone and DHT and for anabolic steroids. However, the identification of the androgen-induced F XXLF-AF2 N/C interaction suggests that AR antagonists can be identified that inhibit or agonists that promote interactions with other F XXLF or L XXLL motif-containing proteins. Pharmaceutical ligands that bind AR with moderate or high affinity may promote interactions with related peptide sequences present in coregulatory proteins. Whether the F XXLF motif or related sequences occur in AR-specific coactivators that have sufficient affinity to compete for the agonist-induced N/C interaction or are induced to interact by other ligands remains to be established. In the presence of such ligands, coregulatory proteins might inhibit or compete for the androgen-induced N/C interaction to regulate tissue-selective AR-mediated gene activation. The androgen receptor (AR)1 is a member of the steroid receptor family of nuclear receptors that act as ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators. The AR shares with other steroid receptors an overall structural arrangement that includes a COOH-terminal ligand binding domain, central DNA binding region, and a less well conserved NH2-terminal region (Fig. 1). Within these domains are two major transactivation regions, activation function 1 in the NH2-terminal region and activation function 2 (AF2) in the ligand binding domain. The NH2-terminal activation function 1 region, although not well defined, requires androgen binding for transcriptional activity and appears to be critical for AR-mediated gene activation. The AF2 region in the ligand binding domain forms a putative hydrophobic binding site for the L XXLL motifs of p160 coactivators (1Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

https://openalex.org/W2155639936,"Dopamine cells are generated in the ventral midbrain during embryonic development. The progressive degeneration of these cells in patients with Parkinson's disease, and the potential therapeutic benefit by transplantation of in vitrogenerated dopamine cells, has triggered intense interest in understanding the process whereby these cells develop. Nurr1 is an orphan nuclear receptor essential for the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. However, the mechanism by which Nurr1 promotes dopamine cell differentiation has remained unknown. In this study we have used a dopamine-synthesizing cell line (MN9D) with immature characteristics to analyze the function of Nurr1 in dopamine cell development. The results demonstrate that Nurr1 can induce cell cycle arrest and a highly differentiated cell morphology in these cells. These two functions were both mediated through a DNA binding-dependent mechanism that did not require Nurr1 interaction with the heterodimerization partner retinoid X receptor. However, retinoids can promote the differentiation of MN9D cells independently of Nurr1. Importantly, the closely related orphan receptors NGFI-B and Nor1 were also able to induce cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Thus, the growth inhibitory activities of the NGFI-B/Nurr1/Nor1 orphan receptors, along with their widespread expression patterns both during development and in the adult, suggest a more general role in control of cell proliferation in the developing embryo and in adult tissues. Dopamine cells are generated in the ventral midbrain during embryonic development. The progressive degeneration of these cells in patients with Parkinson's disease, and the potential therapeutic benefit by transplantation of in vitrogenerated dopamine cells, has triggered intense interest in understanding the process whereby these cells develop. Nurr1 is an orphan nuclear receptor essential for the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. However, the mechanism by which Nurr1 promotes dopamine cell differentiation has remained unknown. In this study we have used a dopamine-synthesizing cell line (MN9D) with immature characteristics to analyze the function of Nurr1 in dopamine cell development. The results demonstrate that Nurr1 can induce cell cycle arrest and a highly differentiated cell morphology in these cells. These two functions were both mediated through a DNA binding-dependent mechanism that did not require Nurr1 interaction with the heterodimerization partner retinoid X receptor. However, retinoids can promote the differentiation of MN9D cells independently of Nurr1. Importantly, the closely related orphan receptors NGFI-B and Nor1 were also able to induce cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Thus, the growth inhibitory activities of the NGFI-B/Nurr1/Nor1 orphan receptors, along with their widespread expression patterns both during development and in the adult, suggest a more general role in control of cell proliferation in the developing embryo and in adult tissues. central nervous system retinoid X receptor nerve growth factor-inducible B neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 dopamine hormone-response element NGFI-B-binding response element ligand binding domain retinoic acid receptor retinal dehydrogenase 1 enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence-activated cell sorting bromodeoxyuridine room temperature retinoic acid phosphate-buffered saline (E)-4-[2-(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl] benzoic acid Nuclear receptors constitute a large family of ligand-regulated transcription factors including receptors for steroid hormones, retinoids, vitamin D, and thyroid hormone (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

In addition, a large number of so-called “orphan receptors” belong to the same gene family but lack identified ligands. Nuclear receptors play fundamental roles in adult physiology and during development where they are essential for cell fate specification and differentiation of various cell types both within and outside of the nervous system (3Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Nurr1 (NR4A2) is an orphan nuclear receptor expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (CNS)1 (4Law S.W. Conneely O.M. DeMayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5Zetterström R.H. Williams R. Perlmann T. Olson L. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Nurr1 is highly related to two other orphan receptors, NGFI-B and Nor1 (NR4A1 and NR4A3) (6Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar, 7Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 8Ohkura N.

All three receptors are predominantly expressed in the CNS but are encoded by immediate early genes and can be strongly induced in both neural and non-neural tissues (see e.g.Refs. 9Crispino M.

Commun. 2001; 281: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). During development, Nurr1 is expressed at high levels in the ventral mesencephalon, a region where dopamine (DA) cells are being generated (5Zetterström R.H. Williams R. Perlmann T. Olson L. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These cells are critically involved in control of motor functions, reward mechanisms, and other neural processes. Importantly, the progressive degeneration of these cells is the underlying cause of Parkinson's disease. Analysis of Nurr1 null mutant mice has revealed that this gene is essential for the development of midbrain DA cells (16Zetterström R.H. Solomin L. Jansson L. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Perlmann T. Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 17Saucedocardenas O. Quintanahau J.D. Le W.D. Smidt M.P. Cox J.J. Demayo F. Burbach J.P.H. Conneely O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 1998; 11: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Neuronal induction occurs even in the absence of Nurr1, which is normally expressed as developing DA cells become postmitotic (19Wallén Å. Zetterström R.H. Solomin L. Arvidsson M. Olson L. Perlmann T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, newly generated, differentiating DA neurons fail to migrate to their normal lateral midbrain positions and are unable to extend axons towards their normal target areas (19Wallén Å. Zetterström R.H. Solomin L. Arvidsson M. Olson L. Perlmann T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby Nurr1 promotes differentiation has remained unknown, and the only Nurr1 target gene identified to date in developing DA cells is tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis (20Sakurada K. Ohshima-Sakurada M. Palmer T.D. Gage F.H. Development. 1999; 126: 4017-4026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Iawawaki T. Kohno K. Kobayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similar to other nuclear receptors, Nurr1 recognizes DNA by binding hormone-response elements (HREs) in the promoters of regulated target genes. In case of Nurr1, several such binding sites have been identified. The DNA sequence determines the type of protein complex interacting with the HRE. Accordingly, Nurr1 can bind as a monomer and activate transcription from a particular HRE referred to as NGFI-B-response element (NBRE) (22Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1297-1300Google Scholar, 23Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Similar to NGFI-B (24Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Rey-Hei C. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Paulsen R.E. Weaver C.A. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16491-16496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Nurr1 transactivation through the NBRE is mainly dependent on an activation function localized in the large amino-terminal domain of the receptor. In addition, in certain cell lines, Nurr1 activity can also be mediated in part by an activation function within its putative carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (26Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bolin M.B. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown if endogenous ligands exist or if Nurr1 exerts its functions in the absence of ligands. Nurr1 can also form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to certain retinoic acid-responsive elements (27Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 28Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Finally, a third type of binding site identified in the promoter of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene has been shown to be bound by Nurr1 homodimers (29Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.-H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 30Maira M. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) are potent inducers of cell differentiation in a variety of tissues in vivo as well as in many different cell lines cultured in vitro. Two types of retinoid receptors, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and RXR, mediate the effects of retinoids. RAR binds all-trans- and 9-cis-RA, whereas RXRs bind only 9-cis-RA (31Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). RXR may also utilize other naturally occurring ligands such as the recently identified brain-enriched RXR ligand docosahexaenoic acid (32Mata de Urquiza A. Liu S. Sjöberg M. Zetterström R.H. Griffiths W. Sjövall J. Perlmann T. Science. 2000; 290: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). RXR forms heterodimers with RAR and with a number of other nuclear receptors including Nurr1 and NGFI-B. Whereas RXR is an inactive partner in complex with several other nuclear receptors (33Chen J.Y. Clifford J. Zusi C. Starrett J. Tortolani D. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), RXR can be very efficiently activated by its ligand in complex with Nurr1 or NGFI-B, suggesting that one function of these orphan receptors might be to promote ligand-induced signaling by RXRin vivo (27Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 28Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In vivo, retinoids are generated by oxidation of retinol into retinaldehyde and retinoic acid in two enzymatic steps requiring specific alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases, respectively. Interestingly, one of these enzymes, retinal dehydrogenase 1 (RALDH1) (reviewed in Ref. 38Deuster G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), is highly expressed in developing DA cells during embryogenesis (19Wallén Å. Zetterström R.H. Solomin L. Arvidsson M. Olson L. Perlmann T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 39McCafferey P. Dräger U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7772-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). RALDH1 expression appears even before Nurr1 in proliferating dopaminergic progenitor cells and remains highly expressed in maturing DA cells and in the adult brain. Thus, it is likely that retinoids are exerting important functions in developing and/or mature DA cells. To begin to elucidate the mechanisms whereby Nurr1 promotes cellular differentiation, it is desirable to identify suitable in vitro systems where Nurr1 would be actively engaged in the differentiation process. MN9D is a hybridoma cell line established by fusing embryonic primary cells from mouse ventral midbrain with cells from the mouse neuroblastoma cell line N18TG2 (40Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffmann P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). MN9D cells show properties of immature neuronal cells that can mature and extend neurites under certain culturing conditions. In addition, these cells also have characteristic dopaminergic properties, e.g. they express high levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, synthesize and store DA, and are sensitive to N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion, the active metabolite of the dopamine neuron-specific toxinN-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (40Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffmann P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 41Heller H. Price S. Won L. Brain Res. 1996; 725: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, unlike more mature dopamine cells, MN9D cells do not express Nurr1. 2D. S. Castro and E. T. Hermanson, unpublished results. In this paper we have addressed the functional consequences of expressing Nurr1 in transfected MN9D cells, and we have also analyzed the phenotype of these cells after exposure to retinoids. Our results demonstrate that both Nurr1 and retinoids promote cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and induce a mature and highly differentiated phenotype characterized by extension of long neurites. By expressing the related receptors Nor1 and NGFI-B, as well as mutated Nurr1 derivatives in MN9D cells, we have obtained additional insights into the mechanisms whereby Nurr1 and its close relatives are functioningin vivo. pCMX-Nurr1, pCMX-NGFI-B, and pCMX-Nor1 contain the coding cDNA sequences of Nurr1, NGFI-B, and Nor1 (27Perlmann T.

Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). pCMX-RARVP16 encodes the VP16 activation domain from herpes simplex virus followed by the full-length cDNA sequence of the human RARα (44Ogura T. Alvarez I.S. Vogel A. Rodriguez C. Evans R.M. Belmonte J.C.I. Development. 1996; 122: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter used in transfection experiments contain three copies of the NBRE (27Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) cloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene minimal promoter. pCMX-Nurr1-(1–353) contains the truncated sequence of Nurr1 (amino acids 1–353) (26Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bolin M.B. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and pCMX-Nurr1EngR the truncated sequence of Nurr1 (amino acids 94–365) followed by the sequence of the repressor domain from theDrosophila Engrailed protein. pCMX-Nurr1dim, pCMX-Nurr1R334A, and pCMX-Nurr1EngR/R334A were generated using the GeneEditorTM in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). Nurr1 residues Lys-554 to Leu-556, in pCMX-Nurr1dim, and Nurr1 residue Arg-334, in pCMX-Nurr1R334A and pCMX-Nurr1EngR/R334A, were replaced by alanines. MN9D, N18TG2, and 293 cell lines were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) (MN9D) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) (N18TG2 and 293), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). MN9D and N18TG2 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated flasks and plated, 1 day before transfection, at a density of 25 × 104 cells in 25-cm2 flasks. Expression vectors for receptor, EGFP (CLONTECH), and alkaline phosphatase were transfected at a 8:1:1 ratio, respectively, 4 μg of total DNA per flask. Transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 8 h of incubation with DNA precipitate, complete medium containing 2% fetal calf serum was added. Transfection efficiencies were assessed 1 day later by assaying culture medium for alkaline phosphatase activity, and only samples with similar efficiency of transfection were compared. Based on EGFP expression, ∼20–40% of cells were transfected under these conditions. EGFP-expressing differentiated cells were blind-counted 3 days after transfection using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE300, Nikon, Japan). Cells were scored as differentiated when bearing at least one neurite greater than 3-cell body diameter. In each flask, 3 × 15 consecutive fields were examined. Each sample was prepared in quadruplicate, and average values are shown. Error bars represent S.D. For differentiation induced by retinoids, cells were plated at a density of 50 × 104 cells on 25-cm2 flasks. All-trans-RA and the RXR agonist SR11237 were used at 1 μm concentration, and RAR agonist (E)-4-[2-(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl] benzoic acid (TTNPB) at 0.1 μm. Cells were analyzed 2 days later by phase-contrast microscopy (Eclipse E1000M, Nikon, Japan). Proteins were made by coupled in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TNT, Promega). For gel mobility retardation assays (27Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), the indicated species of proteins were incubated with binding buffer. The buffer contained 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probe (0.2–0.5 ng),32P-labeled by a fill-in reaction with the Klenow fragment, with a specific activity of about 3–5 × 108 cpm/mg, was added to the reaction and incubated on ice for 20 min. The mixtures were then loaded onto 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE running buffer (0.045 m Tris borate, 0.002m EDTA). After electrophoresis, gels were dried for autoradiography. The following oligonucleotide and its complement was 32P-labeled and used as probe: βRE, agcttaaggGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCActcgcat. Cells were plated and transfected as for the differentiation assay and fixed 3 days later with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), for 30 min at RT. Blocking was performed for 1 h at RT with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-class III β-tubulin (TUJ1) (Babco), diluted at 1:250 in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at RT with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch). MN9D cells were transfected as for the differentiation assay and 24 h later were given a 45-min pulse of 50 μm BrdUrd (Sigma). After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at RT, cells were rinsed in PBS, incubated for 20 min in 2 m HCl, rinsed in PBS, and blocked at RT for 30 min with 10% goat serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS. Incubation with monoclonal mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (DAKO, Australia) (diluted 1:100 in blocking solution) was done overnight at 4 °C. The following day, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at RT. Five random fields from each sample were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse E1000M, Nikon, Japan). Percentage of EGFP-expressing cells incorporating BrdUrd was calculated as an average of four samples. Error bars represent S.D. Paraffin-embedded sections were prepared at 6 μm thickness, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in ethanol. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in PBS, and digested with proteinase K (27 μg/ml, Sigma in 10 mmTris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA). Sections were then acetylated in acetic anhydride (Sigma) solution with triethanolamine (Sigma) and HCl and permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Following prehybridization (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma), 500 μg/ml herring sperm DNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)), sections were hybridized at 70 °C for 16 h with 2–20 ng of digoxigenin-labeled probe in the same solution. The following day, slides were washed in 0.2× SSC, equilibrated in buffer 1, (B1; 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.15 mNaCl), and then incubated with anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments (1:5000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in B1 overnight. Standard color development was performed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of levamisole (0.24 μg/ml, Sigma) to block endogenous activity of alkaline phosphatase. Slides were mounted with glycerol:PBS (9:1), and data were analyzed and photographed on Eclipse E1000M microscope (Nikon) coupled to a digital camera (Spot2, Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 on poly-d-lysine-coated 25-cm2 flasks and transfected using LipofectAMINE as described above, with expression vectors for receptor and EGFP at a 50:1 ratio, with a total amount of 4 μg of DNA per flask. The distribution of the cells in G1, S, and G2/M cell cycle phases was determined by DNA flow cytometry. 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% sodium azide for 1 h at 4 °C, resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and stored at −20 °C. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in presence of RNase A (50 mg/ml). Flow cytometric analysis was carried out on 10,000 gated EGFP-expressing cells using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Transfections were performed in 24-well plates with LipofectAMINE, according to manufacturer's protocol (MN9D cells) or with calcium-phosphate, as described previously (26Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bolin M.B. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (293 cells). Each well was transfected with 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 100 ng of receptor expression vector, and 200 ng of pCMX-βgal reference plasmid containing a bacterial β-galactosidase gene. Additions to each well were adjusted to contain constant amounts of DNA and of pCMX expression vector. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed, and extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity in a microplate luminometer/photometer reader (Lucy-1; Anthos, Austria). Values shown are averages of quadruplicates, with error bars representing S.D. Within 3 days after transient transfection of a Nurr1 expression vector, a mature neuronal morphology, characterized by long, commonly bipolar neurites, was induced (Fig.1 A). This morphology could be clearly visualized by staining for a neuronal specific marker such as β-tubulin III or by cotransfection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression vector (Fig. 1, B andC). Transient expression of several other nuclear receptors including the vitamin D-, thyroid hormone-, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ did not induce differentiation of MN9D cells (data not shown). In addition, Ptx3 and Lmx1b, two homeobox transcription factors also expressed in developing midbrain DA cells and implicated in their differentiation, did not promote differentiation in similar transfection experiments (data not shown) (45Smidt M.P.

Because Nurr1 can form RXR heterodimers that are efficiently activated by ligands binding to RXR, the involvement of Nurr1-RXR heterodimers in the process of MN9D cell differentiation was analyzed. Culturing MN9D cells in the presence of the synthetic RXR ligand SR11237 (47Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) did not promote increased differentiation in either mock- or Nurr1-expressing MN9D cells (Fig.2 A). Although these results indicate that RXR activation is not essential for Nurr1-induced cell maturation, it remained possible that Nurr1 required heterodimerization with RXR for promoting differentiation of MN9D cells. To address this possibility, a dimerization-deficient Nurr1 mutant (Nurr1dim) was generated by introducing a 3-amino acid substitution in a region shown to be critical for dimerization in other heterodimers (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nurr1dimdid not heterodimerize with RXR either in a mammalian two-hybrid assay in transfected cells or in vitro as demonstrated by a gel-shift experiment (data not shown, Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Nurr1dim was transcriptionally active as a monomer and activated a reporter gene containing three NBREs in transfected cells (Fig. 2 C). Importantly, Nurr1dim was fully active when tested in transfected MN9D cells for its ability to induce morphological differentiation (Fig. 2 D). Overall, the results demonstrate that heterodimerization with RXR is not required in the differentiation process. Accordingly, a Nurr1 derivative lacking the entire LBD (Nurr1-(1–356)), which also encompasses the RXR dimerization interface, was also actively promoting differentiation, although to a somewhat lesser extent (Fig. 2 E). In contrast, a mutation in the so-called A box (Nurr1R334A) (48Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) abolished DNA binding (data not shown) and was inactive in promoting MN9D cell differentiation (Fig. 2 F). Thus, DNA binding by Nurr1 is required, whereas the integrity of the LBD is not essential in the differentiation process. The previously reported (19Wallén Å. Zetterström R.H. Solomin L.

After 3 days in the presence of all-trans-RA, cells had adopted a distinct morphology typical of highly differentiated neurons and indistinguishable from the appearance of Nurr1-overexpressing MN9D cells (Fig.3 A). Selective RAR and RXR ligands were tested either alone or in combination to assess their influence on the differentiation process. The RAR-selective agonist TTNPB (49Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) induced cell differentiation, whereas the RXR-specific agonist SR11237 did not promote maturation w"

We observed a cooperative interaction between the β1 integrin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3 or Flt4) that appeared to be required for cell migration. By using VEGFR-3-transfected 293 cells (293/VEGFR-3) or primary dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMEC), we found that stimulation with either soluble or immobilized extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, collagen or fibronectin (FN), resulted in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in the absence of a cognate ligand. This increased tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was diminished by pretreatment with a blocking antibody against the β1integrin. Cross-linking with anti-β1 integrin antibody induced a similar degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. Stimulation with collagen or FN induced an association between β1 integrin and VEGFR-3 in both 293/VEGFR-3 and primary DMEC cells. Collagen or FN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was inhibited by treatment with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Collagen or FN was able to induce the migration of 293/VEGFR-3 or DMEC cells to a limited extent. However, migration was dramatically enhanced when a gradient of the cognate ligand, VEGF-D, was added. VEGF-D failed to induce cell migration in the absence of ECM proteins. Introducing a mutation at the kinase domain of VEGFR-3 or treatment with blocking antibody against either VEGFR-3 or β1 integrin inhibited cell migration induced by ECM and VEGF-D, indicating that signals from both β1 integrin and VEGFR-3 are required for this cell function.

The adhesive interactions between cells and ECM are mediated by integrins, a family of cell surface receptors that bind to ECM proteins including collagens, vitronectin, laminins, and fibronectin. Integrins are heterodimeric molecules composed of α- and β-subunits. At least 17 different α-subunits and 8 β-subunits have been identified to date. The various combinations of the α- and β-subunits yield integrin dimers with diverse ligand specificity and biological activities (3Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Integrins not only function as ECM adhesion molecules but also transduce biochemical signals into the cell to affect various proteins and second messengers, such as tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, lipid mediators, low molecular weight GTPases, and intracellular calcium fluxes (4Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 5Harris E.S. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Biol.

Integrins can synergistically act with growth factors to modulate cell functions and share signaling pathways initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

In certain types of cells, integrin-mediated cell adhesion appears to be required for optimal activation of growth factor receptors (2Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Engagement of integrins by ECM proteins can modulate the activation of RTKs, even in the absence of their ligands (9Sundberg C. Rubin K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P.

The possible molecular basis of such cross-talk between integrins and RTKs may involve the physical interaction of these two classes of proteins, forming macromolecular complexes on the cell membrane. Thus, the αvβ3 integrin can be immunoprecipitated in complexes with the receptor for insulin (12Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Integrin-mediated interaction of endothelial cells with ECM proteins is essential for angiogenesis, a complex process that involves extracellular matrix remodeling, endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and maturation of new endothelial cells into mature blood vessels. Angiogenesis is regulated by various growth factors such as VEGF, placenta growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and PDGF. Synergistic effects of these growth factors and certain ECM proteins have been described (15Borges E. Jan Y. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR-3 or Flt4) is a member of a subfamily of class III receptor tyrosine kinases characterized by seven extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a split, intracellular domain containing kinase activity (25Aprelikova O.

Two glycoproteins, VEGF-C and VEGF-D, have been identified as the ligands for VEGFR-3 (27Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K.

In this report, we present evidence that the ECM proteins, collagen and fibronectin, through their binding to β1 integrin, can stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGFR-3 receptor and induce the formation of a β1 integrin·VEGFR-3 receptor complex. Furthermore, endothelial cell migration required signals from both the ligand-activated VEGFR-3 and the ECM-activated β1 integrin. Recombinant VEGF-D was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for VEGFR-3 (Flt4) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G10 was a generous gift of Dr. Brian Druker (University of Oregon). Mouse anti-human β1 integrin-blocking mAb and anti-β1 integrin mAb for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Normal rabbit serum and purified normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Organon Teknika Corp. (West Chester, PA). The recombinant human VEGFR-3 (Flt4)/Fc chimera (VEGFR-3/Ig) containing the extracellular domain of human VEGFR-3 and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cytochalasin D was obtained from Calbiochem. Poly-l-lysine was purchased from Sigma. Electrophoresis reagents and nitrocellulose membrane were obtained from Bio-Rad. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and GammaBind® plus Sepharose® were obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Calcium and potassium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 293 cells stably transfected with VEGFR-3 (293/VEGFR-3) (28Lee J. Gray A. Yuan J. Louth S.-M. Avraham H. Wood W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and shown to be mycoplasma-free prior to their expansion in culture. 293/VEGFR-3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMEC) were purchased from Clonetics Inc. (Palo Alto, CA) and expanded in EGM-2 medium. 5–8 passages were used in the described experiments. 293/VEGFR-3 cells were starved in serum-free DMEM for 20 h or DMEC were starved in EGM-2 medium without serum and without supplements for 5 h. After starvation, cells were washed and incubated with PBS containing 0.1 mm Na3VO4 for 20 min. Cells were then stimulated with collagen (8 μg/ml), fibronectin (10 μg/ml), or VEGF-D (100 ng/ml) in PBS for different times as indicated at 37 °C. For stimulation with immobilized ECM proteins, cells were detached by PBS containing 0.2 mm EDTA, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended at 5 × 106/ml in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were then stimulated by loading onto tissue culture dishes coated with collagen or fibronectin for different times as indicated at 37 °C. After stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Because receptor complexes can be dissociated in Triton X-100 buffer (36Yu X. Miyamoto S. Mekada E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 15 mm CHAPS was used to replace Triton X-100 in the above lysis buffer for studying the co-immunoprecipitation of VEGFR-3 with β1 integrin. Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). For the immunoprecipitation studies, identical amounts of protein from each sample were clarified by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Following the removal of protein A-Sepharose by brief centrifugation, the solution was incubated with different primary antibodies as detailed below for each experiment for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the antibody-antigen complexes was performed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% suspension) or 50 μl of GammaBind® plus Sepharose®. Nonspecific bound proteins were removed by washing the Sepharose beads three times with lysis buffer and one time with PBS. Bound proteins were solubilized in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and further analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk protein and probed with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times, and the presented blots are representative of these. 293/VEGFR-3 cells were starved in serum-free DMEM, washed with PBS, and incubated with anti-β1 integrin antibody (10 μg/ml in PBS) at 4 °C for 45 min. After washing with cold PBS, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml in PBS) for 15 min at 4 °C and then 10 min at 37 °C. Total cell lysates were prepared as described above. Tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-VEGFR-3 antibody followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The wild type VEGFR-3 expression construct was generated by cloning the long form of VEGFR-3 cDNA into the vector, PRK5, as described previously (28Lee J. Gray A. Yuan J. Louth S.-M. Avraham H. Wood W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The expression construct of the mutant form of VEGFR-3 was made in PRK5, in which a Gly to Arg mutation at the 857 site was generated by an in vitro site-directed mutagenesis kit, QuickChange TM XL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using oligonucleotide primers as follows: P1, 5′-CGGCGCCTTCAGGAAGGTGGT-3′; P2, 5′-ACCACCTTCCTGAAGGCGCCG-3′. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM 3777 System. For transient expression of wild type or mutant VEGFR-3 in 293 or 293/VEGFR-3 cells, EffecteneTM Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Migration assays were performed in triplicate using 8-μm pore filters (Transwell, 24-well cell clusters; Costar, Boston, MA). The lower side of each filter was coated with type I collagen isolated from rat tail (50 μg/ml in PBS), FN (25 μg/ml in PBS), poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml), or BSA (50 μg/ml) as a control for 2 h at room temperature. The filters were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C and then rinsed with migration medium (DMEM with 0.5% BSA for 293 or 293/VEGFR-3 cells, RPMI 1640 with 0.5% BSA for DMEC), and the supernatant was aspirated immediately before loading the cells. Cells (about 80% of confluence) were harvested by releasing them from flasks with 2 mm EDTA for 293 or 293/VEGFR-3 cells or with trypsin/EDTA for DMEC. Cells were washed two times with migration medium and then loaded into the upper chamber of the inserts (2 × 105 cells/0.1 ml migration medium). The inserts were then carefully transferred to another well containing 650 μl of migration medium with various concentrations of VEGF-D (R & D Systems). The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3.5 h. Non-migrated cells were removed from the upper chambers by wiping the upper surface with a cotton-tip applicator, and the migrated cells on the under surface were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik® stain Kit (Baxter Healthcare Corp., McGaw Park, IL). The number of migrated cells was counted in 10 randomly selected high power (× 200) fields per insert. No cells were found in the lower chambers where the inserts were placed. Each determination represents the average of three individual inserts, and error bars represent mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t test. To assess if collagen activates VEGFR-3, we first examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in 293/VEGFR-3 cells after stimulation with a soluble form of collagen. Serum-starved 293/VEGFR-3 cells were stimulated with human type I collagen (8 μg/ml) or VEGF-D (50 ng/ml) for various times. VEGFR-3 was immunoprecipitated by anti-VEGFR-3 antibody and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10). As shown in Fig. 1 A, collagen stimulation induced a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. This increased tyrosine phosphorylation was rapid and transient, detected as early as 1 min, reached a maximum at 5 min, and returned to a basal level at 30 min after stimulation (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). Equal amounts of VEGFR-3 were present in each lane (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). Used as a positive control, VEGF-D also stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. We also observed a similar induction of VEGFR-3 phosphorylation by type I collagen isolated from rat tail (data not shown). In addition to type I collagen, we demonstrated a similar induction of VEGFR-3 tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with other forms of human collagen including types III–V (data not shown). These results indicated that the soluble form of various types of collagen can activate VEGFR-3. Because collagen encountered in vivo will usually be immobilized as part of the extracellular matrix, we next examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in 293/VEGFR-3 cells stimulated by immobilized collagen. Serum-starved 293/VEGFR-3 cells were detached with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, washed twice, and resuspended in PBS with 0.1% BSA at 5 × 106/ml. The cells were then loaded onto collagen I-coated dishes. The dishes were centrifuged briefly and incubated at 37 °C for different times. The tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was then examined as described above. As shown in Fig. 1 B, tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was stimulated by immobilized collagen with similar kinetics to that induced by soluble collagen (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). We verified similar protein loading in each lane of the immunoblot (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). We also found that stimulation with either soluble (Fig. 1 C) or immobilized forms (data not shown) of FN induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in 293/VEGFR-3 cells. To exclude the possibility that VEGFR-3 phosphorylation induced by collagen or FN was mediated through autocrine stimulation by its natural ligands, 293/VEGFR-3 cells were stimulated with collagen, FN, or VEGF-D in the absence or presence of the recombinant human VEGFR-3 (Flt4)/Fc chimera protein (VEGFR-3/Ig). VEGFR-3/Ig has been shown to bind to both VEGF-D and VEGF-C and to block ligand/receptor binding (37Makinen T. Jussila L. Veikkola T. Karpanen T. Kettunen M.I. Pulkkanen K.J. Kauppinen R.

Jaattela M. Alitalo K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1786-1790PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 D, the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 induced by VEGF-D was blocked by VEGFR-3/Ig, whereas the collagen- or FN-stimulated phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was not inhibited in the presence of VEGFR-3/Ig. These results indicated that matrix protein-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was not mediated by the release of receptor ligands. To investigate the effects of collagen or FN on normal primary cells expressing endogenous VEGFR-3, we utilized DMEC which express robust levels of VEGFR-3. 2M. Zambela, D. R. Sage, J. F. Wang, B. J. Dezube, and J. D. Fingeroth, manuscript submitted for publication. We showed that both collagen and FN induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in DMEC (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicate that the extracellular matrix protein, collagen or FN, can activate VEGFR-3 by inducing its tyrosine phosphorylation. Receptors for collagen include α1β1 and α2β1 integrins, whereas the major receptors for FN are α4β1 and α5β1, which have been found to be expressed in many cell types (40Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8940) Google Scholar, 41Brugge J.S. Nat. Gen. 1998; 19: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The functional roles of collagen or FN in regulating cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, and migration are mediated through such cell surface expressing molecules. Thus, we tested whether the collagen- or FN-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was mediated by β1 integrin. To that end, we used blocking antibody against β1 and treated the 293/VEGFR-3 cells before collagen or fibronectin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of 293/VEGFR-3 cells with anti-β1 blocking antibody, but not control isotype IgG antibody, inhibited the collagen (Fig. 3 A) or FN (Fig. 3 B)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. These results indicated that the collagen- or FN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was mediated through β1integrin. To investigate further the role of β1 integrin in the activation of VEGFR-3, experiments were performed to assess the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in 293/VEGFR-3 cells after cross-linking with anti-β1 integrin antibody. Serum-starved 293/VEGFR-3 cells were incubated with anti-β1 or control isotype IgG for 45 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with sheep anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. The variously treated dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the cells were then treated with a lysis buffer. The tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-VEGFR-3 antibody and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10). As shown in Fig. 4, cross-linking of anti-β1antibody, but not control normal mouse IgG, with sheep anti-mouse IgG, resulted in an increase in VEGFR-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results indicated that β1 integrin-mediated enhancement of the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was dependent on the clustering of these cell surface integrin molecules. To investigate whether VEGFR-3 associates with β1 integrin, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Serum-starved 293/VEGFR-3 cells were stimulated by soluble collagen or FN for different times. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-3 antibody and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-β1 integrin antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, collagen or fibronectin stimulation induced an association of VEGFR-3 with β1integrin. A similar association of VEGFR-3 with β1integrin was shown in DMEC (Fig. 5 B). This enhanced association was confirmed by immunoprecipitating with anti-β1 integrin antibody and Western blotting with anti-VEGFR-3 antibody (data not shown). Disruption of actin cytoskeleton integrity decreased the collagen-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. The integrity of the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be necessary for many integrin-mediated signaling events (6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). We investigated whether actin cytoskeleton integrity was required for the collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. Before stimulation with collagen, 293/VEGFR-3 cells were incubated with 0.4 μm cytochalasin D, a known inhibitor of actin polymerization. We demonstrated that the collagen-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was inhibited by cytochalasin D (Fig. 6). Our data suggested cooperation between β1 integrin and VEGFR-3 signaling. We investigated the possible functional significance of this observation in regulating cell migration. In a Transwell migration assay, 293/VEGFR-3 cells or parent 293 cells were loaded in the migration insert filters coated with collagen or BSA. The transmigration was examined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 7, coating with collagen increased the number of migrating 293/VEGFR-3 and 293 cells compared with coating with BSA. However, the migration of 293/VEGFR-3 cells was higher (2.5-fold) than that of the 293 cells. To test the specific role of VEGFR-3 or β1 integrin in collagen-induced cell migration, cells were pretreated with anti-VEGFR-3 or anti-β1 integrin antibody before performing the migration assays. We observed that the migration of 293/VEGFR-3 cells through collagen-coated inserts was reduced by either blocking antibody treatment. To explore further the possibility that activation of VEGFR-3 by β1 integrin stimulation contributed to the enhanced cell migration on collagen, we generated"

We showed that MTF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo and that zinc stimulates MTF-1 phosphorylation 2–4-fold. Several kinase inhibitors were used to examine the possible involvement of kinase cascades in the activation of MTF-1. Metal-induced MT gene expression was abrogated by protein kinase C (PKC), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and tyrosine-specific protein kinases inhibitors, as assayed by Northern analysis and by cotransfection experiments using a metal regulatory element-luciferase reporter plasmid. The extracellular signal-activated protein kinase and the p38 kinase cascades did not appear to be essential for the activation of MT gene transcription by metals. By using dominant-negative mutants of PKC, JNK, mitogen-activated kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), and MKK7, we provide further evidence supporting a role for PKC and JNK in the activation of MTF-1 in response to metals. Notably, increased MTF-1 DNA binding in response to zinc and MTF-1 nuclear localization was not inhibited in cells preincubated with the different kinase inhibitors despite strong inhibition of MTF-1-mediated gene expression. This suggests that phosphorylation is essential for MTF-1 transactivation function. We hypothesize that metal-induced phosphorylation of MTF-1 is one of the primary events leading to increased MTF-1 activity. Thus, metal ions such as cadmium could activate MTF-1 and induce MT gene expression by stimulating one or several kinases in the MTF-1 signal transduction pathway.

A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). All vertebrates examined contain two or more distinct MTs that are grouped into four families, MT-1 through MT-4. The expression of MT-1 and MT-2 is ubiquitous, while that of MT-3 and MT-4 is restricted to specific tissues. MTs play important roles in zinc and copper homeostasis and detoxification of toxic metals. MT can also confer protection against reactive oxygen species, electrophilic antineoplastic agents, various mutagens, ionizing radiation, and nitric oxide.MT genes are universally inducible at the transcriptional level by metals and a variety of stress conditions such as reactive oxygen species, hypoxia, and UV irradiation. The ability of MT genes to be induced by metals is controlled by a short DNA sequence (metal regulatory element; MRE), which is present in six nonidentical copies (MREa through MREf) in the 5′-flanking region of the mouse MT-1 gene, and by the capacity of metal-regulatory transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) to bind to the MREs in the presence of zinc and induce transcription (3Andrews G.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). MTF-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor of the Cys2His2 family (4Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) that is essential for both basal and metal-inducible MT gene expression (5Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). MTF-1 is not only essential for induction by zinc, but it also mediates the response to all metals that activate MT gene expression (5Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 6Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). MTF-1 is also a central cellular component of the stress signal transduction machinery activated in response to oxidative stress (7Dalton T. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Giaccia A. Sutherland R.M. Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1315-1322PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, MTF-1 is essential for liver development (5Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and mediates metal regulation of the genes encoding γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (10Gunes C.

Genet. 1999; 262: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms by which metals exert their action on MTF-1 still remain unclear. On the one hand, MTF-1 was initially described as a constitutive activator responsible for basal MT gene expression (4Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that MTF-1 availability was regulated by a zinc-sensitive inhibiting factor, called MTI, similar to the NF-κB-IκB system (6Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, the isolation of such an inhibitor has not yet been reported. On the other hand, MTF-1 DNA binding activity rapidly increases in cells treated with zinc (4Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W.

Similarly, MTF-1 DNA binding activity is rapidly activated in vitro by zinc in assays using recombinant MTF-1 synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate (15Dalton T.P. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This suggests that MTF-1 is reversibly activated to bind to DNA and to enhance MT gene transcription in response to increased free zinc levels. Zinc would lead to an allosteric change in MTF-1 causing exposure of zinc fingers involved in DNA binding (for a review, see Giedroc et al. (20Giedroc D.P. Chen X. Apuy J.L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)). All of the other metals capable of inducing MT would do so by displacing zinc from the weakly bound pool, and this displaced zinc would activate MTF-1 DNA-binding (6Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating DNA binding, metals appear to modulate nuclear translocation, since zinc promotes the rapid transport of MTF-1 into the nucleus (21Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9377-9384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).However, cadmium, a potent inducer of MT gene expression, has no major effect on the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 either in vivoor in vitro (13Westin G. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3763-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 15Dalton T.P. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, low nontoxic concentrations of cadmium exert only a small effect on MTF-1 nuclear translocation despite strong induction of MT gene expression (21Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9377-9384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This suggests that cadmium may activate MT gene expression by increasing the transactivation potential of MTF-1. It has been suggested that this could be accomplished by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (16Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S.L.A. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 173: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a survey of the MTF-1 sequence for kinase consensus sites indicated that the protein contains numerous putative casein kinase-II, protein kinase C (PKC), glycogen synthetase kinase-3, and tyrosine protein kinase sites.To date, however, there has been no clear indication of any specific cellular components serving as kinase targets in the putative signaling cascade leading to MTF-1 activation. Previous studies showed that zinc- and cadmium-induced MT gene expression is abrogated by the PKC inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7) or chelerythrine, as assayed by Northern analysis (22Yu C.W. Chen J.H. Lin L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of PKC by prolonged exposure to phorbol ester completely blocked cadmium-mediated activation of the MRE in HepG2 cells and significantly reduced zinc-mediated activation (23Chu W.A. Moehlenkamp J.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5279-5284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These data have been interpreted as indicating that PKC is involved in the activation of MT gene expression in response to metals (22Yu C.W. Chen J.H. Lin L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, prolonged exposure to phorbol ester can affect many cellular processes in addition to inhibiting PKC. Furthermore, H7 markedly reduces the cellular accumulation of zinc (22Yu C.W. Chen J.H. Lin L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and inhibits phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in vivo (24Kumahara E. Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of H7 on MT gene expression could be due to the blocking of zinc transport or the inhibition of elongation of RNA transcripts.We therefore undertook the present study to ascertain whether MTF-1 itself is phosphorylated in vivo and to characterize the kinase signaling pathway involved in MTF-1 activation and MT gene expression in response to metals. In mammalian cells, a variety of extracellular stimuli generate intracellular signals that converge on a limited number of protein kinase cascades, commonly referred to as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (25Dhanasekaran N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1327-1490Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 26Pouysségur J. Science. 2000; 290: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are three distinct classes of MAPK, the extracellular signal-activated protein kinase (ERK), the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 MAP kinases. While the ERK MAPKs are activated by mitogenic stimuli, the two other types of MAPKs, JNK and p38, are in general activated by antimitogenic stimuli such as environmental or genotoxic stress, transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1. In addition, there is significant cross-talk between MAPK transduction and other kinase signaling pathways such as those involving the PKC and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). By using several kinase inhibitors, mitogen extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1)-null mutant cells and dominant negative mutants of PKC, JNK, and its upstream activators MAP kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) and MKK7, we provide evidence supporting a role for PKC, PI3K, and JNK, but not for ERK or p38, in the activation of MTF-1 and the induction of MT gene expression in response to metal ions.DISCUSSIONMTF-1 is required for basal as well as zinc- and cadmium-induced MT gene expression. MTF-1 is considered to be a cytoplasmic zinc sensor, characterized by increased DNA binding activity upon zinc treatment (5Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 15Dalton T.P. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). While activation of MTF-1 DNA binding activity is dependent on the interaction of zinc with the zinc fingers of the protein (53Bittel D.C. Smirnova I.V. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37194-37201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 54Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Gong P. Otuska F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it does not appear sufficient for zinc induction of MT gene expression in vivo. Analysis of MTF-1 zinc finger mutants indicated that a functional domain responsible for zinc regulation resides outside of the zinc finger domain in the N-terminal region (54Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Gong P. Otuska F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and that MTF-1 zinc fingers cooperate with the transactivation domains to produce a zinc-sensing metalloregulatory transcription factor (53Bittel D.C. Smirnova I.V. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37194-37201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MTF-1 activity can be modulated by mechanisms independent of the zinc-dependent increase in DNA binding activity. Indeed, MTF-1 binding in nuclear extracts from zinc-pretreated cells is always higher than from untreated cells, even if saturating amounts of zinc are added to the binding reaction (5Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar,18LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that zinc induction in vivo induces other changes in MTF-1 enhancing its activity, distinct from the structural changes directly induced by zinc. Zinc may simply be a constitutive structural component of MTF-1 but may also act as a regulatory molecule. In addition to the direct interaction of zinc with MTF-1, other signal transduction cascades may be involved in the regulation of MTF-1 activity in response to metal ions.In an effort to further explore the mechanisms controlling MTF-1 activity, we wished to determine whether MTF-1 is a phosphoprotein. Metabolic labeling experiments showed that MTF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo both in the uninduced and induced state and that zinc treatment led to a 2–4-fold increase in the overall phosphorylation status of the protein. Using different kinase inhibitors and kinase-dead dominant negative mutants, we showed that MTF-1 activity and MT gene expression are controlled by a complex kinase signaling transduction pathway that includes PKC, PI3K, JNK, and a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. The ERKs and the p38 pathways do not appear to be essential for the activation of MT gene expression in response to metals. Notably, increased MTF-1 DNA binding in response to zinc and MTF-1 nuclear localization was not inhibited in cells preincubated with the different kinase inhibitors despite strong inhibition of MTF-1-mediated gene expression. Thus, despite the fact that MTF-1 is localized in the nucleus in a zinc-activated DNA binding conformation, as assayed by EMSA, it did not activate MRE-mediated transcription. This strongly suggests that phosphorylation is essential for MTF-1 transactivation function. These results allow us to hypothesize that metal-induced phosphorylation of MTF-1 is one of the primary events leading to increased MTF-1 activity. Metals may trigger a protein kinase cascade(s) that results in the phosphorylation by a specific MTF-1 kinase(s) (MTFK) of regulatory site(s) required for transcriptional activity of MTF-1 (Fig.8). Interactions of zinc with the zinc finger domain of MTF-1 would remain, in cooperation with the MTF-1 kinase cascade, an important regulatory mechanism controlling MTF-1 DNA binding activity and, possibly, nuclear translocation.Zinc is an essential trace nutrient for all life forms and participates in a variety of enzymatic reactions. Zinc has been identified as a central component of over 300 metalloenzymes as well as numerous zinc finger transcription factors (55Prasad A.S. Nutrition. 1995; 11: 93-99PubMed Google Scholar). The biological essentiality of zinc implies the existence of homeostatic mechanisms that tightly regulate its absorption, distribution, cellular uptake, and excretion. Because of its central role in the regulation of key molecules involved in zinc homeostasis, such as MT and ZnT-1, control of MTF-1 activity by zinc is likely to play an important role in these homeostatic mechanisms. Our results show that regulation of MTF-1 activity involves a specific metal-activated kinase signaling cascade; thus, mechanisms regulating this cascade are also likely to be crucial for zinc homeostasis. We postulate the existence of a zinc-responsive pathway that functions as a reversible activated sensor of the free zinc pool in the cell. A component(s) in this pathway would be reversibly activated in response to increased intracellular free zinc levels and would control the activity of the kinase cascade converging on MTFK and MTF-1 and, possibly, on other transcription factors and molecules involved in zinc homeostasis and stress response.Cadmium (Fig. 7, B and C), as well as other transition metals, have little effect on MTF-1 DNA binding activity in vivo and in vitro despite strong MTF-1-dependent induction of MT genes (16Bittel D.

Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data were interpreted as suggesting that cadmium activation of MT gene expression by MTF-1 could be modulated by indirect mechanisms independent of those used by zinc (3Andrews G.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 16Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S.L.A. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 173: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, cadmium appears to use the same signaling cascade as that used by zinc to activate MT gene expression, since the kinase inhibitors used in this study abrogated the activation of MT gene transcription in response to both zinc and cadmium. Cadmium is a toxic transition metal with no known physiological function, which activates the expression of several genes such as those encoding HSPs, heme oxygenase, c-Fos, c-Jun, and Erg-1 (56O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, several different sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins can function as “cadmium-responsive” factors. These include USF (57Maeshima H. Sato M. Ishikawa K. Katagata Y. Yoshida T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2959-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), AP-1 (58Daffada A.A.I. Murray E.J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Alam et al. (40Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol.

In the case of the MT genes, this would be by interfering with the mechanisms controlling MTF-1 activity in response to zinc. Indeed, cadmium can activate several kinases (40Alam J. Wicks C.

Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), of which some may overlap with the MTF-1 kinase transduction pathway, thus stimulating MTF-1 transcriptional activity and MT gene expression without increasing MTF-1 DNA binding activity. While zinc is required for MTF-1 DNA binding activity, in normal physiological conditions, cells presumably contain enough endogenous zinc to keep MTF-1 in a transcriptionally inducible form that can undergo transcriptional activation through phosphorylation without further increase in DNA binding activity. Thus, in this hypothesis, cadmium and other metals do not simply cause the redistribution of zinc but alter the transactivation potential of MTF-1 by phosphorylation (Fig. 8).If metals activate MTF-1 by phosphorylation as suggested in the above model, MTF-1 should be phosphorylated on at least one additional site in response to metal induction. Indeed, phosphorylation of MTF-1 increased 2–4-fold in response to zinc induction in vivo(Fig. 1). This extent of enhanced phosphorylation of MTF-1 in zinc-treated cells compared with the control is compatible with the proposed model despite stronger MTF-1-dependent induction of MT genes in vivo. Indeed, since MTF-1 is already phosphorylated in control cells, the phosphorylation of an extra amino acid in response to metals could easily produce a relatively modest increase in the overall phosphorylation state of the protein. However, the phosphorylation of only one or two additional amino acid residues can have a major effect on protein activity. For example, the phosphorylation of serine 392 can efficiently activate p53's DNA binding and transcriptional function (60Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of c-Jun serine 63 and 73 dramatically stimulates the transcriptional activity of the protein (61Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). Use of MTF-1 deletion mutants should facilitate the identification of the amino acid residue(s) phosphorylated in response to metal induction.Because JNK and PKC can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as NF-E2 (62Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and SAF (63Ray A. Fields A.P. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39727-39733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the signaling pathways(s) utilized for regulation of MT gene expression in response to metals may ultimately depend on the ability of MTF-1 to serve as a substrate for JNK and PKC. Although kinase-dead mutants and PKC and JNK inhibitors can inhibit MTF-1 activity, direct phosphorylation of MTF-1 by PKC and JNK remains to be tested. PI3K controls key target kinases such as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 and protein kinase B/AKT (AKT) and is apparently not directly involved in the phosphorylation of transcription factors. AKT, however, has been shown to phosphorylate some transcription factors including NF-κB (64Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar) and the forkhead-related transcription factor FKHRL1 (65Zheng W.H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39152-39158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because AKT and PKC are two possible immediate downstream components of PI3K → 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, PKC may be downstream of PI3K and upstream of JNK in the MTF-1 signal transduction cascade. In fact, a 150 μm concentration of the JNK inhibitor dicoumarol completely inhibited MRE-LUC expression (Fig. 5) and did not prevent the activation of PKC by zinc (Fig.2 A, PKC pathway), thus indicating that PKC is indeed upstream of JNK. However, the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 did not prevent the activation of JNK in response to zinc (Fig.2 B), thus suggesting that JNK is upstream of PKC, which would be quite surprising and unexpected. However, in mammals there are three JNK genes, and elaborate splicing generates at least 10 different JNK isoforms, which might differ in their substrate specificity (66Davis R.J. Cell. 2001; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3593) Google Scholar). The assay used in this study to measure JNK activity does not allow us to distinguish each JNK family member. Thus, it is possible that inhibition by Ro-31-8220 of a specific JNK isoform involved in regulation of MT gene expression could have gone undetected due to the imprecision of the assay. Another possible way to reconcile these apparently contradictory observations is to assume that PKC and JNK are in two different MTF-1-regulating signal transduction pathways and that both cascades are required f"

In some Gram-positive strains, the surge of resistance to treatment with β-lactams is primarily the result of the proliferation of mosaic PBP-encoding genes, which encode novel proteins by recombination. PBP2x is a primary resistance determinant in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and its modification is an essential step in the development of high level β-lactam resistance. To understand such a resistance mechanism at an atomic level, we have solved the x-ray crystal structure of PBP2x from a highly penicillin-resistant clinical isolate of S. pneumoniae, Sp328, which harbors 83 mutations in the soluble region. In the proximity of the Sp328 PBP2x* active site, the Thr338 → Ala mutation weakens the local hydrogen bonding network, thus abrogating the stabilization of a crucial buried water molecule. In addition, the Ser389 → Leu and Asn514 → His mutations produce a destabilizing effect that generates an “open” active site. It has been suggested that peptidoglycan substrates for β-lactam-resistant PBPs contain a large amount of abnormal, branched peptides, whereas sensitive strains tend to catalyze cross-linking of linear forms. Thus, in vivo, an “open” active site could facilitate the recognition of distinct, branched physiological substrates.

Fischetti V.A. Novick R.P. Feretti J.J. Portnoy D.A. Rood J.I. Gram-positive Pathogens. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 609-620Google Scholar). These drugs target bacterial species by acylating the active site serine of the transpeptidase domains of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)1; as a defense mechanism, bacteria have developed β-lactamases in an effort to hydrolyze these drugs (2Frère J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). PBPs catalyze key steps in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan, a highly cross-linked mesh, which is not only essential in cell division but also protects bacteria from osmotic shock and lysis (3Höltje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBP action involves interconnecting glycan chains (polymers of N-glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues) and cross-linking, or transpeptidation, of short stem peptides, which are attached to such glycan chains. Different bacterial species may have between four and eight distinct PBPs; high molecular mass PBPs are multidomain molecules, consisting of a short cytoplasmic region, a single transmembrane domain, and a large periplasmic region. High molecular mass PBPs are classified into class A molecules (containing both glycosyltransfer and transpeptidation activities) and class B, which contain a transpeptidase domain unit in addition to a N-terminal domain of unknown function. Low molecular mass PBPs function mostly as carboxypeptidases and are believed to regulate the amount of cross-linking within the peptidoglycan mesh (4Ghuysen J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 5Di Guilmi A.M. Mouz N. Andrieu J.P. Hoskins J. Jaskunas S.R. Gagnon J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basis of β-lactam action reflects the fact that the transpeptidation substrate, namely thed-alanyl-d-alanine C terminus of peptidoglycan stem peptides, has close structural analogy to the β-lactam ring. The antibiotics thus act as pseudosubstrates and acylate the PBP transpeptidation active sites, which then deacylate very slowly and are subsequently incapable of performing regular cross-linking functions. The vastly successful employment of β-lactams for the treatment of infections relies on the fact that the PBP transpeptidase domains reside in the periplasmic space, allowing the drugs to have free access to the active sites without the need for traversing the cytoplasmic membrane. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae, the causative agent of a variety of upper respiratory tract infections, has been treated successfully over time with increasing doses of penicillin, antibiotic resistance has been traced to low β-lactam affinity forms of its PBPs (7Hakenbeck R. Kaminski K. Konig A. van der Linden M. Paik J. Reichmann P. Zahner D. Microb. Drug Resist. 1999; 5: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae has five high molecular mass PBPs (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 2x, the first three of which possess both glycosyltransfer and transpeptidase domain activities) and a low molecular mass PBP3 (4Ghuysen J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Notably, low β-lactam affinity forms of streptococcal PBPs are present as highly mosaic genes, especially PBP 1a, 2x, and 2b; PBP2x and PPB2b are primary resistance determinants, and their modification is an essential step in the development of high level resistance (8Reichmann P. Konig A. Marton A. Hakenbeck R. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Hakenbeck R. Konig A. Kern I. van der Linden M. Keck W. Billot-Klein D. Legrand R. Schoot B. Gutmann L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1831-1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pneumococci are naturally highly transformable, and such mosaic structures are believed to have arisen by interspecies homologous recombination, generating PBPs that have decreased affinity for almost all β-lactams, including third generation cephalosporins (10Spratt B.G. Science. 1994; 264: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Clinically resistant strains ofS. pneumoniae may harbor PBP2x variants with over 100 mutations spread throughout highly divergent regions (9Hakenbeck R. Konig A. Kern I. van der Linden M. Keck W.

Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1252-1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Important insight into biological function and resistance mechanisms generated by mutant PBPs have been made available through the structural and biochemical studies of S. pneumoniae PBP2x (12Parès S.

Crystallization and x-ray structure solution of a β-lactam-sensitive form of PBP2x (R6 PBP2x*), possible after solubilization by omission of the cytoplasmic region and the membrane anchor, revealed a three-domain macromolecule composed of an elongated, “sugar tong”-like N-terminal unit, a central transpeptidase domain, and a C-terminal domain. The transpeptidase domain has an active site reminiscent of class A β-lactamases and harbors the essential nucleophile Ser337 (12Parès S. Mouz N. Pétillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 501-509Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The most frequent mutation observed in PBP2xs of clinically resistant pneumococci is that of Thr338 (consequence of a T → A mutation at the genetic level (13Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A. Petit I. Pétillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). Thr338 is immediately adjacent to the catalytic Ser337 and is buried in a small cavity shielded from the active site (15Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 501-509Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This cavity also harbors a buried water molecule, which is coordinated to the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr338, among others. The mutation of Thr338 to glycine, alanine, proline, or valine revealed that the absence of a hydroxyl group at this position drastically lowered the acylation efficiency of PBP2x for β-lactams, even though this residue is not in direct contact with the antibiotic (13Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A. Petit I. Pétillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of a mosaic form of PBP2x from a highly penicillin-resistant clinical strain of S. pneumoniae, Sp328. This enzyme contains 92 mutations when compared with the sensitive form (83 in the soluble region), and the structure reveals information relevant for an understanding of antibiotic affinity and efficiency of catalytic turnover. The structure is analyzed in light of biochemical results obtained with laboratory and clinical mutants in an effort to further decipher the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in streptococci. The gene corresponding to PBP2x from the highly penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae strain Sp328 (minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin = 4 μg/ml) was a kind gift from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). A fragment corresponding to residues 49–750 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into EcoRI-XhoI sites in plasmid pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The first 48 residues of Sp328 PBP2x, which correspond to the cytoplasmic region and the transmembrane helix, were not included in the studies to generate a soluble form of the protein, here identified with an *. The resulting construct, pGEX-Sp328-PBP2x*, was transformed into Escherichia coli MC1061 cells, and this strain was employed for protein expression as described below. Sp328 PBP2x* was expressed as a fusion protein to glutathioneS-transferase with a thrombin-cleavable linker positioned N-terminally to the initiator methionine. The protein was purified to homogeneity as described previously (13Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A. Petit I. Pétillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Once crystallization trials for Sp328 PBP2x* were initiated, an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis revealed that the protein was unstable and had been cleaved during purification into two fragments. N-terminal sequencing showed that the cleavage was at the level of Phe364 (a mutant residue) and, hence, was the product of a chymotrypsin-like protease. To increase the stability of Sp328 PBP2x*, Phe364 was mutated back to leucine, which is the amino acid present in R6 PBP2x*. To generate the Phe364 → Leu mutation, vector pGEX-Sp328-PBP2x* was modified by introducing the replication origin of phage f1 as described in Ref. 14Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the single-stranded DNA produced from the resulting phagemid, pGEX-Sp328-PBP2x*-f1. The resulting construct was subsequently transformed into competent E. coli MC1061 cells. Introduction of the desired mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. Sp328 PBP2x*-Phe364 → Leu was expressed and purified as described above for Sp328 PBP2x* (and shall henceforth carry this denomination). SDS-PAGE controls confirmed that the mutant protein was stable, presenting no cleavage products. Sp328 PBP2x* crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in 0.2 m sodium acetate pH 4.8, 22–24% polyethylene glycol 2000, and 200 mm(NH4)2SO4. Typical crystals did not grow larger than 50 × 50 × 100 μm. Cryoprotection was performed by initially introducing 10 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 24% polyethylene glycol 4000, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, and 5% ethylene glycol into the crystallization drop. After a 5-min equilibration period, crystals were transferred into a larger volume of the above solution. The amount of ethylene glycol in the cryoprotection buffer was slowly increased to 15% in a total period of 24 h, after which crystals were flash-cooled by rapid introduction into liquid nitrogen. All attempts to perform cryoprotection in less than 24 h or with a protectant other than ethylene glycol yielded poor quality, highly mosaic diffraction patterns. Data were collected at the ID14-EH4 beamline (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) at 0.94 Å using a 250-mm crystal-to-detector distance and 1° oscillations. Crystals presented unit cell dimensions a= b = 146.56 and c = 132.61 Å in space group P32, with four monomers per asymmetric unit. Integration, scaling, and merging of data were performed with the programs Denzo and Scalepack (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the 2.5-Å structure of the penicillin-sensitive form of R6 PBP2x* (Ref. 15Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol.

The program AMoRE (17Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) was employed with data from 10 to 4 Å. No noncrystallographic symmetry was used during refinement of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit. Atomic refinement of Sp328 PBP2x* was performed with CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

The final structure includes 2237 residues (67–99, 181–236, 242–364, 395–523, and 536–750 (monomer 1); 1066–1100, 1150–1235, 1246–1360, 1397–1520, and 1535–1749 (monomer 2); 2067–2099, 2181–2236, 2242–2360, 2397–2523, and 2536–2750 (monomer 3); 3066–3100, 3150–3235, 3246–3360, 3397–3520, 3535–3612, and 3632–3749 (monomer 4)), and 21 water molecules, and has an R-factor of 23.4% for all reflections. An Rfree of 31.1% was obtained from a subset of 9% of the data, which were excluded from the refinement. The model has good stereochemistry and structural quality, with an average bond length and bond angle deviation of 0.009 Å and 1.6°, respectively. A total of 96.8% of all residues are in most favorable and additionally allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot.Table IData collection statisticsCell dimensions (Å)a = b = 146.56,c = 132.61Space groupP32Resolution (last shell) (Å)25–3.2 (3.31–3.2)No. of unique/total reflections52,413/167,780Rmerge (last shell) (%)11.1 (36.7)I/ςI (last shell)10.2 (3.1)Completeness (last shell) (%)96.1 (97.8)Refinement No. of residues2237 No. of water molecules21 Rcryst (%)23.4 Rfree (%)31.1 No. of reflections in working set41,859 No. of reflections in test set4,672 Root mean square bond deviation (Å)0.009 Root mean square angle deviation (°)1.6 Mean B-factor (Å2)31.3 Open table in a new tab The Sp328 PBP2x* monomer consists of three domains: an N-terminal unit, which folds into an elongated, sugar tong shape; a central transpeptidase domain (residues 266–616), which harbors the peptidoglycan cross-linking catalytic machinery; and a C-terminal unit (residues 635–750). Fig. 1 relates positions of all mutations in Sp328 PBP2x* (as compared with the penicillin-sensitive R6) and secondary structural elements in the present structure. Limits between domains are shown by red arrows. Most mutations are nonconservative (orange) and are located in loop regions. During refinement, side chain density was clearly visible for all mutated residues (which during molecular replacement had been included as alanines) with very few exceptions. Mutations present in Sp328 PBP2x* are mapped as red marks onto a Cα representation in Fig.2. Although it is clear that punctual modifications have occurred throughout the entire structure, it is evident that there are two main regions where they are concentrated: the active site area and the C-terminal domain, including the C-terminal/transpeptidase domain linker region. Interestingly, an analysis of 26 available PBP2x sequences from β-lactam-resistantS. pneumoniae isolates available in GenBank™ revealed that, although there is only a 16% sequence variation within the N-terminal domain, the transpeptidase and the C-terminal regions display 26 and 31% variability, respectively. The sequence of the C-terminal/transpeptidase domain linker region (residues 617–634) displays 64% variability among the 26 strains. The relevance of the localization of these mutations will be discussed below. Sp328 PBP2x* crystallizes in space group P32 with four molecules (2237 traceable residues) and 43% solvent per asymmetric unit. Interestingly, this new, distinct arrangement from the tetragonal (P41212) and hexagonal (P6122) forms reported previously for the β-lactam-sensitive molecule (12Parès S. Mouz N. Pétillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,15Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 501-509Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) displays an N-terminal domain that is clearly more stable than in either form (green in Fig. 3). This is especially relevant upon comparison with the monomer crystallized in tetragonal form, which diffracted to 1-Å higher resolution than the hexagonal samples but contained a cleavage site at peptide bond 182–183 and had a largely disordered N-terminal region. The Sp328 PBP2x* structure reveals traceable density that had not been detected before for N-terminal domain residues 66–70, 93–99, 151–182, and 245–253 (and corresponding residues in monomers 2, 3, and 4). Interestingly, the structure of Sp328 PBP2x* clearly displays the linker between the transpeptidase domain and the C-terminal unit for three of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit; this region was also absent in the tetragonal crystals of the β-lactam-sensitive molecule. Notably, in Sp328 PBP2x*, the loop region between residues 365 and 394 has very weak electron density for monomer 1 and is untraceable for the other three molecules (red in Fig. 3). Because a SDS-PAGE analysis of dissolved crystals of Sp328 PBP2x* proved the protein to be stable (a unique band at the expected molecular weight was observed), we interpret this observation as being a result of inherent flexibility of the molecule in this region. The active sites of both sensitive and resistant forms of PBP2x* are depicted in Fig. 4(a and b), respectively, showing the three highly conserved sequence motifs for the transpeptidase domain (S337 XXK; S395 XN; K547SG). The nucleophilic serine (Ser337) is found at the N-terminal end of α2 (secondary structure nomenclature as in Ref. 12Parès S. Mouz N. Pétillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and, in both resistant and sensitive forms, is in close proximity to the Nε atoms of Lys340 (not shown for clarity) and Lys547. In the sensitive form (Fig.4 a), the loop between α4 and α5 is stably positioned, allowing Ser395 to point into the active site and make close contact with Ser337 Oγ. Asn514, present in α9, points away from the active site region and does not interfere with the position of Ser389 in α4. Thus, the conserved active site residues form a rigid network of hydrogen bonds; these involve Ser337, Lys340, Ser395, Asn397, and Lys547. In the structure of R6 PBP2x* complexed to cefotaxime, Ser337 and Ser395 are critical for stabilization of the antibiotic in the active site cavity (15Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 501-509Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The active site of Sp328 PBP2x* contains a number of discrepancies from the enzymatic cavity of the protein from the antibiotic-sensitive strain (Fig. 4 b). A slight modification in the polarity of the site is evident because of the presence of Ser347 (Ala in the sensitive protein), which forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Thr352, a residue present in the loop that follows α2 (not shown for clarity). It is precisely at this point that the tracing of the sensitive and resistant proteins start to differ significantly, an observation that culminates with the non-traceability of residues 365–394. This region includes α4, whose stability is affected by the presence of the Asn514 → His mutation. The His514 side chain thus lies within the region where α4 is located in R6 PBP2x*. In the resistant form of PBP2x*, the lack of stability of this region engenders the flexibility of the α4-α5 loop, which in turn causes Ser395 (from the SXN motif) to point away from the active site, thus not being readily available for participation in the enzymatic reaction. Chain stability is regained at the level of Asn397, which is positioned analogously in both active sites. The active site of Sp328 PBP2x* also harbors the Thr338 → Ala mutation, which has been shown to be a key structural determinant for β-lactam resistance in S. pneumoniae (13Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A. Petit I. Pétillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the sensitive R6 PBP2x* structure, Thr338 is at the N-terminal end of α2 but does not point into the active site cavity. Instead, it is involved in a constellation of hydrogen bonds which include Ser571, Tyr586, and a buried, tightly bound H2O molecule. In the active site of Sp328 PBP2x*, the loss of the Thr Oγ group occurs concomitantly with the loss of the stable water molecule; none of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit display such a molecule in the vicinity of the hydroxyl groups of Ser571 and Tyr586. Although it was not surprising that the loss of a key hydrogen bond donor (Thr338 Oγ) would cause instability of a tightly bound H2O molecule, the proposed importance of the constellation of interactions in this area of the protein for generation of antibiotic resistance (13Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A. Petit I. Pétillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) led us to test our data. Thus, we compared positions of H2O molecules present in the resistant and in the β-lactam-sensitive structure (15Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 501-509Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Molecules analyzed in the sensitive structure had B-factors < 30 Å2and made at least three hydrogen bonds within the structure (and were therefore considered to be buried). Of the 41 molecules withB-factors < 30 Å2, 21 made at least three contacts within the structure; 2 molecules from this group interacted with residues which lost hydrogen bonding capabilities in the resistant PBP2x* structure. Thus, from the 19 molecules searched for in Sp328 PBP2x*, only 5 were not identified in Fo −Fc maps contoured at 2.8 ς in any of the four monomers, including the Thr338 ligand. Further testing was performed by introducing water molecules at the expected sites in all four monomers within the Thr338-Ser571-Tyr586 vicinity, performing several rounds of individual B-factor refinement and energy minimization with CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar), and generating 2Fo − Fc maps.B-factors for all artificially introduced water molecules were above 50 Å2, and none of the molecules had any identifiable density in the maps. The average B-factor value for all water molecules present in the Sp328 PBP2x* structure is 25.5 Å2. Unlike classical drug resistance mechanisms in which the bacterial target is mutated by a few residues in “hot spot” regions (20Walsh C. Nature. 2000; 406: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 21Dessen A. Di Guilmi A.M. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 1: 63-77Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism which underlies the development of β-lactam resistance in streptococci results from the acquisition of mosaic genes, sometimes with 100 mutations throughout the target protein. Such mosaic structures are believed to have arisen by intra- and interspecies homologous recombination involving PBPs, penicillin resistance determinants of the highly transformable streptococcal spp. (10Spratt B.G. Science. 1994; 264: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Closely related DNA sequences of PBP genes occur in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguis, all of which may generate low affinity PBP forms by acquiring mosaic PBP-encoding genes in which sequence blocks are replaced by homologous regions that may diverge as much as 20% from the sequence of the drug-sensitive strain (9Hakenbeck R. Konig A. Kern I. van der Linden M. Keck W. Billot-Klein D. Legrand R. Schoot B. Gutmann L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1831-1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the six PBPs present in S. pneumoniae, PBP2x is the first to be altered in cefotaxime-resistant laboratory mutants (22Laible G. Hakenbeck R. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and also in clinical isolates (23Laible G. Hakenbeck R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6986-6990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have solved the crystal structure of a soluble form of PBP2x from a highly penicillin-resistant clinical strain of S. pneumoniae, Sp328. The fold of PBP2x* had been described previously for the β-lactam-sensitive structure from strain R6 (12Parès S. Mouz N. Pétillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 501-509Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but the present structure displays a number of topological changes. This mutant contains 83 amino acids that are different from PBP2x from the penicillin-sensitive R6 strain (in the crystallized region). Although mutations exist throughout the entire protein structure, two heavily mutated hot spots are of interest: the active site and the C-terminal region, including the loop that links the transpeptidase and C-terminal domains. PBPs have been proposed as being essential members of a multi-enzymatic cell division network of central importance in peptidoglycan biosynthesis (the divisome (24Bramhill D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CARDINAL interacts with the regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, IKKγ (NEMO), providing a molecular basis for CARDINAL function.

Caspases, cysteine aspartic acid-specific proteases, play a key coordinating role in apoptosis by targeting a subset of cellular proteins for limited proteolysis (2Martin S.J. Green D.R.

Activation of apical (CARD- or DED-containing) caspases appears to be achieved through aggregation of the latter via interactions between adaptor molecules that contain similar CARD or DED motifs (5Slee E.A.

This strategy serves to increase the local concentration of apical caspases and allow processing of adjacent caspase molecules in trans, a process that has been termed the “induced-proximity model” (10Salvesen G.S.

Recently, several CARD-containing proteins have been identified (Bcl10, CARD4/Nod1, Nod2, CARD10, CARD11, CARD14), the function of which appears to be directed primarily toward activation of the NF-κB transcription factor, rather than caspases (11Willis T.G.

The prototypical member of this family, Bcl10 (cE10, CIPER, CLAP, CARMEN), has recently been found to be essential for NF-κB activation in the context of ligation of the T or B cell receptors for antigen (20Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The viral Bcl10 homologue, vCLAP (vE10), is also a potent activator of NF-κB and has been shown to interact with the regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase complex, IKKγ (21Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M.

Cellular Bcl10 may also drive NF-κB activation via recruitment of IKKγ, although this remains to be demonstrated.Several other CARD family proteins have been described that also appear to drive NF-κB activation through association with Bcl10 (16Bertin J.

Thus, Bcl10 appears to be an important convergence point for CARD-containing proteins that regulate NF-κB activation (see Ref. 22Martin S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 188-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholarfor a recent review). In the latter cases, CARD:CARD interactions between Bcl10 and its binding partners may facilitate activation of the IKK complex through recruitment of IKKγ, followed by the IKKα and IKKβ subunits.More recently, CARD-containing homologues of Apaf-1 (CARD4/Nod1, Nod2) have also been shown to promote NF-κB activation through recruitment of the CARD-containing kinase RICK (CARDIAK/RIP-2; Refs. 17Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar and 23Inohara N. Koseki T.

Moreover, RICK has also been shown to interact with IKKγ providing a means whereby recruitment of RICK may result in NF-κB activation through downstream activation of the IKK complex (23Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).Thus, CARD-containing proteins occur repeatedly in stress response pathways that lead to activation of either caspases or NF-κB. Activation of the latter molecules results in either apoptosis or transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, responses that are consistent with the preservation of the integrity of multicellular organisms. Here, we describe a novel CARD-containing protein, CARDINAL, which does not appear to be involved in activation of either caspases or NF-κB. Instead, CARDINAL was found to inhibit divergent NF-κB activation signals and to interact with the regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase complex, IKKγ/NEMO. Thus, CARDINAL may play a role in setting a threshold for NF-κB activation, or in limiting the duration of the NF-κB response in the context of pro-inflammatory signals.DISCUSSIONHere we report the identification of CARDINAL, a CARD-containing protein that exhibits potent NF-κB-inhibitory activity. CARDINAL was found to associate with IKKγ but not with several CARD-containing caspases. Consistent with this, CARDINAL failed to promote apoptosis but was found to antagonize NF-κB activation signals initiated by a variety of receptors or their adaptors. During the preparation of this report, CARDINAL was also reported by Reed and colleagues as TUCAN (30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Pio F. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32220-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although there is broad agreement on the domain structure, tissue distribution, and failure of TUCAN to promote apoptosis, Reed's group report that TUCAN can act as an antagonist of caspase-9 and can block apoptosis associated with transient overexpression of Bax or caspase-9/Apaf-1 (30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Pio F. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

In contrast, our investigations along these lines failed to find a role for CARDINAL/TUCAN as an inhibitor of apoptosis, or an interaction partner for caspase-9 (data not shown). Rather, we have found that CARDINAL/TUCAN antagonizes NF-κB activation, a role that was not explored by Pathan et al.(30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S.

Some of the disagreement between the two groups may relate to the expression systems/assays used. Clearly, further investigation of CARDINAL/TUCAN, particularly at constitutive protein levels, will be required to resolve these issues.As outlined in the Introduction, many recent studies have implicated CARD-containing proteins as signaling components of pathways that result in NF-κB activation (see Ref. 22Martin S.J.

Moreover, using BCL10-null mice, it has also been found that Bcl10 is essential for NF-κB activation associated with stimulation of the T or B cell receptors for antigen (20Ruland J. Duncan G.S.

Apaf-1 is a well established caspase-activating molecule that exhibits homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans caspase-activating protein CED-4 (31Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 possesses an N-terminal CARD motif, a nucleotide-binding domain, and a domain rich in WD repeats that acts as a sensor for cellular damage through binding of cytosolic cytochrome c (9Adrain C. Martin S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 31Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

Upon binding of cytosolic cytochrome cthat has escaped from mitochondria through cell stress/damage, Apaf-1 acts as an oligomerization and activation platform for caspase-9. Recently, two CARD-containing proteins with significant homology to Apaf-1 (Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2) have been described that, in contrast to Apaf-1, appear to be primarily involved in NF-κB activation through recruitment of the RICK kinase (17Ogura Y.

Because RICK has been shown to interact with IKKγ, this suggests that aggregation of RICK by the Apaf-1/Nod1-like family members may result in NF-κB activation through downstream activation of the IKK complex via an induced proximity mechanism (23Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).Strikingly, Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2 have recently been implicated as intracellular sensors for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, through binding of this conserved component of Gram-negative bacteria through their leucine-rich repeat regions (32Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2 also share significant homology with plant disease resistance (R) proteins that also act as intracellular sensors of pathogen products. Thus, the Nod1/Apaf-1 family appear to be involved in host defense responses to different forms of cellular stress (bacterial infection, cell damage) where the outcome is either caspase activation and apoptosis (in the case of Apaf-1), or NF-κB activation and a pro-inflammatory response (in the case of Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2).Given the emerging role for CARD-family proteins as signaling intermediaries in multiple pathways that result in NF-κB activation, CARDINAL may act to counteract some of the latter molecules to set a threshold for NF-κB activation. Alternatively, CARDINAL may play a role in limiting the duration of NF-κB activation, through competition with other proteins for IKKγ/NEMO recruitment. Further work is clearly necessary to explore how CARDINAL expression/stability is regulated in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli and to determine the specific biological context(s) in which CARDINAL operates.The significance of the extensive homology between the N terminus of CARDINAL and the C terminus of DEFCAP/NAC also remains unclear. DEFCAP/NAC is a member of the Apaf-1/Nod1 family of CARD/nucleotide binding domain proteins (33Chu Z.L. Pio F. Xie Z. Welsh K. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

There is disagreement as to the specific binding partners of DEFCAP/NAC (caspase-2/caspase-9 versus Apaf-1) and whether this protein promotes caspase activation and apoptosis via direct or indirect means (33Chu Z.L.

The domain structure of NAC/DEFCAP would strongly suggest that this protein is likely to act as a sensor for pathogen products, akin to Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2, although this remains to be determined. The latter possibility introduces a scenario where CARDINAL may act to antagonise signals routed through DEFCAP/NAC by competing for the same C-terminal binding partners of the latter.Clearly, there are many interesting questions concerning CARDINAL function that require further investigation. In the present study, we have provided data to suggest that CARDINAL can antagonize NF-κB activation signals in diverse contexts. This represents a novel function for a CARD family protein and adds to the growing body of evidence that proteins containing CARD motifs play diverse roles within the overall context of host defense. The caspase recruitment domain (CARD)1 is a protein-protein interaction motif, comprising a bundle of six α-helices, that was first identified in caspases and their associated adaptor molecules (1Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Caspases, cysteine aspartic acid-specific proteases, play a key coordinating role in apoptosis by targeting a subset of cellular proteins for limited proteolysis (2Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 3Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Caspases that participate in apoptosis appear to be organized into hierarchical cascades, with those containing CARD motifs (or the related death effector domain (DED) motif) within their pro-domain regions occupying positions at the apex of caspase activation cascades (3Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar, 5Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J.

Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Activation of apical (CARD- or DED-containing) caspases appears to be achieved through aggregation of the latter via interactions between adaptor molecules that contain similar CARD or DED motifs (5Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem.

A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). This strategy serves to increase the local concentration of apical caspases and allow processing of adjacent caspase molecules in trans, a process that has been termed the “induced-proximity model” (10Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The CARD motif does not appear to be restricted to caspases and their adaptor proteins, however. Recently, several CARD-containing proteins have been identified (Bcl10, CARD4/Nod1, Nod2, CARD10, CARD11, CARD14), the function of which appears to be directed primarily toward activation of the NF-κB transcription factor, rather than caspases (11Willis T.G.

The prototypical member of this family, Bcl10 (cE10, CIPER, CLAP, CARMEN), has recently been found to be essential for NF-κB activation in the context of ligation of the T or B cell receptors for antigen (20Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The viral Bcl10 homologue, vCLAP (vE10), is also a potent activator of NF-κB and has been shown to interact with the regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase complex, IKKγ (21Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3183-3187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cellular Bcl10 may also drive NF-κB activation via recruitment of IKKγ, although this remains to be demonstrated. Several other CARD family proteins have been described that also appear to drive NF-κB activation through association with Bcl10 (16Bertin J. Guo Y. Wang L. Srinivasula S.M. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L.

Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11877-11882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, Bcl10 appears to be an important convergence point for CARD-containing proteins that regulate NF-κB activation (see Ref. 22Martin S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 188-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholarfor a recent review). In the latter cases, CARD:CARD interactions between Bcl10 and its binding partners may facilitate activation of the IKK complex through recruitment of IKKγ, followed by the IKKα and IKKβ subunits. More recently, CARD-containing homologues of Apaf-1 (CARD4/Nod1, Nod2) have also been shown to promote NF-κB activation through recruitment of the CARD-containing kinase RICK (CARDIAK/RIP-2; Refs. 17Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar and 23Inohara N. Koseki T.

Moreover, RICK has also been shown to interact with IKKγ providing a means whereby recruitment of RICK may result in NF-κB activation through downstream activation of the IKK complex (23Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Thus, CARD-containing proteins occur repeatedly in stress response pathways that lead to activation of either caspases or NF-κB. Activation of the latter molecules results in either apoptosis or transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, responses that are consistent with the preservation of the integrity of multicellular organisms. Here, we describe a novel CARD-containing protein, CARDINAL, which does not appear to be involved in activation of either caspases or NF-κB. Instead, CARDINAL was found to inhibit divergent NF-κB activation signals and to interact with the regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase complex, IKKγ/NEMO. Thus, CARDINAL may play a role in setting a threshold for NF-κB activation, or in limiting the duration of the NF-κB response in the context of pro-inflammatory signals. DISCUSSIONHere we report the identification of CARDINAL, a CARD-containing protein that exhibits potent NF-κB-inhibitory activity. CARDINAL was found to associate with IKKγ but not with several CARD-containing caspases. Consistent with this, CARDINAL failed to promote apoptosis but was found to antagonize NF-κB activation signals initiated by a variety of receptors or their adaptors. During the preparation of this report, CARDINAL was also reported by Reed and colleagues as TUCAN (30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Pio F. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32220-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although there is broad agreement on the domain structure, tissue distribution, and failure of TUCAN to promote apoptosis, Reed's group report that TUCAN can act as an antagonist of caspase-9 and can block apoptosis associated with transient overexpression of Bax or caspase-9/Apaf-1 (30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Pio F. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32220-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, our investigations along these lines failed to find a role for CARDINAL/TUCAN as an inhibitor of apoptosis, or an interaction partner for caspase-9 (data not shown). Rather, we have found that CARDINAL/TUCAN antagonizes NF-κB activation, a role that was not explored by Pathan et al.(30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S.

The latter possibility introduces a scenario where CARDINAL may act to antagonise signals routed through DEFCAP/NAC by competing for the same C-terminal binding partners of the latter.Clearly, there are many interesting questions concerning CARDINAL function that require further investigation. In the present study, we have provided data to suggest that CARDINAL can antagonize NF-κB activation signals in diverse contexts. This represents a novel function for a CARD family protein and adds to the growing body of evidence that proteins containing CARD motifs play diverse roles within the overall context of host defense. Here we report the identification of CARDINAL, a CARD-containing protein that exhibits potent NF-κB-inhibitory activity. CARDINAL was found to associate with IKKγ but not with several CARD-containing caspases. Consistent with this, CARDINAL failed to promote apoptosis but was found to antagonize NF-κB activation signals initiated by a variety of receptors or their adaptors. During the preparation of this report, CARDINAL was also reported by Reed and colleagues as TUCAN (30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Pio F. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32220-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although there is broad agreement on the domain structure, tissue distribution, and failure of TUCAN to promote apoptosis, Reed's group report that TUCAN can act as an antagonist of caspase-9 and can block apoptosis associated with transient overexpression of Bax or caspase-9/Apaf-1 (30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Pio F. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

In contrast, our investigations along these lines failed to find a role for CARDINAL/TUCAN as an inhibitor of apoptosis, or an interaction partner for caspase-9 (data not shown). Rather, we have found that CARDINAL/TUCAN antagonizes NF-κB activation, a role that was not explored by Pathan et al.(30Pathan N. Marusawa H. Krajewska M. Matsuzawa Si S. Kim H. Okada K. Torii S.

Some of the disagreement between the two groups may relate to the expression systems/assays used. Clearly, further investigation of CARDINAL/TUCAN, particularly at constitutive protein levels, will be required to resolve these issues. As outlined in the Introduction, many recent studies have implicated CARD-containing proteins as signaling components of pathways that result in NF-κB activation (see Ref. 22Martin S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 188-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar for a recent review). The Bcl10 CARD protein appears to be a common convergence point for several recently described CARD proteins that activate NF-κB (16Bertin J. Guo Y. Wang L. Srinivasula S.M. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L.

Moreover, using BCL10-null mice, it has also been found that Bcl10 is essential for NF-κB activation associated with stimulation of the T or B cell receptors for antigen (20Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). A different route to NF-κB activation appears to involve a distinct set of CARD proteins, which includes members of the Nod1/Apaf-1 family. Apaf-1 is a well established caspase-activating molecule that exhibits homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans caspase-activating protein CED-4 (31Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 possesses an N-terminal CARD motif, a nucleotide-binding domain, and a domain rich in WD repeats that acts as a sensor for cellular damage through binding of cytosolic cytochrome c (9Adrain C. Martin S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 31Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Upon binding of cytosolic cytochrome cthat has escaped from mitochondria through cell stress/damage, Apaf-1 acts as an oligomerization and activation platform for caspase-9. Recently, two CARD-containing proteins with significant homology to Apaf-1 (Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2) have been described that, in contrast to Apaf-1, appear to be primarily involved in NF-κB activation through recruitment of the RICK kinase (17Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 23Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Because RICK has been shown to interact with IKKγ, this suggests that aggregation of RICK by the Apaf-1/Nod1-like family members may result in NF-κB activation through downstream activation of the IKK complex via an induced proximity mechanism (23Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Strikingly, Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2 have recently been implicated as intracellular sensors for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, through binding of this conserved component of Gram-negative bacteria through their leucine-rich repeat regions (32Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2 also share significant homology with plant disease resistance (R) proteins that also act as intracellular sensors of pathogen products. Thus, the Nod1/Apaf-1 family appear to be involved in host defense responses to different forms of cellular stress (bacterial infection, cell damage) where the outcome is either caspase activation and apoptosis (in the case of Apaf-1), or NF-κB activation and a pro-inflammatory response (in the case of Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2). Given the emerging role for CARD-family proteins as signaling intermediaries in multiple pathways that result in NF-κB activation, CARDINAL may act to counteract some of the latter molecules to set a threshold for NF-κB activation. Alternatively, CARDINAL may play a role in limiting the duration of NF-κB activation, through competition with other proteins for IKKγ/NEMO recruitment. Further work is clearly necessary to explore how CARDINAL expression/stability is regulated in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli and to determine the specific biological context(s) in which CARDINAL operates. The significance of the extensive homology between the N terminus of CARDINAL and the C terminus of DEFCAP/NAC also remains unclear. DEFCAP/NAC is a member of the Apaf-1/Nod1 family of CARD/nucleotide binding domain proteins (33Chu Z.L. Pio F. Xie Z. Welsh K. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

There is disagreement as to the specific binding partners of DEFCAP/NAC (caspase-2/caspase-9 versus Apaf-1) and whether this protein promotes caspase activation and apoptosis via direct or indirect means (33Chu Z.L.

These changes include increased levels of lysosomal hydrolases in early endosomes and increased expression of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), which is partially localized to early endosomes. To determine whether AD-associated redistribution of lysosomal hydrolases resulting from changes in CD-MPR expression affects amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, we stably transfected APP-overexpressing murine L cells with human CD-MPR. As controls for these cells, we also expressed CD-MPR trafficking mutants that either localize to the plasma membrane (CD-MPRpm) or to early endosomes (CD-MPRendo). Expression of CD-MPR resulted in a partial redistribution of a representative lysosomal hydrolase, cathepsin D, to early endosomal compartments. Turnover of APP and secretion of sAPPα and sAPPβ were not altered by overexpression of any of the CD-MPR constructs. However, secretion of both human Aβ40 and Aβ42 into the growth media nearly tripled in CD-MPR- and CD-MPRendo-expressing cells when compared with parental or CD-MPRpm-expressing cells. Comparable increases were confirmed for endogenous mouse Aβ40 in L cells expressing these CD-MPR constructs but not overexpressing human APP. These data suggest that redistribution of lysosomal hydrolases to early endocytic compartments mediated by increased expression of the CD-MPR may represent a potentially pathogenic mechanism for accelerating Aβ generation in sporadic AD, where the mechanism of amyloidogenesis is unknown.

Additionally, α-cleavage of APP may occur within the Aβ domain of APP, adjacent to the plasma membrane (see Ref. 1Selkoe D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar for a review of APP proteolytic processing). β-Amyloidogenesis in familial AD caused by mutation of APP or the presenilins involves, at least in part, the overproduction of Aβ (2Selkoe D.J.

There is also evidence that at least some of the proteases responsible for Aβ generation reside within early endosomes. For example BACE, a recently identified transmembrane aspartic protease with β-secretase activity, resides in part within early endosomes (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A.

The lysosomal protease cathepsin D (Cat D) was recently confirmed to have secretase-like activity (8Gruninger-Leitch F. Berndt P. Langen H. Nelboeck P. Dobeli H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and, as discussed below, can be detected in early endosomes, particularly in the abnormally enlarged early endosomes of neurons from AD brain (9Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we have detected Aβ immunoreactivity within the abnormally enlarged early endosomes seen in neurons of individuals with Down syndrome and AD. 2A. M. Cataldo, unpublished observation. 2A. M. Cataldo, unpublished observation. Neuronal endocytic abnormalities precede substantial β-amyloid deposition in AD brain and appear decades prior to the development of AD pathology in Down syndrome (10Cataldo A.M. Peterhoff C.M. Troncoso J.C. Gomez-Isla T. Hyman B.T. Nixon R.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Abnormalities of the endocytic pathway in AD are characterized by increased early endosome volume, increased expression of proteins involved in the regulation of endocytosis, endosomal fusion, and recycling (such as Rab5, rabaptin, and Rab4), and abnormally increased levels of lysosomal hydrolases within the early endosome (9Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysosomal system activation, which develops in virtually all neurons within cell populations that are potentially vulnerable to the disease process, is characterized by increased gene expression and protein expression for all classes of lysosomal hydrolases, including proteases such as Cat D, and a robust proliferation of lysosomes (11Cataldo A.M.

Additionally, Cat D levels in the cerebrospinal fluid are increased in individuals with sporadic AD, suggesting that changes in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes result not only in their abnormal accumulation within early endosomes but also in their secretion from neurons (15Schwagerl A.L. Mohan P.S. Cataldo A.M. Vonsattel J.P. Kowall N.W. Nixon R.A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism underlying the partial redistribution of lysosomal hydrolases in AD brain is a change in the expression of neuronal mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPR). The two MPRs bind the majority of lysosomal hydrolases in the trans-Golgi network via the mannose 6-phosphate recognition signal and mediate their transport to organelles within the endosomal-lysosomal system (16Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Cataldo et al. (9Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated by immunocytochemistry an increased neuronal expression of the 46-kDa, cation-dependent MPR (CD-MPR) in sporadic AD cases when compared with control. This increase in CD-MPR immunoreactivity in sporadic AD brain was not accompanied by increased levels of the cation-independent MPR (CI-MPR), a ∼300,000-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein containing two mannose 6-phosphate binding sites as well as a binding site for insulin-like growth factor II (16Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar,17Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both the CD-MPR and CI-MPR can divert the majority of mannose 6-phosphate-tagged hydrolases from the secretory pathway to the endosomal-lysosomal system, it is now clear that these receptors are not functionally redundant (18Munier-Lehmann H. Mauxion F. Bauer U. Lobel P. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15166-15174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The CD-MPR preferentially delivers newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases to endocytic compartments, including the early endosome (20Chao H.H. Waheed A. Pohlmann R. Hille A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which may in part explain the increased localization of lysosomal hydrolases in neuronal early endosomes in AD (9Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have modeled the increase in lysosomal hydrolases seen in early endosomes in sporadic AD by overexpressing human CD-MPR in a mouse fibroblast-like cell line. Overexpression of CD-MPR, which was localized in part to early endosomes, resulted in partial redistribution of a marker lysosomal protease, Cat D, to this compartment. Although this had little effect on rates of APP turnover and sAPP production, it had a dramatic impact on Aβ secretion, increasing Aβ levels in the growth media more than 2.5-fold. These results suggest that abnormalities of the protease composition within early endosomes in AD may contribute directly to AD pathogenesis by promoting Aβ generation and release early in the disease process and may have relevance to sporadic forms of AD in which the amyloidogenic mechanism has been elusive. Ltk cells (a murine fibroblast-like cell line (21Kit S. Dubbs D.R. Anken M. J.

Similarly, CD-MPRpm was generated using the oligonucleotide to introduce the amino acid sequence NGSLQCRICI at the same point in the CD-MPR molecule. These constructs, as well as a cDNA encoding human APP695, were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). CD-MPR constructs were transfected into the same progenitor clone of APP695-overexpressing L cells using co-transfection with a vector carrying hygromycin B resistance (CD-MPRendo using pCEP4) or the tk gene (CD-MPR and CD-MPRpm (22Mathews P.M.

Neurology. 1991; 41: 479-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the criteria proposed by Mirra et al. (32Mirra S.S. Hart M.N. Terry R.D. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1993; 117: 132-144PubMed Google Scholar) and staged according to Braak and Braak (33Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11418) Google Scholar). Control brains showed no evidence of neurofibrillary or plaque pathology. Postmortem tissue samples from 10 cases were diagnosed as having neuropathological evidence of early stage AD (neocortex devoid of neuritic plaques and transentorhinal, entorhinal cortex/hippocampus with sparse plaques; these are Braak stages I–III). A second group of five brains met the diagnosis of late stage AD using the above criteria and the NIA-Reagan guidelines for the diagnosis of AD (3434. (1998) Neurobiol. Aging 19, 109-116.Google Scholar) (>30 neuritic plaques/high power field in the entorhinal-perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, and other limbic regions, and association and visual cortices; Braak stages V–VI). Proteins were extracted from prefrontal cortex gray matter, region A10, in 10 volumes of 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm iodoacetamide, 1% Triton X-100. Equal amounts of proteins were denatured in SDS sample buffer lacking any reducing agent and sized by SDS-PAGE prior to transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. CD-MPR was detected by overnight incubation in 22D4, and antibody binding was detected as described below. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, and expression of APP and the CD-MPR constructs was induced by the addition of 20 mm butyrate for ∼48 h (22Mathews P.M. Martinie J.B. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were gently fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 20 min, and immunolabeled as described previously (22Mathews P.M. Martinie J.B. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.1% saponin (Sigma) to the antibody-containing solutions. Alternatively, for cathepsin D, cells grown on coverslips were fixed by the addition of cold methanol for 15 min, washed, and immunolabeled as above. For BODIPY-pepstatin A labeling, living cells were incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 5 mm BODIPY-pepstatin A (Molecular Probes), washed with cold Hank's balanced salt solution, and fixed in paraformaldehyde. Cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined by epifluorescence or confocal microscopy. Optiprep was purchased from Accurate Chemical Co. (Westbury, NY). Our protocol is modified from that recommended by the manufacturer and as described previously (35Petanceska S.S. Seeger M. Checler F. Gandy S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on to 100-mm-diameter plates, allowed to settle, and treated with butyrate for 48 h. To prepare the homogenate, cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors, pelleted, and resuspended in 0.32 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and homogenized with 10 strokes of a steel cell cracker. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by spinning for 15 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge and layered onto a gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 30, 25, 20, 15, 12.5, 9, 7.5, 5, 2.5% Optiprep diluted in 250 mm sucrose, 6 mm EDTA, 60 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, fractions of 1.1 ml were collected from the bottom, and equal protein was loaded onto SDS polyacrylamide gels. To detect APP and sAPP, 5 × 105 cells were seeded onto 35-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes followed by induction with 20 mm butyrate for 24 h. Cultures were methionine/cysteine-starved for 20 min, pulse-labeled for 15 min with 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), washed, and chased in complete medium containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine (22Mathews P.M. Martinie J.B. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both the chase medium, briefly spun to remove cellular debris, and cell lysates (prepared in 1% Triton X-100, 140 mm NaC1, 25 mm Tris pH 7.4, 10 mm methionine, and protease inhibitors (22Mathews P.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20895-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described under “Results.” Immunoprecipitated proteins were sized by SDS-PAGE, and labeled proteins were visualized by exposure to x-ray film and analyzed quantitatively using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). 1.5 × 10 6cells were seeded onto 100-mM-diameter tissue culture dishes and incubated for 40 h in medium containing 20 mmbutyrate. Medium was replaced by fresh butyrate containing medium (2.5 ml/100-mM-diameter dish), and conditioned media were collected after 8 h. Conditioned media pooled from duplicate plates were spun briefly and frozen in aliquots in a dry ice/methanol bath prior to storage at −70 °C. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were measured by sandwich ELISA using 6E10 as the capture antibody and Aβ40 or Aβ42 carboxyl-terminal-specific detection antibodies as described previously (37Potempska A. Mack K. Mehta P. Kim K.S. Miller D.L. Amyloid. 1999; 6: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 38Mehta P.D. Pirttila T. Mehta S.P. Sersen E.A. Aisen P.S. Wisniewski H.M. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Following collection of conditioned media, Triton X-100 lysates were prepared from each dish (22Mathews P.M. Martinie J.B. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The amount of total protein in cell lysates was determined (Bio-Rad DC protein assay) to confirm equal cell density, and APP was examined by Western blot analysis to confirm equal levels of APP expression (see Fig. 4). For Western blot analysis, lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated in primary antibody overnight, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1.5 h. Membranes were incubated in ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film. Murine Aβ was detected by sandwich ELISA from similarly prepared media samples using Aβ40 and Aβ42 antibodies. Synthetic peptides were used to immunize mice for the production of monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies specific for the carboxyl terminus of Aβ40 were raised against a peptide corresponding to Aβ residues 36–40 (VGGVV). Monoclonal antibody JRF/cAβ40/10 recognized Aβ1–40 by ELISA and Western blot analysis, failed to detect Aβ1–42 by either of these methods, and did not detect full-length APP by immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. A similar Aβ42 carboxyl-terminal-specific antibody (JRF/cAβ42/26) was also generated. Additionally, an antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to murine Aβ residues 1–15 (DAEFGHDSGFEVRHQ; antibody JRF/rAβ/2). This antibody detected murine but not human Aβ1–40, or Aβ1–42 by ELISA and Western blot analysis and was coupled to horseradish peroxidase for detection. Sandwich ELISAs using these antibodies were done as reported previously (30Janus C. Pearson J. McLaurin J. Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D. Chishti M.A. Horne P. Heslin D. French J. Mount H.T.

We extended our earlier finding that CD-MPR immunoreactivity is increased in neurons in sporadic AD (9Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by determining CD-MPR levels in human control and AD brain using Western blot analysis (Fig.1). Prefrontal cortex obtained from age-matched control cases lacking tangle or plaque pathology was compared with the corresponding region from early stage AD cases, in which AD neuropathology was limited to the transentorhinal cortex/hippocampus, and from late stage AD cases as defined by the presence of severe neuronal loss and neurofibrillary and plaque pathology within the five surveyed brain regions (31Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Crain B.J. Brownlee L.M. Vogel F.S. Hughes J.P. van Belle G. Berg L. Neurology. 1991; 41: 479-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mirra S.S. Hart M.N. Terry R.D. Arch.

Quantitation of these results showed a mean increase of 3-fold in the immunosignal for CD-MPR in early stage AD cases (mean increase ± S.E., 3.1 ± 0.5; p < 0.01). CD-MPR levels in late stage AD cases increased to a smaller extent (1.5 ± 0.3;p = 0.06) However, as CD-MPR expression in the brain is primarily neuronal and is increased in pyramidal neurons in AD (9Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the smaller increase in cases with advanced disease pathology compared with those with less severe disease is likely to be related to the extensive neurodegeneration and neuronal cell loss in late stage AD. Our results confirm that CD-MPR expression is substantially increased early in AD, as is the case for other AD-related abnormalities of the neuronal endosomal system (9Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether increased expression of the CD-MPR in AD might modify intracellular lysosomal hydrolase distribution and therefore the proteolytic processing of APP, we isolated a cDNA encoding the human CD-MPR and expressed this in murine L cells overexpressing human APP695 (Fig. 2). Extensive previous work has documented that CD-MPR is distributed, in order of decreasing abundance, within the trans-Golgi network, in endosomal compartments, and on the cell surface (16Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 17Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

The vesicular immunolabeling pattern for the transfected human CD-MPR, showing perinuclear as well as more peripheral labeling (Fig.2 B), is consistent with this distribution. Although we were unable to compare the level of expression of the human CD-MPR directly with that of the endogenous mouse CD-MPR in this cell line, because of the species specificity of our antibodies, we did compare the expression of human CD-MPR in the transfected L cells to its expression in control and AD brain. When standardized to equal amounts of total protein examined by Western blot analysis, the expression of CD-MPR in L cells following induction was ∼2-fold that seen in early stage AD brain and ∼5.5-fold that seen in controls (data not shown). Given the cellular heterogeneity of the brain and the predominant localization of CD-MPR to neurons, it is likely that the expression in neurons in AD brain is close to, if not higher than, that in CD-MPR transfected L cells. This suggests that although the overexpression of CD-MPR in the L cell line may not match precisely the level in AD brain, it is likely to be similar, allowing trends in APP processing brought about by an increase in CD-MPR expression to be examined in this model. Although it is the increased expression of CD-"
https://openalex.org/W2150739289,"In the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the chemoreceptors are coupled to the central two-component kinase CheA via two proteins, CheW and CheV. CheV is a two-domain protein with an N-terminal CheW-like domain and a C-terminal two-component receiver domain. In this study, we show that CheV is phosphorylated in vitro on a conserved aspartate in the presence of phosphorylated CheA (CheA-P). This reaction is slower compared with the phospho-transfer reaction between CheA-P and one other response regulator of the system, CheB. CheV-P is also highly stable in comparison with CheB-P. Both of these properties are more pronounced in the full-length protein compared with a truncated form composed only of the receiver domain, that is, deletion of the CheW-like domain results in increase in the rate of the phospho-transfer reaction and decrease in stability of the phosphorylated protein. Phosphorylation of CheV is required for adaptation to the addition of the chemoattractant asparagine. In tethered-cell assays, strains expressing an unphosphorylatable point mutant of cheV or a truncated mutant lacking the entire receiver domain are severely impaired in adaptation to the addition of asparagine. Both of these strains, however, show near normal counterclockwise biases, suggesting that in the absence of the attractant the chemoreceptors are efficiently coupled to CheA kinase by the mutant CheV proteins. Inability of the CheW-like domain of CheV to support complete adaptation to the addition of asparagine also suggests that unlike CheW, this domain by itself may lead to the formation of signaling complexes that stay overactive in the presence of the attractant. A possible structural basis for this feature is discussed.

Environmental cues are detected by transmembrane receptors called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs),1 which are methyl-esterified on conserved glutamate residues within their cytoplasmic domains by the methyltransferase CheR (1Ahlgren J.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6Hanlon D.W. Marquez-Magana L.M. Carpenter P.B. Chamberlin M.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12055-12060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, the autophosphorylating activity of CheA is up-regulated by binding of attractant molecules to the MCPs (7Garrity L.F. Ordal G.W. Microbiol. 1997; 143: 2945-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This event is thought to increase the phosphoryl group flux to two response regulators, CheB and CheY. CheB is activated upon phosphorylation and hydrolyzes the methyl groups on the MCPs (8Stock J.B. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3659-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Goldman D.J. Nettleton D.O. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Fuhrer D.K.

The main response regulator of the system, CheY, upon phosphoryl group transfer from CheA-P binds the switch complex at the base of each flagellum (12Bischoff D.S. Bourret R.B. Kirsch M.L. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9256-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Binding of CheY-P to the flagellar switch brings about an increase in the probability of counterclockwise (CCW) rotation of the flagella, resulting in smooth swimming (13Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 14Bishoff D.S. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12301-12305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In B. subtilis the default clockwise (CW) rotation of the flagella in the absence of CheY-P binding is associated with tumbling (14Bishoff D.S. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12301-12305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tumbling randomly reorients the bacteria in space, enabling them to swim in another direction in response to subsequent environmental signals. Under steady state conditions, the wild-type B. subtilis has an average bias (defined as the percentage of time the flagella rotate CCW) of about 55%. A net increase in the attractant concentrations in the environment causes a transient increase in bias followed by an almost immediate return to the prestimulus level despite the continued presence of the attractant. This adaptation process allows bacteria to reset their systems to the new level of attractant concentration in the environment so that they can further respond to the net changes with respect to this new level. In Escherichia coli, adaptation involves changes in receptor methylation (15Yonekawa H. Hayashi H. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1228-1235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weiss R.M. Chasalow S. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6817-6826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of methylation are associated with increased CheA activity; the purpose of net methylation changes is to cause adaptation to the stimulus caused by ligand binding to the receptor (17Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, adaptation is more complex. McpB, the sole receptor for the attractant asparagine, is demethylated not only upon asparagine addition but also upon asparagine removal (18Kirby J.R. Saulmon M.S. Kristich C.K Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11092-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These demethylation events appear to target different glutamate residues; relative methylation states of the various glutamates have been correlated with adaptation (19Zimmer M.A. Tiu J. Collins M.A. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example if one of the sites of methylation, residue 637, is mutated to aspartate and thus prevented from becoming methylated, whereas another site of methylation, residue 630, is unchanged, then the bacteria cannot adapt to the addition of asparagine (19Zimmer M.A. Tiu J. Collins M.A. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The same phenotype is also seen in null mutants lacking another chemotaxis protein, CheC (20Rosario M.M.L. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, both selective methylation changes and CheC have been implicated in the mechanism of adaptation to the addition of attractants in B. subtilis. In this study, we have investigated the existence of another adaptation system involving CheV, the third response regulator of the B. subtilis chemotaxis network. CheV is a two-domain protein with an N-terminal CheW-like domain and a C-terminal two-component receiver domain (21Frederick K.L. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier experiments showed that cheW and cheV null mutants had wild-type biases and were able to respond and adapt to large stepwise increase of the attractant azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (22Rosario M.M.L. Frederick K.L. Ordal G.W. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2736-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cheWcheV null mutant, however, had a very low bias and was unable to respond to the addition of attractant (22Rosario M.M.L. Frederick K.L. Ordal G.W. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2736-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In capillary assays, both cheW and cheV single mutants were impaired in their ability to migrate up attractant gradients (22Rosario M.M.L. Frederick K.L. Ordal G.W. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2736-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results led to the conclusion that CheW and CheV may be partially redundant in coupling the receptors to CheA; however, they are both necessary for efficient chemotaxis (22Rosario M.M.L. Frederick K.L. Ordal G.W. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2736-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that CheV is phosphorylated as a result of phosphoryl group transfer from CheA-P and that the purpose of this phosphorylation is to facilitate adaptation to attractants.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Growth media-tryptone, tryptose blood agar base, and yeast extract were from Difco. Luria-Bertani (LB) medium is 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl. LBON (LB medium without NaCl) is 1% tryptone and 0.5% yeast extract. Both mutant alleles of the cheV gene were created by PCR mutagenesis using pKF13 as template (21Frederick K.L. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To create pK33 (pSK::cheVD235A), a set of primers, one of which was coded for the mutation, was used to PCR the entire plasmid. The PCR product was ligated, digested with DpnI (Life Technologies, Inc.) to remove the parent plasmid, and transformed into Tg1. Several transformants were selected, and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. A 1.4-kilobase EcoRI-BamHI fragment was excised from pK33 and cloned into the thrC integration plasmid pDG1664 to create pK34 (24Guérout-Fleury A. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene. 1996; 180: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To create pK35 (pSK::cheV1–168), which encodes a truncated form of CheV containing the N-terminal CheW-like domain, PCR primers were constructed as follows: the reverse primer annealed starting at the codon encoding Phe168, and the forward primer annealed at the stop codon. Ligation of the PCR product created a truncated form of the cheV gene with the entire C-terminal domain deleted. This construct was digested with DpnI and transformed into Tg1. Several transformants with the correct size insert were picked, and the junctions were sequenced. A 1.0-kilobase EcoRI-BamHI fragment was excised from pK35 and cloned into pDG1664 to make pK53. Both mutants were constructed such that they contained the native promoter, native ribosome binding site, the start codon (TTG), and the terminator of the cheV gene. Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used for all PCR reactions. pK34 and pK53 were transformed into OI2737 (cheW::cat) as well as OI3061 (cheW::cat,cheV::kan). The transformants were scored for macrolide/lincosamide antibiotic (MLS) resistance and spectinomycin sensitivity. Western blot analysis done on these strains as well as on OI2737 and OI1085 showed that the expression levels of CheV were identical in all strains. A T7 expression system was used to overexpress the CheV proteins (25Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). In order not to add extra amino acids to the start of the protein, a NdeI site was used as the upstream cloning site. Because the cheV gene has an internal NdeI site, pKF13 and pK33 were first used as templates for PCR mutagenesis to delete the NdeI site by a silent mutation, creating pK39 and pK41, respectively. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. PK39 and pK41 were in turn used as templates for PCR to add a NdeI site to the start of the gene, a 6xhistidine tag, and a BamHI site at the end of the cheV gene. These constructs were cloned into pT7-7 vectors to create pK44 (cheV) and pK42 (cheVD235A). The 6xhistidine-tagged wild-type cheV gene (cheVhis) was also integrated into the thrC locus in a cheWcheV double null mutant background, creating strain OI3463, to test whether the tag interfered with function. cheVhis rescued the nonchemotactic phenotype of the cheWcheV double mutant in capillary assays, indicating that the tag did not interfere with function. To create the vector expressing the C-terminal receiver domain of cheV, a 455-base pair fragment was amplified using pKF13 as template. This fragment was cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pUSH1, creating pK52 (26Schön U. Schumann W. Gene. 1994; 147: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). pK44 and pK42 were transformed into strain OI3378 (27Bahndari P. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4403-4406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1L cultures were grown to A600 0.7 at 37 °C in LBON medium, induced by adding solid NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3m, and grown for an additional 3 h. Purification was carried out using metal affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (28Hochuli E. Bannwarth W. Dubeli H. Gentz R. Stuber D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1321-1325Crossref Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The matrix used for the metal affinity purification (Talon) was from CLONTECH. Briefly, the cell pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl), and cells were sonicated 3 times for 30 s each with a 1-min pause in between at 34% amplitude. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min followed by an additional centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with the Talon beads for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation by 2 min at 700 × g. The supernatant was aspirated, and the beads were washed twice with wash buffer (extraction buffer with 5 mm imidazole). After the second wash the beads were loaded onto a column, and the protein was eluted in elution buffer (extraction buffer with 50 mm imidazole). pK52 was transformed into OI3229. The resulting strain was used to overexpress the C-terminal domain of cheV. Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.7 at 37 °C, induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 3 h. The pUSH1 expression plasmid adds a 6xhistidine tag to the N terminus of the proteins; therefore, CheV164–303 was also purified using metal affinity chromatography as described above with the exception of using a step gradient of imidazole during elution. pLG104 was transformed into OI3378 creating OI3454. A 5-liter culture was grown to an A600 of 0.7 at 37 °C in LBON, induced by adding solid NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3 m, and grown for an additional 3 h. Cell extracts were prepared by centrifugation and clarified as described previously. Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to 32% saturation; solution was mixed gently at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to the supernatant to 55% saturation, the solution was mixed gently at 4 °C for 1 h, and the precipitate, which contained most of the CheA, was collected by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 30 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 20 ml of Tris-HCL buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. 250-μl samples were loaded onto a MemSep 1000 anion exchange cartridge (Millipore) driven by an HPLC pump (Waters, model 510). The column was first washed with 250 mm NaCl for 10 min and then developed with a gradient of 250–500 mm NaCl in the above described buffer delivered over 25 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 1-ml fractions were collected, and those containing CheA were identified by Coomassie staining following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These fractions were pooled and concentrated using a 50-ml Amicon concentration unit with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Amicon). An 8-liter culture of OI3637 was grown to an A600 of 0.7 at 37 °C in LBON, induced by adding solid NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3 m, and grown for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested, washed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 10 ml/g wet weight and resuspended at 3 ml/g wet weight in Tris-HCl buffer with 0.05 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by sonication and the suspension clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 4000 × g followed by a 1-h, 95,000 × g centrifugation. CheB was fractionated by 50 and 65% ammonium sulfate cuts. The 65% fraction was resuspended at 75 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05 β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed solution was passed over a 2.0 × 10.0-cm Macro-prep DEAE (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated in the same buffer. The flow-through was pooled and fractionated over a Protein Pak 300SW gel filtration column (Waters). CheB-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated. All of the proteins were dialyzed against TKMD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.0). The purity of the final protein preparations, assessed by Coomassie staining, was judged to be about 85–95%. Protein concentrations were estimated by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using the following extinction coefficients calculated using the method of Gill and von Hippel (29Gill S.C von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar): for CheV and CheVD235A, E280 = 17210 m−1cm−1; for CheA, E280 = 23380m−1 cm−1; and for CheV164–303, E280 = 5120m−1 cm−1. Concentration of CheB was determined using the Bradford assay. For single time point phosphorylation reactions, CheA was incubated alone or with wild-type or mutant CheV proteins in TKMD buffer with 20 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The final concentration of each of the proteins was 10 μm. For time course phosphorylation assays, CheA was autophosphorylated in TKMD buffer with 20 μm ATP containing 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at room temperature. CheA-P was separated from unincorporated nucleotides by passing the incubation mixture through G-30 microspin columns (Bio-Rad) twice (7Garrity L.F. Ordal G.W. Microbiol. 1997; 143: 2945-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified CheA-P was mixed with each of the response regulators (final concentration of CheA-P was 0.44 μm), and at the given times, 10-μl aliquots were drawn and stopped by adding an equal amount stop buffer (2× SDS buffer containing 100 mm EDTA). For CheV-P decay experiments, CheA-P was mixed with a 200-fold excess of either CheV or CheV164–303. All phospho-transfer reactions were carried out at room temperature unless indicated otherwise. Reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), washed twice for 15 min with phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Autoradiographs were scanned using a scanning densitometer (Precision Digital Images (PDI), model 420e). Quantifications of the scans were done using Quantity One software from PDI. Apparent half-time (t12) for CheA-P dephosphorylation is defined by amount of time it takes for CheA-P decrease to 50% of its original value. These values were calculated using computer-generated fits of the data to exponential curves with R values of ≥0.96. Tethered-cell assays were performed as described previously (18Kirby J.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11092-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using Hobson Tracker, bacterial edition (Hobson Tracking Systems Ltd., Sheffield, UK). Asparagine was used as an attractant at 506 μm, which corresponds to 90% receptor occupancy for asparagine. Prestimulus bias was calculated by averaging data points before the attractant was added. Post-addition bias was calculated by averaging data points at the steady state that the cells reached in the presence of asparagine. The Hobson Tracker system generates raw event text files that sequentially lists the rotational direction and duration of each distinct CCW or CW event. Using a program written with the scripting component of the MatLab software package (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) the events duration times generated by individual cells of a given strain were pooled together and averaged to obtain a mean event duration value. The start and end points of the addition and the post-addition response duration times were determined on a cell by cell basis. The addition phase extends from the point at which the cell responds to the addition of asparagine to the point at which it has reached a stable CCW bias. All sequence analyses, including sequence alignments with ClustalW (31Higgins D.G. Bleaseby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar, 32Thompson J.D. Higgings D.G.

To test whether CheV is phosphorylated as a result of phosphoryl group transfer from CheA-P, purified proteins were incubated in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as a substrate for CheA. The appearance of a radiolabeled band corresponding to the molecular weight of CheV indicated that CheV was phosphorylated, as expected (Fig.1, lane 2). A sequence alignment of the C-terminal response regulator domain of CheV with CheY proteins from various organisms predicted that aspartate 235 is the phospho-acceptor residue on CheV (21Frederick K.L. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this residue is the site of phosphorylation, this aspartate was mutated to alanine. The resulting mutant protein CheVD235A did not become phosphorylated when incubated with CheA and [γ-32P]ATP in vitro (Fig. 1, lane 3). This result suggested that aspartate 235 is the phospho-acceptor residue and that it is the only site of phosphorylation on the CheV protein. To test whether the N-terminal coupling domain of CheV is necessary for the phosphorylation reaction, a truncated mutant of CheV was constructed, which lacked the predicted coupling domain (21Frederick K.L. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This truncated mutant, CheV164–303, did become phosphorylated in vitrowhen incubated with CheA and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1,lane 4). This result showed that the C-terminal response regulator domain of CheV is sufficient for the phospho-transfer reaction between CheA-P and CheV. To ensure that CheV was phosphorylated as a result of phosphoryl group transfer from CheA-P and not from [γ-32P]ATP, CheV and CheV164–303were each incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of CheA. As expected, neither the wild-type nor the truncated CheV protein was able to use [γ-32P]ATP as a phosphoryl group donor (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6)"

Biophys. Acta. 2000; 477: 299-306Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether Tax-mediated apoptosis involves any of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of extracellular death regulators. This family includes TNF-α, Fas ligand (FasL), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and other related proteins, all of which induce cell death by binding to their specific receptors on target cells (25Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). FasL plays a critical role in activation-induced cell death, which occurs in antigen-stimulated T cells (26Russell J.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the FasL pathway is not important for Tax-mediated apoptosis induction (23Chlichlia K. Busslinger M. Peter M.E. Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2265-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, we present genetic evidence suggesting that the Tax-induced T-cell death is largely mediated by TRAIL. Tax expression in Jurkat T cells results in potent induction of TRAIL gene expression, which is associated with massive cell death. This Tax-induced cell death can be inhibited with a TRAIL-blocking antibody. Interestingly, both the Tax-induced TRAIL gene expression and cell death require an intact NF-κB signaling pathway. The parental Jurkat cell line and its derivatives, JM4.5.2, JM4.5.2-GFP, and JM4.5.2-IKKγ, have been described previously (17Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G.-T. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera I. Sun S.-C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar). JM4.5.2 lacks expression of IKKγ and thus is defective in NF-κB activation by both cellular signals and Tax. The JM4.5.2-GFP and JM4.5.2-IKKγ are derivatives of JM4.5.2 stably reconstituted with green fluorescence protein (GFP) and IKKγ, respectively. The Molt-4 and SupT1 T-cell lines were provided by the AIDS Research and Reference Program of NIAID, National Institutes of Health. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg of streptomycin. LAF is an IL-2-dependent HTLV-immortalized human T-cell line (kindly provided by Dr. G. Franchini (27Cereseto A. Diella F. Mulloy J.C. Cara A. Michieli P. Grassmann R. Franchini G. Klotman M.E.

The anti-Tax and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies were prepared from hybridoma 168B17-46-34 (provided by the AIDS Research and Reference Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) and 9.3 (provided by The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), respectively. FITC-conjugated annexin V (annexin-FITC) and propidium iodide were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Retroviral transduction was performed using the pCLXSN system provided by Dr. I. Verma (30Naviaux R.N. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs for GFP and Tax were cloned into the pCLXSN retroviral vector by standard methods, and the procedure for retrovirus production and infection was as previously described (21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar) except for the inclusion of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (provided by Dr. T. Friedmann (31Sharma S. Cantwell M. Kipps T.J. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11842-11847Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) in the packaging. Total RNA was isolated from the various T-cell lines using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). RT-PCR analysis was performed as described (21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar) using the following primers: TRAIL, forward, GGCTATGATGGAGGTCCAGG, and reverse, GGTCCATGTCTATCAAGTGCTC; GAPDH, forward, CTCATGACCACAGTCCATGCCATC, and reverse, CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGTC. The RNase protection assays were performed using the RiboQuant Multi-probe RPA System (hAPO-3 template set, PharMingen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Apoptosis was analyzed based on the translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner side of the plasma membrane to the outer layer during the early stages of apoptosis (32Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4622) Google Scholar). Briefly, the indicated cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide, and the apoptotic cells were subjected to two-color FACS analysis (21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar). The early and late stage apoptotic cells are stained with annexin V and annexin V-propidium iodide, respectively, whereas the live cells are not stained (double negative). To investigate the mechanism mediating Tax-induced T-cell death, we utilized a genetically manipulated T-cell system previously characterized in our laboratory (17Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G.-T. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera I. Sun S.-C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar). This system includes an IKKγ-deficient mutant Jurkat T-cell line, JM4.5.2, the parental Jurkat cells, and JM4.5.2 cell derivatives reconstituted with GFP (JM4.5.2-GFP) or IKKγ (JM4.5.2-IKKγ). The JM4.5.2 and JM4.5.2-GFP cells are defective in NF-κB activation by both mitogens and Tax, whereas the parental Jurkat and JM4.5.2-IKKγ are competent in this cellular signaling pathway (17Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G.-T. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera I. Sun S.-C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar). For efficient Tax expression, we infected the cells with a retroviral expression vector encoding Tax. Under these conditions, more than 95% of the cells were infected as assessed by a parallel infection using GFP-expressing retroviruses (data not shown). Consistent with a prior study (6Chlichlia K. Moldenhauer G. Daniel P.T. Busslinger M. Gazzolo L. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 269-277PubMed Google Scholar), expression of Tax in the parental Jurkat T cells resulted in marked induction of cell death, whereas the mock infected cells (infected with retroviral vector lacking a cDNA) did not exhibit significant cell death beyond the background level detected in uninfected cells (Fig.1A). More importantly, the Tax-induced cell death was markedly reduced in the IKKγ-deficient cells (Fig. 1B, middle panel). This functional blockade specifically resulted from the IKKγ defect, since the induction of cell death was restored when the JM4.5.2 cells were reconstituted with IKKγ (bottom panel). Such a pattern of cell death was more clearly demonstrated in a time course study (Fig.1C). Although the majority of the IKKγ-competent cells died within 10 days after Tax infection, no significant killing was detected in the IKKγ-deficient cells over the entire time course. Further, the differential survival rates between the IKKγ-positive and IKKγ-negative cells did not result from variation in Tax expression (Fig. 1D). These results clearly demonstrate that the NF-κB signaling pathway is essential for Tax-induced Jurkat cell death. To further investigate the mechanism of Tax-induced T-cell death, we examined the involvement of two important apoptosis-inducing molecules, FasL and TRAIL. Specific blocking antibodies for these two proteins were incubated with the Tax-expressing cells followed by measuring the effect of this treatment on Tax-mediated apoptosis. In agreement with a prior study (23Chlichlia K. Busslinger M. Peter M.E. Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2265-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the Fas antibody did not generate an appreciable protective effect on Tax-induced cell death (Fig. 2,column 4). In contrast, the TRAIL-blocking antibody efficiently inhibited this virus-specific event (column 5). This finding suggests that TRAIL, but not FasL, is involved in Tax-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. We then examined whether Tax induces TRAIL gene expression. RT-PCR analysis revealed a strong induction of TRAIL mRNA by PMA and ionomycin (lane 2), mitogens that mimic the T-cell activation signals (Fig.3A, upper panel). Interestingly, the TRAIL mRNA was also induced upon Tax expression. Parallel immunoblotting analysis readily detected the Tax protein in the infected cells (Fig. 3A, lower panel). This result, which was confirmed by the more quantitative RNase protection assays (see Fig. 4), is in complete agreement with the finding that the TRAIL pathway is important for Tax-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2). We also examined TRAIL mRNA expression in a number of HTLV-transformed T cell lines (C8166, HUT102, LAF, MT2, and SLB-1) as well as control uninfected T-cell lines (Jurkat, Molt4, and SupT1) using RNase protection assays (Fig. 3B). Little or no TRAIL mRNA was detected in the HTLV-negative cell lines (lanes 1, 7, and 10). Consistent with the RT-PCR result, stimulation of Jurkat cells with PMA and ionomycin led to strong induction of TRAIL mRNA expression (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lane 2), which was further potentiated by cross-linking the CD28 costimulatory molecule using an agonistic antibody (anti-CD28) (lane 3). More importantly, TRAIL was constitutively expressed in all of the HTLV-transformed T cell lines except C8166 (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lanes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9). Internal control assays revealed that the expression of caspase 8 was ubiquitous and not enhanced in HTLV-transformed cells (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Further, the total RNA amount in the different samples was similar, as demonstrated by the close to equal expression of a house-keeping gene (ribosomal L32). These results suggest that TRAIL gene expression is induced by HTLV-I infection and maintained in most of the virus-transformed cell clones.Figure 4Induction ofTRAILmRNA by both mitogens and Tax is dependent on NF-κB signaling.RNA samples were isolated from the indicated cells and subjected to RNase protection assays. Analysis was performed 8 h after mitogen (P/I) stimulation or 3 days after Tax infection. The protected RNA fragments are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If TRAIL is the mediator of Tax-induced T-cell death, the expression of this death regulatory gene may also require NF-κB signaling. To examine this possibility, we performed RNase protection assays to detect the expression of TRAIL mRNA in parental and IKKγ-deficient Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4). As expected, both mitogens and Tax stimulated TRAIL mRNA expression in the wild-type Jurkat cells (lanes 1–3). Remarkably, the TRAIL gene induction was almost completely blocked in the IKKγ-deficient JM4.5.2 cells (lanes 4–6). Further, this functional defect was largely rescued when the mutant cells were reconstituted with IKKγ (lanes 10–12) but not with GFP (lanes 7–9). Parallel immunoblotting assays readily detected Tax in all of the Tax-infected cell lines (data not shown). Together, these data clearly demonstrate that the NF-κB signaling pathway is essential for the inducible expression of the TRAIL gene. In the same RNase protection assay, we also examined the expression of caspase 8, FasL, and Fas, as well as TRAIL receptors, including the decoy receptors DcR1 and DR3 and the killing receptors DR4 and DR5. As previously demonstrated (21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar), the mitogen-mediated FasL mRNA induction was not blocked by the IKKγ deficiency (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 8), which is in sharp contrast to the induction of TRAIL. Additionally, we found that Tax is not a strong inducer of FasL, a result consistent with the dispensable role of the FasL/Fas pathway in Tax-induced cell death (see Fig. 2). Further, Jurkat cells exhibited constitutive expression of caspase 8, Fas, and DR5. Although the levels of Fas and DR5 were enhanced in mitogen-stimulated parental cells (lane 2), the inducible expression of these two genes appeared to be only moderately affected by the IKKγ deficiency. The NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in apoptosis regulation (33Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 69: 6910-6924Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Although strong evidence implicates NF-κB as an antiapoptotic factor, there are studies suggesting that NF-κB may also function proapoptotically under certain situations (33Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 69: 6910-6924Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 34Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NF-κB promotes apoptosis remains controversial. Although overexpression of the RelA subunit of NF-κB induces FasL promoter activity, the NF-κB signaling pathway does not seem to be essential for the inducible expression of FasL in Jurkat T cells (21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar). In the current study, we have demonstrated that the NF-κB signaling plays a critical role in TRAIL gene induction by both T-cell mitogens and the Tax protein. This finding suggests a novel mechanism underlying the proapoptotic function of NF-κB. Although Tax is best known for its T-cell activation function, several studies have demonstrated a potent apoptosis-inducing activity of this viral oncoprotein (6Chlichlia K. Moldenhauer G. Daniel P.T. Busslinger M. Gazzolo L. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 269-277PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chlichlia K. Busslinger M. Peter M.E. Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Schirrmacher V.

Virol. 1997; 78: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been consistently difficult to generate stable T-cell lines expressing high levels of Tax. Indeed, retrovirus-mediated expression of Tax in Jurkat T cells results in massive cell death within a few days in culture (Fig. 1). The Tax-induced Jurkat cell death can be blocked by a caspase inhibitor, zVAD (data not shown and Ref. 23Chlichlia K. Busslinger M. Peter M.E. Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2265-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of common intracellular mediators of apoptosis. However, it has remained unclear how Tax initiates the apoptosis pathway. Tax has been shown to stimulate the promoter activity of FasL in reporter gene assays (35Chen X. Zachar V. Zdravkovic M. Guo M. Ebbesen P. Liu X. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,36Rivera I. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22382-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and enhance the level of FasL mRNA (23Chlichlia K. Busslinger M. Peter M.E. Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2265-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, Tax-induced T-cell death is largely insensitive to FasL-specific blocking antibodies (Fig. 2 and Ref. 23Chlichlia K. Busslinger M. Peter M.E. Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2265-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This finding is somewhat surprising because Jurkat cells express high levels of Fas and are sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Rivera-Walsh, I., Cvijic, M. E., Xiao, G., and Sun, S.-C. (2000) 275, 25222–25230.Google Scholar). Our current study could explain these previous findings. Using the sensitive and specific RNase protection assays, we have shown that TRAIL, but not FasL, is strongly induced in Tax-expressing Jurkat cells (Fig. 4) as well as in various HTLV-transformed T-cell lines (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Indeed, a TRAIL-blocking antibody can effectively inhibit Tax-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Our studies suggest that TRAIL is a major mediator of Tax-induced T-cell death. We thank Drs. G.

Smad4 plays a pivotal role in the TGF-β signaling pathway and has been identified as a tumor suppressor, being mutated or deleted in ∼50% of pancreatic carcinomas and 15% of colorectal cancers. A nonsense mutation generating a C-terminal truncation of 38 amino acids in the Smad4 protein has been identified in a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Hahn, S. A., Schutte, M., Hoque, A. T., Moskaluk, C.

(1996)Science 271, 350–353), and here we investigate the functional consequences of this mutation. We demonstrate that the C-terminal truncation prevents Smad4 homomeric complex formation and heteromeric complex formation with activated Smad2. Furthermore, the mutant protein is unable to be recruited to DNA by transcription factors and hence cannot form transcriptionally active DNA-binding complexes. These observations are supported by molecular modeling, which indicates that the truncation removes residues critical for homomeric and heteromeric Smad complex formation. We go on to show that the mutant Smad4 is highly unstable compared with wild type Smad4 and is rapidly degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that the pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring this mutated allele, in conjunction with loss of the other allele, expresses no Smad4 protein. Thus we conclude that these tumors completely lack Smad4 activity.

The ligand brings the two receptors together in a complex, and the constitutively active type II receptor kinase phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor kinase. The signal is transmitted to the nucleus by the Smads (1Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to TGF-β or activin, receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated and activated by the type I receptor and form complexes (probably trimeric) with a co-Smad (Smad4) (1Massagué J.

Smad3-Smad4 complexes bind DNA directly (3Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

At early stages TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor, presumably as a result of its ability to growth arrest epithelial cells from which the majority of tumors are derived. At late stages of tumorigenesis, TGF-β has tumor promoting activities, in particular causing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in tumor cells and enhancing invasiveness and malignancy (12Massagué J.

Pathol. 1999; 187: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although many tumor-derived cell lines are resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β, only in pancreatic and colorectal cancers is it clear that this is caused by inactivating mutations in components of the TGF-β signaling pathway (12Massagué J.

About half of pancreatic cancers contain either homozygous deletions of Smad4 or inactivating mutations in one allele associated with loss of the other allele (loss of heterozygosity) (23Hahn S.A.

The majority of the inactivating mutations, which are usually missense or nonsense mutations occur in the MH2 domain, although several have been identified in the MH1 domain and in the linker region (14Jonson T.

Many mutations in the MH2 domain have been shown to prevent homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization with other Smads (26Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P.

Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Recently, however, mutations in the MH1 domain have also been shown to target the proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (28Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).A nonsense mutation at residue 515 of one allele of Smad4 accompanied by loss of heterozygosity in the other has been identified in a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (23Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). The mutation generates a protein (Smad4 ΔC) that has a deletion of 38 amino acids at the C terminus. To understand how this naturally occurring mutation in Smad4 might contribute to tumor formation, we have analyzed its effect on Smad4 function. Using both in vitro and in vivo model systems, we demonstrate that Smad4 ΔC is unable to form homo or hetero-oligomeric interactions with other Smads in response to ligand. Furthermore, Smad4 ΔC is unable to be incorporated into a transcriptionally active DNA-binding complex with the transcription factors Fast-1 or Mixer. Most importantly, we show that Smad4 ΔC is a highly unstable protein that is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We go on to demonstrate that the pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring this mutated Smad4 allele, associated with loss of the other allele, expresses no Smad4 protein, consistent with this truncated Smad4 being highly unstable in vivo. Our findings contrast with previous data that concluded that this mutant Smad4 had dominant negative activity (29Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, our data provide an explanation for at least some of the apparent dominant negative activity of this mutant, because we demonstrate that in certain conditions, the mutant Smad4 can target co-expressed Smad2 for degradation. These results provide important new insights into the mechanism of inactivation of the tumor suppressor Smad4 in cancer. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 ligands require serine-threonine kinase receptors (type II and type I) to signal. The ligand brings the two receptors together in a complex, and the constitutively active type II receptor kinase phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor kinase. The signal is transmitted to the nucleus by the Smads (1Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to TGF-β or activin, receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated and activated by the type I receptor and form complexes (probably trimeric) with a co-Smad (Smad4) (1Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chacko B.M. Qin B. Correia J.J. Lam S.S. de Caestecker M.P. Lin K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The Smad complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they are directly involved in the regulation of transcription of target genes. Smad3-Smad4 complexes bind DNA directly (3Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), but Smad2-Smad4 complexes require specific transcription factors, e.g. Fast-1 or Mixer, to recruit them to specific promoter elements (4Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 5Germain S. Howell M. Esslemont G.M. Hill C.S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 435-451PubMed Google Scholar). R-Smads and co-Smads contain two well conserved domains, the N-terminal MH1 domain and the C-terminal MH2 domain, which are separated by a more divergent linker region. The MH1 domain is required for DNA binding in Smad3 and Smad4 and contains a nuclear localization signal (6Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), whereas the MH2 domain mediates many of the biological effects including interaction with other Smad proteins, transcription factors, co-activators, and co-repressors (reviewed in Ref. 11Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant TGF-β signaling has long been implicated in cancer (12Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 13Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). At early stages TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor, presumably as a result of its ability to growth arrest epithelial cells from which the majority of tumors are derived. At late stages of tumorigenesis, TGF-β has tumor promoting activities, in particular causing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in tumor cells and enhancing invasiveness and malignancy (12Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 13Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although many tumor-derived cell lines are resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β, only in pancreatic and colorectal cancers is it clear that this is caused by inactivating mutations in components of the TGF-β signaling pathway (12Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 14Jonson T. Gorunova L. Dawiskiba S. Andren-Sandberg A. Stenman G. ten Dijke P.

Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), a member of the importin β/karyopherin-β class (22Gorlich D. Kraft R. Kostka S. Vogel F. Hartmann E.

Three key players with restricted subcellular compartmentalization are thought to play a pivotal role in maintaining the predicted Ran-nucleotide bound gradient across the nuclear envelope. The chromatin-associated Ran-nucleotide exchange factor, RCC1 (32Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), promotes the production of nuclear Ran-GTP via the exchange of RanGDP to RanGTP (33Bischoff F.R. Postingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, RanGTP hydrolysis seems to be mediated by the costimulation of RanGTPase-activating protein (34Bischoff F. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and high affinity Ran-binding proteins (34Bischoff F. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W.

This mechanism presumably ensures that loading of cargo destined for nuclear import and unloading of nuclear exported substrates, and loading of cargo for nuclear export and unloading of nuclear imported cargo, respectively, are compartmentalized in the cytosol and nucleus.

RanBP1 is well conserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes (24Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 42Butler G. Wolfe K.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23179-23188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Fauser S. Aslanukov A. Roepman R. Ferreira P. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), four highly homologous RanBP1 domains (RBD n = 1–4), and no orthologs in yeast and Drosophila genomes (24Gorlich D. Kutay U.

Genome. 2001; 12: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In humans, the RanBP2 gene is partially duplicated once in chromosome 2 and designated RanBP2L1 (45Nothwang H.G. Rensing C. Kubler M. Denich D. Brandl B. Stubanus M. Haaf T. Kurnit D. Hildebrandt F. Genomics. 1998; 47: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This gene encodes the leucine-rich domain, two (RBD2 and RBD3) of the four RBDs of RanBP2, but lacks its zinc finger cluster, W1W2 tandem repeats, RBD4, cyclophilin, and the C-terminal part of CLD domains (44Fauser S. Aslanukov A. Roepman R. Ferreira P. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RanBP2 is highly expressed in retinal neurons (37Ferreira P.A. Hom J. Pak W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23179-23188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and is also shown to localize at cytoplasmic fibrils emanating from the nuclear pore complex of liver cells (38Wilken N. Senecal J.-L. Scheer U. Dabauvalle M.-C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol.

Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Several reports seem to implicate RanBP1 and RanBP2 in terminal steps of nuclear export and possibly, initial steps of nuclear import (10Melchior F. Guan T. Yokoyama N. Nishimoto T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nuclear export transporters, such as exportin-1, form stable complexes with their nuclear cargo in the presence of RanGTP (27Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 46Askjaer P. Jensen T.B. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16279-16286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These competent nuclear export complexes are thought to transverse the nuclear pore complex and dock at cytoplasmic stations at the cytosolic face of the nuclear pore complex or its vicinity (24Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 25Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In support of this model is the observation that the zinc finger-rich cluster domain of RanBP2 constitutes a specific docking site for exportin-1, and in contrast to the association of Ran-GTP with exportin-1, leptomycin-B does not affect this interaction (48Singh B. Patel H. Roepman R. Schick D. Ferreira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37370-37378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although progress has been made in identifying the components mediating nucleocytoplasmic transport, far less is known about how the cargoes are dispatched from (and to) the nuclear transport complexes once they exit the nucleus, disassembled/assembled into such complexes, and captured by downstream effectors involved in substrate targeting to various subcellular destinations. Recent structure-function analysis of RanBP2 (41Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T. Pak W. Travis G. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 48Singh B. Patel H. Roepman R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggests that selective domains of RanBP2 independently recruit specific molecular partners and provide a dynamic platform for the delivery (and/or reception) of cargoes to (and/or from) the downstream cytosolic components yet to be identified. RanBP2 contains several RBDs interspersed along its long primary structure. The zinc finger cluster domain (ZnF) of RanBP2 is flanked by the RBD1 and RBD2, suggesting that upon nuclear exiting and docking of exportin-1-RanGTP-cargo complexes to ZnF (48Singh B. Patel H. Roepman R. Schick D. Ferreira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37370-37378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), one or more of the neighboring RanBDs may promote the disassembly of nuclear complexes via RanGTP hydrolysis. Similarly, we previously found (49Ferreira P. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 50Ferreira P.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 455-468Crossref Google Scholar) that a domain with weak homology to the C-terminal cyclophilin domain of RanBP2, cyclophilin-like domain (CLD), which is flanked by RBD3 and RBD4, associates specifically and in a tissue-restricted fashion with components of the 19 S cap of the 26 S proteasome. This suggests that the predicted unfolding/chaperone activity of the 19 S regulatory particle (51Schubert U. Anton L. Gibbs J. Norbury C. Yewdell J. Bennink J. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 52Strickland E. Hakala K. Thomas P. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5565-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), in concert with RanGTP-mediated hydrolysis by the flanking RBDs, may also promote the disassembly of 19 S cap-associated cargoes, 19 S cap itself, and/or target some of the cargoes/carriers for possible degradation. In addition, if the mechanisms and components mediating the release and loading of nuclear cargo at the cytosolic face or vicinity of the nuclear pore complex are tightly coupled, and possibly subjected to regeneration, then factors mediating the delivery to, and transport from, the nuclear pore may be also subjected to analogous coupling and regenerating cycles. Such factors may also interface with nuclear shuttling components. This process is hinted, for example, by data reporting the localization at the nuclear pore complex of “atypical” proteins, such as Sec13p and related Seh1p, which have been implicated in ER to Golgi trafficking (53Pryer N.K. Salama N.R. Schekman R.W. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 54Siniossoglou S. Wimmer C. Rieger M. Doye V. Tekotte H. Weise C. Emig S. Segref A. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1996; 84: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the role of RanBP2 in the integration of signaling and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking processes, we postulated whether the segment region between the RBD2 and RBD3 of RanBP2, JX2, constitutes a novel functional domain. Here, we show that this previously unrecognized domain associates specifically, directly, and in a neuronal biased fashion with two members of kinesin heavy chain in vitro and in vivo. The implications of these findings are discussed. The ∼393-base pair EcoRI/SalI fragment encoding the junction region between the RBD2 and RBD3 domains of bovine RanBP2 (equivalent to the sequence of amino acids 1971–2102 and 2134–2265 of mouse (44Fauser S.

Isolation of cDNAs encoding the motor and coiled-coil/tail domains of KIF5s (see Fig. 2 in Supplemental Material) was carried out by polymerase chain reaction from normalized mouse brain (KIF5A, KIF5C) and kidney (KIF5B) cDNAs (mouse MTC panel;CLONTECH), and respective identities were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The 5′ and 3′ pairs of primers used to amplify the motor domains of KIF5B-N and KIF5C-N, respectively, were 5′-GCTCTAGACATGGCGGACCCGGCGGAG and 5′-CCCAAGCTTAGCATCAATACTTGCTAAAGTTGCAGA, and 5′-GGAATTCCGATGGCGGATCCAGCCGAATGCAGC and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCGCTGGGTGGTTGTCAGTGT. The 5′ and 3′ pair of primers to amplify the coiled-coil/tail domains of KIF5A-C, KIF5B-C and KIF5C-C, respectively, were 5′-GAATTCCGCAGAAAGTGGCCACCATGCTG and 5′-GCGTCGACTTAGCTGGCTGCTGTCTCTTG, 5′-GCTCTAGACGCAACTTTAGCAAGTATTGATGCTGAG and 5′-GCTCTAGATTACGACTGCTTGCCTCCACCACC, and 5′-GGAATTCCGGCCCAGAAAACGACGACACTGACA and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTATTTCTGGTAGTGAGTAGAGTTTGAAGAGCC. All KIF5s constructs were subcloned into pGEX-KG, expressed, and purified on an AKTA explorer fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and whenever applicable, the fused protein moiety was cleaved off from GST with thrombin as described elsewhere (48Singh B.

CHAPS extracts were prepared in the presence of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). GST-bound complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and silver-stained as described (50Ferreira P.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 455-468Crossref Google Scholar). The bovine retinal p120 protein was purified by scaling up the analytical binding reactions ∼1000-fold. GST-bound complexes were incubated twice with elution buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 10 min, and eluted p120 was concentrated and the buffer exchanged with storage buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) in Centricon-100 (Millipore) at 4 °C. Eluted samples were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and destained, and the SDS-PAGE band containing retinal p120 was isolated. Sample and neighboring mock (blank) gel pieces were placed on prewashed Eppendorf tubes (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile) and washed in 50% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and then 50% acetonitrile, 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min on a nutator. Gel slices were dried in a SpeedVac followed by in-gel trypsin digestion (0.1 μg of trypsin/∼15 mm3 of gel in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate) of the mock and protein samples at 37 °C for 24 h. Tryptic peptide mixtures were divided into two pools. 5 (v/v) and 95% (v/v) of the sample were subjected to MALDI-MS and Q-Tof MS/MS, respectively, for peptide mass spectra analysis and determination of peptide sequences. Peptide fingerprint analysis against NCBI and EMBL nonredundant data base was performed with Profound and PeptideSearch using a mass tolerance of ±0.012% for monoisotopic and ±0.05% for observed average masses. For Q-Tof analysis, samples were cleaned with a small packed “ZipTip.” MS/MS spectra were searched using the Sequest search program. Mass spectrometry analyses of retinal p120 were carried out at the Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory of Yale University. Two rabbit antibodies were generated against the recombinant (∼100 μg) and GST-cleaved ZnF (ZnF-20909 and ZnF-20908 antibodies) and junction region between RBD2 and RBD3, JX2 (JX-40 and JX-41 antibodies), of bovine RanBP2 (Fig. 1 a) as described elsewhere (37Ferreira P.A.

All antibodies were purified against the cognate-purified antigens under non-denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stereogene, Arcadia, CA). Affinity-purified antibodies, ZnF-20909 and ZnF-20908, and JX-40 and JX-41, respectively, were used at 0.4 and 0.3 ng/ml.

Anti-Ran monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used at 1:5,000 dilution. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA), was used at 25 ng/ml, and the blots were developed with the SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). CHAPS-solubilized bovine extracts of different tissues and bovine and human retinal homogenates were prepared and concentrations determined exactly as described previously (50Ferreira P.A.

In vitro association assays between recombinant GST-fused domains of KIF5 isoforms and unfused JX2 of RanBP2 were performed under similar conditions in CHAPS incubation buffer as described. Antibodies were incubated with protein A-agarose beads in a phosphate-saline buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min. The beads were precipitated and washed 3 times with 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with retinal extracts solubilized in Nonidet P-40 homogenization buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 NaCl, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0) without β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (57Roepman R.

https://openalex.org/W2038859299,"Programmed cell death (PCD) in many systems is controlled by relative amounts of the apoptosis-regulating proteins Bax and Bcl-2 through homo- or heterodimerization. Here we show that Bax-induced PCD of yeast was suppressed by transformation with a vesicle-associated membrane protein from Arabidopsis(AtVAMP), which was isolated by screening a cDNA expression library against sugar-induced cell death in yeast. AtVAMP expression blocked Bax-induced PCD downstream of oxidative burst. AtVAMP also prevented H2O2-induced apoptosis in yeast and inArabidopsis cells. Reduced oxidation of lipids and plasma membrane proteins was detected in the AtVAMP-transformed yeast, suggesting improved membrane repair. Inhibition of intracellular vesicle trafficking by brefeldin A induced apoptosis from a sublethal concentration of H2O2. No protection occurred by overexpression of the yeast homolog SCN2. However, efficient suppression of yeast PCD occurred by expression of a chimeric gene, composed of the conserved domains from yeast, fused to the variable N-terminal domain from Arabidopsis, resulting in exchange of the proline-rich N-terminal domain of SCN2 with a proline-poor Arabidopsis sequence. Our results suggest that intracellular vesicle traffic can regulate execution of apoptosis by affecting the rate of membrane recycling and that the proline-rich N-terminal domain of VAMP inhibited this process. Programmed cell death (PCD) in many systems is controlled by relative amounts of the apoptosis-regulating proteins Bax and Bcl-2 through homo- or heterodimerization.

PCD1 plays important roles in many diverse processes from development to stress responses. The function of PCD ranges from organismal sculpting by elimination of specific tissue areas (e.g. interdigit spaces in animals or xylem formation in plants) to removal of sublethally stressed cells. PCD is manifested by characteristic morphological and biochemical features (1Matsuyama S. Nouraini S. Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although considerable differences in the mechanism of PCD exist among the kingdoms, recent studies show that many basic hallmarks of apoptosis are conserved among animal and plant cells (2Pennell R.I. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 3Ryerson D.E. Heath M.C. Wang H. Li J. Bostock R.M. Gilchrist D.G. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1 (212): 212Google Scholar) and even in unicellular organisms, such as dinoflagellates (4Vardi A. Berman-Frank I. Rozenberg T. Hadas O. Kaplan A. Levine A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 13: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and yeast (5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Expression of a proapoptotic mammalian protein Bax in yeast or in plants, which lack the counteracting Bcl-2 gene, induced PCD with characteristics of apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation and exposition of phosphatidylserine (5Madeo F.

Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and a number of genes that suppress yeast cell death have been isolated from animal and plant cells (8Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Kampfenkel K. Belles-Boix E. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10580-10584Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, a homologue of glutathioneS-transferase from tomato was isolated by screening yeast against Bax-induced PCD, which suppressed cell death by restoring mitochondrial function (9Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In yeast, apoptosis can also be caused by sugar, a phenomenon termed sugar-induced cell death, whereby yeast cell death is triggered by transfer of resting (nondividing) cells from water to medium containing metabolized sugars but without a nitrogen source (10Granot D. Dai N. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have screened an expression library ofArabidopsis cDNA (11Minet M. Dufour M.-E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) for genes that suppress sugar-induced cell death in yeast. Several genes were isolated, one of which had high homology to the family of eukaryotic synaptobrevins or VAMPs (vesicle-associated membrane protein), which belong to the v-SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors). Comparison with theArabidopsis genome data base showed that the isolated gene corresponded to GenBankTM accession number AF025332but was missing the first 74 amino acids. The highest homology of the isolated sequence (ΔNAtVAMP) was to VAMP7 gene from rat (41% identity and 64% similarity) and was therefore termed ΔNAtVAMP7. VAMPs, which are conserved from yeast to mammals, constitute the major vesicle-associated component and play an important role in vesicle docking through interaction with their counterpart t-SNAREs in the target membranes. The SNAREs, particularly VAMPs and syntaxins, are specifically localized throughout the secretory pathways, including the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the early endosomes, and the plasma membrane (12Advani R.J. Yang B. Prekeris R. Lee K.C. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Both v- and t-SNAREs contain α-helical coiled-coil domains that carry out the interaction between them. The target specificity of the vesicle is determined by the different SNAREs together with an associated family of Rab proteins (13Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sellner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The VAMPs/synaptobrevins are composed of highly conserved C-terminal regions, which contain α-helix coils that participate in the v-SNARE binding to t-SNARE in the target membrane, and of a variable proline-rich N-terminal region that has been considered to be either dispensable or to exert an inhibitory effect on vesicle fusion (14Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16591-16598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,15Hazzard J. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, vesicle trafficking is responsible for the delivery of proteins to organelles as well as membrane recycling, both of which are crucial processes for normal cell functioning. Membrane recycling is particularly important during oxidative stress, which causes damage to membrane components by lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. Failure to repair the membranes will result in the loss of membrane integrity and ion leakage, leading to cell death. The cellular responses to oxidative stress range from induction of stress genes to induction of apoptosis or necrosis (16Levine A. Tenhaken R. Dixon R. Lamb C. Cell. 1994; 79: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar, 17Korsmeyer S.J. Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Veis-Novack D.J. Linette G.P. Biochim. Biophys.

A key role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated in the PCD in many different organisms including animals, plants, and yeast (4Vardi A. Berman-Frank I. Rozenberg T. Hadas O. Kaplan A. Levine A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 13: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 19Korsmeyer S.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 101-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 20Levine A. Pennell R. Alvarez M. Palmer R. Lamb C.J. Curr.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 22Clement M.V. Pervaiz S. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The failure to maintain membrane integrity could therefore be a major cause of cell death during stress. Here we show that accelerated membrane recycling through ectopic expression of a major vesicle trafficking protein can suppress the PCD process beyond the step of oxidative stress. Yeast (Y426, Mata, ura3-52, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-98) cells were grown in selective (Ura− or Ura−Trp−) synthetic complete medium containing either glucose (2%) or galactose (2%) at 30 °C with continuous shaking or were plated on synthetic complete medium plates. Mouse Bax clone (BF339) was a gift from Gross and Korsmeyer (23Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Bax in this plasmid was under a constitutiveADH promoter, and accordingly this plasmid gave colonies on Ura−Trp− plates only when co-transformed with ΔNAtVAMP7. To prepare the galactose-inducible GAL-Bax construct, the Bax gene was excised from pBF339 with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of pYES2 vector (Invitrogen). For double transformants pYES2-Bax (GAL-Bax)-carrying yeast cells were transformed with the VAMP vector and selected on Ura− + galactose plates. Bax expression was confirmed by Western blotting (23Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and by reisolation of the Bax clone and transformation of yeast cells. Yeast transformations were done by electroporation, and colonies were selected by plating on selective media. ROS were determined as described previously (5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) except that cultures were incubated with the dye for 30 min. The SNC2-AtVAMP chimeric construct was made by exchanging the 31 N-terminal amino acids of the pADSNC2 plasmid (14Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16591-16598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with 63 N-terminal amino acids from pGEMΔNAtVAMP7 by using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction. A DNA fragment corresponding to residues 1–63 of the ΔNAtVAMP7 was generated by using an internal chimeric primer (TCAATCTCACCCTTAATACG) that covered the junction between the variable and the conserved region. In a separate reaction a conserved region from the SNC2 yeast gene was amplified by using a second chimeric primer (TTAAGGGTGAGATTGATGAC) containing the same flanking sequence. The resulting fragments with the hybridizing ends were combined to produce the chimeric fragment and then amplified using the primers CTCGAGATGGTGAGTAATTTA and CTCGAGTTACGTGAAATGGAC, which contained a built-in XhoI recognition site for subsequent cloning into the pRS424 vector. The chimeric construct was fully sequenced to verify the correct nucleotide sequence. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures, originally isolated by May and Leaver (24May M.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), were kept at 25 °C under constant light in Murashige and Skoog medium, pH 6.0, supplemented with 100 mg/liter myo-inositol, 0.4 mg/liter thiamine, 0.5 mg/liter α-naphthaleneacetic acid, 0.05 mg/liter kinetin, and 3% sucrose. Cells were treated with H2O2 in 12-well culture dishes. Transient transformation was achieved as described previously (25Amor Y. Babiychuk E. Inze D. Levine A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Solomon M. Belenghi B. Delledonne M. Levine A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The percentage of transformed cells was estimated to be >65% by staining cultures transformed with the β-glucuronidase (pBI121, control)-carrying plasmid with X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-glucuronic acid) and microscopic examination. Northern blot analysis of transformedArabidopsis cells was as described previously (26Solomon M. Belenghi B. Delledonne M. Levine A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress and cell death were assayed with 2,7-dihydrodichlorofluorescein and propidium iodide, respectively, as described previously (5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). For quantitative fluorescence measurements cells were normalized according to cell number and analyzed in a BioTek FL600 fluorometer. Cells were viewed with an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope and photographed with a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera. H2O2half-life was estimated by the addition of 1 mmH2O2 and the periodic removal of aliquots from the culture and measurement of the remaining H2O2. Arabidopsis cell death was measured as previously described (16Levine A. Tenhaken R. Dixon R. Lamb C. Cell. 1994; 79: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 3 min and washed two times with water. Cells were resuspended in 0.9 m sorbitol and treated with 40 μg/ml glucanase at 24 °C with gentle shaking. After 1 h cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 0.2 ml of Solution A (0.8 m sorbitol, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MnCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 μl of Sigma protease inhibitors mix), and homogenized with glass beads. Particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of water. Lipid hydroperoxides were measured with a Lipid Hydroperoxide (LPO) Assay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Proteins were labeled with 300 cpm/ml Promix ([35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine) fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material were used for analysis of label incorporation into peripheral membrane proteins. Yeast cells were protoplasted with 0.1 mg/ml lyticase (Sigma) in citrate buffer in the presence of 0.8 m sorbitol. Cell wall removal was verified by observing swelling of >95% of cells when placed in water. Protoplasts were washed twice in sorbitol and incubated with 3.6 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (CLONTECH) for 30 min in sorbitol and phosphate buffer, pH 7. After removal of unreacted biotin by two steps of centrifugation (4,000 × g, 5 min), the supernatant was discarded, and cells were lysed by 1 min of Vortex mixing after a 10-min incubation on ice. The membrane proteins were collected by binding biotin-incorporated material with avidin-coated beads (107 beads/ml of lysate) (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Protein oxidation was assayed by the carbonyl method as described previously (27Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). In animals, it was found that PCD is often controlled by relative amounts of the apoptosis-regulating proteins Bax and Bcl-2 through homo- or heterodimerization (19Korsmeyer S.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 101-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). An excess of Bax promotes apoptosis, while Bcl-2 suppresses it. Expression of Bax in yeast, which lack Bcl-2, induces apoptosis via generation of oxidative stress (5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 21Frohlich K.U. Madeo F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To see whether in addition to suppressing sugar-induced cell death, the isolated plant gene (ΔNAtVAMP7), could block Bax-induced apoptosis, yeast cells were transformed with Bax driven by a galactose-regulated promoter (GAL-Bax) and with ΔNAtVAMP7 driven by a constitutive (PGK) promoter. The double (Bax+ΔNAtVAMP7) transformants and the individual (ΔNAtVAMP7 or Bax) transformants were inoculated into glucose- or galactose-containing media. All cells grew on glucose, but when transferred to galactose only the ΔNAtVAMP7-containing cells continued to grow (Fig.1 A). Identical results were also obtained by replacing the isolated truncated ΔNAtVAMP7 with the full-length Arabidopsis gene, which included the missing 74 N-terminal amino acids (AtVAMP7). However, no protection was observed by overexpression of the yeast homolog SNC2 gene. To determine the region responsible for protection against Bax-induced apoptosis we constructed a chimeric gene in which the first 31 amino acids of SNC2 were exchanged with the remaining 63 N-terminal amino acids of the variable domain from Arabidopsis. This resulted in a gene that contained the conserved domains from yeast fused to the variable N-terminal domain from Arabidopsis (Fig. 1 B). Transformation of yeast with this construct was as effective as the full-length AtVAMP7 or the truncated ΔNAtVAMP7 genes (Fig.1 C). The conservative domain contains many α-helical domains and is thought to participate in protein-protein interactions during vesicle docking (14Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16591-16598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), while the variable N-terminal region was shown to exhibit inhibitory activity on vesicle binding to the syntaxins in the target membrane (15Hazzard J. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The effective protection against Bax-induced cell death by the AtVAMP-SNC2 chimeric gene shows that the conserved domains of VAMPs are interchangeable between organisms as diverse as yeast and plants. It has been suggested that the variable N-terminal domain of mammalian VAMP/synaptobrevin plays opposing roles in neurotransmitter release and that proline-rich regions are responsible for this effect (29Cornille F. Deloye F. Fourniezaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Poulain B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16826-16832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of the N-terminal domain of VAMP7 stimulated neurite outgrowth, suggesting an important function of this domain for the VAMP7 activity (30Martinez-Arca S. Alberts P. Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This conclusion is also supported by the NMR analysis of the interaction of human synaptobrevin-2 with the syntaxin N-terminal domain (15Hazzard J. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Importantly, while in the yeast SNC2 gene there are 5 prolines in the 32 residues of the variable region (4 of them within a single stretch of 8 amino acids), in the whole variable domain of the full-length Arabidopsis VAMP, there are 3 prolines within 130 amino acids (with none of them located close to each other). The presence of Bax in the colonies was confirmed by restriction analysis of plasmids recovered from individual clones and grown inEscherichia coli (Fig.2 A). The recovered Bax-encoding plasmids were reintroduced into yeast cells. Colonies, which failed to grow on galactose-containing medium, were obtained on glucose plates (data not shown). Expression of Bax in the double (Bax+ΔNAtVAMP7) transformants was verified by Western blotting, which showed exclusive expression in the presence of galactose (Fig.2 B). To see whether Bax expression resulted in cell death or merely stopped yeast growth, 5-μl aliquots of culture were removed after 6 and 12 h and plated on a glucose-containing plate in sequential dilutions. Co-transformation with ΔNAtVAMP7 or with AtVAMP7 (not shown) rescued the extensive death observed in cells transformed with Bax alone. In cultures transformed with both plasmids colonies were established even after 10,000-fold dilution. This is in contrast to cultures that expressed only Bax, in which by 12 h the number of formed colonies was reduced already after 10–100-fold dilution, and almost no cells were rescued after 1,000-fold dilution (Fig. 2 C). Production of ROS has been demonstrated as one of the critical steps in many types of apoptosis (17Korsmeyer S.J. Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Veis-Novack D.J. Linette G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), although in certain systems apoptosis occurs in the absence of ROS (31Hug H. Enari M. Nagata S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In yeast, ROS generation was shown to a have a key role in Bax-induced apoptosis (5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to find out whether ectopic expression of AtVAMP7 interfered with the PCD process before or after ROS generation. To this end, yeast cells were transformed with Bax alone or with Bax together with ΔNAtVAMP7 and grown in a glucose-based medium to a mid-log phase, after which they were transferred to a galactose-based medium. ROS production was examined 6 and 12 h after changing the medium (5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). No ROS were detected in cells in glucose-based medium, but substantial ROS accumulation was observed in Bax-producing cells, regardless of ΔNAtVAMP7 expression (Fig.3 A). The amount of ROS produced by yeast cells that were transformed with Bax alone was only slightly higher than by cells expressing both Bax and ΔNAtVAMP7 as determined by fluorescence measurements of an equal number of cells in a spectrofluorometer (Fig. 3 B) or by integration of the signal intensity of the digital image within individual cells (data not shown). ROS induction was not a consequence of yeast transfer into the galactose-based medium since the cells transformed with a control plasmid (pFL61) did not accumulate ROS after transfer to galactose. The above results indicated that the protection provided by ΔNAtVAMP7 occurred downstream of Bax-induced oxidative stress. We therefore examined the ability of ΔNAtVAMP7 to protect yeast from oxidative stress produced by the direct addition of H2O2. Earlier work, which was reproduced by us, showed that 3–5 mm H2O2 induced a typical PCD in yeast (5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). When compared with control cells, the ΔNAtVAMP7 transformants grew much better after treatment with 3 mmH2O2 (Fig.4 A). No protection was observed from a necrogenic dose of 9 mmH2O2. The increased viability of the ΔNAtVAMP7 transformants was confirmed by rescue-plating cells into fresh medium. Aliquots were removed 12 h after H2O2 treatment and plated on agar in a series of 10-fold dilutions. Cells that were transformed with the control vector produced a small number of colonies after the first round of dilution, and no colonies were seen after 100-fold dilution, indicating extensive cell death in the culture exposed to 3 mmH2O2 (Fig. 4 B). ΔNAtVAMP7 transformants, however, formed a substantial amount of colonies after a 100-fold dilution, and a small number of colonies was seen even after a 1,000-fold dilution. Since VAMP is not expected to directly affect ROS detoxification, these results indicate that the ectopic expression of ΔNAtVAMP7 succeeded in interfering with the execution of ROS-induced PCD. Protection against oxidative stress-induced PCD by ectopic expression of AtVAMP7 was also tested in plant cells. To this end, AtVAMP7 was cloned into a binary expression vector under the control of a constitutively expressed cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and introduced into Arabidopsis cells viaAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (26Solomon M. Belenghi B. Delledonne M. Levine A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 32Krausgrill S. Greiner S. Koester U. Vogel R. Rausch T. Plant J. 1998; 13: 275-280Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression of the gene was verified by Northern blotting (Fig.4 C, inset). The cell culture was treated with H2O2 at a concentration that induces PCD (20Levine A. Pennell R. Alvarez M. Palmer R. Lamb C.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar,33Desikan R. Reynolds A. Hancock J.T. Neill S.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The ectopic expression of AtVAMP7 reduced cell death from 76% in cultures transformed with a control vector to 46%, indicating efficient suppression of PCD in the homologous system as well (Fig.4 C). The actual protection was even higher since the procedure of A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation of suspension-cultured plant cells results in transient expression of the transgene in 60–70% of cells (25Amor Y. Babiychuk E. Inze D. Levine A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Solomon M. Belenghi B. Delledonne M. Levine A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Since VAMPs are known to function in intracellular vesicle transport (14Gerst J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we examined the involvement of vesicle trafficking in H2O2-induced PCD. Intracellular vesicular traffic was blocked with a specific inhibitor, brefeldin A (BFA), which causes reversible dissolution of the Golgi complex in many cells, including yeast (35Sata M. Donaldson J.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4204-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were treated with a sublethal dose of H2O2 (see Fig. 4) in the presence or absence of BFA. Pretreatment of culture with BFA followed by the addition of a mild dose of 1.5 mm H2O2 strongly reduced yeast growth (Fig.5 A). The growth reduction was associated with increased cell death as evaluated by parallel measurements of propidium iodide staining, which tests the plasma membrane integrity (Fig. 5 B). The collapse of plasma membrane occurs late in the apoptotic program and constitutes the terminal stage of PCD (36Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6204) Google Scholar, 37Xiang J.L. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ΔNAtVAMP7 diminished the effect of BFA, supporting the involvement of vesicular trafficking in yeast cell death and implying that AtVAMP7 and BFA operate in the same pathway. The ΔNAtVAMP7 transformants also showed improved survival when assayed by culture dilution and colony growth on plates (Fig. 5 C). The effects of ΔNAtVAMP7 and BFA implied that the vesicle trafficking system may be involved in the execution of yeast PCD. One possible mechanism for the anti-PCD mode of action of AtVAMP could be increased repair of oxidatively damaged membranes, which is crucial for cell viability. VAMP7 was indeed shown to function in vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane (38Hibi T. Hirashima N. Nakanishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To examine the changes in the plasma membrane condition during oxidative stress, we analyzed lipid and protein oxidation in control and ΔNAtVAMP7-expressing cells. Both cultures were treated with a PCD-inducing dose of 5 mmH2O2, and the amount of lipid hydroperoxides was analyzed 2 h later, which is ∼4 h before the first cells begin to show loss of membrane integrity (Ref. 5Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar and our own results). ΔNAtVAMP7 expression reduced the amount of lipid hydroperoxides by about 2.5-fold (Fig. 6 A). ΔNAtVAMP7 also reduced the degree of membrane protein oxidation after 5, 30, and 120 min of H2O2 treatment. While in control cells protein oxidation increased during this period, due to the slow clearance of H2O2 from the culture (the half-life of 1 mm H2O2 in the yeast cultures was measured to be 30 min), in the ΔNAtVAMP7 transformants the protein oxidation was lower, and the level decreased further during the incubation period (Fig. 6 B). These results are in agreement with the suppression of yeast PCD from Bax- or H2O2-triggered death by improved repair of oxidative damage by overexpressing a tomato glutathione S-transferase homologue (9Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To study the effect of ΔNAtVAMP7 expression on the exchange of plasma membrane proteins we analyzed changes in protein trafficking to the plasma membrane. Newly synthesized proteins were labeled with a radioactive mixture of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine that was added together with a PCD-inducing dose of H2O2 for 2 h. Samples were normalized according to equal label incorporation, and the membrane proteins were separated from the cytosol by first incubating the protoplasts with N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin and then collecting the biotin-coupled proteins with avidin-coated beads. In the control cells H2O2 treatment almost completely stopped the incorporation of new proteins into the plasma membrane, but in the ΔNAtVAMP7 transformants protein export was essentially unaffected (Fig. 7 A). The greatly diminished incorporation of the label into the plasma membrane was not a consequence of reduced protein synthesis as indicated by equal labeling of the cytosolic proteins (Fig. 7 B). In eukaryotic cells, proteins are transported to organelles by a series of membrane transport steps, which are regulated by specific interactions between syntaxins and v-SNAREs. Interestingly, VAMP7 has been implicated in vesicle trafficking specifically to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells (39Lafont F. Verkade P. Galli T. Wimmer C. Louvard D. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3734-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover, VAMP7 localizes to vesicles in the dendritic outgrowths and concentrates into the leading edge of the growth cone, suggesting a specific function in the biogenesis or in the recycling of defined parts of the plasma membrane (40Coco S. Raposo G. Martinez S. Fontaine J.J. Takamori S. Zahraoui A. Jahn R. Matteoli M. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9803-9812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-localization of VAMP7 with endosomes and inhibition of internalization of certain membrane proteins by anti-VAMP7 antibodies suggested that VAMP7 is important for membrane trafficking events (12Advani R.J. Yang B. Prekeris R. Lee K.C. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In light of the above observations, the increased protein delivery to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7) strongly suggests that AtVAMP7 assisted plasma membrane repair. Very little data exists in the literature on the link between vesicle traffic and apoptosis. Caspase-mediated cleavage of kinectin, which is the membrane anchor for microtubule-based vesicle movement, is a general feature of tumor necrosis factor-, Fas-, or radiation-induced apoptosis in human cells and results in disruption of membrane trafficking (41Machleidt T. Geller P. Schwandner R. Scherer G. Kronke M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that perturbations in vesicular traffic could affect capacitative calcium entry, resulting in apoptosis (42Jayadev S. Petranka J.G. Cheran S.K. Biermann J.A. Barrett J.C. Murphy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8261-8268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Inhibition of vesicle fusion to membranes by the inactivation of an essential component of endosome fusion, Rabaptin-5, has been reported in several models of apoptosis (43Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that Rabaptin-5 is cleaved specifically by caspase-3, which causes a subsequent decrease in endosome fusion, thus directly affecting the membrane recycling (44Swanton E. Bishop N. Woodman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37583-37590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 expression prevented the cleavage of Rabaptin-5 and the inhibition of endosome fusion as well as the subsequent apoptosis, suggesting that membrane recycling is involved in the late stages of apoptosis (43Cosulich S.C. Horiuchi H. Zerial M. Clarke P.R. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6182-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutant yeast strain, KFY437, that is deficient in theCDC48 gene, which controls the homotypic fusion of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles, exhibits a spontaneous apoptotic phenotype, which is partially suppressed by ROS scavengers (45Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Spontaneous apoptosis also occurs in Drosophilamutants in the small-minded (smid) gene, which is the animal homolog of CDC48 (46Long A.R. Wilkins J.C. Shepherd D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Severe lethality of vesicle trafficking mutants also occurs in A. thaliana, which possesses an especially large arsenal of v- and t-SNAREs (47Sanderfoot A.A. Assaad F.F. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1558-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These observations are in line with the results presented here and suggest that the intracellular vesicle trafficking is closely connected with PCD. Hence, perturbations in trafficking can induce apoptosis, while enhanced trafficking can inhibit apoptosis in an indirect way by increased membrane recycling. In summary, our results show that apoptosis induced by Bax or by oxidative stress is a dynamic process during which there is a progressive deterioration of membrane integrity, leading to apoptosis, that could be prevented by improved recycling of the membrane components through overexpression of one of the vesicle docking proteins. Since oxidative stress is closely associated with many signaling events, including the induction of apoptosis in many systems (16Levine A. Tenhaken R. Dixon R. Lamb C. Cell. 1994; 79: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar, 48Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, other earlier studies showed that cytokine-stimulated STAT3 signaling activation required a secondary phosphorylation modification at the serine/threonine residues, possibly by H7-sensitive kinase (9Boulton T.G.

Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Later, a serine phosphorylation of STAT3, as well as STAT1, 4 and 5, was found to be induced in a stimulus-related manner (4Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Further, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727, like Tyr705, was shown to be essential for its full activation (11Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 12Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Additionally, STAT3 signaling activation by environmental stresses, such as heat and osmotic shock, short wave UV light, free radicals, or hypoxia, was also shown to involve induction of multiple signaling pathways (15Gatsios P. Terstegen L. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22962-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Lim C.P. Cao X. J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These findings, therefore, indicate that STAT3 may be a convergent point for integrating signals from multiple pathways (18Janknecht R. Hunter T. Science. 1999; 284: 443-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). More interestingly, only Ser727phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed to be stimulated by insulin, anisomycin, tumor necrosis factor-α, or arsenite and, to a weaker extent, by NaCl, okadaic acid, or lipopolysaccharide (16Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Ceresa B.P. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

These observations indicate that Ser727 phosphorylation may play an important role in mediating the activation of STAT3 independently of Tyr705phosphorylation. Moreover, Ser727 lies within a potential mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) consensus motif of the C-terminal domain (11Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 12Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S.

Ser727 phosphorylation is, thereby, postulated to occur through activation of MAPKs, including ERKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinase (4Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 22Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). However, identification of the kinases responsible for Ser727phosphorylation has not been fully resolved (4Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 23Kovarik P. Mangold M. Ramsauer K. Heidari H. Steinborn R. Zotter A. Levy D.E. Müller M. Decker T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying the STAT3 (Ser727) kinases will provide a clearer understanding of the mechanisms of STAT3 activation. Activation of STAT3 signaling was shown to be involved in regulation of diverse cell processes, including growth, differentiation, proliferation, transformation, as well as apoptosis (24Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 25Williams J.G. Curr. Opin. Gen.

Furthermore, STAT3 was confirmed to be an oncogene (27Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), and its mediated signaling pathways were initiated by carcinogens (28Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar, 29Frank D.A. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 432-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Song J.I. Grandis J.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2489-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Solar UV irradiation is believed to be one of the most important skin carcinogens (31Griffiths H.R. Mistry P. Herbert K.E. Lunec J. Crit. Rev. Clinic. Lab. Sci. 1998; 35: 189-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Woodhead A.D. Setlow R.B. Tanaka M. J. Epidemiol. 1999; 9: S102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The UV components of sunlight reaching the surface of the earth are UVB (290–320 nm) and UVA (320–400 nm). UVC (200–290 nm) is completely absorbed by the ozone layer of the atmosphere of the earth (31Griffiths H.R. Mistry P. Herbert K.E. Lunec J. Crit. Rev. Clinic. Lab. Sci. 1998; 35: 189-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and, therefore, is unlikely to have major pathophysiological effects. UVB is also partially absorbed by the ozone layer, and efficient protection can be provided by using sunscreen (31Griffiths H.R. Mistry P. Herbert K.E. Lunec J. Crit. Rev. Clinic. Lab. Sci. 1998; 35: 189-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,32Woodhead A.D. Setlow R.B. Tanaka M. J. Epidemiol. 1999; 9: S102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). UVA thus constitutes more than 90% of solar UV and is a major contributor to carcinogenesis (31Griffiths H.R. Mistry P. Herbert K.E. Lunec J. Crit. Rev. Clinic. Lab. Sci. 1998; 35: 189-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Woodhead A.D. Setlow R.B. Tanaka M. J. Epidemiol. 1999; 9: S102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Moan J. Dahlback A. Setlow R.B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 243Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To date, an array of signaling pathways are known to be activated in UV-induced carcinogenesis (34Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1997; 37: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,35Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, STAT1 was reported to be activated through tyrosine phosphorylation in response to UVA (36Maziere C. Dantin F. Dubois F. Santus R. Maziere J. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1430-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, whether STAT3 signaling in oncogenesis is stimulated by UVA is not clear. In the UVB/UVC response, activation of STAT3 signaling was triggered by phosphorylation at Ser727 but not at Tyr705(16Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ser727 phosphorylation was also shown to be critical for constitutive or aberrant activation of STAT3 signaling in tumorigenesis (4Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 28Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R.

To facilitate an understanding of the role for the STAT3 signaling pathway in UVA-induced skin carcinogenesis, the serine/threonine kinase pathways through which Ser727 in STAT3 is phosphorylated in UVA-irradiated epidermal JB6 cells were investigated. We provide evidence that UVA-induced Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 may occur through JNKs and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), a downstream kinase of both ERKs and p38 kinase.

Here, the nonirradiated cells in the UV box were used as negative controls. The treated cell lysates were harvested in SDS sample buffer and resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes followed by Western blotting analysis with specific antibodies against phospho-STAT3 (Ser727), phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), phospho-MSK1 (Ser376), STAT3 (Cell Signaling, Inc., Beverly, MA), or MSK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). For a detailed description of the assay see Zhang et al.(42Zhang Y. Dong Z.M. Nomura M. Zhong S. Chen N. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J..Biol.

Additionally, the intensity of the bands in some Western blots was calculated using the Image-Quant Microsoft system or the recommended system (www.totallab.com). After starvation for 48 h in 0.1% FBS with minimum essential medium, JB6 Cl 41 cells were disrupted in 300 μl of lysis buffer A containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifuging at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and then equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a STAT3 antibody (42Zhang Y. Dong Z.M. Nomura M. Zhong S. Chen N. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J..Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20913-20923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The immune complex containing STAT3 proteins was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min with active ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, JNK2, p38 kinase, or MSK1 (Upstate Biotechnology) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, and 0.01% Brij 35) (Cell Signaling) after washing twice with lysis buffer A and twice with kinase buffer. Subsequently, Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 was detected by Western blot analysis as described previously (42Zhang Y. Dong Z.M. Nomura M. Zhong S. Chen N. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J..Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20913-20923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Nonphosphorylated STAT3 was used as an internal control to verify equal protein loading. To further evaluate STAT3 phosphorylation catalyzed by MSK1, the immunoprecipitated STAT3 from nonirradiated JB6 cell lysates was incubated with active MSK1 or JNK1 at the indicated doses in the above kinase buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After quantifying by scintillation counting, radioactive phosphate incorporated into immunoprecipitated STAT3 was calculated (www.upstatebiotech.com). In addition, to assess the specificity of the phospho-STAT3 (Ser727) antibody, UVA-irradiated cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a phospho-STAT3 (Ser727) antibody preincubated with a 5-fold concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA) or STAT3 blocking peptides containing phospho-specific Ser727 (sc-8001P) or Tyr705(sc-7993P), a C terminus with no Ser727 or Tyr705 sites (sc-482P), or an internal domain (sc-483P) of STAT3 p92 of mouse origin (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at room temperature. Then phosphorylated STAT3 p92 was visualized using Western blots with the phospho-STAT3 (Ser727) antibody. The immune complex MSK1 activity assay with the Akt/SGK peptide as a substrate was employed according to the recommended procedure of Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (www.upstatebiotech.com) (44Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In brief, treated or untreated cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a MSK1 antibody as reported (42Zhang Y. Dong Z.M. Nomura M. Zhong S. Chen N. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J..Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20913-20923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Then the immune complex containing MSK1 proteins was incubated with agitation for 15 min at 30 °C in a mixture of the following: 20 μl of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), 10 μl of the Akt/SGK substrate peptide in assay dilution buffer, and 10 μl of [γ-32P] ATP solution (1 μCi/μl, diluted in 75 mm MgCl2 and 500 μm unlabeled ATP). To stop the reaction, the samples were spotted onto a numbered P81 paper square and washed three times (5 min each) with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once (3 min) with acetone. Each sample paper was transferred into a scintillation vial containing 5 ml of scintillation fluid and counted in a β-scintillation counter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to detect STAT3 DNA binding activity after exposure of the cells to UVA irradiation (16Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 36Maziere C. Dantin F. Dubois F. Santus R. Maziere J. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1430-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 h after UVA irradiation, the cells were disrupted in 500 μl of lysis buffer B (50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μmdithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 17,000 × gfor 1 min, the nuclear pellets were washed with the same buffer without Nonidet P-40 and then resuspended in 300 μl of extraction buffer (500 mm KCl and 10% glycerol with the same concentrations of HEPES, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, and dithiothreitol as the buffer B). After an additional centrifugation for 5 min, the supernatant fractions were harvested as nuclear protein extracts and stored at −70 °C. The STAT3-binding oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3′) probe from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) (66Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the Klenow fragment (Life Science Co., Gaithersburg, MD). The nuclear extract (3 μg) was added into the DNA binding buffer containing 5 × 104 cpm 32P-labeled probe, 1.5 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 3 μg of BSA. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min followed by an additional incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Then the DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For specific competition, the nuclear extracts were preincubated for 20 min with 2 μg of unlabeled cold probe or for 4 h with 0.2 μg of STAT3 antibody before addition of the labeled STAT3-binding probe. After autoradiography, the radioactivity was quantified using the Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 was shown to be required for its maximal activation by cytokine stimulation (11Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar,12Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S.

A recent report indicated that STAT1, which is highly homologous to STAT3, was activated by UVA irradiation (36Maziere C. Dantin F. Dubois F. Santus R. Maziere J. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1430-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). But whether UVA stimulates STAT3 signaling through Ser727phosphorylation is as yet unknown. This question was investigated here by using Western blot analysis with a specific antibody to detect phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727. After epidermal JB6 Cl 41 cells were exposed to UVA irradiation, Ser727phosphorylation was induced in a dose-dependent (Fig. 1 A) and time-dependent (Fig. 1B) manner. Induction of Ser727 phosphorylation occurred 15 min after irradiation with UVA at 160 kJ/m2 (Fig. 1 B), increased to maximal induction at 30 min (Fig. 1), and then gradually decreased to basal level by 120 min, and a second peak of induction recurred at 360 min following irradiation (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, a weaker Tyr705 phosphorylation induced by UVA was also observed in the same experiments (Fig. 1, A and B). Tyr705 phosphorylation was induced at 5 min following UVA irradiation and then decreased to basal level at 30 min after irradiation (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the phosphorylation at Ser727 (Fig. 1 A), but not at Tyr705(Fig. 1 A), was detected in JB6 cells irradiated with UVB or UVC, consistent with previous reports (16Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl.

These findings, therefore, suggest that changes in Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 may indirectly reflect regulation of STAT3 signaling. EGFR-mediated activation of STAT3, but not STAT1, has been shown to be an early event in carcinogenesis (30Song J.I. Grandis J.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2489-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar,49Sartor C.I. Dziubinski M.L., Yu, C.L. Jove R. Ethier S.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 978-987PubMed Google Scholar, 50Karni R.

Furthermore, UVA, like UVB or UVC, was reported to initiate several potential EGFR signaling pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ras/MAPKs (30Song J.I. Grandis J.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2489-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 52Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P.

However, although Janus kinase-independent Tyr705 phosphorylation is known to be mediated by EGFR, which has an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (7Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), whether Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 by serine/threonine kinases is EGFR-dependent is unclear.

Recombinant APRs from both Lemna minorand Arabidopsis thaliana were overexpressed inEscherichia coli and isolated as yellow-brown proteins. UV-visible spectra of these recombinant proteins indicated the presence of iron-sulfur centers, whereas flavin was absent. This result was confirmed by quantitative analysis of iron and acid-labile sulfide, suggesting a [4Fe-4S] cluster as the cofactor. EPR spectroscopy of freshly purified enzyme showed, however, only a minor signal at g = 2.01. Therefore, Mössbauer spectra of 57Fe-enriched APR were obtained at 4.2 K in magnetic fields of up to 7 tesla, which were assigned to a diamagnetic [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. This cluster was unusual because only three of the iron sites exhibited the same Mössbauer parameters. The fourth iron site gave, because of the bistability of the fit, a significantly smaller isomer shift or larger quadrupole splitting than the other three sites. Thus, plant assimilatory APR represents a novel type of adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase with a [4Fe-4S] center as the sole cofactor, which is clearly different from the dissimilatory adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductases found in sulfate reducing bacteria.

In living organisms, however, most sulfur is in the reduced form of organic thiols. Plants, yeast, and most prokaryotes are able to reduce sulfate to sulfide and incorporate it into organic compounds. The sulfate assimilation pathway was first resolved in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium (1Jones-Mortimer M.C. Biochem. J. 1968; 110: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3474-3484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For reduction sulfate must be activated in two steps; ATP sulfurylase forms adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS),1which is further phosphorylated by APS kinase to form adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). PAPS is reduced in a thioredoxin-dependent reaction by PAPS reductase (EC 1.8.99) to sulfite. Sulfite is reduced by a NADPH-dependent sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.7.1) to sulfide, which is incorporated into the amino acid skeleton of O-acetyl-l-serine, thus forming cysteine (3Brunold C. Rennenberg H. Brunold C. De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Sulfur Nutrition and Sulfur Assimilation in Higher Plants. SPB Academic Publishing, The Hague, The Netherlands1990: 13-31Google Scholar). Plants and algae were shown to utilize APS rather than PAPS as sulfonyl donor; the corresponding enzyme was originally called APS sulfotransferase becauseS-sulfoglutathione was detected among the reaction products (4Schmidt A. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1972; 84: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Schmidt A. Plant Sci. Lett. 1975; 5: 407-415Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). APS sulfotransferase was shown to be highly regulated and to play a key role in controlling sulfate reduction in plants (6Brunold C. De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Rennenberg H. Brunold C. Rauser W.E. Sulfur Nutrition and Sulfur Assimilation in Higher Plants. SPB Academic Publishing, The Hague, The Netherlands1993: 61-75Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a PAPS-dependent pathway of sulfate reduction could not be excluded, especially when the purification of PAPS reductase from spinach had been reported (7Schwenn J.D. Z. Naturforsch. 1989; 44c: 504-508Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In attempts to clone plant PAPS reductase by complementation ofE. coli CysH mutants, a small family of three cDNA clones was obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana (8Gutierrez-Marcos J.F. Roberts M.A. Campbell E.I. Wray J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13377-13382Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Setya A. Murillo M. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13383-13388Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These cDNA clones encoded isoforms of an enzyme with a N-terminal organelle targeting peptide, a central part similar to E. coli PAPS reductase, and a C-terminal part similar to thioredoxin. The enzyme produced sulfite from APS, and the cDNAs complemented also E. coli mutants deficient in APS kinase. Therefore, the enzyme was named APS reductase (8Gutierrez-Marcos J.F. Roberts M.A. Campbell E.I. Wray J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13377-13382Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When both the PAPS reductase-like and the thioredoxin-like domains of APS reductase were expressed separately in E. coli, they were able to reconstitute the APS reductase activity (10Bick J.-A. Åslund F. Chen Y. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8404-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Prior A. Uhrig J.F. Heins L. Wiesmann A. Lillig C.H. Stoltze C. Soll J. Schwenn J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain was shown to possess the same enzymatic activity as glutaredoxin but not thioredoxin (10Bick J.-A. Åslund F. Chen Y. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8404-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the other hand, thioredoxin but not glutaredoxin was able to replace the C-domain in the APS reductase of Catharanthus roseus (11Prior A. Uhrig J.F. Heins L. Wiesmann A. Lillig C.H. Stoltze C. Soll J. Schwenn J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although for the reduction of PAPS in E. coli thioredoxin and glutaredoxin are interchangeable (12Tsang M.L.-S. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The controversy about the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of APS (13Leustek T. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar,14Hawkesford M.J. Wray J.L. Adv. Bot. Res. 2000; 33: 159-223Crossref Google Scholar) has been resolved in a recent report by Suter et al.(15Suter M. von Ballmoos P. Kopriva S. Op den Camp R. Schaller J. Kuhlemeier C. Schürmann P. Brunold C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 930-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The APS sulfotransferase from Lemna minor was isolated, the corresponding cDNA was cloned, and the deduced amino acid sequence was shown to be very similar to that of APS reductase from A. thaliana. Free sulfite was the only reaction product detected under reducing conditions, and S-sulfoglutathione was only formed when oxidized glutathione was present in the enzyme assay (15Suter M. von Ballmoos P. Kopriva S. Op den Camp R. Schaller J. Kuhlemeier C. Schürmann P. Brunold C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 930-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). From these experiments, the authors concluded that APS sulfotransferase and APS reductase were identical enzymes and should be named APS reductase. The reductase mechanism of APR was corroborated by identification of a reaction intermediate, with sulfite covalently bound to a cysteine residue of the enzyme (16Weber M. Suter M. Brunold C. Kopriva S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain was responsible for release of this bound sulfite. Interestingly, the PAPS reductase domain from A. thaliana APR2 was able to catalyze sulfite production even without additional thioredoxin. Hereby, only recombinant thioredoxin m but not thioredoxin f enhanced the reaction velocity (16Weber M. Suter M. Brunold C. Kopriva S. Eur. J.

APS reductase from both A. thaliana and C. roseus, which had been overexpressed in E. coli, was described as a protein without prosthetic groups or cofactors (9Setya A. Murillo M. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13383-13388Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Bick J.-A. Åslund F. Chen Y. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schaller J. Kuhlemeier C. Schürmann P. Brunold C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 930-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of a cofactor, possibly FAD or/and FeS as in the dissimilatory APS reductases (17Verhagen M.F. Kooter I.M. Wolbert R.B. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The major difference between the N-terminal part of plant APS reductases and the homologous E. coli PAPS reductase (18Krone F.A. Westphal G. Schwenn J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was the presence of two additional Cys pairs in the plant enzyme (Fig.1). From these findings two important questions arise: (i) is there a cofactor in plant APR, and (ii) do the additional Cys residues play any role in the plant enzyme? In this report we present biochemical and spectroscopic evidence that recombinant plant APS reductase constitutes a new member of the iron-sulfur protein family. On the basis of Mössbauer measurements, we propose that three of the additional Cys residues are involved in binding of the catalytically active [4Fe-4S] center. [35S]APS was prepared from [35S]SO 42− (Hartmann Analytic) according to Li and Schiff (19Li J. Schiff J.A. Biochem.

The APR from L. minor (LMAPR) (15Suter M. von Ballmoos P. Kopriva S. Op den Camp R. Schaller J. Kuhlemeier C. Schürmann P. Brunold C. J. Biol.

For the preparation of 57Fe labeled Lemna APR,E. coli harboring the expression construct was grown in M9 medium, containing 0.4% glucose, in which 56Fe was replaced by 57Fe. Metal foil consisting of 57Fe (94.7% enrichment, Glaser, Basel, Switzerland) was dissolved in HCl, neutralized, and added to the culture medium at a final57Fe concentration of 20 μm. The ATAPR2-pET14b construct was used as template for the site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were produced with the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and the mutated plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. APR activity was either measured as the production of [35S]sulfite, assayed as acid volatile radioactivity formed in the presence of [35S]APS and dithioerythritol (21Brunold C. Suter M. Lea P. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. 3. Academic Press, London1990: 339-343Google Scholar), or as formation of APS, with K3[Fe(CN)6] as electron acceptor (22Fritz G. Buchert T. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Kroneck P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Iron was quantitated by atomic absorption spectrometry (23Stieger P.A. Feller U. Plant Soil. 1994; 166: 173-179Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Acid-labile sulfide was determined according to Ref. 24Fischer D.S. Price D.C. Clin. Chem. 1964; 10: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were routinely estimated according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. For the estimation of the iron content of Lemna APR, protein measurements were done based on the amino acid determination of hydrolyzed aliquots of APR solutions. The values obtained with this approach were smaller than the values obtained with the Bradford method. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Lambda 16 Instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a temperature-controlled cell compartment. For measuring the decrease in optical density of Lemna APR during storage, a Beckman instrument was used. EPR spectra (X-band, 9.5 GHz) were recorded on the ESP 300 spectrometer (Bruker) and evaluated as described elsewhere (26Riester J. Zumft W.G. Kroneck P.M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The temperature was maintained with the Helitran system (Air Products). Mössbauer spectra were recorded using a conventional spectrometer in the constant acceleration mode. Isomer shifts are given relative to α-Fe at room temperature. The spectra obtained at 20 mT were measured in a bath cryostat (Oxford MD 306) equipped with a pair of permanent magnets. For the high field spectra, a cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet was used (Oxford Instruments). Magnetically split spectra were simulated within the spin Hamiltonian formalism (27Trautwein A.X. Bill E. Bominaar E.L. Winkler H. Struct. Bond. 1991; 78: 1-95Crossref Google Scholar); otherwise, spectra were analyzed by least square fits using Lorentzian line shape. To identify the putative cofactor of APS reductase, the enzymes from L. minor (LMAPR) and A. thaliana (ATAPR2) were overexpressed in E. coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity. In solution, they exhibited a yellow-brown color. Whereas LMAPR was losing its activity continuously when kept at 4 °C, ATAPR2 in addition to decrease of activity began to precipitate after 2–3 days under these conditions. Therefore, LMAPR was used in most experiments. Freshly purified LMAPR had a specific activity of 30–40 μmol·min−1·mg−1 in the reaction with [35S]APS and dithioerythritol as electron donor (15Suter M. von Ballmoos P. Kopriva S. Op den Camp R. Schaller J. Kuhlemeier C. Schürmann P. Brunold C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 930-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which decreased to ∼40% after 24 h. Attempts to measure the specific activity of the enzyme with K3[Fe(CN)6] as electron acceptor and sodium sulfite/AMP as electron donor similar to the dissimilatory APS reductase (22Fritz G. Buchert T. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Kroneck P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) failed, as the plant enzyme was rapidly denatured by even micromolar concentrations of K3[Fe(CN)6]. Substitution of K3[Fe(CN)6] by other electron acceptors, such as horse heart cytochrome c (E°′ = +254 mV), toluidine blue (E°′ = +115 mV), or phenazinemethosulfate (E°′ = +80 mV) did not reveal any specific activity of plant APS reductase in the oxidative reaction. The UV-visible spectrum of ATAPR2 exhibited maxima at 280 and 390 nm, with shoulders around 324, 475, and 625 nm (Fig. 2 A). Upon photochemical reduction with 5-deazaflavin/sodium oxalate, or addition of sodium dithionite (data not shown), the absorption decreased in the range 300–750 nm but could be restored after exposure of the solution to dioxygen. The UV-visible difference spectrum, [APS reductase oxidized] − [APS reductase reduced], exhibited maxima at 322 and 405 nm as expected for iron-sulfur proteins (Fig. 2 B) (28Cammack R. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 281-322Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the presence of stoichiometric amounts of the oxidant K3[Fe(CN)6], the solution turned turbid and the protein started to precipitate, most likely the result of destruction of the iron-sulfur centers. Reduction of plant APS reductase was not achieved by either excess of sodium sulfite or excess of sodium sulfite/2 mm AMP, as observed for the bacterial enzyme (22Fritz G. Buchert T. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Kroneck P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Incubation with 2 mm dithiothreitol also did not lead to reduction of the enzyme (data not shown). The more stable LMAPR revealed almost identical UV-visible spectra in the reduction-oxidation experiments (data not shown). In this case, the molar extinction coefficient at 386 nm e386 was 14,254m−1·cm−1 per monomer, which accounts rather well for the presence of two [4Fe-4S] clusters per α2-homodimer (15Suter M. von Ballmoos P. Kopriva S. Op den Camp R. Schaller J. Kuhlemeier C. Schürmann P. Brunold C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 930-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In view of its color, the recombinant APS reductases were analyzed for flavin, iron, and acid-labile sulfide. Whereas flavin (FAD or FMN) were absent, freshly isolated LMAPR contained 4.08 ± 0.88 mol of iron and 2.6 ± 0.2 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol of APR monomer. Note that, parallel to the decrease in LMAPR enzymatic activity, the yellow-brown color of the protein solution faded, as documented by the decay of the absorbance at 386 nm, and the iron content of LMAPR decreased at the same rate (Fig. 3). To characterize the cofactor binding domain of plant APS reductase, a C-terminally truncated ATAPR2 protein (16Weber M. Suter M. Brunold C. Kopriva S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was analyzed for iron. The protein, overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity, was again colored and gave UV-visible spectra similar to those for the recombinant ATAPR2 (data not shown). Furthermore, the amount of iron in ATAPR2N was identical to that determined for the native enzyme. Thus, the PAPS reductase-like section of plant APR appears to be the iron-sulfur cluster binding site. The comparison of the PAPS reductase-like section of plant APR with PAPS reductase fromE. coli revealed the presence of two additional Cys pairs in the plant enzyme, which might potentially bind the iron-sulfur cluster (Fig. 1). Therefore, each of the Cys residues in ATAPR2 was converted into Ser by in vitro mutagenesis. Although the ATAPR2 and ATAPR2N remained mostly soluble in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain, the modified proteins C128S, C220S, and C223S were completely excreted into inclusion bodies. The enzymatic activity of the C129S mutant was only very slightly influenced; theVmax dropped to 50% of that of the wild type enzyme. The mutation of C248 completely abolished the APR activity (compare with Ref. 16Weber M. Suter M. Brunold C. Kopriva S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3647-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, both modified proteins, C129S and C248S, exhibited the same spectral characteristics as the wild type enzyme (data not shown), indicating correct folding, structure, and presence of cofactor. It seems, therefore, likely that Cys-129 and Cys-248 do not contribute to the binding of the iron-sulfur cluster, thus leaving the remaining three Cys, Cys-128, Cys-220, and Cys-223, as only potential Cys ligands. Compared with the bacterial APS reductases, which carry two [4Fe-4S] centers with intense resonances in the reduced state (22Fritz G. Buchert T. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Kroneck P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), EPR spectroscopy proved not to be the method of choice to investigate the iron-sulfur centers of the plant enzymes. EPR spectra of ATAPR2 exhibited a minor nearly isotropic signal around g = 2.01 with the typical features of a [3Fe-4S] center (22Fritz G. Buchert T. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Kroneck P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Similarly, the LMAPR revealed the nearly isotropic signal at g = 2.01. In both cases spin quantitation gave ≤0.1% of the chemically determined iron. In the recombinant LMAPR isolated from E. coli, which had been cultivated on 57Fe, the weak signal at g = 2.01 was again present, and its linewidth was slightly increased compared with the signal of the corresponding 56Fe enzyme. In all preparations, there was a signal at g = 4.3, which was assigned to nonspecifically bound FeIII. All attempts to generate new EPR signals under reducing conditions, either by titrating the enzyme as isolated with varying amounts of dithionite or Ti(III) citrate or by photochemical reduction with the deazaflavin/oxalate system, failed. Similarly, titration of the enzyme with the oxidant K3[Fe(CN)6] did not yield any significant resonances. The Mössbauer spectrum of LMAPR obtained at 4.2 K in a small field of 20 mT (perpendicular to the γ-beam; Fig. 4 a) exhibited an asymmetric quadrupole doublet. This asymmetry indicates that APR comprises structurally different iron sites. Applying a strong field of 7 T (parallel and perpendicular to the γ-beam; Fig. 4, band c) at 4.2 K showed that the iron sites form a diamagnetic cluster. This information, together with the isomer shift δ and the quadrupole splitting ΔEQ of the asymmetric doublet, which take the values δ ∼ 0.45 mm s−1 and ΔEQ ∼ 1.2 mm s−1 (see below), strongly points toward the presence of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters (27Trautwein A.X. Bill E. Bominaar E.L. Winkler H. Struct. Bond. 1991; 78: 1-95Crossref Google Scholar). The quantitative analysis of the measured spectra was based on the assumption that only three (and not four) Cys residues were binding to the metal cluster (see above). It was assumed that three iron sites exhibit the same δ and ΔEQ values, which, however, may differ from the corresponding values of the fourth site. Thus, the fit comprises two doublets with area ratio 3:1. Two different fits have been performed in view of the fact that the asymmetry of the quadrupole doublet (Fig. 4 a) could be accounted for by two symmetric doublets with either 1) δ1∼ δ2, ΔEQ,1 ≠ ΔEQ,2, or 2) δ1 ≠ δ2, ΔEQ,1 ∼ ΔEQ,2. With start parameters corresponding to cases 1 and 2, respectively, the obtained parameter sets are: 1) δ1 = 0.46 mm s−1, ΔEQ,1 = 1.02 mm s−1 (75%), δ2 = 0.43 mm s−1, ΔEQ,2 = 1.33 mm s−1 (25%); and 2) δ1 = 0.49 mm s−1, ΔEQ,1 = 1.08 mm s−1 (75%), δ2 = 0.35 mm s−1, ΔEQ,2 = 1.15 mm s−1 (25%). As the two cases yield practically the same goodness-of-fit, only the results for case 1 have been presented in Fig. 4. Both parameter sets were used to simulate the magnetic pattern of the spectra measured at a magnetic field of 7 T (Fig. 4, b and c). Again, there is no obvious preference for either case. Both biochemical and spectroscopic techniques were used to demonstrate that plant-type APS reductase carries a diamagnetic [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster at the active site. UV-visible spectra of the enzymes from A. thaliana (ATAPR2) and L. minor (LMAPR) together with the results from iron and acid-labile sulfur analysis indicated the presence of [4Fe-4S] clusters as prosthetic group. However, EPR spectroscopy only yielded a minor signal of a [3Fe-4S] cluster. No EPR signals were observed for the oxidized and reduced enzymes, which could be assigned to a [4Fe-4S] cluster. A comparison of the homologous amino acid sequences of both enzymes and site-directed mutagenesis revealed the possibility that one iron center of the [4Fe-4S] cluster might be coordinated by a non-cysteine ligand. This interpretation would agree with the high instability of plant-type APS reductases observed even under exclusion of dioxygen and might explain their unusual EPR properties. Clearly, Mössbauer spectroscopy was decisive in unraveling the structural and electronic features of the iron-sulfur center. The interpretation of the obtained parameters is based on data that show the isomer shifts δ of Fe-S clusters are closely correlated to oxidation states and iron-ligand coordination numbers of the individual iron sites (29Emptage M.H.

According to typical values for the average isomer shifts at 4.2 K of tetrahedrally sulfur-coordinated ferric and ferrous high spin iron, Fe3+ (δ = 0.24 mm s−1) → Fe2+ (δ = 0.69 mm s−1) (with variation ± 0.03 mm s−1), case 1 represents the situation that the four iron sites in APR form a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster and have the same intermediate oxidation state ∼ 2.5+ (corresponding to δ1 = 0.46 mm s−1 and δ2 = 0.43 mm s−1) but slightly different individual coordination geometry (different quadrupole splittings) as, e.g., in aconitase or CO-dehydrogenase (Table I). Along this line of discussion, case 2 represents a [4Fe-4S]2+cluster with one iron site having slightly larger (2.75+) and the other three slightly smaller (2.42+) oxidation state than the average of 2.5+. The assumption that only three (and not four) Cys residues are binding to the 4Fe cluster is, so far, implied from our analysis only by considering a 3:1 area ratio of subspectra. We therefore extend our discussion to cases that deviate from the classical FeS4coordination of each individual iron site.Table IIsomer shifts δ and quadrupole splittings ΔE Q of [4Fe-4S] 2+ cluster-containing proteinsRelative areaδΔEQReference%mm s −1mm s −1APR case 1750.461.02This work250.431.33APR case 2750.491.08This work250.351.15Aconitase750.461.3029Emptage M.H.

This increase has been attributed to an increase of iron-ligand coordination larger than 4 (29Emptage M.H. Kent T.A. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Münck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4674-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A corresponding increase of isomer shift by increasing iron coordination has been observed also in biomimetic [4Fe-4S]2+ models (37Holm R.H. Ciurli S. Weigel J.A. Prog. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 38: 2-64Google Scholar). In the present case, an iron-ligand coordination larger than 4 is very unlikely, because APR provides only three Cys residues for cluster formation and in either case, 1 or 2, the isomer shift is not larger than 0.49 mm s−1. Another factor that is responsible for an increase of isomer shift of one iron site within a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is the replacement of one Cys residue by a non-sulfur ligand. Examples are the 4Fe clusters in the ferredoxin from the hyperthermophilic archeonPyrococcus furiosus (with one of the four sites yielding δ = 0.55 mm s−1, ΔEQ not reported, Ref. 38Bates D.M. Popescu C.V. Khoroshilova N. Vogt K. Beinert H. Münck E. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6234-6240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase fromE. coli (with one site yielding δ = 0.50 mm s−1, ΔEQ = 1.18 mm s−1; Ref. 39Ollagnier S. Meier C. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Schuenemann V. Trautwein A.X. Mattioli T. Lutz M. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6344-6350Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the increase of isomer shift caused by the replacement of a Cys residue may be counterbalanced by a corresponding decrease of isomer shift caused by a redistribution of electron charge within [4Fe-4S]2+. Such redistribution of electron charge in 4Fe clusters is readily accessible by minor changes of cluster symmetry (40Coropceanu V. Meier C. Trautwein A.X. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2000; 323: 14-20Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). An example for the compensation of counter effects upon the isomer shift is provided by the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in the native pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme. This enzyme provides only three Cys residues for 4Fe cluster formation; the fourth terminal ligand has not yet been identified (32Krebs C. Henshaw T.F. Cheek J. Huynh B.H. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12497-12506Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this example the isomer shift is 0.45 mm s−1 for all four iron sites, and only the quadrupole splittings are slightly different, i.e. 1.15 mm s−1 and 1.00 mm s−1. The parameters obtained for case 1 from APR are compatible with this situation. Trigonally sulfur-coordinated iron sites have the tendency to exhibit isomer shifts that are smaller than those from corresponding tetragonally sulfur-coordinated iron sites. For the ferrous high spin complex [Fe(SC6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3)3], for which a trigonal thiolate coordination is enforced by use of sterically encumbered ligands, an isomer shift of δ = 0.57 mm s−1 at 4.2 K was reported (41MacDonnel F.M. Rohlandt-Senge K. Ellison J.J. Holm R.H. Power P.P. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1815-1822Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This value is significantly smaller than the corresponding average value δ = 0.69 mm s−1 for tetrahedral Fe2+S4compounds. The same trend was observed for polynuclear Fe-S clusters, which comprise individual subsites with oxidation state 2.5+ and μ3-sulfido coordination. Examples of this type (Fe2.5+S3) belong to the family of cofactors of nitrogenase, i.e. iron-vanadium cofactor, iron-iron cofactor, and iron-molybdenum cofactor, for which isomer shifts were reported (δ = 0.40–0.37 mm s−1; Refs. 33Ravi N.

Within the frame of conditions discussed here, the parameters obtained for case 2 from APR are compatible with a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster with one iron site being trigonally and three iron sites being tetragonally sulfur-coordinated. In summary we conclude that APR comprises four paramagnetic iron sites, which form a diamagnetic [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. One of the individual subsites is different from the other three because it is either tetragonally FeS3 X-coordinated, withX being a non-sulfur ligand (C, N, O), or it is trigonally sulfur-coordinated. The experimental finding of such an iron-sulfur cluster in APR, however, does not agree with data recently published by Prior et al. (11Prior A. Uhrig J.F. Heins L. Wiesmann A. Lillig C.H. Stoltze C. Soll J. Schwenn J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), who described APR from C. roseus as a protein devoid of chromophores. The C. roseus APR is 74.4% identical to ATAPR2 and 70.7% to LMAPR, and possesses the same 7 Cys residues as the other plant APR proteins. However, theVmax of the C. roseus enzyme obtained with APS and DTT (4.2 μmol/min/mg) was 10 times lower than theVmax determined for the recombinant LMAPR or with the isolated L. minor enzyme (15Suter M. von Ballmoos P.

Possibly, the expression system used by Prior et al. (11Prior A. Uhrig J.F. Heins L. Wiesmann A. Lillig C.H. Stoltze C. Soll J. Schwenn J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) yielded only partially active protein because of incomplete incorporation of the iron-sulfur center. The presence of an iron-sulfur cluster in plant APS reductase raises new questions about the evolution of this enzyme. Obviously, APR does not represent a simple fusion protein of PAPS reductase and thioredoxin, although the original gene might have been formed this way. The C-terminal, thioredoxin-like, part of the APR has clearly changed its function into a glutaredoxin despite the sequence homology with thioredoxin (10Bick J.-A. Åslund F. Chen Y. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8404-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-terminal part of APR did not just modulate the active site to react preferentially with APS and not PAPS, but acquired a new cofactor and a new reaction mechanism. Note that dissimilatory APS reductase, an enzyme catalyzing reduction of APS in anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio sp., carries two [4Fe-4S] centers in addition to FAD. The structure of dissimilatory APR is completely different from that of plant APR. The protein is a dimer of a large FAD containing subunit with a small one possessing two [4Fe-4S] clusters (17Verhagen M.F. Kooter I.M. Wolbert R.B. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and there is no sequence homology among these proteins. Whether there really is a link between presence of an iron-sulfur cluster and reduction of APS rather than PAPS will be a subject of additional experiments. We thank Dr. T. Brunold, Dr. M. Droux, and Dr. B. Buchanan for helpful discussions and Dr. C. Schäublin for help in administrative matters."
https://openalex.org/W2016809656,"Open reading frame YJL071W ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae was shown to be ARG2and identified as the structural gene for acetylglutamate synthase, first step in arginine biosynthesis. The three Ascomycete acetylglutamate synthases characterized to date appear homologous, but unlike the other enzymes of the yeast arginine biosynthesis pathway, they showed no significant similarity to their prokaryotic equivalents. The measured synthase activity did not increase with the number ofARG2 gene copies unless the number of ARG5,6gene copies was increased similarly. ARG5,6 encodes a precursor that is maturated in the mitochondria into acetylglutamate kinase and acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase, catalyzing the second and third steps in the pathway. The results imply that the synthase must interact stoichiometrically in vivo with the kinase, the reductase, or both to be active. Results obtained with synthetic ARG5 and ARG6 genes suggested that both the kinase and the reductase could be needed. This situation, which has completely escaped notice in yeast until now, is reminiscent of the observation in Neurospora crassa that nonsense arg-6 kinase/reductase mutants lack synthase activity (Hinde, R.

In immunoprecipitation experiments, hemagglutinin-tagged synthase coprecipitated with a protein proven by microsequencing to be the kinase. Western blot analyses showed that the synthase has reduced stability in the absence of the kinase/reductase.

This makes arginine biosynthesis independent of biochemically analogous proline biosynthesis (Fig.1) (1Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 193-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Davis R. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 280-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial acetylation reaction, catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate synthase (EC2.3.1.1), occurs at the expense of an acetyl-CoA molecule. In most microbes, the high energy cost of this reaction is limited by the fact that the acetyl group of acetylornithine is recycled to a glutamate molecule in a step catalyzed by an ornithineN-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.35). This cyclic metabolic organization confers an anaplerotic character to the first step in biosynthesis, which merely feeds the cycle to compensate for dilution by growth. Avoidance of futile metabolization of acetylglutamate, independently of its origin, requires a double control of activity on the first two enzymes at the pathway entrance. In humans there is no acetylated derivatives pathway specialized in ornithine biosynthesis. Some ornithine is made from glutamyl-phosphate semialdehyde, an intermediate in the pathway to proline, but most of the arginine produced is hydrolyzed in the urea cycle, which ensures detoxification of excess ammonium. Arginine thus remains an “essential” amino acid, required in food. Although no acetylated derivatives cycle has been identified, acetylglutamate synthase is present. It is viewed as the first committed step in the urea cycle because carbamoyl-phosphate synthase I (EC 6.3.4.16), forming the carbamoyl phosphate needed together with ornithine to produce citrulline, must be activated specifically by acetylglutamate to function (3Grisolia S. Cohen P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 204: 753-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, factors regulating the activity of acetylglutamate synthase are relevant to the control of the urea cycle. It has been shown, for example, that arginine stimulates the activity of rat acetylglutamate synthase (4Shigesada K. Tatibana M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the other Ascomycetes studied to date, acetylglutamate synthase and the next four enzymes forming the acetylated derivatives cycle are located in the mitochondria (5Jauniaux J.C. Urrestarazu A. Wiame J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, ornithine is exported to the cytosol for further processing to arginine, whereas in a number of other yeasts (mostly obligate aerobes) and Neurospora crassa, ornithine is transcarbamylated to citrulline in the mitochondria, and it is citrulline that is exported to the cytosol. In the latter cases the carbamoyl phosphate required to make citrulline is produced in the mitochondria as well. As expected from the pathway organization, arginine feedback regulation in S. cerevisiaeand N. crassa controls the activity of the enzymes catalyzing the first two steps: N-acetylglutamate synthase (6Wipf B. Leisinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 874-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hinde R.W. Jacobson J.A. Weiss R.L. Davis R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5848-5852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and N-acetylglutamate kinase (EC 2.7.2.8) (8De Deken R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 8: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Wolf E.C. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9189-9195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Acetylglutamate kinase (EC 2.7.2.8) andN-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase (EC 1.2.1.38) are encoded by a single gene in all Ascomycetes studied to date:ARG5,6 in S. cerevisiae (10Boonchird C. Messenguy F. Dubois E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Candida albicans (11Negredo A. Monteoliva L. Gil C. Pla J. Nombela C. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), arg-6 in N. crassa(12Gessert S. Kim J.H. Nargang F. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8189-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and arg11 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (13Van Huffel C. Dubois E. Messenguy F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Each of these genes encodes a polyprotein precursor with an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal reductase domain. The precursor is cleaved into two distinct enzymes in the mitochondria. InS. cerevisiae for example, deletion of the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide results in the accumulation of an uncleaved but enzymatically active polyprotein in the cytosol (10Boonchird C. Messenguy F. Dubois E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes (both bacteria and archaea), acetylglutamate kinase and acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase are encoded by separate genes (1Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 193-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding a single acetylglutamate kinase-like protein has also been identified (data base CAB66113). When the sequences of the complex genetic loci of the Ascomycetes are aligned with those of the homologous prokaryotic genes encoding the kinase (argB) and the reductase (argC) separately, there appear two extra domains in the Ascomycete loci: one encoding the expected N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide and another encoding an intriguing 200-amino acid domain which, after maturation in front of the reductase region, presumably forms the C-terminal domain of the kinase (10Boonchird C. Messenguy F. Dubois E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Gessert S. Kim J.H. Nargang F. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8189-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No function has been assigned to this region so far. It is absent from the putative A. thaliana kinase gene. Much attention has focused on the regulation of acetylglutamate synthase activity in many organisms, including ureotelic mammals. This is not surprising for a key enzyme in the arginine biosynthetic pathway or urea cycle. In contrast, the synthase gene has been much less studied and characterized. So far five bacterial acetylglutamate synthase genes are known, and only two eukaryotic genes,arg-14 in N. crassa (14Yu Y.G. Turner G. Weiss R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the S. pombe gene (locus CAA22186, EMBL SPBC725, accession no.AL034352.1, direct submission by Lyne, M., Rajandream, M. A., Barrell, B. G., and Rieger, M.). An unexpected feature ofN. crassa acetylglutamate synthase is the absence of a discernible evolutionary relationship with its bacterial counterparts (14Yu Y.G. Turner G. Weiss R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, no formal characterization of the synthase gene has been published yet, except that our own data were reported, with permission, by Vandenbol and Portetelle in the framework of the yeast open reading frame (ORF)1 characterization project (15Vandenbol M. Portetelle M. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Until now, the only S. cerevisiae mutants known to lack synthase activity have been those of the arg2complementation group, so this locus is presumed to encode the structural gene of the synthase. Yet in the filamentous fungus N. crassa, acetylglutamate synthase activity is absent not only inarg-14 mutants, deficient in the structural gene, but also in some arg-6 mutants (7Hinde R.W. Jacobson J.A. Weiss R.L. Davis R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5848-5852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kim J.H. Weiss R.L. Mol. Cells. 1995; 5: 461-466Google Scholar). This suggests that acetylglutamate kinase and/or acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase might play a role in the proper functioning of acetylglutamate synthase, probably at a post-translational level (14Yu Y.G. Turner G. Weiss R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate conclusively that the ARG2gene is the structural gene for acetylglutamate synthase in S. cerevisiae, but we also show that acetylglutamate synthase activity does not increase in proportion to the number ofARG2 gene copies unless the number of ARG5,6 gene copies is increased similarly. We provide evidence suggesting that the synthase is not active in vivo unless it associates stoichiometrically at least with the ARG5,6-encoded kinase and possibly also with the ARG5,6-encoded reductase. We show that the kinase coimmunoprecipitates in vitro with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged acetylglutamate synthase and that the uncomplexed synthase is unstable. We discuss the possible functional relevance of this new yeast arginine metabolon in relation to the cyclic character of the arginine pathway and the resulting requirement for arginine feedback control on the first two steps of the pathway.

MG471 (Mat α ura3–471) and MG535 (Mat α, arg2–535) are genetically and enzymatically characterized strains of our laboratory derived from Σ1278b by M. Grenson. We obtained 13S62b (ura3−, arg2–535) as a recombinant issued from a cross between MG535 and 10R33b (Mata,ura3 −), a strain provided by E. Dubois. Strain AB1 (Mata, ura3−Δarg2::genR), derived from 10R33b, and strains YeBR5 (Matα ura3–4,Δarg5::genR) and YeBR6 (Matα ura3–471, Δarg6::genR, arg5 −) were constructed for this work (see below). Strain 14S31b (Mata,ura3− his3 −) was obtained from a cross between 13S31a (18Crabeel M. Abadjieva A. Hilven P. Desimplelaere J. Soetens O. Eur. J.

Where required, uracil,l-histidine, or l-arginine were added to a concentration of 25 μg/ml. When genes under the transcriptional control of a GALpromoter had to be induced, cells were grown on minimal galactose medium containing 3% galactose as carbon source instead of the usual minimal medium (containing 3% glucose).

At their 5′-ends, the primers included “add-on” sequences corresponding to the wanted restriction sites (in bold in the oligonucleotide list), allowing classical sticky end cloning into the corresponding sites of the vectors. In vectors pYX213 and pYX223 (from R&D Systems), the cloned ORFs are expressed from a GAL promoter. Plasmid pYB8 was obtained by recombinant PCR. Two first step PCR-amplified fragments were made, corresponding to the DNA sequences encoding the first 38 residues of the mitochondrial leader peptide of ARG5,6(known to be sufficient for targeting (10Boonchird C. Messenguy F. Dubois E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)), and to residues 494–863 comprising the acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase domain and the maturation site in front of it. Because primers BY9 and BY10 were designed with a mutual overlap, the two first step fragments can self-anneal and be elongated and amplified with the external primers BY4 and BY5. This recombinant fragment was then digested withEcoRI and BamHI and cloned in a similarly cut vector. Plasmid pHP16 was constructed similarly by recombinant PCR, using primers BY4/AA71 and AA73/BY5 to generate two overlapping PCR fragments whose self-annealing and PCR amplification with oligonucleotides BY4 and BY5 generates an ARG5,6 ORF with a row of 10 histidines inserted in-frame between amino acids 83 and 84 of the precursor protein.Table IMean features of the plasmids constructed in this workPlasmidsCloning vectorOrigin and nature of insertpAA8apFL1 (2 μmURA3)Σ1278b Genomic fragment bearing the ARG2 gene: PCR-amplified with AA16/AA6pAA8cS288cpAA9apFL38 (ARS/CEN,URA3)Σ1278bpAA9cS288cpYB1pYX213 (2 μm URA3, pGAL)Σ1278b PCR-amplifiedARG2 ORF (primers BY1 and BY2)pYB2PCR-amplified ARG2 ORF inserted with its 3′-end in fusion with the sequence encoding HA epitope (primers BY1/BY3)pYB3pYX223 (2 μm HIS3, pGAL)PCR-amplified ARG5,6 ORF (primers BY4 and BY5)pYB4PCR-amplified ARG7 ORF (primers AA37 and AA40)pYB5PCR-amplifiedARG8 ORF (primers BY6 and BY7)pYB6PCR-amplified ARG11 ORF (primers OR39 and OR40)pYB7PCR-amplified mitochondrial leader and ARG6 domain of ARG5,6 (primers BY4 and BY8)pYB8Recombinant PCR with PCR-amplified mitochondrial leader of ARG5,6 (primers BY4 and BY9) andARG5 domain of ARG5,6 (primers BY10 and BY5)pHP16Recombinant PCR with PCR-amplified mitochondrial leader of ARG5,6 (primers BY4/AA71) andARG5,6 domain (primers AA73/BY5), with insertion of 10 His residues at the N terminus of the mature acetylglutamate kinasepOS16pYeF2 (2 μm URA3)FL100 ARG3ORF inserted in frame upstream of the HA epitope coding sequence (20)pAA6pTrc99AΣ1278b PCR-amplified ARG2 ORF (primers AA29 and AA30) inserted downstream of IPTG-inducibletryp-lac promoter Open table in a new tab The DNA sequences of the ARG2 ORFs cloned in plasmids pYB1, pYB2, pAA8a, and pAA8c were determined. The sequence ofARG2 in pAA8c, amplified using S288c genomic template DNA, was 100% identical to the data base sequence. The sequence of the Σ1278b ARG2 gene in pYB1, pYB2, and pAA8a displays 11 differences at nucleotide level with respect to the data base sequence. These differences, starting from the initiator ATG, are A26G, A195T, C349T, A486G, C492T, G501A, A822G, A1156G, T1161C, C1168T, and T1239G. Four of these differences result in modifications at the deduced amino acid level, i.e. E9G, L117F, K386E, and P390S. Because the three sequenced clones were issued from independent PCR amplifications, these differences must be proper to the Σ1278b genome and not PCR-linked errors. We used the method of A. Wach (21Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) to construct strain AB1, where the genomic ARG2 ORF is deleted between the ATG and the stop codon and transplaced by a heterologous cassette, kanMX4, selected on the basis of the Geneticin (G418) resistance it confers to yeast. In this method, two homology regions several hundred base pairs long, flanking the ORF to be transplaced, are produced in a couple of first step PCR amplifications. The resulting PCR products are purified on Wizard columns (Promega). Thanks to the 5′-add-ons present on the two internal primers (these add-ons are homologous to the 5′-ends of the kanMX4 cassette in plasmid pFA-kanMX4), the PCR fragments obtained in the first step can be used as primers to amplify the selectable marker while linking it to the long flanking homology regions, ensuring efficient recombination with the homologous chromosome in strains transformed with this recombinant DNA. The two oligonucleotide pairs used in this construction were AA5/AA7 and AA8/AA6. Strains YeBR6 and YeBR5 were constructed in a similar way, using the BR1/BR2 and BR3/BR4 oligonucleotide primer pairs to construct YeBR6, and BR5/BR6, and BR7/BR8 to construct YeBR5. In strain YeBR6, the transplacement removed amino acids 39–493, comprising the entire kinase-encoding domain of the ARG5,6 locus. Because of the polarity of ARG5,6 transcription (from the kinase orARG6 region to the reductase or ARG5region), replacement of the ARG6 region with the 1.5-kilobase Geneticin-resistance cassette renders strain YeBR6 also unable to express the reductase region. In strain YeBR5, the transplacement removed amino acids 545–863, i.e. the entire reductase-encoding region. Strain YeBR5 is therefore kinase-plus. This enzyme activity was measured by a radioassay using l-[14C]glutamate and acetyl-CoA as substrates. French press cell extracts (from 2 liters cultures at OD 0.4) were desalted on Sephadex G-25 against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mmMgCl2. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 20 mm uniformly labeled l-[14C]glutamate (specific activity around 800 cpm/nmol), 10 mm acetyl-CoA, and extract (0.4–0.8 mg of protein). The reaction was started by adding acetyl-CoA and terminated, after a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, by adding 0.1 ml of 0.2 m HCl. Blanks were incubations without acetyl-CoA. Precipitated proteins were eliminated by centrifugation. To separate the radioactive acetylglutamate formed from the glutamate, 0.1 ml of each reaction tube was passed through a Dowex AG 50W column (X8 resin; 200–400 mesh) from Bio-Rad. The radioactivity present in the eluent from a wash with 2.5 ml of 0.1 m HCl, containing the acetylglutamate (and impurities), was counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The radioactivity of 0.01 ml of reaction mixture (not passed through the column) was also counted for determination of the initial count. Acetylglutamate synthase activity was unstable. The specific activity decreased by half if the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min instead of 10, and it decreased by 40% if incubation was for 10 min at 37 °C instead of 30 °C. Activity was also gradually lost in extracts kept on ice or even frozen. Assays were therefore always performed on fresh extracts. This activity was assayed as described by Jauniaux et al. (5Jauniaux J.C. Urrestarazu A. Wiame J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the blanks corresponded to incubations without substrate (acetylglutamate) instead of incubations in the presence of feedback-inhibitingl-arginine. The specific enzyme activities given in TableII (specific synthase activities) and under “Results” (specific kinase activities) are the means of at least two independent experiments.

Open table in a new tab A 400-ml overnight culture of the tested strain grown on minimal galactose medium supplemented with the required amino acids was grown to OD 0.25–0.3. After centrifugation (4,500 rpm, SS34 rotor) for 10 min at room temperature, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of prewarmed medium and incubated at 30 °C for another 10 min. Then 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (>37 TBq/mmol, >1,000 Ci/mmol,in vivo cell labeling grade), 250 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (same specific activity) (both labeled compounds were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and a 20-fold excess of cold amino acids were added. The culture was then incubated for 2 more h at 30 °C. After a short centrifugation in a microcentrifuge to remove the supernatant, the cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The cells were disrupted by vortexing with glass beads three times at 1-min intervals, followed by a 1-min incubation on ice. To reduce nonspecific adsorption, a preclearing step was included. The step involved the addition of protein G-agarose (Roche) in homogeneous suspension to a concentration of 100 μl/ml followed by incubation of the samples on a rocking platform for 3 h at 4 °C. The target proteins were immunoprecipitated by adding anti-HA high affinity antibody (5 μg/ml; clone 3F10, Roche), incubating the mixture on a rocking platform for 1 h at 4 °C, then allowing the antibody to adsorb overnight under the same conditions to 50 μl of the protein G-agarose suspension. Collected complexes were washed with gentle shaking for 20 min according to the manufacturer's recommendations: twice in (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), then twice in (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl) and once in (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated from the beads in 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE) in 10% gels. The gels were further dried and used to expose Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Further analysis of the proteins was performed by a standard chemiluminescence Western blotting protocol (Roche). After SDS-PAGE in 12% gels, the proteins were transferred to an ECL Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) in a Mini PROTEAN 3 blotting cell (Bio-Rad). Specific primary mouse anti-HA antibody and mouse anti-His antibody (Roche) (4 μl/ml each) and 40 units/ml horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Roche) were used to detect the tagged proteins. Sequencing was done by R. Wattiez in the Laboratory of Biological Chemistry of the University of Mons-Hainaut (22Wattiez R. Hermans C. Cruyt C. Bernard A. Falmagne P. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2703-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Proteins were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Sequi-Blot PVDF membrane; Bio-Rad) using 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, 0.1% SDS as the cathode buffer and 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 2% methanol as the anode buffer. Before electroblotting, the membranes were soaked in methanol for 30 s and in anode buffer for at least 10 min. Protein transfer was carried out for 1 h at 24 V in a semidry blotting apparatus (Biolyon, France). Just before staining, the membranes were washed four times with MilliQ water. The PVDF membrane-bound proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brillant Blue R-250. The bands on the PVDF membrane were excised, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins were determined routinely at the pmol level by automated Edman degradation of 1 pmol of protein by a Beckman LF3400D protein-peptide microsequencer equipped with an on-line model 126 Gold system microgradient high performance liquid chromatography and a model 168 diode array detector (Beckman Instruments). Carboxymethylcysteine eluted just after glutamic acid in the phenylthiohydantoin derivative chromatograms. All samples were sequenced using standard Beckman sequencer procedure 4. All sequencing reagents were from Beckman. FastA and BLAST searches of the yeast data base with the amino acid sequence of the E. coliacetylglutamate synthase identified no ORF showing significant similarity to the prokaryotic enzyme. In contrast, a query with the sequence of the N. crassa acetylglutamate synthase encoded by the arg-14 gene identified ORF YJL071W, displaying 30% identity over a length of about 330 residues. We amplified the YJL071W ORF region by PCR, from base pair −839 upstream from the initiator codon to base pair 361 downstream from the stop codon, using as template genomic DNA from our wild-type strain Σ1278b or from the S288c data base strain. The amplified fragments were cloned in a multicopy vector (pAA8a or pAA8c, respectively) and in a single copy vector (pAA9a or pAA9c, respectively). All of the clones were able to complement fully the arg2 mutation of strain 13S62b, which displays no detectable acetylglutamate synthase activity. In 13S62b, moreover, the presence of the plasmids resulted in a synthase activity about twice as high as in the wild-type strain"

Genetic studies suggest that homologs of GERp95 are components of signaling pathways that regulate cellular differentiation, development, and RNA interference. However, the precise molecular functions of these proteins remain unknown. Genetic analysis of GERp95 homologs has been complicated by the presence of multiple genes with overlapping functions in most organisms.

The amino-terminal region of GERp95 was found to interact with the specialized chaperone Hsp90 and a number of its cognate binding proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity with geldanamycin or radicicol resulted in rapid degradation of newly synthesized GERp95. The membrane-associated pool of GERp95 was not bound to Hsp90, although activity of this chaperone was required for stable association of GERp95 with the Golgi in normal rat kidney cells.

We refer to this group of proteins as the PAZ family, an acronym derived from the first three members of this family (PIWI, ARGONAUTE,ZWILLE) to be described (1Bohmert K. Camus I. Bellini C. Bouchez D. Caboche M. Benning C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 2Moussian B. Schoof H. Haecker A. Juergens G. Laux T.

PAZ family members are defined by the presence of two domains: a centrally located PAZ domain, which is ∼100 amino acids, and a ∼300-amino acid Piwi domain located in the carboxyl-terminal regions. Sequence conservation among PAZ proteins is greatest in the carboxyl-terminal regions. Conversely the amino-terminal regions of PAZ proteins are highly variable and may confer functional specificity. Whereas PAZ domains are confined to eukaryotes, Piwi domains are present in some species of bacteria (10Cerutti L. Mian N. Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 481-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The functions of these domains are not known. Recent data indicate that expression of PAZ proteins is comparatively high in undifferentiated cell types and is consistent with their known roles in regulating stem cell differentiation. For example, microarray analysis of gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegansrevealed that at least eight PAZ mRNAs are enriched (some up to 29-fold) in germline compared with adult tissues (11Reinke V. Smith H.E. Nance J. Wang J. Van Doren C. Begley R. Jones S.J. Davis E.B. Scherer S. Ward S. Kim S.K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In addition, the level of mRNA encoding a novel human PAZ protein, HIWI, decreases as CD34+ hematopoietic stems cells become more differentiated (12Sharma A.K. Nelson M.C. Brandt J.E. Wessman M. Mahmud N. Weller K.P. Hoffman R. Blood. 2001; 97: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PAZ proteins apparently function in a number of different signaling pathways and may exert their effects by binding to the 3′-regions of RNA either directly or indirectly. A case in point is the PAZ member sting/aubergine, whose gene product enhances the translation of specific maternal RNAs in the Drosophilaovary (13Wilson J.E. Connell J.E. Macdonald P.M. Development. 1996; 122: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila ortholog of GERp95,dAGO1, binds to poly(A) sequences and is a positive regulator of the WINGLESS signaling pathway (9Kataoka Y. Takeichi M. Uemura T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast,rde-1, a PAZ gene in C. elegans, has a role in down-regulation of gene expression through RNA interference (14Tabara H. Sarkissian M. Kelly W.G. Fleenor J. Grishok A. Timmons L. Fire A. Mello C.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Work from our laboratory indicated that the putative C. elegansortholog alg-2 (70% identity) of GERp95 is required for gametogenesis and larval development (3Cikaluk D. Tahbaz N. Hendricks L. DiMatti G. Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Hobman T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3357-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Subsequently Grishok and co-workers (8Grishok A. Pasquinelli A. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S. Ha I. Baillie D. Fire A. Ruvkun G. Mello C. Cell. 2001; 106: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar) extended this work and showed that a second GERp95 homolog alg-1 has overlapping functions withalg-2 that are required for fertility and development (8Grishok A. Pasquinelli A. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S. Ha I. Baillie D. Fire A. Ruvkun G. Mello C. Cell. 2001; 106: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). This group also demonstrated that alg-1 and alg-2are not required for RNA interference. Two other PAZ genes,prg-1 and prg-2, are also required for maintaining the mitotic ability of germline stems cells in C. elegans (4Cox D.N. Chao A. Baker J. Chang L. Qiao D. Lin H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). PIWI is a Drosophila protein required for renewal of germline stem cells (4Cox D.N. Chao A. Baker J. Chang L. Qiao D. Lin H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 5Cox D.N. Chao A. Lin H. Development. 2000; 127: 503-514PubMed Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies have placed PIWI in a Yb-controlled signaling pathway (7King F.J. Szakmary A. Cox D.N. Lin H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The pathway is thought to function in parallel to the HEDGEHOG pathway, which regulates division of somatic stem cells. The fact that overexpression of HEDGEHOG can compensate for the loss of PIWI function indicates that the signaling pathways responsible for regulating division of germline and somatic stem cells are linked. Finally, mutations in each of the two Arabidopsis thaliana PAZ genesArgonaute and Zwille result in multiple defects in plant morphology (1Bohmert K. Camus I. Bellini C. Bouchez D. Caboche M. Benning C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 2Moussian B. Schoof H. Haecker A. Juergens G. Laux T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to their role in modulating the differentiation of germline stem cells, PAZ proteins have important roles in development of multicellular organisms. The number of PAZ genes in a given organism varies widely. In the fission yeast S. pombe, a single PAZ gene is present. In contrast, the C. elegans genome encodes at least 23 PAZ proteins, whereas A. thaliana encodes eight such proteins. The number of human PAZ genes has not been determined, but it appears that there are fewer than 10. Genetic studies of PAZ proteins in multicellular organisms have been complicated by the presence of multiple homologs with overlapping functions in each organism. Therefore, the use of biochemical approaches to study PAZ proteins is an important strategy to uncover the cellular pathways in which they are involved. To this end, we have initiated searches for interacting proteins using affinity purification and yeast two-hybrid screening and have identified a number of proteins that bind to GERp95. Here we show that Hsp90 binds to the amino terminus of GERp95. Hsp90 is an abundant chaperone protein but does not participate as a general folding factor as does Hsp70. Rather it has a very limited number of substrate types most of which are signaling proteins that include protein kinases, steroid hormone receptors, nitric-oxide synthases, and telomerase (15Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,16Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Thus, GERp95 and related proteins may comprise a new class of Hsp90 substrates that are involved in novel signaling pathways. Reagents and supplies were obtained from the following sources.

Rabbit antibodies to Cdc37, rat monoclonal antibody to Hsc70, and mouse monoclonal antibodies to FKBP52, FKBP54, Hop (p60), Hsp90, and Hsp70 were from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Rabbit antibodies to α-mannosidase II (Man II) were a gift from Drs. Marilyn Farquhar (University of California, San Diego, CA) and Kelley Moremen (University of Georgia, Athens, GA). A pan-specific polyclonal antibody to GERp95 was produced by immunizing rabbits with a bacterially expressed fusion protein consisting of GST fused to the carboxyl-terminal 309 amino acids of the protein. Confluent dishes of cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in minimum essential medium minus cysteine and methionine containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were labeled for various time periods with 150–500 μCi of Promix [35S]methionine/cysteine/ml in the same medium. Where indicated, cells were treated with geldanamycin (3 μm) before and during the labeling period as well as the chase period. Radiolabeled cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for five min at 4 °C before immunoprecipitation with various antibodies and protein A- or G-Sepharose. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, immune complexes were washed three times with cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and once with water. When using rabbit anti-GERp95 in pulse-chase experiments, samples were washed three times with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) and once with water. Samples were heated at 95 °C in SDS gel sample buffer for five min before loading onto gels. The GST pull-down and subcellular fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (3Cikaluk D. Tahbaz N. Hendricks L. DiMatti G. Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Hobman T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3357-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In some cases, membranes were cut into strips and probed with antibodies to Hsp90 and associated proteins. Radioimmunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (3Cikaluk D. Tahbaz N. Hendricks L. DiMatti G. Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Hobman T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3357-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips, fixed and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (3Cikaluk D. Tahbaz N. Hendricks L. DiMatti G. Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Hobman T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3357-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with the Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin (5–10 μm) or radicicol (10 μm) before fixation. Geldanamycin and radicicol stocks were prepared in Me2SO and methanol, respectively, and stored at −20 °C prior to use. Cells were examined using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. 35S-Labeled GERp95 and GFP were synthesized in vitro using a SP6/T3 polymerase/rabbit reticulocyte-coupled kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were diluted 100-fold in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by radioimmunoprecipitation with antibodies to GERp95, GFP, or chaperones as described above. The entire open reading frame and selected coding regions of rat GERp95 were amplified usingPwo polymerase. Forward and reverse primers containedBamHI and NotI (underlined) sites, respectively. The following primers were used: GERp-FL-forward, 5′-GTGTGGATCCATGTTACCCATGTACTCGG-3′; GERp-FL-reverse, 5′-GCTAGCGGCCGCAACATGTCAAGCAAAGTACA-3′; GERp-NT-reverse, 5′-GCATGCGGCCGCATGAACCAGCTTGTGCCTGTCC-3′; GERp-CT-forward, 5′CGATCGGATCCAACGTGCAGAGGACGACGCC-3′; PAZ-forward, 5′-GACTCGGATCCATGCTGAATATTGATGTGTCA-3′; PAZ-reverse, 5′-GACTAGCGGCCGCTTAAATACATCTTTGTCCTGCC-3′; Piwi-forward, 5′-ATCGAGGATCCATGTTCCGGCACCTGAAGAAC-3′; Piwi-reverse, 5′-AGCATGCGGCCGCTTAGGTATGGCTTCCTTCAGCACT-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were gel-purified, digested withBamHI and NotI, and then ligated in-frame to the 3′-end of the GST cassette in the mammalian expression vector pEBG (17Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Transcription of the GST fusion proteins was driven by theEF-1α promoter. COS or RK-13 cells (1 × 106) in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μl of Fugene6. Forty hours post-transfections, cells were washed with cold PBS and then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 containing 150 mm NaCl; 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA plus protease inhibitors). Lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were incubated with 400 μl of PBS glutathione-Sepharose 4B bead slurry (10% in PBS) for a minimum of 3 h at 4 °C on a rotating device. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min and then washed three times with cold lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted twice with freshly prepared elution buffer (10 mmglutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 500 × g, and proteins were precipitated from the supernatants by the addition of ice cold 100% trichloroacetic acid ( 15 volume) followed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Human prostate and testis cDNA libraries were screened for GERp95-binding proteins using GERp95 NT and CT constructs as bait essentially as described previously (18Beatch M.D. Hobman T.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5569-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) except that MATCHMAKER System 3 reagents and yeast strains were used (CLONTECH). Membrane flotation assays were performed according to a previously published protocol (19Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.Y. Ou J.H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forty hours post-transfection, COS or NRK cells in 100-mm dishes were washed in cold PBS followed by incubation with 3 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors on ice for 10 min. Cells were scraped from dishes and homogenized by 15 passes through a 26.5 gauge needle. Homogenates were cleared of nuclei and unbroken cells by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for five min at 4 °C. Postnuclear supernatants (446 μl) were mixed with 1.78 ml of 72% sucrose prepared in low salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2) and transferred to SW50.1 tubes. The sucrose-adjusted postnuclear supernatants were overlaid with 2.23 ml of 55% sucrose and 0.54 ml of 10% sucrose prepared in low salt buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 12 h at 4 °C. Gradient fractions collected from the top were diluted with 5 volumes of low salt buffer, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and then subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Our goal was to identify GERp95 binding-proteins using affinity purification. To accomplish this, defined regions of GERp95 cDNAs were ligated in-frame to a GST cDNA (Fig.1). The resulting GST-GERp95 fusion proteins were expressed in transiently transfected COS cells and then isolated along with their cognate binding proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Proteins bound to the GST-GERp95 fusion proteins were visualized after SDS-PAGE and silver staining. As expected, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of GERp95 bound to distinct sets of proteins that did not bind to GST alone (Fig.2 A). Of particular note was a ∼90-kDa protein that co-purified with GST fused to full-length (FL) GERp95 and the amino-terminal 323 amino acids (NT) of this protein (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). The ∼90-kDa protein did not bind to the carboxyl-terminal region of GERp95 (CT) or GST alone. Pull-down assays using GST fused to the Piwi and PAZ domains indicated that the 90-kDa protein does not bind to these highly conserved domains (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the 90-kDa protein was the abundant cellular chaperone Hsp90 (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained using GST-GERp95 fusion proteins expressed in rabbit epithelial kidney cells (data not shown). The GST pull-down fractions were also probed with antibodies to Hsp90-binding proteins including the co-chaperones p23, Hop, Hdj-2, and Hsp70. Coincidentally the chaperone Hdj-2 was identified as a GERp95-binding protein from a yeast two-hybrid screen using the NT region as bait (data not shown). Strong binding of all five chaperone/co-chaperone proteins to the NT construct was observed (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2A, multiple proteins bind to GERp95. GST alone and GST fused to full-length (FL), amino-terminal 323 amino (NT), or carboxyl-terminal 309 amino acids (CT) of GERp95 were transiently expressed in COS cells and then immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. Proteins were eluted with glutathione, separated by SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained. The GST fusion proteins are marked by asterisks. The 90-kDa protein (arrow) that binds to FL and NT-GERp95 was shown to be Hsp90 by immunoblotting. B, lysates (L) and GST fusion protein bound fractions (B) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to Hsp90, p23, Hop, Hdj-2, and Hsp70. Two times (percentage of total) as much of the bound fractions were loaded to detect weaker interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Full-length GERp95 did not bind as well to p23, Hop, and Hdj-2 even taking into account the lower expression levels of this protein. Hsp90, p23, Hop, Hsp70, and Hsp40 homologs (e.g. Hdj-2) form the core of a highly dynamic multiprotein complex that interacts with a wide variety of signaling proteins such as transcription factors, protein kinases, and telomerase (20Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 21Munoz M.J. Bejarano E.R. Daga R.R. Jimenez J.

The CT construct did not interact with Hsp90, Hop, or p23 but did bind weakly to Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Hdj-2. The latter two proteins Hsp70 and Hdj-2 are general chaperones that participate in the folding of many nascent polypeptides. In addition, under certain conditions, p23 can act as a chaperone independently of Hsp90 to recognize non-native protein substrates (25Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 26Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Accordingly the increased binding of Hdj-2 and p23 to the NT construct relative to the FL construct (Fig. 2 B) may indicate that the NT construct adopts a different conformation than the FL construct. To ascertain that the GERp95-Hsp90 interaction was not an aberration resulting from overexpression of the fusion protein, we verified this interaction using another approach. A commonly used system to study Hsp90 interaction with cognate binding proteins and substrates is rabbit reticulocyte lysate-mediated translation. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains adequate levels of Hsp90 chaperone complexes that are functional in regulating the activity of steroid hormone receptor complexes and protein kinases (27Hutchison K.A. Brott B.K. De Leon J.H. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2902-2908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Scherrer L.C. Hutchison K.A. Sanchez E.R. Randall S.K. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7325-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). There are two well characterized Hsp90 complexes that have been studied using this system. Hsp90-kinase complexes contain the co-chaperones p50 cdc37, whereas Hsp90 complexes that regulate steroid hormone receptor activity contain a high molecular weight tetratricopeptide repeat-containing immunophilin such as FKBP52 or CyP-40 (22Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hsp90, Hop, p23, Hsp70, and Hsp40 proteins (e.g. Hdj-2) are common to both kinase and transcription factor complexes. The binding sites for p50 cdc37 and immunophilins on this chaperone complex are separate but topologically adjacent. Consequently p50 cdc37 and immunophilin-containing Hsp90 complexes exist separately. GERp95 and GFP (as a negative control) were synthesized in vitro using TNTTM reagents in the presence of [35S]methionine, and translation products were radioimmunoprecipitated with antibodies to GERp95, GFP, Hsp90, and co-chaperones followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. GERp95 was efficiently recovered using antibodies to Hsp90 and the co-chaperones Hop and p23 (Fig. 3). No interaction between GERp95 and the kinase-specific co-chaperone p50 cdc37 was detected using this assay (Fig. 3) or the GST pull-down fractions from COS cells (data not shown). Nor was FKBP52, a component of steroid hormone receptor complexes, found to be part of the GERp95-Hsp90 complexes in reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 3) or COS cells (data not shown). Identical results were obtained using human GERp95 in this system (data not shown). Radiolabeled GFP did not bind to Hsp90 or any of the co-chaperones under these conditions. The interaction of GERp95 with the Hsp90 complex differed slightly between the two expression systems. Specifically only the GERp95 GST-NT construct was stably associated with all five chaperone complex members in transfected COS cells. The full-length GST-GERp95 fusion protein bound p23 but not detectable amounts of Hop (Fig. 2). In contrast, stable binding of p23 and Hop to full-length GERp95 was observed when the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system was used. Since p23 binding occurs on “mature” Hsp90 complexes after Hop dissociates, this could indicate that maturation of the Hsp90-GERp95 complexes is more efficient in COS cells than in reticulocyte lysates (16Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 30Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively the discrepancy could be due to the fact that Hsp90 complexes are highly dynamic, and the complexes isolated from cell lysates and rabbit reticulocyte lysates may have different stabilities (22Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether Hsp90 was important for biogenesis of GERp95, we used biosynthetic labeling and pulse-chase experiments in the presence and absence of the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. It was necessary to use transfected COS cells for these experiments because synthesis rates of endogenous GERp95 in most cell types is quite low. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for various time periods before radioimmunoprecipitation with anti-GERp95. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Fig.4 shows that in the absence of Hsp90 activity (+Geld), newly synthesized GERp95 is more rapidly degraded than in the presence of Hsp90 activity (−Geld). After 2 h, only 7% of newly synthesized GERp95 remained when the Hsp90 inhibitor was present. In contrast, when geldanamycin was absent, degradation of GERp95 occurred at a slower rate. These results indicate that an Hsp90 chaperone complex is required for stability of nascent GERp95. Moreover, steady state pools of GERp95 were reduced ∼50% in the presence of geldanamycin, whereas this drug did not cause reduction in the levels of two endoplasmic reticulum-localized proteins calnexin (Fig. 4 B) and BiP (data not shown). These results confirm that the effects of geldanamycin are limited to a subset of cellular proteins that include GERp95. Our results are similar to those shown with a variety of kinases such as p56 lck, Mik1, Pim1, Wee1, and Swe1, which also require Hsp90 for stability and/or activity (24Goes F.S. Martin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2281-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Miyata Y.

Hirano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At steady state a large proportion of GERp95 is localized to the Golgi complex of certain epithelial cells such as NRK52E and pancreas acinar cells (Fig. 5 Aand Ref. 3Cikaluk D. Tahbaz N. Hendricks L. DiMatti G. Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Hobman T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3357-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, no significant colocalization between Hsp90 and the resident Golgi membrane protein mannosidase II was apparent in NRK cells (Fig. 5 A) and other cultured cell types (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation experiments showed that there are two pools of GERp95: one that is membrane-associated and one that is not (Fig. 5 B). Fractions that contain membrane-associated GERp95 are largely devoid of Hsp90. However, a significant proportion of Hsp90 and GERp95 co-purify in denser fractions that do not contain membranes. The integral membrane protein calnexin was present only in the top of the gradients where membranes are expected to float. To determine whether Hsp90 activity was required for Golgi localization of GER95, NRK cells were treated for 12–14 h with the Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol. Both inhibitors resulted in a drastic reduction in the amount of Golgi-localized GERp95 (Fig.6). As expected, the distributions of the integral membrane protein mannosidase II and the Golgi region-specific coat protein β-COP were unaffected by the lack of Hsp90 activity even when higher concentrations of inhibitors were used (Fig. 6). Interestingly the geldanamycin/radicicol effects on GERp95 localization were not immediate in that loss of Golgi localization was not readily apparent until after 4–6 h (data not shown). This suggests that loss of Hsp90 activity does not directly cause redistribution of GERp95 from Golgi membranes. Rather we favor the hypothesis that interaction of GERp95 with the Hsp90 complex is an obligatory step prior to Golgi localization. Accordingly the interaction of GERp95 with the chaperone complex may be transient and may explain why no colocalization between GERp95 and Hsp90 is observed in the Golgi region of NRK52E cells.Figure 6Hsp90 inhibitors block association of GERp95 with the Golgi complex. NRK cells were incubated for 14 h with 5 μm geldanamycin, 10 μm radicicol, or vehicle (control) and then processed for indirect immunofluorescence with mouse anti-GERp95 and rabbit antibodies to the Golgi marker mannosidase II (Man II). Samples were analyzed using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. To show that inhibition of Hsp90 activity did not result in dissociation of all peripheral membrane proteins from the Golgi, cells treated with geldanamycin (10 μm) were also stained for β-COP. Neither geldanamycin nor radicicol (not shown) affected localization of β-COP indicating that the effect is specific for GERp95.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Hsp90 is a highly specialized chaperone with a limited number of substrates. Although it is one of the most abundant cellular proteins, it is clear that this chaperone does not play a general role in folding of nascent polypeptides (15Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 34Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 35Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R322-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Most Hsp90-dependent substrates are involved in various aspects of intracellular signaling. The molecular function of GERp95 is not known; however, data from studies of other PAZ proteins including GERp95 orthologs are consistent with the fact that it may be involved in signaling pathways that modulate gene expression particularly during early stages of development. PAZ proteins appear to be widely expressed in most tissues albeit at low levels. Accordingly the activity of these proteins must be tightly regulated since abnormally low expression levels can result in decreased rates of mitosis (5Cox D.N. Chao A. Lin H. Development. 2000; 127: 503-514PubMed Google Scholar), whereas overexpression can result in induction of apoptosis (12Sharma A.K. Nelson M.C. Brandt J.E. Wessman M. Mahmud N. Weller K.P. Hoffman R. Blood. 2001; 97: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In light of its known role in regulating the function of other signal-transducing proteins, Hsp90 is a likely candidate for modulating the activity of GERp95 and possibly other PAZ proteins. Although Golgi-localized GERp95 is not associated with Hsp90 it is clear that Hsp90 activity is required for biogenesis and Golgi localization of GERp95 in NRK52E cells. The localization data is particularly interesting in light of a recent model proposed by Pratt and co-workers (22Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). They propose that Hsp90 complexes target their substrates to the nucleus or plasma membrane, and the direction of transport is determined by accessory proteins such as p50 cdc37 and immunophilins (22Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For example, p50 cdc37 would be expected to target Hsp90-kinase complexes to the plasma membrane, whereas immunophilins would target Hsp90 complexed with transcription factors to the nucleus. In the case of GERp95, perhaps a third and unknown accessory protein is required to target Hsp90 and GERp95 to intracellular membranes. In this scenario, Hsp90 would only be transiently associated with the Golgi. It is tempting to speculate that GERp95 is involved in regionalized control of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. For example, down-regulating the translation of endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-localized inhibitors of the WINGLESS signaling pathway such as presenilins (36Soriano S. Kang D.E. Fu M. Pestell R. Chevallier N. Zheng H. Koo E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) may be the mechanism by which the GERp95 ortholog dAGO1 stimulates this pathway inDrosophila.

Wood B.J.B. Holzapfel W.H. The Genus Lactococcus. 2. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1995: 173-234Google Scholar). The metabolism of trehalose has been studied extensively in many microorganisms, and there are a number of reports in the literature concerning alternative catabolic pathways of this disaccharide (Fig. 1). Trehalose may be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane either by a permease or by a phosphotransferase system (PTS),1 leaving trehalose unmodified or phosphorylated as trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) inside the cell, respectively (2Schöck F. Dahl M.K. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Dahl M.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 148: 233-238Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The further degradation of trehalose or T6P may involve a hydrolyzing enzyme such as trehalase (4Uhland K. Mondigler M. Spiess C. Prinz W. Ehrmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23439-23445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), trehalose 6-phosphate hydrolase (5Rimmele M. Boos W. J.

Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 484-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trehalose phosphorylase may also split trehalose by exerting a phosphate attack on the bond joining the glucose moieties (8Maréchal L.R. Belocopitow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3223-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In L. lactis, it was recently demonstrated that the enzyme, β-phosphoglucomutase (β-PGM), which catalyzes the reversible conversion of β-glucose 1-phosphate (β-G1P) to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), is essential in the catabolism of both maltose and trehalose (9Levander F. Andersson U. Rådström P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An indication of a novel degradation pathway for trehalose, involving phosphorylation and cleavage of T6P into G6P and β-G1P, was observed by measuring the intracellular accumulation of sugar phosphates in a β-PGM mutant of L. lactis. Furthermore, it has previously been proved that the gene encoding β-PGM,pgmB, in L. lactis is induced by the presence of either maltose or trehalose in the growth medium, although the presence of glucose or lactose mediates gene repression (10Qian N. Stanley G.A. Hahn-Hägerdal B. Rådström P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Qian N. Stanley G.A. Bunte A. Rådström P. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). According to the genome sequence of L. lactis, pgmB is part of a putative trehalose operon (12Bolotin A. Mauger S.

In the present study, we show that L. lactis contains a novel enzyme for trehalose assimilation, designated trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase (TrePP). TrePP was purified and characterized, and the locus of its corresponding gene,trePP, was determined. In addition, the existence of TrePP in other bacteria is discussed as well as the physiological role of metabolic reactions involving the β-isomer of G1P.

The cells were washed twice and resuspended in 20 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets;Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Disintegration of the cells was achieved using an X-press (Biox, Gothenburg, Sweden). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 19,500 × g, at 2 °C for 10 min. Cell extracts were stored at −80 °C until used. The protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Two different assays were applied to detect TP in cell extracts of L. lactis cultivated on trehalose. The first assay was performed according to the assay of maltose phosphorylase (13Nilsson U. Rådström P. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), except that maltose was replaced by trehalose. Another assay for TP activity detection was performed using a glucose oxidase-peroxidase method to determine the amount ofd-glucose released, as previously described (8Maréchal L.R. Belocopitow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3223-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15White J.W. Subers M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1961; 2: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To detect the presence of TH in cell extracts, the first method of TP measurement was performed, omitting phosphate in the assay mixture. All measurements of TP and TH were performed on a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Measurements of TrePP activity were conducted on a Cobas Mira autoanalyzer (ABX Diagnostics, Montpellier cedex, France). The measurement of TrePP activity was coupled to the formation of NADPH and the absorbance was determined at 340 nm. The assay mixture (total volume, 150 μl) contained 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 3.75 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.8 mmNADP+, and 0.67 mm T6P. T6P was used as the starting reagent. The above conditions for the TrePP activity measurements were employed to follow the purification of the enzyme and as the starting point for the kinetic studies of the enzyme. To investigate the presence of a trehalose metabolic enzyme in cell extract from trehalose-cultivated L. lactis, the cell extract was incubated with either trehalose or T6P. The consumption of substrate as well as product formation, resulting from any possible catalysis, was determined using high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a Carbopac PA-1 column with a precolumn (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Sugar phosphates and mono- and disaccharides were separated at room temperature using a 120 mm NaOH mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. A linear sodium acetate gradient from 100 to 350 mm was applied from 0 to 15 min after sample injection. The injection volume was set to 25 μl, and the compounds were quantified by pulsed amperometric detection with an ED40 detector (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The assay mixture (0.5 ml) containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, cell extract (50 μg/ml protein), and 2 mmsubstrate was prepared, and an aliquot was directly withdrawn, diluted 1:10, and kept on ice until analyzed. The rest of the mixture was incubated at 35 °C for 150 min and then kept on ice until analyzed. The cell extract was pretreated with MgCl2 at a final concentration of 10 mm to prevent the inhibitory effect of EDTA. The cell extract was then treated with DNase I (Appligene Oncor, Illkirch cedex, France) to reduce the viscosity resulting from the presence of DNA. DNase I was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the cell extract was incubated at 16 °C for 1 h. Degraded DNA was removed by centrifugation at 19,500 × g, at 2 °C for 10 min. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant, and the precipitate was collected at 60% ammonium sulfate saturation. The precipitate was further dissolved in and dialyzed against 20 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.2, containing 30 mm KCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). All procedures for the purification of TrePP were carried out at 8 °C. The chromatography procedures were performed on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing two P-500 high precision pumps, a model LCC-501 plus liquid chromatography controller, two motor valves (MV-7 and MV-8), and an REC 102 recorder. Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm with a UV-M II control unit, and fractions were collected with a FRAC-200 fraction collector. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 column that had been equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted using the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fractions showing the highest TrePP activities were pooled and further applied to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech MonoQ HR 5/5 anion exchange column (5 × 0.5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted using buffer A and buffer B, which had the same composition and pH as buffer A but contained 500 mm KCl instead of 30 mm. A gradient elution of proteins was started using of 40% buffer B and continued until an elution volume of 7 ml was reached. Between 7 and 27 ml of elution volume, the concentration of buffer B was increased linearly to a final value of 75%. The flow rate was set to 1.0 ml/min. TrePP-active fractions were pooled, concentrated 10-fold, and dialyzed against buffer A using a centrifugal filter device with a molecular mass cut-off of 30 kDa (Microcon, Amicon BioSeparations). The resulting TrePP was checked for purity using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). All reagents used for SDS-PAGE and precast native gels were purchased form Bio-Rad. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the Laemmli method (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), using an acrylamide concentration of 10%. The acrylamide concentration gradient was 4–15% in the native gels. Cell extract and pools from the purification procedure of TrePP were denatured by heating with an SDS-buffer containing 2-mercapthoethanol and then separated using SDS-PAGE. The protein bands in the gels were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or by silver staining (Silver Stain Plus kit; Bio-Rad). In native PAGE, the samples were not denatured but separated directly, and proteins were detected by either method used for SDS-PAGE gels. Native PAGE was carried out at 8 °C, using precooled gels and running buffer. Molecular masses were determined using SDS-PAGE and native PAGE. A low molecular weight standard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing phosphorylase b (94.0 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67.0 kDa), ovalbumin (43.0 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30.0 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa) was used for SDS-PAGE. For the native PAGE a high molecular mass standard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) including thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) was used. Purified TrePP was denatured and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Sequi-Blot™ polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, 0.2 μm; Bio-Rad) using a Trans-Blot semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein band was cut out from the membrane, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation at the Department of Plant Biology (The Swedish University of Agricultural Science, Uppsala, Sweden). Investigations of optimal conditions for the enzymatic activity of TrePP were carried out using the standard assay on a Cobas Mira autoanalyzer (ABX Diagnostics) as described above, with varying parameters. For determination of the pH optimum, the pH of the potassium phosphate buffer was varied in the range from 5.5 to 8.0. In the investigations of divalent cation requirement, MgSO4was added to the TrePP assay at concentrations of 0–20 mm. For the determination of the kinetic constants of the TrePP enzymatic reaction, one substrate was varied, while the other substrate was kept constant at various excess concentrations. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 35 °C for 15 min (diluted 1:20), and the product formation was analyzed using HPAEC. In all reaction mixtures, less than 5% of the reactants had been converted; thus, the reactions were assumed to follow initial rate kinetics. The K m values were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots, and theK m values of the enzyme for the reactants of the phosphorolysis reaction were also confirmed using the spectrophotometric assay (see above). To distinguish between sequential (ternary complex) and nonsequential (ping-pong) kinetic mechanisms, initial velocity measurements were carried out in the direction of phosphorolysis, with one substrate being varied at several constant concentrations of the second substrate. Reciprocal initial velocities were plotted against reciprocal substrate concentrations, and the kinetic pattern was identified from these plots (17Cleland W.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant of TrePP interconversion of T6P and phosphate and β-G1P and G6P was determined by incubating pure TrePP with 2 mm each of T6P and inorganic phosphate or with 2 mm each of β-G1P and G6P at 35 °C for 4 h, using 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.3, or 50 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.0. The reaction mixtures were diluted 20-fold, and the concentrations of substrates and products were determined using HPAEC. The concentration of inorganic phosphate was assumed to be the same as the measured T6P concentration. Southern blotting and colony hybridization were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probe labeling was conducted using the Random Primed DNA Labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid DNA was purified fromEscherichia coli using a Bio-Rad Quantum Miniprep kit (Bio-Rad). Digestion using restriction enzymes, ligations, and agarose gel electrophoresis was performed according to Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), current protocols (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1996Google Scholar), or the manufacturer's instructions. All DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DNA was extracted from gel fragments obtained by agarose gel electrophoresis either by digestion with AgarACE™ (Promega) and then conventional ethanol precipitation or with the aid of a Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Competent E. colicells were prepared and transformed according to Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR was used for automatic sequencing using the reaction conditions described in the protocol of the DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (ABI, Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and construct pTMB2010 as a template. The sequencing was performed on a 373A DNA Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 15–20-mer oligonucleotides used as primers were synthesized in the Biomolecular Laboratory at Lund University, Sweden. The nucleotide sequence was determined from both strands. A genomic library of L. lactis 19435 DNA, partially digested withSau3A, was prepared in E. coli LE392 using the λEMBL3 Arms Cloning System and Packagene System (Promega). The genomic bank was screened for the trePP DNA sequence by performing Southern blots of DNA recovered from bacteriophage λ plaques. A DNA probe including the DNA sequence of pgmB, the gene directly upstream of trePP, was synthesized with PCR and used in the Southern blots. According to the results of the Southern blots, five λ clones were selected, and recombinant bacteriophage λ DNA was extracted and purified according to the WizardTM Lambda Preps DNA Purification System kit (Promega). The λ DNA was digested by HindIII and cloned into pUC19 according to conventional methods described by Sambrooket al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pUC19 clones were propagated in E. coli JM83, and single transformants were transferred to a fresh selection plate. Colony hybridization was performed on these colonies using a 1.2-kb DNA intergenic sequence of trePP andpgmB as a probe (GenBankTM accession numberZ70730). E. coli harboring a construct includingtrePP and pgmB sequences were cultivated, and plasmid extraction was performed. The resulting construct chosen for further applications was termed pTMB2010. For the preparation of a construct including only the trePP gene, pTMB2010 was digested by HindIII and NsiIA, and the resulting 2.6-kb restriction fragment was ligated into pUC18 for propagation inE. coli. This construct was called pTMB2011. To create a construct to be used for expression in L. lactis, the gene encoding TrePP was amplified from pTMB2010 with PCR using the primers 5′-ggcgtcgacaggcagtgctgataaat-3′ (forward) containing a SalI restriction site and 5′-ggcctgcagttaagcaatgacttt-3′(reverse) containing a PstI restriction site. The 2.4-kb PCR product was ligated into the lactococcal expression vector pMG36e (20van de Guchte M. van der Vossen J.M.B.M. Kok J. Venema G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 224-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting construct was named pTMB5011. For insertional inactivation of thetrePP gene, a 1.2-kb internal DNA sequence of the gene was removed from pTMB2010 using the restriction enzymes Sau3A and XbaI and ligated into vector pFL20 (9Levander F. Andersson U. Rådström P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), unable to replicate in L. lactis. The construct, pTMB5012, was transformed into L. lactis 19435, and homologous recombination was screened for on erythromycin-selective plates and confirmed by PCR. For sequence similarity searches, BLAST programs (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer T.L. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), found under the National Center for Biotechnology Information page on the World Wide Web, were used. Both standard protein-protein blast searches and blast with microbial genomes (completed and uncompleted) were performed. Multiple sequence alignments were made using the ClustalX program (22Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor joining method (23Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) and visualized using the TreeView program (24Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts from L. lactis grown on trehalose were analyzed in various spectrophotometric assays specifically detecting trehalase, trehalose phosphorylase, and trehalose 6-phosphate hydrolase activity. However, none of these enzyme activities could be detected. Instead, lactococcal cell extracts were incubated with trehalose or T6P and quantification and separation of sugars and phosphorylated sugars were carried out using HPAEC. Incubation of cell extracts with trehalose did not lead to any production of phosphorylated sugar, as would be expected if trehalose phosphorylase were present in the lactococcal cell extract. Nor could any glucose be detected, which would be produced by a trehalase. However, when the cell extracts were incubated with T6P, there was considerable formation of G6P and β-G1P (Fig.2 A). The enzyme, TrePP, responsible for converting T6P into G6P and β-G1P, was purified using ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) precipitation, size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography (TableII). One explanation of the remarkable changes in TrePP activity along the purification could be the presence of inhibitors, which were subsequently separated from the fractions containing TrePP. The final fraction of purified TrePP showed one band in SDS-PAGE corresponding to a molecular mass of 94 kDa under denaturing conditions (Fig. 3). According to native PAGE, TrePP is a monomeric enzyme, since a band could be observed at 95 kDa. The purified pool of TrePP was used for the determination of the optimal conditions of its catalytic action (Fig.4). The temperature optimum of the phosphorolysis was estimated to be 35 °C, and the highest activity of TrePP was obtained when the pH of the phosphate buffer was set to 6.3. No requirement of a divalent cation in the TrePP catalysis could be found (data not shown). The Michaelis-Menten constants of TrePP for inorganic phosphate (Pi) and T6P were determined to be 32 and 6 mm, respectively, and for the reverse reaction the constants were determined to be 0.9 and 4 mm for β-G1P and G6P, respectively. When incubating pure TrePP with equal concentrations of either T6P and Pi or β-G1P and G6P at 35 °C, the equilibrium constants were estimated to be 0.026 at pH 6.3 and 0.032 at pH 7.0. These results were obtained in both directions of the catalysis (Fig. 2 B). According to double reciprocal plots, TrePP catalysis was indicated to follow a ternary complex mechanism (Fig. 5) (17Cleland W.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIPurification of trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylasePurification stepVolume cell extractTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activitymlmgunitsunits/mg protein2-a1 unit/mg protein is defined as 1 μmol of T6P converted per min per mg of protein added under standard assay conditions.Crude extract15281.230.04(NH4)2SO4precipitation670.0230.003Size exclusion chromatography120.351.654.71Anion exc"
https://openalex.org/W2022487629,"Specific chromosomal translocations involving the ews gene and one of five members of the ets family of transcription factors create ews/ets fusion genes that are found in ∼85% of Ewing’s family of tumors. ews/ets fusion genes consistently maintain an intact and functional ets DNA binding domain (DBD) in all of these cases. We demonstrate here, however, that EWS/FLI1, the most prevalent EWS/ETS fusion, activates oncogenic pathways independent of its DBD. In in vivo tumor assays, EWS/FLI1 molecules with either point mutations or a large deletion in the ets DBD retain the ability to accelerate tumors in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas they lose the ability to bind DNA in vitro. Additionally, whereas inhibition of DBD functions of EWS/FLI1 with a dominant negative form of FLI1 is sufficient to inhibit anchorage-independent growth in NIH 3T3 cells, it is ineffective in inhibiting tumor growth in SCID mice. Usage of this dominant negative construct in a Ewing’s tumor cell line, however, does reduce the rate of tumor formation, supporting the need for a functional DBD in this context. Together, these results suggest that EWS/FLI1 induces both DBD-dependent and DBD-independent oncogenic pathways.

DNA binding domains internal ribosome entry site green fluorescent protein The production of chimeric fusion genes through chromosomal translocation is a common theme in the development of neoplasia. The resultant gene products often utilize domain-associated functions derived from the native participants of the fusions but in novel, atypical contexts. Such is the case for the Ewing's family of tumors, in which the ews gene on chromosome 22 is fused to one of five members of the ets family of transcription factors (FLI1, ERG, ETV1, E1AF, or FEV) (1Kim J. Pelletier J. Physiol. Genom. 1999; 1: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The consequent ews/etsfusion genes are thought to utilize amino-terminal EWS transactivation domains and intact carboxyl-terminal ets DNA binding domains (DBDs)1 to form aberrant transcription factors that induce neoplastic phenotypes through altered gene regulation (2Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). EWS is a member of the TET family of RNA-binding proteins, which also includes TLS and TAFII68 (3Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These genes are commonly involved in chromosomal translocations that lead to the development of cancer, particularly sarcomas. In addition to Ewing's sarcoma, TET translocations are associated with at least five other sarcomas including desmoplastic small round cell tumors, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma (1Kim J. Pelletier J. Physiol. Genom. 1999; 1: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A pervasive feature of all of the TET translocations is that a TET family member is fused to an intact DBD of a transcription factor. This observation supports the hypothesis that TET translocation products, including EWS/ETS fusions, utilize their DBDs to bind DNA and directly alter transcriptional activity. Although the physiological functions of wild type EWS are not well defined, EWS may have a role in coupling transcription and RNA processing. The amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain of EWS includes protein-protein interaction domains that direct binding to RNA polymerase II subunits (4Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, an interaction with splicing factor U1C has been mapped to amino-terminal sequences (6Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24865-24871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Both of these interactions are maintained in EWS/ETS fusions. By contrast, EWS uses carboxyl-terminal residues to interact with TASR RNA splicing factors (4Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). How these interactions may impact the efficiency or execution of specific mRNA processing reactions is as yet undetermined. However, it appears that uncoupling of TASR binding from nascent mRNA synthesis in EWS/FLI1 fusions results in decreased pre-mRNA splicing in vitro (4Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These effects are also observed with a closely related TET family member, TLS. Wild type TLS can be found in complex with the TASR factors, whereas the TLS/ERG fusion protein found in myeloid leukemia lacks this interaction (7Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 8Yang L. Embree L.J. Hickstein D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that TET fusion proteins also alter steady state mRNA levels through mechanisms that are independent of DNA binding and transcriptional initiation. The importance of the ets DBD to the oncogenic function of the EWS/FLI fusion protein has been established mainly through the use of tissue culture-based transformation assays. Most mutations or deletions in the DBD result in almost complete loss of transforming potential (9Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5592-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). More recently, however, alternative in vivo-based tumor assays have been used to assay the oncogenic activity of EWS/ETS fusions proteins (11Arvand A. Welford S.M. Teitell M.A. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5311-5317PubMed Google Scholar, 12Teitell M.A. Thompson A.D. Sorensen P.H. Shimada H. Triche T.J. Denny C.T. Lab.

In some of these experiments, it has become apparent that although often in agreement, these two different transformation assays do not always concur (13Thompson A.D. Teitell M.A. Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,14May W.A. Arvand A. Thompson A.D. Braun B.S. Wright M. Denny C.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the ets DBD is one of two necessary FLI1 domains to promote anchorage-independent growth (10May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 11Arvand A. Welford S.M. Teitell M.A. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5311-5317PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether EWS/FLI1 is dependent on this domain for the acceleration of tumor formation in SCID mice as well. Here we show that EWS/FLI1 does not require its DNA binding domain to enhance the tumorigenic phenotype of NIH 3T3 cells in vivo. Inactivation of the DBD via specific mutations or through the use of a dominant negative FLI1 reduces transformation efficiency in colony forming assays and activation of some known target genes but is incapable of reducing the tumorigenic potency of EWS/FLI1 in in vivo mouse assays. On the contrary, competitive inhibition of the DBD in a Ewing's tumor cell line does reduce tumorigenesis. Therefore, the data suggest that EWS/FLI1 induces multiple oncogenic pathways, some that are DNA-binding dependent and some that are DNA-binding independent. The NIH 3T3 system described here should allow further dissection of the DNA binding independent pathways. All EWS/FLI1 DBD mutants were made through a two-step polymerase chain reaction process with specific primer pairs containing the desired nucleotide changes. Briefly, in the first step two fragments were amplified using sense and antisense primers covering the mutations along with flanking vector specific primers on a pBluescript KS II+ EWS/FLI1 type 4 template. These two fragments were then purified, annealed, and amplified using only the flanking primers. The fused fragments were then cloned EcoRI/HindIII into pBluescript KS II+ for sequencing and then cloned the same way into the retroviral construct pSRα MSV tkneo. SGI constructs were created by cloning an EcoRI GFP-IRES cassette from pMSCV GFP-IRES-puro (gift of D. Rawlings) into the EcoRI site in front of EWS/FLI1 (or mutants) in pSRα MSV tkneo. The pSRα EWS/FLI1 Δ22 tkneo construct was described previously (10May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 13Thompson A.D. Teitell M.A. Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For the dominant negative studies in NIH 3T3 cells, pSRα EWS/FLI1-IRES-puro was created by polymerase chain reaction modifying EWS/FLI1 to add a NotI site on the 3′ end, and then cloning a NotI-HindIII IRES-puro fragment with EWS/FLI1 into the pSRα MSV tkneo backbone. Retroviral infections were performed as described previously (11Arvand A. Welford S.M. Teitell M.A. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5311-5317PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of the pSRα constructs were CaPO4-transfected with 15 μg of Ψ- ecotrophic (for NIH 3T3 cells) or amphotrophic (for TC32 cells) packaging plasmid into 293T cells. After 2 days, viral collections were made for 24 h, filtered, and applied to cells. NIH 3T3 cells or the human Ewing’s tumor cell line, TC32, were carried in 5% calf serum/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and selected with 450 μg/ml G418 2 days post-infection. For the dominant negative studies, NIH 3T3 cells were subjected to two rounds of infection and selection. First, the cells were given retrovirus from pMSCV GFP-IRES-puro or pSRα EWS/FLI1-IRES-puro (which has had its neomycin resistance gene removed), selected with puromycin 2 μg/ml, and then split and infected with either pSRα EWS/FLI1 Δ22 tkneo or empty vector pSRα MSV tkneo and selected with G418. Electromobility shift assays were performed as described (15May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Briefly, EWS/FLI1 proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated using the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, catalog number L4610). Two μl of each protein were incubated with 50,000 cpm of radioactively labeled double-stranded annealed oligonucleotides (5′ GGTTGAGACCGGAAGTGGGG 3′ and 5′ TTGGCCCCACTTCCGGTCTC 3′), which compose the consensus FLI1-binding site (16Mao X. Miesfeldt S. Yang H. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18216-18222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min, and then run on a 6% polyacrylamide, 0.25% TBE, 5% glycerol gel at 20 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. For supershifts, reactions were incubated for 5 min with 3.3 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, catalog number F-3165) prior to addition of the probe. The negative control samples represent binding reactions with in vitro transcription and translation of empty vector plasmid. The gel was then dried and exposed to film. Western and Northern blots were performed using standard procedures. For protein analysis, cell lysates were made using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmTris, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA). 80 μg of total protein lysates were run on denaturing SDS gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes on a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus, and decorated with α-FLI1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-356) in 5% milk, 1× TBS-T. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Transduction Laboratories, catalog number R14745) and Western blot Chemiluminescent Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog number NEL101) were used for detection. Coomassie staining of the gel and Ponceau staining of the membrane were used to ensure equal loading. For Northern blots, RNA lysates were made using STAT-60 (TEL-TEST, Inc.). Approximately 8 μg were run under denaturing conditions on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by capillary methods, and hybridized and washed using standard methods. Ethidium staining of the gel was used to ensure equal loading. Agar assays were performed as described previously (10May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 NIH 3T3 cells expressing EWS/FLI1, a DBD mutant, or empty vector (tkneo) were seeded in semi-solid agar in high serum conditions (final 20%) and incubated for a period of 4 weeks. Photographs were taken at days 14, 21, and 28; 21-day pictures are shown. For tumor assays, 1 × 106 NIH 3T3 cells expressing EWS/FLI1 constructs or empty vector or TC32 cells expressing Δ22 or empty vector were subcutaneously injected into the nape region of the neck of CB17 SCID mice. All mice were female and of about 6–8 weeks of age at the time of injection. Mice were observed until a grossly visible tumor of 1.5 cm in diameter was present, at which time the animals were sacrificed and the tumors were dissected. Tumor cell lines were created by culturing minced tumors until cell lines were established and expanded. To assay the necessity of the FLI1 DBD for the oncogenic potency of EWS/FLI1, we created a panel of mutations within the DBD that would knock out the DNA binding activity of the fusion molecule, and we then compared the transforming and tumorigenic abilities of these mutants to wild type EWS/FLI1. The solution structure of the DBD of FLI1 bound to DNA has been solved and demonstrates contact points with DNA through at least three residues: Arg-337, Arg-340, and Tyr-341 (17Liang H. Mao X. Olejniczak E.T. Nettesheim D.G., Yu, L. Meadows R.P. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Two of these residues, Arg-337 and Arg-340, are invariant in all ETS proteins. Tyr-341 is thought to contact the methyl group of the thymidine complementary to the second adenosine of the GGAA core ETS DNA-binding sequence. Site-specific mutagenesis of any of these residues is sufficient to abrogate binding of the FLI1 DBD to a DNA probe in vitro (17Liang H. Mao X. Olejniczak E.T. Nettesheim D.G., Yu, L. Meadows R.P. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose to create EWS/FLI1 molecules with point mutations in the codons of each of these amino acids individually and in combination. This produced five EWS/FLI1 point mutants as follows: R337N, R340N, Y341V, double mutant R337N/R340N, and triple mutant R337N/R340N/Y341V (Fig. 1 A). We also made an EWS/FLI1 construct that lacks the first 65 amino acids of the ETS domain (Δ65). This deletion removes almost all of the three α-helices in the DBD that are involved in direct contact to DNA. All of the EWS/FLI1 constructs contain an amino-terminal FLAG tag. To confirm that these DBD mutants would be deficient in binding to a FLI1 target sequence, we performed gel shift analysis on in vitro transcribed and translated mutant proteins (Fig. 1 B) using a 32P-labeled FLI1 consensus binding sequence (16Mao X. Miesfeldt S. Yang H. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18216-18222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type EWS/FLI1 is capable of binding to this probe, creating a specific gel shift complex (Fig. 1 C, asterisk). This complex can be supershifted using an α-FLAG antibody, confirming that EWS/FLI1 is part of this complex (Fig. 1 C, double asterisk). In contrast, all of the DBD mutants were incapable of binding. The only bands present in these lanes are nonspecific bands, present in the negative control lane as well. Even on overexposed film, no specific gel shift complexes can be seen (data not shown). Thus, these mutations in the DBD of EWS/FLI1 ablate the capacity of this protein to bind DNA as a monomer in vitro. Previously, several studies (9Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5592-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that DNA binding deficient mutants of EWS/FLI1 have reduced transforming activity in soft agar colony-forming assays. To confirm that our mutants were behaving similarly, we retrovirally transduced EWS/FLI1, EWS/FLI1 DBD mutants, or an empty vector (tkneo) into NIH 3T3 cells. Following a brief selection with neomycin, the cells were suspended in soft agar for a 4-week period. Concordant with previous results, whereas EWS/FLI1 efficiently forms colonies within 2–3 weeks, all of the DBD mutants demonstrate diminished capacity to grow in semi-solid media (Fig. 2 A). Mutant R340N retains some ability to form colonies, with a 30–40% decrement in both size and number of colonies as compared with wild type EWS/FLI1. However, when mutations are made at both the Arg-337 and Arg-340 residues (double), or at the Arg-337, Arg-340, and Tyr-341 residues (triple), the ability of EWS/FLI1 to transform is reduced to levels only slightly above background. These results were consistent in two independent experiments. In addition, we investigated whether the DBD mutants retain the ability to activate EWS/FLI1 up-regulated genes in vivo. Two of the target genes that we chose to analyze were stromelysin and eat-2, both previously identified EWS/FLI1-activated genes (18Braun B.S. Frieden R. Lessnick S.L. May W.A. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4623-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in a Northern blot in Fig. 2 B, NIH 3T3 cells expressing EWS/FLI1 have high levels of expression of both of these genes, whereas empty vector cells have undetectable levels. The DBD mutants are unable to activate transcription of either of these target genes. Thus, it seems that the mutations in the DBD of EWS/FLI1 have not only impaired in vitro DNA binding function, but in vivo functions as well. In addition to formation of colonies in soft agar, tumorigenesis assays have been used to assess the potency of EWS/ETS fusions in vivo (11Arvand A. Welford S.M. Teitell M.A. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5311-5317PubMed Google Scholar, 12Teitell M.A. Thompson A.D. Sorensen P.H. Shimada H. Triche T.J. Denny C.T. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1535-1543PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thompson A.D. Teitell M.A. Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We utilized a SCID mouse tumorigenesis assay to investigate the oncogenic potential of the EWS/FLI1 DBD mutants. The same NIH 3T3 populations expressing the DBD mutants that were used for the soft agar assays were injected subcutaneously into CB17 SCID mice. For each mouse, the time to formation of a 1.5-cm tumor was recorded. Strikingly, we found that most of the DBD mutations had virtually no effect on the tumorigenic rate of EWS/FLI1 (Fig. 3 A). In independent experiments, NIH 3T3 cells expressing EWS/FLI1 formed 1.5-cm tumors with an average of 22.2 days. Empty vector NIH 3T3 cells formed tumors with an average of 43.8 days. Almost all of the mutant cohorts formed tumors with an average latency of 16–20 days. The only exception was the R337N mutant, which averaged 46.3 days. This mutant is particularly anomalous. When this mutation is put in the context of the double and triple mutants, this loss of tumorigenic function is not seen. Perhaps the most definitive result is the behavior of the NIH 3T3 cells expressing the EWS/FLI1 Δ65 construct, which formed tumors with an average latency of 18.5 days post-injection. With almost a complete loss of the DBD, tumorigenesis is not affected. These results suggest that the DBD of EWS/FLI1 is not required for NIH 3T3-induced tumorigenesis. Western analysis demonstrated that all of the EWS/FLI1 DBD mutant proteins were expressed in both implant cells and tumor-derived explant cell lines. As seen in Fig. 3 B, expression of the mutants is higher than wild type EWS/FLI1 in both the groups of cell lines. In addition, Northern analyses were performed and found that the DBD mutants were more highly expressed at the transcriptional level, likely contributing to the observed differences in protein (data not shown). These results raise the possibility that the biologic effects of the mutants are non-physiologic and an artifact of being so highly expressed. To reduce the expression levels of the DBD mutants, we selected two of the constructs to clone into an alternate expression vector. Based on previous experiments in our lab and by others, we have found that placement of a gene downstream of a viral IRES cassette results in reduced expression of the gene 3′ to the IRES. We subcloned a GFP-IRES cassette in front of EWS/FLI1, EWS/FLI1 R340N, and EWS/FLI1 Δ65 in our retroviral expression constructs. To confirm reduced levels of protein expression from these SGI (SRαGFP-IRES) vectors, we infected NIH 3T3 cells as before and prepared lysates for Western analysis. As seen in Fig. 4 A, the placement of the IRES cassette resulted in 3–4-fold reduced expression of both EWS/FLI1 R340N and EWS/FLI1 Δ65. EWS/FLI1 expression was also reduced. This reduction in expression of the mutants allows us to determine whether the observed biologic effects of the EWS/FLI1 DBD mutants are simply due to a titration effect. NIH 3T3 cells expressing each of the appropriate EWS/FLI1 constructs were injected subcutaneously into SCID mice and observed for tumor formation. The results of two independent assays are presented in Fig. 4 B. Tumorigenicity by EWS/FLI1, R340N, and Δ65 was not significantly affected by reduction in levels of expression. The placement of the GFP IRES cassette in these vectors resulted in tumor formation rates for SGI EWS/FLI1, SGI R340N, and SGI Δ65 of 22.6, 21.2, and 25.4 days, respectively. Fig. 4 C demonstrates that expression of EWS/FLI1 constructs is maintained over the course of tumor formation and present in explant cell lines. These results suggest that tumor formation by EWS/FLI1 DBD mutants is not a function of an impaired yet overexpressed oncogene but rather that EWS/FLI1 contains oncogenic functions that are independent of its DNA binding domain. The behavior of the EWS/FLI1 DNA binding domain mutants suggests that the lack of a functional DNA binding domain does not impair the ability of EWS/FLI1 to form tumors when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Given that strictly normalizing protein levels of wild type and mutant EWS/FLI1 constructs proved difficult, we sought to confirm our tumorigenesis results using an alternative strategy. Dominant negative ets constructs have been used previously to compete with EWS/FLI1 for DNA-binding sites and thereby inhibit the DNA binding function of EWS/FLI1 (19Kovar H. Aryee D.N. Jug G. Henockl C. Schemper M. Delattre O. Thomas G. Gadner H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 429-437PubMed Google Scholar). For our experiments we chose a construct that is composed of the 3′ region of FLI1 that is present in the fusion gene, including the ets DNA binding domain, but lacks the 5′ EWS region and its associated transcriptional activation properties. Expression of this construct (Δ22, Fig. 1) has been shown to inhibit the function of EWS/FLI1 in in vitro transformation assays, as well as target gene activation (13Thompson A.D. Teitell M.A. Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Zwerner J.P. May W.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To test the ability of the dominant negative construct to impair EWS/FLI1-induced tumors in SCID mice, we first infected NIH 3T3 cells with retrovirus containing either EWS/FLI1 or GFP. These populations were expanded and split and then infected with either Δ22 or empty vector. These four cell lines (GFP tkneo, GFP Δ22, EWS/FLI1 tkneo, and EWS/FLI1 Δ22) were then subjected to the same protocol as before to assay for tumor formation. In Fig. 5 A, results of two independent assays are presented in the form of a survival curve, wherein the mice were sacrificed upon the formation of a 1.5-cm tumor. Once again, expression of EWS/FLI1 results in the formation of tumors in about 3 weeks (average of 22.9 days). Of nine GFP tkneo mice, four did not form tumors within 80 days; those that did averaged 40.4 days. Co-expression of GFP and Δ22 resulted in tumor formation in seven of nine mice and averaged 54.7 days. Interestingly, co-expression of Δ22 with EWS/FLI1 did not have any effect on the rate of tumor formation. EWS/FLI1 Δ22 mice formed tumors with an average of 22.8 days and resulted in a survival curve that almost completely overlaps with EWS/FLI1 mice. We also tested the behavior of these cell lines in soft agar assays to confirm that the dominant negative construct was working as reported previously (Fig. 5 B). Here, Δ22 can inhibit the function of EWS/FLI1. Thus, although Δ22 is capable of inhibiting transforming abilities of EWS/FLI1 in agar and up-regulation of at least some target genes (13Thompson A.D. Teitell M.A. Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is incapable of reducing tumor formation in these cells. These results support the finding that functions associated with the DNA binding domain of EWS/FLI1 are not required for its tumorigenic activity in NIH 3T3 cells. Finally, to confirm the levels of protein expression in these cells, we performed Western blot analyses in both the implant and explant tumor cell lines, and we used an antibody to FLI1 to detect both EWS/FLI1 and Δ22. In these cell lines, EWS/FLI1 is expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 5 C). Importantly, the expression of Δ22 is much higher than that of EWS/FLI1 in both implant and tumor explant cell lines, facilitating its role as a dominant negative. Additionally, the maintained expression of Δ22 in explant tumor cell lines suggests that the inability to inhibit tumor formation is not a function of lost expression of the inhibitor. The results with EWS/FLI1 mutants and a dominant negative construct suggested that the DBD of EWS/FLI1 is not required for tumor formation in an NIH 3T3 model system. To test whether the DBD is important for tumorigenesis in a Ewing’s tumor derived cell line containing the EWS/FLI1 fusion, we infected the human Ewing’s sarcoma cell line TC32 with a retrovirus containing either the dominant negative construct (Δ22) or an empty vector. After selection for stable transfectants, we injected cells into mice as before, and we observed the mice for tumor formation. In contrast to the behavior of NIH 3T3 cells, TC32 cells are significantly inhibited by the Δ22 construct. As seen in Fig. 6 A, TC32 tkneo cells uniformly formed tumors with an average of 18.3 days. TC32 Δ22 cells formed tumors at a delayed rate, with an average of 29.0 days. The difference between these cohorts is statistically significant (p = 0.0003). These results support the importance the DBD of EWS/FLI1 in tumorigenesis. To confirm the levels of protein expression, protein lysates were harvested at the time of injection and subjected to Western analysis (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, the level of EWS/FLI1 in TC32 tkneo cells was actually lower than TC32 Δ22 cells, precluding the possibility that reduced protein expression leads to decreased rates of tumor formation. Δ22 expression is maintained in TC32 Δ22 tumor cell lines, albeit lower than the input line. Our data indicate that the ets DBD of EWS/FLI1 is not required for NIH 3T3-induced tumors in SCID mice but is necessary for promotion of anchorage-independent growth of these cells in soft agar. Even though the NIH 3T3 model system only approximates Ewing's oncogenesis, the fact that DBD null mutants have any tumorigenic effects at all is surprising. Our observations suggest that EWS/FLI1 can mediate oncogenesis by both DNA-binding dependent and DNA-binding independent pathways. The fact that in vivo growth of a Ewing's tumor cell line is inhibited by expression of a dominant negative FLI1 construct suggests that in this cellular context DNA-binding dependent pathways are required. Furthermore, this accounts for the observation that in Ewing's tumor samples, the etsDBD is invariably intact. Our findings are in agreement with a recently described (9Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5592-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) EWS/FLI1 DBD mutant that abolishes in vitro DNA binding but retains a reduced capability to promote NIH 3T3 anchorage-independent growth. In our assays, multiple DBD mutant EWS/FLI1 constructs still maintain oncogenic activity. The results with the single R337N mutant ran counter to the majority of our DBD mutant constructs. It is unclear why this particular mutant lost tumorigenic potential, whereas the double and triple mutants that include the R337N point mutation did not. Perhaps there are secondary and tertiary structural effects unique to the R337N construct that disrupt additional functions of EWS/FLI1. Nonetheless, the predominant trend taking into account all ets DBD mutants suggests that the tumorigenic ability of EWS/FLI1 is not dependent on direct DNA binding activity in all model systems. The discordance between the behavior of our DBD mutants in soft agar assays compared with SCID mouse tumor assays complicates the analysis of oncogenic capabilities. The majority of studies that have investigated the oncogenic role of EWS/FLI1 have depended on tissue culture-based transformation assays that measure anchorage-independent growth. Although there is often a strong correlation between these assays and in vivo tumor growth, this association is not invariant. For example, NIH 3T3 cells expressing the Ewing's variant EWS/ETV1 translocation product display no anchorage-independent growth in agar assays but are capable of forming tumors in the SCID mouse assay (13Thompson A.D. Teitell M.A. Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This suggests that anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenic assays are different measures of aberrant cellular growth. Furthermore, by nature, these assays require different cellular characteristics. Whereas anchorage-independent growth demonstrates the ability of cells to grow without supportive and growth-regulating extracellular matrix, tumor formation in SCID mice requires angiogensis and invasion into surrounding tissues. Thus, these assays likely measure different facets of transforming activity. In vivo, ETS proteins often bind DNA as part of heteromeric complexes. Interactions with members of the AP-1, NF-κB, and Pax families can lead to combinatorial control, which is a characteristic property of ETS proteins (for review, see Ref. 21Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In in vitro binding assays, however, most ETS proteins bind as monomers to concise binding regions without the help of cofactors. It is therefore difficult to conclude that mutations that disrupt in vitro binding activity necessarily result in disruption of in vivo activity. However, because we have used an EWS/FLI1 mutant that has a deletion covering the three α-helices involved in ets DNA binding (Δ65) in addition to specific point mutations, we assert that direct DNA binding in vivo is most likely abolished as well. Therefore, the maintained rate of tumor formation by this and other EWS/FLI1 DBD mutants strongly suggests that EWS/ETS functions that are not wholly reliant on direct DNA binding exist and are likely relevant to Ewing’s biology. The lack of a functional DBD, however, does not necessarily preclude EWS/FLI1 from interacting with transcription complexes. Alternative methods of localizing transcription factors to a transcriptional apparatus, such as protein-tethered transactivation, have been described previously for ets family members (for review, see Ref. 21Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For example, interaction between Ets1 and USF-1 results in cooperative activation of the human immunodeficiency virus, type I, promoter. The consensus site for USF-1 and the transcriptional activation domain of Ets1 are both required for this effect, whereas a functional ETS-binding site is not (22Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Jarosch U. Graf T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus ETS proteins can be recruited to promoters and contribute to transcriptional regulation without directly binding to DNA. Likewise, the transactivation activities of EWS/FLI1 may be subjected to similar methods of regulation. EWS/FLI1 may also exert some of its oncogenic effects through mechanisms separate from transcription initiation. The associations of EWS with splicing factors SF1, U1C, and TASR suggest that EWS and EWS/FLI1 may alter gene expression through mRNA processing as well as promoter activation (4Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol.

In fact, EWS/FLI1 has been shown to interfere with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1-dependent splice site selection in an E1Amodel system (24Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22317-22322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, EWS/FLI1 alters the interaction between EWS and YB-1, a multifunctional transcription and translation factor that also affects E1A splicing in vitro (25Chansky H.A. Hu M. Hickstein D.D. Yang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3586-3590PubMed Google Scholar). These in vitro functional data suggest that alternative EWS/FLI1 interactions may have significant effects on splice site selection or efficiency of pre-mRNA processing. Thus, alteration of these functions may contribute to the oncogenic potential of EWS/FLI1. In this way, EWS/FLI1 may act as a dominant negative version of the wild type EWS, utilizing mechanisms that do not need a functional DBD. The portion of FLI1 that is present in the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein is roughly divisible into two significant regions, the DBD and the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). With the deletion of the DBD, EWS/FLI1 DNA-binding independent oncogenic pathways can be attributed to either the EWS region or the FLI1 carboxyl-terminal region, or a cooperation between the two. In contrast to the DBD, however, deletion of the 89-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region results in a profound delay in tumor formation and a starkly different gene expression profile (11Arvand A. Welford S.M. Teitell M.A. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5311-5317PubMed Google Scholar). This argues that the EWS/FLI1 DNA-binding independent oncogenic pathways still depend on FLI1 and that they probably do not simply result from expressing a carboxyl-terminal deleted form of EWS. Our results suggest that EWS/FLI1 promotes oncogenesis by both DNA-binding dependent and independent mechanisms. It appears likely that both pathways are necessary for genesis of Ewing's tumors and that attenuation of either pathway could inhibit tumor growth. Our NIH 3T3 tumorigenesis model system allows for detection of EWS/FLI1 oncogenic activity that is independent of direct DNA binding. This will potentially allow for development of inhibitory strategies that can target this pathway and may then be tested in Ewing's tumor cells.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unwinding of an AT-rich region near the left border oforiC then occurs and requires the ATP-bound form of DnaA protein (4Bramhill D. Kornberg A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of ATP to DnaC, a prerequisite, forms the DnaB-DnaC complex (7Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Galletto R. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12959-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which is then recruited to oriC to form the prepriming complex (9Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this step, DnaB interacts with two functional domains of DnaA protein; the stabilization of the prepriming complex also may involve a cryptic single-stranded DNA binding activity of DnaC (10Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Upon the release of DnaC from the prepriming complex, DnaB is then free to act as a helicase to unwind further the parental DNA template. Its distributive interaction with primase leads to the priming of both leading and lagging strands that are then concurrently extended by each catalytic unit of the dimeric DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in the enzymatic machinery at each replication fork (Ref. 13Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 925-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and references therein). The E. coli replication origin is a locus at which DNA replication is controlled. This site also serves as the assembly site for the enzymatic machinery destined to function at each of the two replication forks that move in opposite directions on the bacterial chromosome. The work described below addresses two questions. First, what is the molecular composition of complexes formed atoriC in assembling the replication fork machinery? Second, because DnaB is the replicative helicase that drives replication fork movement, is the entry of DnaB at oriC somehow modulated so that one and only one helicase molecule is bound per replication fork, or can multiple DnaB molecules bind? The stoichiometries of DnaA and DnaB protein in the prepriming complex assembled at oriCwere determined under several experimental conditions. The important observation is that the number of DnaB molecules in the prepriming complex is restricted, suggesting a mechanism to control this event. Plasmid DNAs and purified proteins have been described previously (10Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19334-19340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To separate the steps of assembly of the prepriming complex from downstream events of priming and DNA replication, staged incubations were performed (15Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first stage (15-μl reaction volume assembled on ice) contained 200 ng of M13oriC2LB5 supercoiled DNA, 0.37 μg of SSB, 9 ng of HU, 90 ng of DnaA, 100 ng of DnaB, and 56 ng of DnaC protein in Buffer I (40 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.25, 17%(v/v) glycerol, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmmagnesium acetate, 7 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 5 mm ATP) and was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. In the indicated experiments the concentrations of ATP and magnesium acetate in Buffer I were varied. Reactions were returned to ice, then components (in a 10-μl volume) for priming and DNA replication were added so that their final concentrations or amounts (in a 25-μl reaction volume) were 0.1 mm [3H]dNTPs, 0.5 mm rCTP, rGTP, and rUTP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 μg of creatine kinase, 0.5 μg of the A subunit of DNA gyrase, 2 μg of the B subunit of DNA gyrase, 22 ng of primase, and 25 ng of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The concentrations of magnesium acetate and ATP were adjusted to 10 and 3 mm, respectively, for the second stage of incubation (24 °C for 30 min). The extent of DNA synthesis was measured as trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry. To measure the formation of a highly underwound DNA called Form I* (16Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), reactions (15 μl) to assemble the prepriming complex were performed as described above with ATP at 5 mm and magnesium acetate at 0.5 mm. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reactions were returned to ice, and magnesium acetate was adjusted to 10 mm. Creatine phosphate, 8 mm; creatine kinase, 0.1 μg; A subunit of DNA gyrase, 0.5 μg; and B subunit of DNA gyrase, 2 μg; were added followed by incubation at 24 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA and SDS to 10 mm and 0.5% (w/v), respectively, and incubation at 65 °C for 5 min. The samples were then electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel in 90 mmTris borate, 1 mm EDTA overnight at 30 V, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed, and band intensities were determined with a Kodak EDAS 120 system. Reactions of prepriming complex formation (150 μl) (9Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained 2 μg of either M13oriC2LB5 or M13ΔE101 supercoiled DNA, as indicated, 3.7 μg of SSB, 90 ng of HU, 0.9 μg of DnaA, 1.0 μg of DnaB, and 0.56 μg of DnaC protein in Buffer I. In the indicated experiments, the concentrations of ATP and magnesium acetate in Buffer I used to assemble and isolate the prepriming complex were varied. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the sample was applied to a precalibrated gel filtration column (Sepharose 4B, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 0.7 × 13 cm) equilibrated in Buffer I, but with the concentrations of ATP and magnesium acetate at the same levels as those used in assembling the complex. Fractions of 200 μl were collected. Prepriming complexes separated from protein not bound to the DNA substrate eluted in column fractions corresponding to the void volume of the column. The DNA in void volume fractions containing isolated prepriming complexes was quantitated by agarose gel electrophoresis in 90 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA relative to known amounts of M13oriC2LB5 or M13ΔE101 supercoiled DNA that were used to prepare a standard curve. Detection of DNA was by ethidium bromide staining, and the gels were photographed and analyzed with a Kodak EDAS 120 gel documentation system. The amounts of different prepriming proteins in isolated prepriming complexes were determined by quantitative immunoblotting in which the samples were first separated in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA-85, Schleicher & Schuell). Known amounts of the respective prepriming proteins were electrophoresed and transferred in parallel to prepare standard curves. The blots were probed with either M43 monoclonal antibody for DnaA protein (17Marszalek J. Zhang W. Hupp T.R. Margulies C. Carr K.M. Cherry S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18535-18542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or affinity-purified polyclonal antibody for DnaB or DnaC. The chemiluminescent signal (SuperSignal, Pierce) provided by horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the secondary antibody in immune complexes was detected and quantitated with a Bio-Rad model GS505 Molecular imager and associated software. AtoriC, assembly of the prepriming complex requires DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC and is stimulated by HU (or IHF) protein (9Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of this intermediate on a supercoiled DNA bearingoriC can be demonstrated by several methods. One involves its isolation by gel filtration to separate the prepriming complex from proteins not bound to the DNA, followed by measurement of its replication activity by the addition of replication proteins (SSB, primase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and DNA gyrase) that act at subsequent stages of the replication process (14Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19334-19340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18van der Ende A. Baker T.A. Ogawa T. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this complex can be demonstrated without its isolation in staged incubations involving its assembly in the first stage, and DNA replication in the second (15Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a highly underwoundoriC plasmid is a third method (16Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this assay, DnaA bound to oriC induces single-stranded character to a region of DNA near the left oriC border. The helicase activity of DnaB enlarges this region, and the compensating positive superhelicity contained in the duplex portion of the DNA can be relieved by the action of DNA gyrase. The highly negatively supercoiled DNA termed F1* is the product of this assay. Finally, prepriming complex formation can be shown by the specific retention of DnaA and DnaB (and also DnaC if the prepriming complex is formed with ATPγS instead of ATP) atoriC by immunoblot analysis of isolated complexes (10Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by electron microscopy (9Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Crooke E. Thresher R. Hwang D.S. Griffith J. Kornberg A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a study by Sekimizu et al. (15Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the reaction conditions optimal for forming the prepriming complex were examined. ATP and Mg2+ at 5 mm and 0.3 mm, respectively, stabilized the complex whereas a higher concentration of Mg2+ was suboptimal. To confirm the importance of these reaction conditions, experiments were done to measure the assembly of the pre-priming complex in staged incubations. In the first stage, DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and HU were incubated with the oriCplasmid. ATP and Mg2+ concentrations were varied in the first stage of incubation. In the second stage, their concentrations were adjusted to 3 mm ATP and 10 mmMg2+, and primase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, SSB, and DNA gyrase were added to measure DNA synthesis. The results of Fig.1 show that among the concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ tested, formation of the prepriming complex occurs best at low Mg2+ (0.5 mm) and at 5 mm ATP. Under these conditions, DNA replication is absolutely dependent on DnaA protein and a supercoiled template carrying oriC. (Fig. 2). Furthermore, this DNA replication activity correlated with a more direct assay of prepriming complex formation as measured by F1* formation (Fig. 3). By agarose gel electrophoresis, this highly underwound DNA migrates more rapidly than the supercoiled oriC plasmid (Form I) isolated from E. coli. Its formation requires assembly of the prepriming complex in which DnaA protein at oriC first unwinds a region of duplex DNA within oriC followed by entry of DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex. Once DnaB has bound to the DNA template, its activity as a DNA helicase enlarges the opened region and induces positive superhelicity elsewhere on the duplex portion of the DNA. Addition of DNA gyrase relieves the positive superhelicity; further combined activities of DnaB and gyrase produce Form I* that is highly negatively supercoiled.Figure 2Prepriming complex formation requires a plasmid carrying oriC. Assembly of the prepriming complex on an oriC plasmid (M13oriC2LB5), or the vector DNA (M13ΔE101) as a negative control was performed with 5 mm ATP and 0.5 mm Mg2+ in the first stage of incubation with the indicated amounts of DnaA protein. See “Experimental Procedures” for details. In the second stage of incubation, the concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ were adjusted to 3 and 10 mm, respectively, and components to measure DNA synthesis were added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3DNA synthesis activity of the prepriming complex correlates with Form I* formation. In panel A, prepriming complexes were assembled at 5 mm ATP and 0.5 mm Mg2+ during the first stage of incubation with the indicated amounts of DnaA protein. At the end of this incubation, DNA gyrase was added instead of the normal components required to measure DNA synthesis. Incubation was at 24 °C for 10 min, then the samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in “Experimental Procedures.” The positions of supercoiled (Form I), linear (Form III), and nicked (Form II) plasmid DNAs are indicated at the right, based on the electrophoretic mobilities of marker DNAs. Form I* is the highly underwound DNA produced by the activity of DNA gyrase on the prepriming complex. Inpanel B, the relative abundance of Form I* (in arbitrary units based on the quantitative analysis of the ethidium bromide-stained gel) was determined and plotted in parallel with DNA synthesis activity (data from Fig. 2) of the prepriming complex as a function of the amount of DnaA protein added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In our experience, DnaA protein has a natural tendency to self-aggregate, and to bind to DNA nonspecifically when assay conditions are not appropriate (3Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Assays like those above that measure the activity of the prepriming complex fail to detect the formation of inactive complexes resulting from nonspecific binding of DnaA and other prepriming proteins to DNA. To provide more support for the importance of reaction conditions in assembly of the prepriming complex atoriC, experiments were done to measure the binding of prepriming proteins to either the oriC DNA or the vector as a negative control when incubated at various concentrations of ATP and Mg2+. As will be shown below, ATP at 5 mm and Mg2+ at 0.5 mm promote the specific assembly of the prepriming complex at oriC whereas omission of Mg2+ or low ATP (0.1 mm) results in nonspecific binding of DnaA and DnaB to the vector DNA. After incubation, proteins bound to each respective DNA were separated from unbound protein by gel filtration chromatography. Fractions from the column were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the DNA (Fig.4, A and D) and by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for each prepriming protein (Fig. 4, C–F). At 0.1 mm ATP, a level sufficient to saturate the ATP binding site of DnaA protein but in the absence of Mg2+, the amount of DnaA bound to the vector plasmid was comparable with that bound to the oriC DNA (Fig.4, C and D), indicating nonspecific binding. Whereas DnaB bound preferentially to the oriC plasmid, the level of DnaB coeluting with the vector DNA (Fig. 4 F) may be because of its ability to bind to DnaA (10Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that, under these conditions, is binding nonspecifically to this DNA. In this experiment, DnaC was not detected because of an insufficient amount of affinity-purified anti-DnaC antibody. However, we did not expect DnaC to be retained in the prepriming complex because ATP supports the release of DnaC from DnaB once the helicase is bound to DNA (11Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation of DnaC from DnaB is dependent on ATP hydrolysis because the replacement of ATP with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue (ATPγS) results in the retention of DnaC to DnaB (20Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. Kaguni, unpublished results. Prepriming complexes assembled under other conditions were also analyzed by immunoblotting. At a higher level of ATP (5 mmcompared with 0.1 mm ATP in Fig. 4) but without Mg2+, DnaA was bound to the vector DNA at a comparable level as in Fig. 4 E (data not shown). This observation suggests that DnaA probably binds to ATP as a Mg-ATP chelate. Lowering the ratio of DnaA protein to DNA prior to gel filtration chromatography did not reduce this background of nonspecific binding of DnaA to DNA. Elevating the Mg2+ concentration to 10 mm in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP, specific binding of DnaA to theoriC plasmid was observed with no detectable binding of DnaA protein to the vector. However, the level of DnaA bound under this condition is suboptimal for DNA replication activity of the prepriming complex (Fig. 1). At 5 mm ATP and 0.5 mm Mg2+, conditions optimal for prepriming complex formation (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), prepriming complexes were isolated by gel filtration chromatography and analyzed to determine the stoichiometry of specific proteins to oriCDNA by quantitative Western blotting (see Fig.5 for examples). The amount of DNA was determined by quantitation of ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels relative to known amounts of DNA that were co-electrophoresed and used to prepare a standard curve. Under these conditions, the binding of DnaA to the oriC plasmid was specific. In contrast, if for example ATP was omitted from the buffer for gel filtration chromatography, the ratio of DnaA per oriC was 27 monomers per DNA (Table I, line 4). As ATP minimizes nonspecific aggregation (3Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the ratio of DnaA protein per oriC DNA measured here may not be physiologically relevant. Recall also that nonspecific binding of DnaA and DnaB to the vector DNA occurs when Mg2+ was omitted from the column buffer (Fig. 4). These observations emphasize the importance of reaction conditions when measuring the binding of DnaA to DnaA box sequences to derive values on stoichiometry; DnaA binds DNA nonspecifically in the absence of ATP or Mg2+.Table IStoichiometry of DnaA and DnaB at oriCConditionsProteinMonomers peroriCNRangeComplete prepriming mixDnaA9.9 ± 1.458.5–12.0DnaB12.0 ± 0.4311.6–12.4No DnaB-DnaCDnaA4.2 ± 1.143.3–5.8No ATP in column bufferDnaA27 ± 2.3325–29M13ΔE101 in place of M13oriC2LB5DnaA≤0.5The results from identical sets of experiments were averaged to calculate the standard deviation for the stoichiometry of DnaA and DnaB protein.

Open table in a new tab The results from identical sets of experiments were averaged to calculate the standard deviation for the stoichiometry of DnaA and DnaB protein. The values under the column labeled N represent the number of times the experiment was performed. The range in the ratios of DnaA and DnaB per oriC plasmid is also indicated. Quantitative Western blotting was used to determine the stoichiometry of prepriming proteins specifically bound to oriC. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 5. Several identical experiments were performed to obtain statistical values which show a stoichiometry of 10 DnaA monomers and 2 DnaB hexamers peroriC plasmid. Because five DnaA boxes are present withinoriC (21Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 22Matsui M. Oka A. Takanami M. Yasuda S. Hirota Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), this value corresponds to two DnaA monomers per DnaA box. Replication forks that progress from oriC move bidirectionally on the circular bacterial chromosome. The two DnaB hexamers correspond to one helicase molecule per replication fork. Because the prepriming complex was assembled with ATP, DnaC that was originally in the DnaB-DnaC complex was not retained in the prepriming complex (data not shown). ATP hydrolysis by DnaB is presumed to move the helicase from its original site of entry. Interestingly, in the absence of DnaB and DnaC protein, the stoichiometry of DnaA bound to oriC was 4.2 ± 1.1 monomers. Given that oriC bears five DnaA boxes (21Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 22Matsui M. Oka A. Takanami M. Yasuda S. Hirota Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is attractive to interpret this stoichiometry to mean that each of the five DnaA boxes is bound by a single DnaA monomer whereas when DnaB has become stably bound to oriC, two monomers are bound per DnaA box. Apparently, the binding of additional DnaA molecules atoriC is coordinated with formation of the prepriming complex. DNA replication is initiated at oriC through a stepwise process involving the assembly of an intermediate termed the prepriming complex (reviewed in Refs. 1Messer W. Weigel C. Neidhardt F.C.

C.1996: 1579-1601Google Scholar and 2Kaguni J.M. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 145-157PubMed Google Scholar). Its formation requires the binding of DnaA protein to the DnaA boxes within oriC followed by the local unwinding of an AT-rich region near the left oriC border. DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex then binds, which must then lead to the proper positioning of two helicase molecules for bidirectional replication fork movement. The study described here determined the stoichiometry of prepriming proteins bound to oriC and is the first quantitative determination of the number of DnaA monomers alone and in the prepriming complex assembled on a supercoiledoriC plasmid. The results from immunoblotting are very reproducible among replicate experiments. Considering the error in measurements, DnaA alone binds with a stoichiometry of four to five DnaA monomers per oriC. This value coincides with the five DnaA boxes in oriC. The conclusion that a single monomer is bound to each box is based on this observation and others. Gel mobility shift experiments with DnaA bound to oriC reveals six shifted complexes (named Complex I through VI) (3Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In situfootprinting showed that Complexes I through IV are formed by the binding of DnaA to DnaA boxes R4, R1, R2, then R3, respectively. Although we were unable to detect if DnaA was bound to DnaA box R5, complex V (or VI) may be formed by this binding event. We suggest that complex VI (or conversely complex V if complex VI arises by the binding of DnaA to the R5 box) then forms by a conformational change in theoriC fragment induced by the interaction among bound DnaA monomers. Finally, gel mobility shift experiments with radiolabeled DnaA protein and an oligonucleotide carrying DnaA box R4 revealed a stoichiometry of 0.8 ± 1 DnaA monomer per DNA (23Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In thednaA promoter region, the stoichiometry was one monomer per DnaA box as determined by surface plasmon resonance (24Speck C. Weigel C. Messer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with our findings. The increase in stoichiometry to 10 DnaA monomers per oriCplasmid on inclusion of the DnaB-DnaC complex is the first evidence that the prepriming complex results in the recruitment of additional DnaA molecules upon DnaB binding. Because an N-terminal domain of DnaA is involved in oligomerization and in retention of DnaB in the prepriming complex (11Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 546-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), this domain is apparently involved both in the uptake of additional DnaA monomers and DnaB in the prepriming complex. The stoichiometry of two and only two DnaB hexamers suggests that a mechanism to control this process. DnaA bound to oriC alone and in the prepriming complex has been examined by electron microscopy (9Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Crooke E. Thresher R. Hwang D.S. Griffith J. Kornberg A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The samples were first fixed with glutaraldehyde then shadowed with tungsten vapor to enhance contrast. Although the method is inherently imprecise, the estimate of 20–40 monomers of DnaA bound to oriC is in reasonable agreement with our findings. The larger size of the prepriming complex compared with the DnaA-oriC complex when viewed by electron microscopy is also consistent with our immunoblotting results. ATP and Mg2+ concentrations are important in assembling the prepriming complex (Fig. 1). In the absence of Mg2+ or ATP, DnaA nonspecifically binds to the vector DNA (Table I, line 4; Fig. 4). DnaA is most likely in the form of a nonspecific aggregate because in the absence of either cofactor, DnaA binds to any DNA fragment. The large size of this protein-DNA complex is indicated by its retention near the sample well in gel mobility shift assays (3Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the absence of Mg2+ in the reaction buffer, DnaB also associates with the vector DNA when it should not be (Fig. 4). By comparison under conditions appropriate for prepriming complex formation, DNA replication is specific for supercoiled DNA carryingoriC (Fig. 3). A recent study described steps in assembing the replication fork machinery at oriC (26Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Primers in the vicinity oforiC served to recruit DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to form a replicative complex, requiring the prior assembly of the pre-priming complex. In the cited report, DnaB was modified to carry a protein kinase site to label it radioactively so that its ratio to the3H-labeled DNA template could be calculated. Despite the isolation of the replicative complex in buffer lacking ATP, the stoichiometry of DnaB bound to the forks was near two, in keeping with the bidirectional mode of replication and the stoichiometry of two hexamers that we determined here. The modified DnaB retains full activity as a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase (27Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It was also active in stimulating primase in general priming, but had 80% of wild type activity in oriC plasmid replication. The reduced activity suggests the possibility that the protein kinase site may perturb the activity of DnaB in initiation at oriC. In our studies, the wild type protein was used. DnaB binds poorly if at all to duplex DNA or to single-stranded DNA covered by SSB (28Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In physiologically relevant systems, an active process is involved in loading the helicase onto single-stranded DNA. In φX174 viral DNA replication, PriA with other primosomal proteins forms a complex that is then recognized by the DnaB-DnaC complex (29Marians, K. J. (1992) Annu. Rev. Biochem., 673–719.Google Scholar). In recombination-dependent DNA replication, PriA is also thought to load DnaB at D loop structures (reviewed in Ref. 30Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). AtoriC, DnaA is the helicase loader (10Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these systems, DnaB must be in a complex with DnaC for the helicase to be loaded. The involvement of DnaC in helicase loading may involve its ability to bind to single-stranded DNA (12Learn B.A. Um S.J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The binding site size of DnaB for single-stranded DNA is a polynucleotide of 20 residues. DnaA unwinds an AT-rich region near the left border of oriC, and KMnO4 probing indicates that 26 base pairs in this region becomes single stranded (31Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, an attractive model is that the unwound region is the site where DnaB initially binds to the DNA. Recent footprinting studies of DnaB bound at oriC support this model (26Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The finding that only two DnaB hexamers are bound in the prepriming complex suggests that the limited amount of available single-stranded DNA controls the number of DnaB hexamers that can bind. This model seems very unlikely for two reasons. First, it is estimated that a 6.6-kilobase supercoiled oriC plasmid used in our experiments has about 6% single-stranded character, based on electron microscopy of unwound structures induced by DnaB helicase activity in the absence of DNA gyrase (32Baker T.A. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6877-6885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This estimate is supported by the limited extent of DNA synthesis that is localized to theoriC region when DNA replication occurs on a supercoiled template with the necessary proteins but in the absence of DNA gyrase (15Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, in a replication system in which DnaB is delivered onto a single-stranded DNA covered by SSB by the binding of DnaA to a DnaA box hairpin, only one DnaB hexamer is bound. 3K. M. Carr and J. M. Kaguni, manuscript in preparation. A mechanism must act to limit the number of DnaB hexamers to one per single strand template. The 2-fold increase in the number of DnaA molecules bound tooriC upon binding of DnaB suggests a mechanism to modulate DnaB binding. In this model (Fig. 6), DnaA monomers bound to each DnaA box in oriC creates a structure recognized by the DnaB-DnaC complex. This then promotes the binding of additional DnaA monomers that not only stabilizes the binding of DnaB, but also blocks the subsequent binding of more DnaB hexamers. Because of the 2-fold increase in stoichiometry of DnaA at this step, and the report thatStreptomyces DnaA binds to a single DnaA box as a dimer (33Majka J. Zakrzewska-Czerwinska J. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6243-6252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is attractive to think that each DnaA box is bound by a dimer of DnaA. Once DnaB is bound to the template, DnaC is released. Driven by ATP hydrolysis, a single DnaB hexamer bound to each template strand can then move in the 5′ to 3′ direction from its original site of binding. It can interact with primase to prime leading-strand synthesis by the first primer and lagging-strand synthesis by primers made subsequently (34Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Reems J.A. McHenry C.S.

https://openalex.org/W1998772598,"The replicative apparatus often encounters blocks to its progression that necessitate removal of the block and reloading of the replication machinery. In Escherichia coli, a major pathway of replication restart involves unwinding of the stalled fork to generate a four-stranded Holliday junction, which can then be cleaved by the RuvABC helicase-endonuclease. This fork regression may be catalyzed by RecG but is thought to occur even in its absence. Here we test whether RuvAB helicase can also catalyze the unwinding of forked DNA to form Holliday junctions. We find that fork DNA is unwound in the direction required for Holliday junction formation only if the loading of RuvB is restricted to the parental duplex DNA arm. If the binding of RuvB is unrestricted, then RuvAB preferentially unwinds forks in the opposite direction. This is probably related to the greater efficiency of two opposed RuvB hexamers operating across a junction compared with a single hexamer. These data argue against RuvAB acting directly at damaged replication forks and imply that other mechanisms must operate in vivo to catalyze Holliday junction formation.

However, chromosomal replication within a cellular environment is fraught with difficulty. DNA damage that is not repaired before the passage of a replication fork may stall the replicative apparatus (1Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Moreover, other proteins necessarily bound to the DNA ahead of an advancing fork may also halt replication if not removed (2Krasilnikova M.M. Samadashwily G.M. Krasilnikov A.S. Mirkin S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5095-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Replication forks therefore face an array of obstacles which must be overcome if the cell is to survive (3Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Stalling of the replicative apparatus presents two major problems for all organisms. First, the original block to fork progression must be removed, and any damage to the DNA must be repaired. Secondly, replication must be restarted. The first of these challenges is met by an array of repair systems which act to remove or bypass lesions. The second challenge, that of restarting replication, must be met by reloading the replicative machinery onto the DNA away from the normal preprogrammed origins of replication. In Escherichia coli, replication is initiated by binding of DnaA to sequences within oriC (4Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). This catalyzes loading of the replicative helicase DnaB onto the template DNA which is the key step in replication fork assembly, allowing recruitment of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and DnaG primase onto the DNA. However, replication restart does not require DnaA but employs PriA, an enzyme that recognizes specific branched DNA structures in which a leading strand is present at the branch point (5Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 6Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At such structures, PriA performs the same function as DnaA at oriC by loading DnaB onto the lagging strand template (9Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This reloading of the replicative helicase at stalled forks is crucial for replication restart as shown by the severe reduction in viability and greatly enhanced sensitivity to UV light of strains lacking PriA (10Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This PriA-dependent restart process is intimately linked with recombination. A major pathway of restarting stalled replication forks involves the formation of a four-stranded Holliday junction by unwinding of the leading and lagging strands at a fork and their subsequent annealing (11Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 12Flores M.J. Bierne H. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These Holliday junctions are processed by the RuvABC complex. A tetramer of RuvA binds Holliday junction DNA and loads two hexameric RuvB helicase rings on opposite arms of the junction (13West S.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The RuvB hexamers pull opposing duplex arms of the junction through the rings with the result being active movement of the branch point along the DNA as it spools across the face of the RuvA tetramer (14Hiom K. Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Hargreaves D. Rice D.W. Sedelnikova S.E. Artymiuk P.J. Lloyd R.G. Rafferty J.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The third component of this complex, a dimer of RuvC, binds to the branch point on the opposite face of the Holliday junction to RuvA and cleaves the junction symmetrically when specific sequences are present at the branch point (16Davies A.A. West S.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 725-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17van Gool A.J. Shah R. Mezard C. West S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1838-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18van Gool A.J. Hajibagheri N.M. Stasiak A. West S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1861-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Zerbib D. Mezard C. George H. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, RuvAB acts as a molecular motor to drive the junction point along the DNA to present RuvC with cleavable sequences at the branch point. In the context of a stalled replication fork which has regressed to form a Holliday junction, RuvABC cleavage of the junction may release a free duplex DNA end. The release of a free duplex end from the stalled fork is thought to be a critical component of replication restart in E. coli. Such DNA ends are known to be processed by the helicase/exonuclease RecBCD followed by RecA-mediated strand exchange with an intact homologous duplex to generate a recombination intermediate, a D-loop (20Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). This D-loop can be bound by PriA to load the replicative apparatus back on to the DNA (21Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, an active replication fork is reestablished. Alternatively, instead of RuvABC creating a free duplex DNA end by cleavage of the regressed fork, the duplex end that spooled out of the regressed fork structure might be acted upon directly by RecBCD (11Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). This would also allow D-loop formation and replication restart. However, RuvABC would still be required in this pathway, because the Holliday junction created by regression of the fork would still need to be resolved. A second pathway for replication restart also exists in E. coli (22McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This alternative restart mechanism is also dependent on PriA. However, it does not require cleavage of the chromosome to release a free DNA end. This pathway uses another branch-specific DNA helicase, RecG, which like RuvAB(C) has the ability to branch migrate Holliday junctions (23Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo function of RecG appears to be to create Holliday junctions rather than simply branch migrate preexisting junctions (22McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Moreover, RecG can actively unwind forked DNA structures to form Holliday junctions in vitro (24McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8235-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the proposal that RecG modulates the structure of stalled forks, possibly by a template switching mechanism, to allow PriA binding and concomitant recruitment of the replicative machinery without the need for potentially dangerous chromosome breakage events and subsequent D-loop formation. The ability of RecG to generate Holliday junctions from forks raises the possibility that RecG creates the Holliday junction substrate for RuvABC-catalyzed replication restart. Indeed, in vitroevidence suggests that stalled replication forks form Holliday junctions by spontaneous branch migration very inefficiently when the parental DNA is negatively supercoiled (26Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2790-2796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and that junction formation in this situation is massively stimulated by RecG (25McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8235-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, there is a high degree of synergism between mutations in recG and any of the ruv genes (27Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This point argues against RecG being the provider of Holliday junction substrates for RuvABC and raises the question of how these substrates are produced. One possibility is that RuvAB(C) itself could unwind stalled forks to generate a Holliday junction. Here we have compared the helicase activity of RuvAB at forks and Holliday junctions in vitro to ascertain whether RuvAB could specifically catalyze fork regression. We found that although RuvAB could unwind fork DNA in the direction necessary for Holliday junction formation, unwinding in the opposing direction was the preferred choice provided the loading of RuvB could freely occur on any of the arms of the fork. Thus, RuvAB is unlikely to act at forks to generate Holliday junctions. This is in marked contrast to RecG, which unwound a fork structure only in the direction necessary for Holliday junction formation. Therefore, RuvAB is likely to act at preexisting Holliday junctions in vivo, which implies that other mechanisms must catalyze regression of damaged forks. Small DNA junctions were constructed using oligonucleotides, one of which in each structure was labeled with [γ32P]ATP at the 5′ end and purified by gel electrophoresis (28Parsons C.A. Kemper B. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9285-9289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of the oligonucleotides are written as follows: (a) 5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACGTTGACCC-3′, (b) 5′-TGGGTCAACGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATGTAATCGTCTATGACGTT-3′, (c) 5′-CAACGTCATAGACGATTACATTGCTAGGACATGCTGTCTAGAGACTATCGA-3′, (d) 5′-ATCGATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGT-3′, (e) 5′-GGACATGCTGTCTAGAGACTATCGA-3′, (f) 5′- TGGGTCAACGTGGGCAAAGATGTCC-3′, (g) 5′-GTCGGATCCTCTAGACAGCTCCATGATCACTGGCACTGGTAGAATTCGGC-3′, (h) 5′-CAACGTCATAGACGATTACATTGCTACATGGAGCTGTCTAGAGGATCCGA-3′, (i) 5′-TGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCAGTGATGGACATCTTTGCCCACGTTGACCC-3′, (j) 5′-TGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCAGTGAT-3′, (k) 5′-TAGCAATGTAATCGTCTATGACGTT-3′, (l) 5′-GTCGGATCCTCTAGACAGCTCCATG TAGCCTGGCACTGGTAGAATTCGGC-3′, (m) 5′-TGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCAG-3′, and (n) 5′-AATGTAATCGTCTATGACGTT-3′.

Labeling of this purified fork was then performed as they were for the small oligonucleotide junctions.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Dissociation of small oligonucleotide junction structures was performed as described previously (31McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with the exception that the buffer system was 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 20 mm potassium acetate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, and 15 mm magnesium acetate. The order of addition of proteins was RuvA and then RuvB. Reactions in which increasing concentrations of RuvAB were titrated against substrate DNA were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before deproteinization. Bandshift assays, in the presence of EDTA, were performed as described previously (31McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The concentration of junction DNA in both dissociation and bandshift assays was 0.2 nm. The dissociation of the fork used in Fig. 7 was performed in 10-μl reactions using the same conditions employed for the small fork structures with the exception that the concentrations of both ATP and magnesium acetate used for RecG were 5 mm, and that of junction DNA was at ∼0.5 nm. Incubation was at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of 2.5 μl of stop solution (31McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and 2.5 μl of loading buffer (30% glycerol v/v and 0.25% bromphenol blue). Samples were electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate EDTA buffer at 12 V cm−1 for 150 min before drying onto filter paper followed by autoradiography and analysis using a PhosphorImager. The helicase activity of RuvAB has never been tested directly on forked DNA structures. Therefore we employed small DNA junctions constructed using synthetic oligonucleotides to determine whether RuvAB can unwind fork DNA in the direction necessary for Holliday junction formation. These junctions were designed so that the branch point was embedded within a region of homology to try and mimic this feature of in vivojunctions. Thus, the branch points were free to spontaneously migrate within this region. A Holliday junction in which the branch point was embedded within a 12-bp1region of homology was unwound by RuvAB to generate two labeled flayed duplex products (Fig. 1 A). Such products indicated that RuvAB can unwind this structure in both possible directions. Hence, the loading of RuvB onto opposing duplex arms can occur in both possible orientations (Fig. 1 B, i and ii). An equivalent fork structure, identical to the Holliday junction but lacking one duplex arm, was also unwound by RuvAB (Fig. 1 A). Three labeled products of unwinding were detected. The major product was a flayed duplex in which both the leading and lagging strands of the fork had been unwound. This direction of unwinding is that which would be necessary for regression of a fork structure to generate a Holliday junction (Fig. 1 B, iii). Thus, RuvAB has the capability to catalyze such a reaction. However, two other products were also observed. A three-strand junction indicated that the leading or the lagging strand could be individually removed by RuvAB. Moreover, a partial duplex product demonstrated that the fork could be unwound in the direction opposite to that required for the generation of a Holliday junction (Fig. 1 B, iv). Thus, although RuvAB may be able to generate a Holliday junction from fork DNA, it is also capable of unwinding a fork in the opposing direction. Moreover, although the 6-bp region of homology within this fork gave the potential for spontaneous migration of the branch point and thus reflected structural features of in vivo forks, this also meant that the fork structure might actually adopt a four-stranded Holliday junction conformation. This would have the effect of reducing the length of the leading and lagging strand arms while increasing the length of the parental duplex arm. The preference of unwinding in the direction necessary for Holliday junction formation might therefore have reflected the preferred loading of a RuvB ring on a longer parental duplex arm (Fig. 1 B, iii) as compared with the leading and lagging strand duplex arms (Fig. 1 B, iv). A closer inspection of the data in Fig. 1 indicates that RuvAB preferentially unwinds the Holliday junction substrate rather than fork DNA (compare the levels of unwinding in lane 4 with lane 10 in Fig. 1 A). To confirm these findings, the rates of RuvAB-catalyzed unwinding of the DNA junctions used in Fig. 1 were measured. The Holliday junction was unwound at an ∼7-fold higher rate than the equivalent fork DNA (Fig. 2). Thus, RuvAB does preferentially unwind this Holliday junction substrate. The RuvA tetramer acts as the recognition factor that governs the loading of the RuvB hexameric rings onto junction DNA (13West S.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed reduced rate of the unwinding of fork DNA by RuvAB may simply be a consequence of reduced binding of RuvA to a fork as compared with a four-stranded junction. This finding was tested by measuring the level of binding of RuvA to the small Holliday junction and fork DNA structures used in Figs. 1 and 2. RuvA bound to Holliday junction DNA to give two retarded protein-DNA complexes in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–8, marked as I and II). These complexes have been attributed to the binding of one and two RuvA tetramers to Holliday junction DNA (32Whitby M.C. Bolt E.L. Chan S.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 878-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RuvA also bound to the fork to give two retarded protein-DNA complexes, although complex I was present in very low amounts (Fig. 3 A, lanes 9–16). These RuvA-fork complexes migrated in the same position as the RuvA-Holliday junction complexes, which suggests that one and two RuvA tetramers were also bound to the fork DNA under these conditions. The affinity of RuvA for each junction was also similar (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, similar relative binding affinities were also obtained in the presence of magnesium (data not shown). These data suggest that preferential unwinding of this Holliday junction DNA by RuvAB is not attributable to reduced binding of the equivalent fork DNA by RuvA. Thus, some feature of RuvB catalysis must be responsible for the observed preferential unwinding of Holliday junction rather than fork DNA in Fig. 2. The homologous fork used in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 does reflect the ability of in vivojunctions to branch migrate spontaneously. However, this meant that the fork might spontaneously adopt a Holliday junction conformation rather than a true fork structure. Furthermore, if a Holliday junction was the preferred conformation, then this would alter the lengths of the duplex arms of the fork. Therefore, it was possible that the parental duplex was 30 bp, whereas the leading and lagging strand duplex arms were 19 bp. This would have a profound effect upon the direction of unwinding of the fork by RuvAB, because if this conformation were preferentially adopted, then binding of RuvB could only occur on the parental duplex arm (33Hiom K. West S.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this situation, unwinding would be forced to occur in the direction necessary for Holliday junction formation (Fig. 1 B, iii). We therefore employed forks that did not contain any homology so that the structure was forced to adopt a fork rather than a Holliday junction conformation. Furthermore, each duplex arm was equivalent in length so that loading of RuvB was not restricted to the parental or daughter duplex arms. RuvAB catalysis at such a structure did produce low levels of unwinding of both the leading and lagging strands (Fig. 4, lanes 1–2 and 3–4, respectively). This finding indicated that unwinding could occur in the direction necessary for Holliday junction formation (Fig. 1 B, iii). However, the majority of products were partial duplexes in which unwinding occurred in the opposite direction. Identical results were also seen with a second junction having a defined fork conformation but constructed using a different set of oligonucleotides (data not shown). Thus, at a defined fork structure the preferred direction of unwinding by RuvAB is opposite to that required for Holliday junction formation. RuvB hexamers must therefore operate predominantly on the leading and lagging strand duplexes of these forks (Fig. 1 B, iv) rather than the parental duplex (Fig. 1 B, iii). Comparison of unwinding of the defined fork structure with unwinding of the equivalent Holliday junction revealed that this fork was unwound at a slightly higher rate than the Holliday junction (Fig. 5 A). However, RuvA bound with significantly higher affinity to the Holliday junction (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the observed levels of unwinding did not correlate with the binding of RuvA to these junctions. These data support the conclusion that some feature of RuvB catalysis is responsible for the observed levels of unwinding of forks and Holliday junctions by RuvAB. Furthermore, the preferential binding of the Holliday junction rather than fork DNA (Fig. 5 B) is in sharp contrast to the approximate equal affinities of RuvA for the fork and Holliday junction structures in Fig. 3. These data suggest that the fork used in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 does adopt a Holliday junction conformation rather than a fork structure. Although the extruded arm of this junction would only be a maximum of 6 bp, such an arm would make several important contacts with the RuvA tetramer (15Hargreaves D. Rice D.W. Sedelnikova S.E. Artymiuk P.J. Lloyd R.G. Rafferty J.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which may explain the equal affinities of RuvA for this fork and the equivalent Holliday junction. Taken together, these data suggest that the efficiency and direction of unwinding fork DNA by RuvAB is governed by the efficiency of one RuvB hexamer bound to the parental duplex DNA arm (Fig. 1 B, iii)versus two RuvB hexamers bound to the daughter duplex arms (Fig. 1 B, iv). The conflicting data with the fork containing a homologous core versus the defined heterologous fork structure might be explained provided a single RuvB ring bound to the parental duplex DNA is less efficient than two opposing RuvB hexamers bound to the daughter duplex arms. Thus, the homologous fork is unwound in the direction necessary for Holliday junction formation since the fork adopts a Holliday junction conformation in which RuvB binding occurs preferentially on the"

Immunolocalization revealed that expression of GPCRs in polarized cells is not uniform, with high levels of GPCR expression at or near the tight junctions. Measurement of phospholipase Cβ activity and receptor-dependent recruitment and trapping of the box domain of RGS4 in GPCRs complexes indicated autonomous functioning of Gq-coupled receptors in acinar cells. These findings explain the generation of receptor-specific Ca2+ waves and why the waves are always initiated at the apical pole. The initiation site of Ca2+ wave at the apical pole and the pattern of wave propagation were independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentration. Furthermore, a second Ca2+ wave with the same initiation site and pattern was launched by inhibition of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps of cells continuously stimulated with sub-maximal agonist concentration. By contrast, rapid sequential application of sub-maximal and maximal agonist concentrations to the same cell triggered Ca2+ waves with different initiation sites. These findings indicate that signaling specificity in pancreatic acinar cells is aided by polarized expression and autonomous functioning of GPCRs and that quantal Ca2+ release is not due to a partial Ca2+ release from a continuous pool, but rather, it is due to an all-or-none Ca2+ release from a compartmentalized Ca2+ pool.

Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that expression of high levels of all IP3 receptor (IP3Rs) isoforms at the apical pole accounts for the initiation of Ca2+ waves at this site (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W.

Furthermore, the apical pole showed higher sensitivity to Ca2+ release by IP3 than other regions of the cell, including the basal pole (3Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 10Ito K. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. J.

However, since the discovery of the polarized Ca2+ waves in exocrine cells, it remained a mystery how IP3 can be generated in the apical pole to initiate the waves. Early functional (12Williams J.A. Groblewski G.E. Ohnishi H. Yule D.I. Digestion. 1997; 58: 42-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and radioligand (13Roettger B.F. Rentsch R.U. Hadac E.M. Hellen E.H. Burghardt T.P. Miller L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) localization of receptors in tissue slices indicated that GPCRs are expressed in the basal membrane. Therefore, it was assumed that during GPCR stimulation IP3 generated in the basal pole diffuses to the apical pole to initiate Ca2+release and waves (14Kasai H. Petersen O.H. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This assumption has several difficulties. For example, at maximal stimulus intensity Ca2+ release starts within few milliseconds of cell stimulation. The diameter of exocrine acinar cells is about 20 μm. This requires exceptionally high rate of diffusion of IP3 in the cytosol of this cells. In pancreatic acini, Ca2+ release events can remain confined to the apical pole (3Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 4Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). This requires continuous traffic of IP3 through the cytosol without causing Ca2+release. Another alternative is generation of IP3 in or close proximity to the apical pole. This requires localization of GPCR at the apical pole. With the development of suitable antibodies for immunolocalization of GPCR and the use of isolated cell clusters that increase the resolution of immunolocalization, it became possible to re-examine GPCR localization in relation to initiation of Ca2+ waves. Another aspect of Ca2+ release in terms of initiation and propagation of Ca2+ waves is the architecture of the Ca2+ pool and the dynamics of Ca2+ release. Propagation of Ca2+ waves requires either sequential Ca2+ release from a compartmentalized pool or release from different sections of a continuous pool along the path of the Ca2+ wave. A unique property of Ca2+ release from internal stores, the quantal feature of Ca2+ release (15Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can reflect the spatial organization of the Ca2+ pool that is needed for propagation of Ca2+ waves.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has quantal properties, that is at submaximal stimulus intensity only part of the Ca2+ pool is released and at increased stimulus an increased fraction of the pool is released. Two main models were proposed to explain quantal release. The first is an all-or-none release of Ca2+ from a compartmentalized pool that has a continuum of sensitivity to IP3 (15Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Totorici G. Zhang B.-X. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol.

The second model proposes phasic Ca2+ release from a homogeneous pool where the phase of release at a given IP3 concentration is determined by gating of IP3Rs activity by Ca2+ content remaining in the stores (21Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Oike M. Casteels R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 98: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The first model fits well with the experimentally observed variable sensitivity of different cellular regions of pancreatic acini to IP3-mediated Ca2+ release (3Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 11Fogarty K.E. Kidd J.F. Tuft D.A. Thorn P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 526: 515-526Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent work (22Callamaras N. Parker I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3608-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in Xenopus oocytes reports that the quantal behavior of Ca2+ release stems from rapid adaptation of the IP3R channels of a continuous Ca2+ pool and claimed to refute the compartmentalization model. The constancy of initiation of Ca2+ waves in the apical pole by all GPCR of pancreatic acini and the variable sensitivity of different cellular regions to IP3-mediated Ca2+release prompted us to determine localization of GPCR in pancreatic acini and to examine their autonomous behavior and what mechanism they use to evoke quantal release. We report that expression of GPCR is highly enriched in the apical pole, at or just underneath the tight junctions. This provides an explanation of how Ca2+ waves are initiated at the apical pole. The initiation site and propagation pattern of Ca2+ waves are receptor-specific in the same cells. This appears to be the result of autonomous coupling of receptors to G proteins and thus operation of GPCR signaling complexes. Finally and most notably, by using agonist concentration jump protocols and inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump of partially stimulated cells, we provide evidence that the quantal properties of Ca2+release are due to an all-or-none Ca2+ release from a compartmentalized Ca2+ pool. Thapsigargin was from Alexis. The anti-muscarinic monoclonal antibody (mAb) M35 was from Argene. The hybridoma cells producing the 5H9 mAb against muscarinic type 3 receptor (M3R) and the specificity of the Abs were described elsewhere (23Nguyen K.H. Brayer J. Cha S. Diggs S. Yasunari U. Hilal G. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two pAbs that recognize different epitopes of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor were prepared using peptide antigens, and their specificity was extensively characterized and verified by blocking with peptides that were used to raise the anti-CCKR antibodies (24Fischer de Toledo C. Roettger B.F. Morys-Wortmann C. Schmidt W.E. Miller L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G488-G497PubMed Google Scholar). A recombinant M2R was a generous gift from Dr. Eliott Ross (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Anti-IP3R2 pAb was a generous gift from Dr. Akihiko Tanimura (University of Hokkaido, Ishikari-Tobetsu, Japan). The box domain of RGS4 (4Box) was prepared as described (25Popov S. K. Yu Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Anti-IP3R3 mAb and anti ZO1 pAbs were purchased from ABR and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Anti-ZO1 mAb was obtained from the Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa. Acini were prepared from the pancreas of 100–150-g rats by limited collagenase digestion as described previously (6Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After isolation, the acini were resuspended in a standard solution A containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 10 glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and kept on ice until use. Doublet or triplet acinar cell clusters were obtained by incubation of a minced pancreas in a 0.025% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution for 5 min at 37 °C. After washing with solution A supplemented with 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor, doublets and triplets were liberated by a 7-min incubation at 37 °C in the same solution that also contained 160 units/ml pure collagenase. The cells were washed with solution A and kept on ice until use. Pancreatic acinar cells were loaded with Fura 2, and [Ca2+]i was imaged as detailed before (6Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fura 2 fluorescence was measured at a single excitation wavelength of 380 nm, by averaging eight consecutive images for each time point. Under these conditions and using a frame size of 256 × 240 pixels, recording was at a resolution of 90 ms/averaged image. During perfusion with the control solution and just before the first stimulation, the image of resting cells was acquired and was taken as the fluorescence signal at time 0 (F0). Pixel values of all subsequent images were divided by this image, and the traces and images are the calculated Ft/F0, where Ft is the fluorescence at time t. To calculate the distance between initiation sites from which Ca2+ waves were triggered by different agonists or sequential application of the same agonist in the same cell, the initiation sites of all waves were marked on the first image, and the image was transferred to Adobe Photoshop. A right triangle was drawn using the ray between the two initiation sites as the hypotenuse. The x and y axes originated from the left and top plane, respectively. The distance between the initiation sites was then calculated by means of the Pythagorean theorem. The distances from multiple experiments were averaged and are given as means ± S.E. Although this procedure allowed quantitative analysis of the distance between initiation sites, such analysis has limitations inherent to the imaging procedure. The most critical limitation is the spatial resolution of cell imaging. The initiation sites and the waves are three-dimensional, whereas imaging at a speed needed to capture Ca2+ waves can be done only in two dimensions. Another limitation of the measurement is the temporal resolution of our recording system. This resulted in initiation sites that occupy 1–2 μm2. Nevertheless, the differences in Ca2+ wave initiation sites and propagation pattern observed when cells were stimulated with two different agonists were sufficiently large to allow quantitative analysis of our measurements. The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used for measurement of Ca2+-activated Cl− current, which correlates with changes in [Ca2+]i near the plasma membrane (26Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed with single acinar cells perfused with solution A. The standard pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 5 ATP, 10 Hepes (pH 7.3 with KOH) with or without 100 nm 4Box, as described in previous studies (27Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.M. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The 4Box was dialyzed against an ATP-free pipette solution and concentrated to about 5 μmwith a centricone system. Seals of 6–10 gigohms were produced on the cell membrane, and the whole cell configuration was obtained by gentle suction or voltage pulses of 0.5 V for 0.3–1 ms. The patch clamp output (Axopatch-1B, Axon Instruments) was filtered at 20 Hz. Recording was performed with patch clamp 6 and a Digi-Data 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). All traces shown were recorded at a holding potential of −40 mV. IP3 levels were measured by a radioligand assay as described elsewhere (28Zhang B.X. Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acini in solution A were stimulated with the indicated combination of agonists for 10 s at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 20 μl of ice-cold 20% perchloric acid to 200 μl of samples, vigorous mixing, and incubation on ice for at least 10 min to allow precipitation of proteins. The supernatants were collected and transferred to clean tubes. Standards of IP3 were prepared in the same manner. The perchloric acid was removed and IP3extracted by the addition of 0.15 ml of Freon and 0.15 ml of tri-n-octylamine. IP3 content in the aqueous phase was measured by displacement of [3H]IP3using microsomes prepared from bovine brain cerebella (28Zhang B.X. Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunostaining procedure was described previously (29Shin D.M. Zhao X.S. Zeng W. Mozhayeva M. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, cells attached to glass coverslips were fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol. After removal of methanol, nonspecific sites were blocked by a 1-h incubation in blocking medium prior to incubation with 50 μl of blocking medium containing control serum (controls) or the following antibodies: 1:500 dilution of the M35 mAb that recognizes all muscarinic receptors; the same mAbs that were reabsorbed with recombinant M2R; 1:250 dilution of the 5H9 mAb recognizing the M3R; 1:200 dilution of pAb specific for the M3R; 1:50 dilution of pAb1 and a 1:100 dilution of pAb2 that recognize the CCK receptor; 1:200 dilution of mAb against IP3R3; 1:100 dilution of pAb against IP3R2; 1:20 dilution of mAb against ZO1; and 1:100 dilution of pAb recognizing ZO1. After incubation with the various primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, the cells were washed three times with the incubation buffer. For the experiment with the 5H9 mAbs in Fig. 4 A, two different protocols were used. The first was a standard protocol using permeabilized cells. Under these conditions, all pools of M3R were detected. Because this antibody recognizes an extracellular epitope of the M3R diagnostic of Sjögren syndrome (23Nguyen K.H. Brayer J. Cha S. Diggs S. Yasunari U. Hilal G. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it was used to label the receptors in the plasma membrane by incubating a 0.5-ml suspension of intact cells with 50 μl of 5H9 mAb for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess antibodies before fixation with 0.5 ml of cold methanol. All steps post-fixation were the same as with permeabilized cells. The primary Abs were detected with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG tagged with fluorescein or rhodamine. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Repetitive stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with the same high concentration of agonist evokes Ca2+ waves with the same initiation site and propagation pattern (6Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The quantal properties of agonist-mediated Ca2+ release (15Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) raised the question of whether partial and maximal discharge of the pool generates the same or different Ca2+ waves. In particular, it was of interest to determine whether the wave initiates from the same site at low and high IP3 concentrations generated by weak and intense agonist stimulation. The properties of Ca2+ waves evoked by repetitive, brief stimulation with increasing concentration of agonist (5, 50, and 500 μm carbachol) are depicted in Fig.1. Similar results were obtained in seven different cell preparations. All experiments were performed with clusters of doublet or triplet cells to ensure polarized expression of signaling protein was maintained. The arrowheads in the first image of each series show that the initiation site is constant and is independent of the IP3 concentration used to initiate the wave. The calculated distance between initiation sites (see “Experimental Procedures”) averaged 0.19 ± 0.05 μm (n = 7). The diameter of an acinar cell was about 20 μm. In addition, the pattern of wave propagation remained constant at all agonist concentrations. Increased stimulation intensity only increased the rate of Ca2+ wave propagation. Constant initiation site and propagation patterns of Ca2+waves were also observed with repetitive stimulation of another GPCR, the CCK receptor (see below). However, in previous work (6Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) we reported that stimulations of multiple GPCRs in the same rat pancreatic acinar cell evoked receptor-specific Ca2+ waves in terms of initiation sites and propagation patterns. Cancela et al.(30Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) used mouse pancreatic acinar cells to suggest that Ca2+ waves are stochastic and are similar for all GPCRs in a given cell. Therefore, we examined Ca2+ waves evoked by carbachol and CCK stimulation in the same cell of small acinar clusters. Fig. 2 shows three examples of five experiments with similar results. The cells were stimulated with submaximal agonist concentrations to increase the temporal resolution of the waves. The white (carbachol) and magenta(CCK) arrowheads in the first image of each experiment show that, without exception, the initiation site of Ca2+ waves was different between the two agonists. The calculated distance between the carbachol and CCK initiation averaged 4.5 ± 1.5 μm (range 1.2–9.1 μm, n = 5). Although the waves initiated by stimulation of the two receptors propagated along the cell periphery, differences in wave patterns were noticeable in most experiments. Close examination of the results in Fig. 5 A of Cancela et al. (30Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) also show that in a single isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cell activation of the muscarinic and CCK receptors resulted in different initiation sites of Ca2+ waves. This is particularly evident when the third image of the acetylcholine series is compared with the second image of the CCK series. The Ca2+ waves evoked by the two GPCRs had different spatial propagation pattern.Figure 5Models of quantal Ca2+release. Model A illustrates quantal Ca2+release by an all-or-none mechanism and model BCa2+ release by IP3Rs adaptation mechanism. The text depicts the predicted outcomes of the agonist concentration jump and SERCA pump inhibition protocols by each model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The constancy of Ca2+ waves evoked by repetitive stimulation of the same GPCR, their independence of stimulus intensity, and the different Ca2+ wave evoked by activation of different GPCRs in the same cell suggest autonomous functioning of GPCRs. We used two experimental protocols to test this prediction. In the first set of experiments we examined IP3 production by maximal agonist concentrations added individually or in combination. Although maximal stimulation of each of the GPCRs can mobilize the entire Ca2+ pool (see below), Fig.3 A shows that all combinations of agonists produced a nearly additive increase in IP3concentration. Hence, each GPCR can activate different pools of cellular PLCβ or distinct portions of a single pool that is in excess to the total number of GPCRs. In the second protocol we used the RGS domain of RGS4 (4Box) to demonstrate autonomous functioning of the GPCRs in the same cell. The 4Box lacks receptor recognition domain and is a poor inhibitor of signaling in resting cells (31Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The 4Box binds to activated α-subunits of G proteins (25Popov S. K. Yu Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) and is nearly as effective as full-length RGS4 in stimulating GTPase activity of Gαq(31Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Consequently, upon cell stimulation the 4Box is recruited to signaling complexes to inhibit their activity and remains trapped in the complexes for as long as the cells are stimulated (see Ref. 27Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.M. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar for further details on the mode of action of the 4Box). We took advantage of the mode of interaction of the 4Box with GPCR signaling complexes to examine whether maximal activation of one GPCR type is sufficient to recruit 4Box to all GPCRs complexes, or stimulation of each GPCR complex is needed to inhibit signaling of the stimulated complex. Fig.3, B and C, shows that stimulation of cells with 1 mm carbachol resulted in complete mobilization of the Ca2+ pool, as evident from the failure of 10 nmCCK8 and 100 nm bombesin (BS) to increase [Ca2+]i in cells continuously stimulated with carbachol. When the cells were infused with 100 nm 4Box, stimulation with 1 mm carbachol resulted in a maximal initial signal that terminated rapidly and returned to base line at continuous stimulation with carbachol, due to receptor-dependent recruitment and trapping of 4Box (27Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.M. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, D and E, shows that at continuous stimulation with carbachol the cells responded with a maximal signal to CCK8 (n = 15) and BS stimulation (n = 4). The response to CCK8 and BS had the same kinetics as that to carbachol, with a rapid onset and inhibition, and it remained inhibited for the duration of cell stimulation. This behavior is best explained if the various receptors are coupled to separate pools of cellular Gαq and PLCβ. Polarized and restricted expression of Ca2+channels and Ca2+ pumps in the luminal pole of epithelial cells appears to be important for initiation and propagation of polarized Ca2+ waves (7Lee M.G.

A direct interaction between MBD2 and MIZF was confirmed by in vitro binding assays and immunoprecipitation experiments.

The subcellular localization of MIZF is distinct from that of MBD2, although both proteins co-localize in some areas of the nuclei; MIZF localizes diffusely in the nucleoplasmic region, whereas MBD2 preferentially localizes in major satellites. A reporter assay demonstrated that MIZF significantly abrogates transcriptional activities. This repression is attenuated by an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, and is completely dependent on the interaction with MBD2. These results suggest that MIZF is abundantly present in cells and functions as a negative regulator of transcription by binding to MBD2 and recruiting HDAC-containing complexes.

This reaction is mediated by DNA methyltransferases (1Bestor T.H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat.

Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). CpG methylation also plays important roles in a wide range of biological steps, including tissue-specific gene expression, X-chromosome inactivation, and genomic imprinting (4Bartolomei M.S. Tilghman S.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 5Ballabio A. Willard H.F. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In addition, abnormalities in CpG methylation have been linked to altered gene expression in certain genetic diseases, tumorigenesis, and senescence; aberrant methylation of a tumor suppressor gene, p16 ink4A, is closely related to tumor growth characteristics (9Issa J.P.

The state of gene methylation is associated with transcriptional repression (12Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and the biological consequence of CpG methylation is mediated by a family of methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MeCPs),1 which contain a common methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) (13Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 14Cross S.H. Meehan R.R. Nan X. Bird A. Nat.

Although the molecular basis for MBD-dependent repression is still unclear, so far five MBD-containing proteins have been reported in mammals: MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4. MeCP2 is the first characterized protein that can bind to methylated CpG pairs (16Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 17Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A.

Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). MBD1 and MBD2 bind specifically to a symmetric methyl-CpG and function as transcriptional repressors (19Ng, H. H., Jeppesen, P., and Bird, A. Mol. Cell Biol., 20, 1394–1406.Google Scholar, 20Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas MBD3 is a subunit of the nucleosome remodeling histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex that includes Mi-2, HDAC1/2, RbAp46/48, and metastasis-associated protein 2 (21Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 22Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MBD4 (also known as MED1) binds preferentially to methyl-CpG·TpG mismatches and removes thymine from a mismatch methyl-CpG site, suggesting that MBD4 may be involved in DNA mismatch repair and the maintenance of genome stability (23Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Much evidence has accumulated to indicate a close association between methylation-dependent repression and histone deacetylation. Among these MBD proteins, MeCP2 functions as a transcriptional repressor in concert with Sin3A, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and HDAC2. MBD2 is also likely to function as a molecular link between methyl-CpG and HDACs, because MBD2 is a component of the MeCP1 HDAC complex that includes RbAp46/48, Sin3A, SAP30, and SAP18 (24Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and MBD2 can also interact with the NuRD complex (20Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To understand the precise mechanisms for the recruitment of the two HDAC complexes by MBD2 and for MBD2-dependent transcriptional repression, further identification and characterization of novel proteins associated with MBD2 is required. In the present study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using mouse MBD2 as bait to search for MBD2-interacting molecules and found a novel zinc finger protein. This MBD2-binding zinc finger (MIZF) protein represses transcription by associating with MBD2 and a histone deacetylase complex. The results suggest that MIZF, in concert with MBD2, recruits HDAC complexes, which in turn results in transcriptional repression. The full-length mouse MBD2b cDNA was subcloned into the pGBT9, a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DBD) vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and transfected into yeast PJ69–4A strain. An expression library consisting of human fetal brain cDNA (CLONTECH) was then introduced into the yeast and screened by growth on plates lacking Ade, His, Leu, and Trp, but containing 2 mm 3-aminotriazole as described (25James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity, and positive clones were analyzed for the insert sequences. To isolate the full-length cDNA, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends combined with nested polymerase chain reaction was performed using a human fetal brain cDNA library (Marathon-Ready cDNA,CLONTECH) as a template. For the expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to MBD2, the MBD2b cDNA was subcloned into the appropriate sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to obtain pGFP-MBD2. Epitope-tagged derivatives of MBD2 and MIZF, containing amino-terminal FLAG and carboxyl-terminal Myc tags, respectively, were generated using a pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For the preparation of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion recombinant proteins, MBD2b and MIZF cDNA were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (GST-MBD2 and GST-MIZF). Deletion derivatives of MBD2b were generated by inserting the cDNA fragments into pGEX-4T-1 using EcoRI and HincII for GST-N1–52, EcoRI and NcoI for GST-N1–154,EcoRI and HindIII for GST-N1–212,HincII and SalI for GST-C53–262, NcoI and SalI for GST-C154–262, and HindIII andSalI for GST-C212–262. To transcribe and translate MBD2 and MIZF in vitro, the MBD2b and MIZF cDNAs were subcloned into the appropriate sites of pGBKT7 (CLONTECH). Deletion constructs of MIZF were generated by inserting the cDNA fragments into pGBKT7 using PstI and XbaI for MIZF-N1–429, EcoRV and BamHI for MIZF-C125–517, and XbaI and BamHI for MIZF-C429–517. For MIZF-N1–201 and MIZF-C201–517, MIZF cDNA was mutagenized by polymerase chain reaction to create a SphI site at codon 201 using the primer 5′-GTGGTAGCATGCCCCACCTGTG. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGBKT7. Plasmids expressing fusion proteins of the GAL4-DBD and MBD2, MIZF, the N-terminal half of MIZF (N1–201), or the C-terminal half of MIZF (C201–517) were constructed using the pM1 expression vector described elsewhere (26Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-G5polβ, was constructed as follows. A 496-base pair fragment of the human DNA polymerase β promoter (−422 to +73) (27Widen S.G. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16992-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified with specific primers 5′-ATCTCTAGAGAAAGTTTTGACAGTGTGACG and 5′-CAAGCTTGAAGGAGGTACCAGGACTTGGAG, digested with XbaI andHindIII, and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGEM-3Z (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGEM-polβ. TheKpnI-NheI fragment containing five GAL4-binding sites excised from pG5luc (Promega) was inserted into theKpnI and XbaI sites of pGEM-polβ, and the insert was excised with SacI and HindIII and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pGL3-enhancer (Promega). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). [35S]Methionine-labeled full-length MIZF, various deletion mutants of MIZF, and MBD2 were synthesized using the indicated pGBKT7 plasmids as templates in a TNT T7 quick coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). The labeled, in vitro-translated proteins were incubated with various GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After washing with the same buffer, the bound proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). COS-7 cells growing on glass coverslips were transfected with pGFP-MBD2 or pMIZF-Myc using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described elsewhere (28Sekimata M. Kabuyama Y. Emori Y. Homma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17757-17762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. For observation of Myc-tagged MIZF, cells were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (9E10) and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (BIOSOURCE, Camalliro, CA). The cell preparation was observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Transfected 293 cells were lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 4 h at 4 °C, and the resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a filter and incubated with either anti-Myc, anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (Sigma), or anti-GFP antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Promega) or anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (Dako, Kyoto, Japan). The positive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA was isolated from several human cell lines by the guanidine isothiocyanate method using Isogen reagent (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Total RNA (20 μg) was resolved in 1% agarose gels and transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and detection were performed using a digoxigenin-labeled MIZF cDNA probe (nucleotides 745–1704) (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan). The tissue expression pattern of MIZF mRNA was also examined with a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). All blots were stripped and reprobed with a cDNA fragment encoding the constitutively expressed human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control. Human 293 cells plated on 24-well plates were transfected with 50 ng of pGL3-G5polβ, 5 ng of pRL-TK (Promega), and the indicated expression plasmids. Total amounts of expression plasmids were normalized by pcDNA3. After incubation for 24 h, transfected cells were split into two dishes and further incubated in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA) (Wako) for 10 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and dual luciferase assays were carried out using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Histone deacetylase activity was measured using mouse core histones radiolabeled with [3H]acetate in vivo as a substrate (29Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (2 μl) of eluates from the immunoprecipitates were incubated with 10 μg of [3H]histones in 100 μl of assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 12 n HCl. The released [3H]acetic acid was extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate and measured by scintillation counting of the solvent layer. When a total of 5 × 106 clones were tested in a yeast two-hybrid screening system with MBD2 cDNA, ∼300 cDNA clones were obtained as first candidates exhibiting His(+) and Ade(+) properties. Most of these were, however, eliminated by a second screening for their ability to activate the β-galactosidase gene. One clone showed strong β-galactosidase activity and was chosen for further analysis. To obtain the full-length sequence of the clone, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends combined with polymerase chain reaction was performed using a human fetal cDNA library. Finally, we obtained a cDNA comprising 2285 base pairs including an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 517 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 59.7 kDa. BLAST search revealed that the cDNA is identical to human cDNA MGC:4317 (accession number BC001945). This cDNA encodes a novel protein with homology to zinc finger proteins. Therefore, we name this protein MIZF (MBD2-interactingzinc finger protein). As shown in Fig.1, the MIZF protein contains seven zinc finger domains similar to the C2H2 zinc finger motif (30Evans R.M. Hollenberg S.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) and a stretch of negatively charged amino acids residues from position 49 to 63. Expression of MIZF was examined by Northern blot analysis with RNA samples from various human tissues and cell lines. The expression level of MIZF was detectable as a predominant single signal in all tissues and cell lines examined (Fig. 2, A andB). The apparent size of the MIZF transcript is ∼2.3 kilobase, consistent with the size of the cDNA clone. Among tissues examined, the highest level of MIZF was detected in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney, with moderate levels of the transcript seen in the colon, thymus, spleen, liver, small intestine, placenta, and lung (Fig. 2 A). The MIZF transcript was detected in all cell lines examined at relatively constant levels (Fig. 2 B). We examined the subcellular localization of MIZF and compared it with that of MBD2. When COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pMIZF-Myc, MIZF localized exclusively to the cell nucleus except the nucleolus (Fig. 2 C, a). The nuclear localization of MIZF proteins was confirmed by difference interference contrast image (Fig. 2 C, b). Consistent with the previous observations on MBD2, GFP-MBD2 displays a diffuse nucleoplasmic staining pattern with prominent nuclear dots that are known to be highly methylated regions of the genome (Fig. 2 C,c and d) (15Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). These results indicate that MIZF is a nuclear protein with subcellular localization distinct from that of MBD2. The association of the MIZF protein with MBD2 was confirmed by in vitro binding assays. The MIZF protein was produced by an in vitro translation system and tested for binding to GST-MBD2, and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 3 A, MIZF bound to GST-MBD2 but not to GST alone. Similarly, the in vitrotranslated MBD2 protein bound to GST-MIZF but not to GST alone (Fig.3 B). This association was further confirmed in 293 cells subjected to cotransfection with pMIZF-Myc and pGFP-MBD2. When GFP-MBD2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, MIZF-Myc (68 kDa) was present in the resultant immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, GFP-MBD2 was detected in immunoprecipitates with anti-Myc antibody. These results demonstrate that MIZF associates specifically with MBD2 in vitro, as well as inside the cell. To determine the region of MIZF responsible for binding to MBD2, several deletion mutants were examined (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig.4 B, C125–517 and C201–517 could bind to MBD2 (lanes 10–15). The removal of an additional 228 amino acids (C429–517) resulted in a complete loss of the binding activity to MBD2 (lanes 16–18), indicating that the N-terminal ∼200 amino acids are dispensable for the interaction with MBD2. In fact, a mutant N1–201 failed to bind to MBD2 (lanes 4–6). Deletion of the C terminus (N1–429) did not affect the binding ability, suggesting that the C-terminal 89 amino acids are also dispensable for the interaction with MBD2 (lanes 7–9). These results indicate that the region comprising amino acids 201–429 of the MIZF protein, containing four zinc finger domains (ZF4–ZF7) (Fig. 1 B), is required for its association with MBD2. A series of MBD2 deletion mutants was also examined to map the region responsible for the interaction with MIZF (Fig.5 A). MIZF could bind to the MBD2 mutant C53–262, which lacks the 52 amino acids at the N terminus (Fig. 5 B, lane 7), but not to mutants N1–52, C154–262, and C212–262, indicating that the N-terminal 52 amino acids are not responsible for the binding to MIZF (lanes 4, 8, and 9). In addition, MIZF could bind to deletion mutants N1–154 and N1–212, indicating that the C-terminal 108 amino acids are dispensable for the interaction with MIZF (lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the region from amino acid 53 to 154 of MBD2 is necessary for the association with MIZF. The effect of MIZF on transcription was examined using a reporter assay with a DNA polymerase β promoter and GAL4-binding sites (Fig.6 A). When the full-length MIZF cDNA fused with GAL4-DBD was transfected into cells, transcription of the reporter gene was significantly inhibited by MIZF in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained using an MIZF mutant, C201–517, which possesses binding activity to MBD2. These results suggest that MIZF functions as a negative regulator for transcription and that MIZF-mediated transcriptional repression is dependent on the binding to MBD2, and, in turn, the association with an HDAC complex. In contrast, another MIZF mutant, N1–201, which does not bind to MBD2, did not repress the transcription (Fig. 6 B). In addition, the results shown in Fig. 6 B demonstrate that transcriptional repression by MIZF can be substantially relieved by TSA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. To examine whether MIZF interacts with endogenous HDAC1, an immunoprecipitation experiment followed by Western blotting analysis was performed on lysates from 293 cells transiently expressing MIZF-Myc. As expected, HDAC1 was detected in the immunoprecipitates containing MIZF. MIZF-Myc was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with HDAC1 by an anti-HDAC1 antibody but not by normal rabbit serum (Fig.6 C). To confirm whether MIZF can modulate MBD2-mediated repression, a luciferase reporter assay was performed in the presence or absence of MIZF. MIZF enhanced the MBD2-mediated repression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7 A). Basal transcription of GAL4-DBD alone was not affected by MIZF. To investigate the involvement of HDAC in this effect of MIZF, cells expressing FLAG-MBD2 and MIZF-Myc were analyzed by an immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 7,B and C, the expression of MIZF produced significant increases in the levels of both the HDAC1 protein and HDAC activity, an effect that was TSA-sensitive. These results suggest that MIZF may enhance MBD2-mediated repression by recruiting HDAC activity to the complex. A close relationship between methylation-dependent repression and histone deacetylation has been demonstrated. The transcriptional effects of CpG methylation are mediated by MBD-containing proteins. Among MBD proteins, MeCP2 is known to bind to methylated CpG pairs and functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting Sin3A and HDACs (16Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 17Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A.

Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). MBD2, another methyl-CpG binding protein, has also been shown to be a component of the MeCP1-HDAC complex that includes RbAp46/48 and Sin3A (24Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, MBD2 interacts with the NuRD complex (21Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that MBD2 is likely to function as a molecular link between methyl-CpG and HDACs. To understand the mechanisms underlying the MBD2-dependent transcriptional repression and recruitment of HDACs, we identify MBD2-interacting molecules using a yeast two-hybrid system. When a human fetal brain cDNA library was screened using mouse MBD2 as bait, a novel zinc finger protein, MIZF, was specifically isolated. This MIZF protein binds to MBD2 and represses the promoter-driven transcription activity. Like the MBD2 protein, the MIZF protein is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cells. These results suggest that MIZF is expressed abundantly in cells and functions as a negative regulator for transcription by binding to MBD2 and to HDAC systems. We demonstrated that the C-terminal region of MIZF (amino acids 201–517) is required for the association with MBD2 (Fig. 4) and for the TSA-sensitive repression (Fig. 6). The N-terminal region of MIZF (amino acids 1–201), which lacks MBD2-binding activity, does not repress transcription (Figs. 4 and 6). These results suggest that MIZF-derived repression is totally dependent on binding to MBD2 and HDACs. Indeed, MIZF was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous HDAC1 (Fig. 6). It has become clear that several transcriptional repressors, such as YY1, Bcl-6, and Rb family proteins, are able to associate directly with HDAC1 or HDAC2 (31Ferreira R. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10493-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 32Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4645-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The minimal structures required for the association with HDAC are thus far identified as the LXCXE-like motif in Rb family proteins, a 30-amino acid glycine-rich region in YY1, and the POZ domain in Bcl-6. However, MIZF does not possess regions homologous to these motifs. In addition, we could not detect the interaction with any known HDACs in a yeast two-hybrid assay when MIZF cDNA was used as bait, 2M. Sekimata and Y. Homma, unpublished data. indicating that MIZF is unable to associate directly with HDACs. It has been reported that MBD2 binds to MBD3, an integral component of the NuRD complex (34Tatematsu K. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and also interacts with a distinct HDAC-containing complex, MeCP1 (24Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is rather possible that MIZF binds to MBD2, which in turn recruits HDACs to the protein complex. A series of associations of these proteins would then result in transcriptional repression. This is supported at least in part by the finding that the coexpression of MIZF and MBD2 significantly enhances HDAC protein recruitment and activity (Fig. 7). MIZF is a unique, C2H2-type zinc finger protein involved in methylation-dependent transcriptional repression. The C2H2 zinc finger structure was initially identified in DNA-binding molecules such as the transcription factors TFIIIA and Krüppel, and at present a number of transcription factors are known to utilize C2H2 zinc fingers as DNA-binding domains (35Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins contain multiple fingers, which are required for the recognition of a specific range of DNA sequences. Concerning an analogy with these proteins, it is possible that MIZF is a DNA-binding protein, and our preliminary results reveal that MIZF binds to some DNA sequences (data not shown). Thus, it is probable that MIZF functions as a repressor, in terms of its suppressive effect on transcription and DNA binding activity. As shown in Fig. 2 C, we demonstrate here that MIZF and MBD2 are expressed quite abundantly and ubiquitously in cells and tissues, suggesting their important functions in cell. Although these two proteins co-localize in some areas in nuclei, their main localizations are quite different; MIZF localizes diffusely in the nucleoplasmic region, whereas MBD2 preferentially localizes in the major satellite, which is known to be a highly methylated region of the genome. Thus, it is possible that MIZF functions as a repressor in the regulation of the transcription of specific genes. Identification of the DNA sequences that interact with MIZF is necessary to understand this issue. It has become clear that zinc fingers are also involved in protein-protein interactions. Homodimerization of the multifinger protein Ikaros is mediated by its two C-terminal fingers (36Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Likewise, metastasis-associated protein 2, a subunit of the NuRD complex, which contains a C4-type zinc finger, also modulates HDAC activity by interacting with MBD3 (20Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). MIZF contains seven zinc fingers (ZF1–ZF7), and four fingers in the C-terminal region are required for the interaction with MBD2. Our preliminary study demonstrates that MIZF also associates with MBD3 in a manner similar to its binding with MBD2 (data not shown). MBD3 is a component of the NuRD complex (34Tatematsu K. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that MIZF recruits the NuRD complex through its interaction with MBD3. The analysis of MIZF-interacting proteins may provide a clue to understanding the mechanism of transcriptional repression induced by MIZF. We are grateful to P. James for providing the yeast strain PJ69-4A. We thank J. Yamaki for technical assistance."

Laminin-5 is markedly down-regulated in breast cancer cells. Little is known about the regulation of laminin gene transcription in normal breast cells, nor about the mechanism underlying the down-regulation seen in cancer. In the present study, we cloned the promoter of the gene for the human laminin α3A chain (LAMA3A) and investigated its regulation in functionally normal MCF10A breast epithelial cells and several breast cancer cell lines. Using site-directed mutagenesis of promoter-reporter constructs in transient transfection assays in MCF10A cells, we find that two binding sites for Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4/GKLF/EZF) are required for expression driven by the LAMA3A promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal absence of KLF4 binding activity in extracts from T47D, MDA-MB 231, ZR75-1, MDA-MB 436, and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Transient transfection of a plasmid expressing KLF4 activates transcription from the LAMA3A promoter in breast cancer cells. A reporter vector containing duplicate KLF4-binding sites in its promoter is expressed at high levels in MCF10A cells but at negligible levels in breast cancer cells.

Kruppel-like factor 4 gut-enriched Kruppel-like factor epithelial zinc finger electrophoretic mobility shift assay The laminin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins is heterotrimeric proteins consisting of three distinct subunits, designated α, β, and γ that are encoded by the LAMA,LAMB, and LAMC genes, respectively. To date there are five α chains, three β chains, and two γ chains that assemble into 12 laminins. Laminin-5 (α3A, β3, and γ2) is the major extracellular matrix protein produced in mammary epithelial cells. In these cells laminin-5 functions as a ligand for the α3β1 and α6β4integrins to regulate adhesion, migration, and morphogenesis (1Stahl S. Weitzman S. Jones J.C. J.

Mutation of this single key AP-1 site reduced promoter activity by ∼90% while mutation of the other two sites had much less effect (4Virolle T. Monthouel M.N. Djabari Z. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G.

Members of the Kruppel-type family are highly conserved in the carboxyl-terminal region that contains three zinc fingers and they bind similar GC-rich recognition sequences.

This report describes the novel role of this factor in the regulation of the LAMA3A promoter. Through transient transfections and EMSA we show that KLF4 activates expression of the LAMA3Agene in MCF10A cells and that loss of KLF4 activity is in part responsible for the loss of LAMA3A expression in breast cells. MCF10A (a nontransformed, spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cell line) and M-H cells (a hygromycin resistant subclone of MCF10A cells) were maintained as previously described (16Miller K.A.

Transfections were normalized for efficiency by normalizing relative light units from the β-galactosidase assay to the luciferase light units for each individual sample. The sequence for the intron betweenLAMA3B exon 1 and LAMA3A exon 1 which has been shown to constitute the LAMA3A promoter in mouse was kindly provided by Dr. Angela Christiano (Columbia University, New York). Based on this sequence, primers were designed to amplify 1410 base pairs of this intronal promoter. The 5′ primer 5′-CAGGTACCAAGTTTTCCCATCCGCAACATTTCC-3′ that has a KpnI site engineered into the 5′ end and the 3′ primer 5′-CAGCTAGCAGGCTGACCGCCTCACTGCTGGAGG-3′ that has an NheI site engineered were used in polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA from MCF10A cells. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was TA cloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega), then excised by KpnI andNheI, and cloned into the pGL2 basic vector (Promega) that was digested with KpnI and NheI. The resulting vector was transformed into XL1 Gold Supercompetent cells (Stratagene), named pL3A and contains the human LAMA3A promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Three separate colonies were sequenced and the consensus sequence was submitted to GenBankTM(accession number AF279435). Restriction sites were identified using MAP functions of GCG software. The adenine of the initiator ATG codon was designated base +1. Dr. Mu-En Lee kindly provided the pcDNA3-hEZF vector containing the full-length cDNA for human KLF4 in the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (8Yet S.F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.W.

The TDA(WT)x2-pGL2-TATA-Luc and TDA(M6-Mut)x2-pGL2-TATA-Luc vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Vincent Yang (The Johns Hopkins University) (17Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vector was used as an internal control in transfections. The Quik-Change Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was used to create site-directed mutants of the full-length pL3A vector. An oligonucleotide that changes overlapping KLF4-binding sites starting at base pair −412 from 5′-CTTCCCCTTCCTCCAT-3′ to 5′-CTTCCTTTTCAGCCTCCAT-3′ created mutation pL3A-KLF4mut1. pL3A-KLFmut2 changes the KLF4 site at −367 from 5′-GAGGGAAAGAGAGGGACT-3′ to 5′-GAGGGAAAGAGATTGACT-3′. The pL3A-AP-1mut3 changes the AP-1 site at base pair −185 from 5′-GCTGACTCATG-3′ to 5′-GCTGCCTTATG-3′. This corresponds to the AP-1B site described in the mouse promoter by Virolle et al. (4Virolle T. Monthouel M.N. Djabari Z. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17318-17325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The overlapping USF site found near the AP-1 site starting at base pair −179 was mutated from 5′-TCATGTGTGAAGTT-3′ to 5′-TCATGCATGAAGTTT-3′ to create pL3A-USFmut4. The KLF4 site at base pair −168 5′-GTTTAAAGGTGGGG-3′ was changed to 5′-GTTTAAAGGTGGTT-3′ to create pL3A-KLF4mut5. Two overlapping KLF4-binding sites were mutated in pL3A-KLF4mut6 changing 5′-ATAAGAGGAAGAGG-3′ to 5′-ATAAGATTAAGATT-3′ starting at position −87. All vectors were sequenced by the Northwestern Biotechnology Facility to verify the correct mutations were created. Nuclear extracts were prepared by collecting cells in cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were then frozen and thawed once and vortexed for 10 s. Nuclei were pelleted by brief centrifugation and resuspended in cold Buffer C (20 mmHEPES pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated for 30 min, briefly centrifuged to remove debris, and the nuclear extract supernatant was collected and stored at −70 °C. Primers to the pL3A vector were used to amplify probe A, the 103-base pair fragment spanning bases −199 to −97, for gel shift analysis, 5′-CGCTCTGGCACAGG-3′ 5′-TTCCTGCTCAGTGCC-3′. Probe A was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Probe B (−84 to −62) was created by annealing two oligonucleotides, 5′-AGAGGAAGAGGCAGAGGTTC-3′ and 5′-CAGGAACCTCTGCCTCTTCCT-3′, that contain base pair overhangs that were radiolabeled using DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The oligonucleotide containing the KLF4 consensus sequence designated TDA by Shields and Yang (15Zhang W. Shields J.M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17917-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and an oligonucleotide based on the TDA with 2 base pairs mutated that does not bind KLF4 designated TDAmut were created as described by Shields and Yang (17Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and end labeled as Probe A. Labeled probes were then separated from free [α-32P]dCTP using Sephadex ProbeQuant G-50 micro columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions included: α-32P-labeled DNA probes (1–5 ng, 100,000 cpm); 4 μg of poly(dI-dC); 10 μg of nuclear extract; 5 μg of bovine serum albumin; 6 μl of 5 × binding buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 2.5% glycerol); and the appropriate volume of H2O to a final volume of 30 μl. Binding reaction mixtures were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Bound products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 7 or 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 1 × running buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.38 m glycine, 2.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). Gels were dried with a Bio-Rad Gel Dryer for 45 min at 85 °C, followed by exposure to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C. Film was then developed using an x-ray film processor (Fuji). To deplete extracts of KLF4, 50 μl of nuclear extracts from an MCF10A subclone were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with either 20 μl of rabbit preimmune serum or 10 μl each of KLF4 antibodies from Dr. Yang (6Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and Dr. Tseng (18Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 40 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies). Samples were briefly centrifuged, and supernatants were used in gel shifts as described above. Competition experiments consisted of 150 × molar excess for the TDA, AP-1, and AP2 oligonucleotides that were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature before proceeding to the binding reactions with the 103-base pair DNA fragment. AP-1 and AP2 duplex oligonucleotides were obtained from Stratagene, the AP2 oligonucleotide serving as a nonspecific control. Competition of the labeled TDA probe consisted of 125 × molar excess of TDA(WT) and TDA(M6-mut) oligonucleotides in Fig. 6 A and 250 × molar excess in Fig. 6 B. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, .1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein reagent assay, 40 μg of protein were electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted using the rabbit polyclonal anti-KLF4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used as a secondary antibody and detected using ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). There is previous evidence that laminin-5 is down-regulated in breast cancer cell lines. Examination of mRNA in breast tumor cells showed that laminin α3 was greatly reduced or not present at all in breast tumor tissue and 15 breast cancer cell lines including T47D, MCF7, ZR75-1, MDA-MB 436, BT474, MDA-MB 361, and MDA-MB 231 (3Martin K.J. Kwan C.P. Nagasaki K. Zhang X. O'Hare M.J. Kaelin C.M. Burgeson R.E. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 602-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Long exposure of Northern blots revealed very low level expression in breast cancer cell lines, ruling out systematic deletion of this gene in breast cancer (3Martin K.J. Kwan C.P. Nagasaki K. Zhang X. O'Hare M.J. Kaelin C.M. Burgeson R.E. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 602-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The main transcript of the laminin-5 α3 subunit in mammary epithelia is the LAMA3A isoform (19Ferrigno O. Virolle T. Galliano M.F. Chauvin N. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20502-20507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the mouse the genetic structure of the mLAMA3 gene consists of the mLAMA3A and mLAMA3B isoforms that each contain a unique exon 1 that is expressed using alternative promoters. Exon 1 of mLAMA3B is upstream of themLAMA3A exon and the intron region between these exons contains the promoter for the mLAMA3A isoform. The genetic structure for the human LAMA3 was previously described by Pulkinnen et al. (20Pulkkinen L. Cserhalmi-Friedman P.B. Tang M. Ryan M.C. Uitto J. Christiano A.M. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1067-1076PubMed Google Scholar) and is very similar to the mouse organization. We cloned the human intron region between theLAMA3B and LAMA3A exons into the pGL2 reporter vector and tested the transcriptional activity in MCF10A cells and T47D cells. We found that the resulting vector, pL3A, contained potent transcriptional activity when transfected into MCF10A cells but had no activity in T47D cells when compared with the activity of empty vector (Fig. 1 A). The murineLAMA3A promoter contains three AP-1 sites (AP-1A, AP-1B, and AP-1C) that are involved in the up-regulation of this gene by transforming growth factor-β in keratinocytes (4Virolle T. Monthouel M.N. Djabari Z. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17318-17325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One of these sites, designated AP-1-B is critical for basal expression as well (4Virolle T. Monthouel M.N. Djabari Z. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17318-17325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the human LAMA3A promoter sequence using the Matinspector software (21Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) revealed several putative transcription factor-binding sites. As in the mouse promoter, there are three AP-1 sites identified in the human promoter at −387, −185, and −127. Ten putative KLF4-binding sites were noted throughout the 1410-base pair promoter and are located at positions −1327, −921, −892, −572, −412, −407, −367, −167, −87, and −81. KLF4 sites at −412 and −407 overlap as do the sites at −87 and −81. Bases upstream of position −589 lacked promoter activity (data not shown) and we further examined transcription factor-binding sites between bases −589 and −6. To analyze which specific transcription factors may be involved in the regulation of this promoter, site-directed mutations were created in the full-length pL3A vector. We found that mutation of the AP-1 site homologous to the key mouse AP-1B site (4Virolle T. Monthouel M.N. Djabari Z. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17318-17325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) at position −185 in vector pL3A-AP-1mut3, nearly abolished transcription in MCF10A cells, while a mutation targeting a nearby putative USF1 site in vector pL3A-USFmut4 at position −180 had no effect (Fig.1 B). We were interested in the KLF4-binding sites and found that mutations in the KLF4-binding sites closest to the translational start site most dramatically decreased transcriptional activity in MCF10A cells (Fig. 1 B). Mutation of the single KLF4 site at −167 in vector pL3A-KLF4mut5 abolished 63% of transcriptional activity while vector pL3A-KLF4 mut6 with mutations in the two overlapping KLF4 sites at −87 and −81 abolished 79% of activity. Mutating the overlapping sites at −412 and −407, vector pL3A-KLF4mut1, as well as mutating the site at −367 in vector pL3A-KLF4mut2 had no significant effect on transcription (Fig.1 B). None of the site-directed mutations had any effect on the lack of transcription in T47D cells (data not shown). The transfection results suggest that both AP-1 and KLF4 are important in the regulation of LAMA3A. A 103-base pair DNA fragment, Probe A, containing the key AP-1 site and the −167 KLF4 site was used for gel shift analysis. Extracts from MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, MDA-MB 231, and MDA-MB 436 cells all show AP-1 binding that is competed with an AP-1-specific oligonucleotide (Fig.2 A, lanes 3,7, 11, 15, and 19) but not a nonspecific competitor (Fig. 2A, lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, and20). This results confirms a previous report that AP-1 binds the human LAMA3A promoter (22Virolle T. Djabari Z. Ortonne J. Aberdam D. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A complex near the free probe was noticed only in the MCF10A cell samples that was competed with a KLF4 consensus binding oligonucleotide (lane 5) designated TDA by Shields and Yang (15Zhang W. Shields J.M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17917-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To further prove that this shift was in fact KLF4, we show that depleting the nuclear extracts of KLF4 with anti-KLF4 antibody resulted in loss of the complex that was competed by the KLF4 consensus binding oligonucleotide (Fig.2 B). By transfection the KLF4 site at −81 was also important in LAMA3A transcription. Gel shift with Probe B, an oligonucleotide that spans bases −84 to −62, containing the −81 KL4-binding site showed a shift in MCF10A cells that was identical to a shift in a sample containing purified KLF4 (Fig. 2 C). A band shift with Probe B was absent in breast cancer cells. To further prove that the shift seen with Probe B in MCF10A cells was in fact KLF4, a supershift experiment was performed with either preimmune serum or an anti-KLF4 antibody. The band shift of Probe B with MCF10A cell extract was specifically supershifted with the KLF4 antibody (Fig.2 D). One of the reasons that a band shift was not seen in the breast cancer cells with LAMA3A promoter sequence probes is that these cells do not express KLF4. In fact we found that to be the case by Western analysis. MCF10A cells clearly express KLF4 while no detectable KLF4 was found in whole cell extracts of MCF7, T47D, or MDA-MB 231 cells (Fig. 3).Figure 3KLF4 is expressed in MCF10A but not MCF7, T47D, or MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. Forty micrograms of whole cell extract from MCF-7 (lane 1), MCF10A (lane 2), T47D (lane 3), and MDA-MB 231 (lane 4) cells were electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with KLF4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:1000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further confirm the lack of KLF4 protein in the breast cancer cells, we compared general KLF4 activity of MCF10A to the activity of T47D cells. Shields and Yang (17Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have published a consensus binding sequence for KLF4. The vector TDA(WT)x2-pGL2-TATA-Luc basic contains two tandem copies of this consensus sequence upstream of a TATA element in the pGL2 basic vector. This vector has been shown to be activated by KLF4 (17Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The TDA(M6-Mut)x2-pGL2-TATA-Luc vector has mutations in the KLF4 consensus and is not KLF4 responsive. We tested activity of the TDA(WT) vector compared with the TDA(M6-Mut) vector to analyze the overall KLF4 transcriptional activity in MCF10A and T47D cells. When the TDA vector was transfected in MCF10A cells, there was a 6-fold increase in transcriptional activity compared with the mutant vector that does not bind KLF4 (Fig. 4). Activation in the T47D cells, on the other hand was negligible (Fig. 4). We next analyzed KLF4 DNA binding activity by EMSA analysis in MCF10A and five different breast cancer cell lines. An oligonucleotide for EMSA analysis was created that contained the TDA consensus sequence as previously described (17Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We found specific binding to the TDA-labeled oligonucleotide that was competed with cold TDA oligonucleotide but not the TDA mutant oligonucleotide in MCF10A cells (Fig.5 A). Specific binding was lacking in the five breast cancer cell lines tested (Fig.5 A). The competition in Fig. 5 A was at 125 × molar excess that did not completely compete the TDA oligonucleotide. In Fig. 5 B the competition was performed at 250 × molar excess that demonstrated complete complex inhibition with TDA(WT) but not TDA(Mut) oligonucleotides in MCF10A cells. The high level of competitor required for competition of binding to the labeled TDA oligonucleotide suggested a high level of KLF4 DNA binding activity in MCF10A cells. These data demonstrated that the KLF4 transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity was greater in the MCF10A cells than the breast cancer cells.Figure 5Tumor cell lines lack KLF4 DNA binding activity. A, EMSA analysis of KLF4 DNA binding activity in MCF10A (lanes 2–4), T47D (lanes 5–7), MDA-MB 231 (lanes 8–10), MCF7 (lanes 11–13), MDA-MB 436 (lanes 14–16), and ZR75–1 (lanes 17–19) cells. An oligonucleotide containing the KLF4 consensus binding sequence was end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and binding reactions were electrophoresed in an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. The KLF4 specific complex was seen only in MCF10A cells (lane 2). The KLF4 binding complex was partially competed with 125 × cold specific (S) oligonucleotide (lane 3) but not a 125 × excess of mutated (NS) oligonucleotide that does not bind KLF4 (lane 4). None of the breast cancer cell lines tested had any KLF4 binding activity. Lane 1shows free probe (FP). Arrow points to the KLF4 specific complex. B, to better demonstrate the specific competition of the TDA oligonucleotide in MCF10A cells, competition with 250X molar excess of cold specific (S) and cold nonspecific (NS) oligonucleotide as in part A were used. Binding reactions were electrophoresed in a 7% native polyacrylamide gel.Arrow points to the KLF4 specific complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Lack of KLF4 protein expression and activity in breast cancer cells lead us to hypothesize that expressing KLF4 in the breast cancer cells would have a positive effect on pL3A activity in these cells. Expression of the pL3A vector was increased 15-fold in T47D cells when co-transfected with 10 ng of the pcDNA3-hEZF vector obtained from Dr. Mu-En Lee (8Yet S.F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M. Layne M.D. Chin M.T. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Jain M.K. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Fig.6 B). In MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.6 C) the fold induction with 10 ng of pcDNA3-hEZF was 39-fold the basal expression of pL3A in these cells and in MCF7 cells (Fig. 6 D) the induction was 20-fold. Thus, expression of KLF4 alone was sufficient to see promoter activity in LAMA3Anonexpressing cells. Transfection of the plasmids with mutated KLF4-binding sites into MCF7 cells (pL3A-Mut5 and pL3A-Mut6) showed no activation in the presence of co-transfected KLF4 (data not shown). We were unsure what the results would be of overexpressing KLF4 in the MCF10A cells that already express KLF4 protein. Co-transfection of pL3A with low doses of the pcDNA3-hEZF vector in MCF10A cells resulted in an increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 6 A). On the other hand, a higher dose of KLF4 in MCF10A cells resulted in repression of the promoter by about 5-fold, suggesting that optimal levels of KLF4 are necessary for LAMA3A expression. Laminin-5 is a highly tissue-specific gene with expression found only in epithelial cell populations. A recent study shows that the human LAMA3A promoter is also driven by AP-1 (22Virolle T. Djabari Z. Ortonne J. Aberdam D. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Virolleet al. (22Virolle T. Djabari Z. Ortonne J. Aberdam D. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) suggest that the conformation of the AP-1 sites is critical in determining whether LAMA3A expression occurs or not. They suggest that under normal circumstances, a repressor binds AP-1 in the fibroblasts but this repressor is absent in keratinocytes which allows expression of LAMA3A. Our results confirm a role of AP-1 in the regulation of the human LAMA3A promoter. Mutation of the AP-1 site decreases transcriptional activity of pL3A in MCF10A cells. Unlike the previous report, our gel shift analysis does not suggest the presence of a repressor complex that is unique to the breast cancer cells. Instead we find that the presence of KLF4 is involved. In MCF10A cells that contain KLF4, mutation of KLF4-binding sites also results in decreased transcription of pL3A. We show that breast cancer cells lack KLF4 expression and activity which likely results in the lack of LAMA3A expression in these cells. Expression of the LAMA3A promoter in the breast cancer cells by expression of KLF4 further supports this claim. This is not the first time that KLF4 has been shown to be involved in tissue specific expression. Presence of KLF4 has been shown to confer tissue specific expression of keratin 19 in pancreatic ductal cells (23Brembeck F.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28230-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Acinar cells that do not express keratin 19 lack KLF4. We suggest that like keratin 19, LAMA3A expression relies on the presence of KLF4; cells that express KLF4 will express LAMA3A and those that do not express KLF4 will not express LAMA3A. These studies do not address the mechanism of loss of KLF4 in the breast cancer cells. Further analysis is necessary to determine whether lack of KLF4 is due to gene loss, transcriptional repression, or protein instability. Studies in colon cells suggest that transcription of KLF4 is reduced in cancer cells. It has been shown that KLF4 mRNA is decreased in colon cancer cells and has an effect on the proliferation and differentiation of these cells (24Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) find that expression of KLF4 is decreased in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. The actual regulation of KLF4 is not very well understood at this time. Several factors including Cdx2, Sp1, Sp3, and KLF4 itself may be involved in its regulation (27Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4562-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Higher doses of KLF4 results in declining LAMA3A promoter activation in both MCF10A and cancer cells. The mechanism for this is unknown. KLF4 has been shown to have both activation and repression domains (8Yet S.F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M. Layne M.D. Chin M.T. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Jain M.K. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Also, the Cyclin D1 promoter has been shown to be repressed by KLF4 by competing away the positive acting transcription factor SP1 (18Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be necessary to determine the mechanism by which large amounts of KLF4 can result in inhibition ofLAMA3A transcription. It is unclear whether AP-1 and KLF4 form a complex in MCF10A cells. In the gel shift of Probe A that contains both AP-1- and KLF4-binding sites, we see that an AP-1 competitor competes only the AP-1 band while a KLF4 competitor competes both the AP-1 and KLF4 bands. However, there is no effect on AP-1 binding with the KLF4 oligo in the breast cancer cells. It is possible that the competition of AP-1 in the MCF10A cells with KLF4 is due to an interaction of the two transcription factors. Further studies would be necessary to confirm this finding. In summary, this study clearly demonstrates a relationship betweenLAMA3A expression and KLF4. The MCF10A cells which expressLAMA3A express KLF4 and have high levels of KLF4 binding activity while all the breast cancer cell lines tested lacked KLF4 expression and activity. Laminin-5 in conjunction with many other pathways mediates the differentiation of mammary epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2094328288,"Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) and carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) catalyze the conversion of long- and medium-chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitines in the presence of carnitine. We propose a common three-dimensional structural model for the catalytic domain of both, based on fold identification for 200 amino acids surrounding the active site through a threading approach. The model is based on the three-dimensional structure of the rat enoyl-CoA hydratase, established by x-ray diffraction analysis. The study shows that the structural model of 200 amino acids of the catalytic site is practically identical in CPT I and COT with identical distribution of 4 β-sheets and 6 α-helices. Functional analysis of the model was done by site-directed mutagenesis. When the critical histidine residue 473 in CPT I (327 in COT), localized in the acyl-CoA pocket in the model, was mutated to alanine, the catalytic activity was abolished. Mutation of the conserved alanine residue to aspartic acid, A381D (in CPT I) and A238D (in COT), which are 92/89 amino acids far from the catalytic histidine, respectively (but very close to the acyl-CoA pocket in the structural model), decreased the activity by 86 and 80%, respectively. The Km for acyl-CoA increased 6–8-fold, whereas the Km for carnitine hardly changed. The inhibition of the mutant CPT I by malonyl-CoA was not altered. The structural model explains the loss of activity reported for the CPT I mutations R451A, W452A, D454G, W391A, del R395, P479L, and L484P, all of which occur in or near the modeled catalytic domain.

Both carnitine acyltransferases facilitate the generation of energy by β-oxidation of fatty acids in the organella in which they are present. Mammalian tissues express two different isoforms of CPT I, a liver isoform (L-CPT I) (1Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. Mc Garry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Britton C.H. Schultz R.A. Zhang B. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1984-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and a heart/skeletal muscle isoform (M-CPT I) (3Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Yamanaka Y. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in β-oxidation, CPT I is tightly regulated by its physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA. In regulating CPT I, malonyl-CoA confers the ability to signal to the cell the availability of lipid and carbohydrate fuels (5McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). CPT I has a critical metabolic role in general metabolism in heart, liver, and β-cells of the pancreas and is a potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders involving diabetes and coronary heart disease. Peroxisomal COT is also inhibited in physiological conditions by malonyl-CoA (6A'Bhaird N.N. Ramsay R.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but to a lesser extent than CPT I. Other enzymes of the family, which are not regulated by malonyl-CoA, are CPT II, which catalyzes long-chain acyl-CoA in the mitochondria, and carnitine acetyltransferase, which has acetyl-CoA as substrate.These enzymes have recently generated much interest, especially the spatial organization of CPT I in the mitochondrial outer membrane. CPT I is an integral membrane protein, and both the N and C termini project to the cytosol, since it has two trans-membrane segments within the first 130 N-terminal residues of its primary sequence (7Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interaction between amino acids from the N and C termini may determine the kinetic characteristics of the enzyme, not only in the inhibitory effect of malonyl-CoA but also in the catalytic activity (8Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). COT appears not to be an integral protein of peroxisomes. Sequence alignment between CPT I and COT shows that COT lacks the first 152 amino acid residues, which indicates that it has no transmembrane regions. However, the two show high sequence identity, which suggests a common genetic origin (9van der Leij F.R. Huijkman N.C. Boomsma C. Kuipers J.R. Bartelds B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Although several attempts have been made to identify the malonyl-CoA site, few data are available on the structure of the catalytic site of carnitine acyltransferases. It has been proposed that a histidine residue is critical in catalysis (10Schmalix W. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27428-27439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated an essential catalytic role for histidine 372 in CPT II (11Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the homologous histidine 327 in COT (12Morillas M. Clotet J. Rubı́ B. Serra D. Asins G. Ariño J. Hegardt F.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However the role of a histidine in catalysis has been questioned for both CPT I and COT (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Nic a'Bhaird N. Yankovskaya V. Ramsay R.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Dai et al. observed that overexpressed CPT I in yeast treated with diethylpyrocarbonate did not decrease the enzyme activity at variance with wild type rat mitochondria, although differences in the folding of CPT I in yeast and in rat liver could lead to an alternative interpretation.Other amino acids residues have been also implicated in catalysis. Mutation of several conserved arginines (Arg388, Arg451) and tryptophans (Trp391, Trp452) comprised between amino acids 381 and 481 of CPT I decreased enzyme activity (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that this segment could be the putative palmitoyl-CoA binding site of CPT I. In this fragment, mutants D376A and D464A in rat CPT II were completely inactive (11Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As to the carnitine binding site, arginine 505 in beef COT, which lies outside the proposed palmitoyl-CoA binding site, has been implicated (15Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In this study, we propose three-dimensional models of the catalytic site comprising amino acids 368–568 in CPT I and 226–417 in COT. These models were made using an integrative approach of several threading procedures taking into account different parameters such as solvatation potentials, contacts, environment-specific substitution tables, and structure-dependent gap penalties. The fold recognition analysis using these procedures showed a common template for the catalytic site of the carnitine/choline acyltransferase family of proteins, corresponding to the structure of the enoyl-CoA hydratase enzyme (Protein Data Bank entry 2dub; Ref. 16Engel C.K. Kiema T.R. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); this motif was also found in CPT I and COT. The three-dimensional models for CPT I and COT are practically identical and show a common architecture for the catalytic site. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that CPT I His473 and COT His327 are the catalytic residues. These histidines are located near the thioester bond in the acyl-CoA, which is broken in catalysis. Mutation of CPT I A381 and COT A238, located close to the catalytic histidine decreased the enzyme activity by 80–86% without modifying the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA.DISCUSSIONDespite efforts in biochemical characterization of carnitine palmitoyltransferases and their related enzymes, their mode of action is not completely understood, probably due to the lack of any structural characterization of the catalytic site. In the absence of an appropriate crystallized reference, some bioinformatics tools can be applied to obtain a structural model able to approximately address some important questions related to these proteins' activity.The threading or “remote homology design” is a three-dimensional structure prediction technique useful when there is not enough sequence similarity of the input sequence and a known three-dimensional structure and, therefore, the “homology modeling” is not applicable. The process adapts the sequence to different known foldings and evaluates the fitting. The meaning of “fitting” varies from one threading program to others: secondary structure coincidence, similar accessibility, or solvatation energy, etc. Methods of protein fold recognition attempt to detect similarities between protein three-dimensional structure that are not accompanied by any significant sequence similarity. There are many approaches, but the unifying theme is to try and find folds that are comparable with a particular sequence. Unlike sequence-only comparison, these methods take advantage of the extra information made available by three-dimensional structural data.To detect structural homologies between CPT I and COT and any other three-dimensional representation, we used an integrative approach of two programs, THREADER2 (22Jones D.T. Miller R.T. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and FUGUE threading server (23Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Whereas the first one uses solvatation potentials and predicted contacts, the latter performs a fold recognition analysis using structural environment-specific substitution tables and structure-dependent gap penalties. The integration of both methodologies revealed that the three-dimensional fold of the central site of all acyl-CoA transferases can be structured in the same way as the enoyl-CoA hydratase monomer (Protein Data Bank entry 2dub, chain E). What was more important was to observe that CPT I and COT had nearly identical structural models for the central region, which putatively contains the catalytic site (amino acids 368–567 of CPT I and amino acids 226–417 of COT). The predicted secondary structure for the 200 amino acids that putatively contains the palmitoyl-CoA or decanoyl-CoA binding region consists of 6 α-helices and 4 β-sheets.Additional support of this fold as template is based on the fact that these proteins bind very similar ligands, all of them acyl-CoA derivatives; the crystal structure of the enoyl-CoA hydratase monomer includes precisely a molecule of octanoyl-CoA, used as inhibitor in this case, the natural substrate of COT. Enoyl-CoA hydratase (Protein Data Bank code 2dub), also known as crotonase, belongs to the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase family. It is a homohexameric enzyme, located at the mitochondrial matrix. It catalyzes the second step in the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, transforming the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA into trans-2(or 3)-enoyl-CoA plus H2O.The model predicts that although CPT I Ala381(Ala238 in COT) is 92 amino acids away from the CPT I His473 (His327 in COT) it is very close to the catalytic histidines. The important decrease in activity (14–20% of residual activity with respect to the wild type) after mutation CPT I A381D or COT A238D confirms the function of these alanines and supports the three-dimensional model. The marked modification ofKm for acyl-CoA of the mutants supports the role of these alanines in locating the substrates to the catalytic site.In addition, these alanine residues had been implicated in CPT and COT activity by a tree determinant study of the complete alignment of the carnitine-choline acyltransferase family of proteins. In a protein family alignment, the positions considered as tree determinants, or subfamily conserved residues, are usually accepted to be implicated in key catalytic activities, being responsible for the different substrate specificities or enzymatic activities of the different subfamilies of the alignment (37Casari G. Sander C. Valencia A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 38Pazos F. Sanchez-Pulido L. Garcı́a-Ranea J.A. Andrade M.A. Atrian S. Valencia A. Lundh D. Olsson B. Narayanan A. Biocomputing and Emergent Computation. World Scientific, Singapore1997: 132-145Google Scholar). A clear example of this type of analysis was made previously in this same family of proteins related to the carnitine versus choline affinity (44Cronin C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24465-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structure-based alignment of the template sequence with all the other transferases sequences used in the extensive threading procedure can also be used to build three-dimensional models of all the other members of the family in the future.The group of Woldegiorgis (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggested that the region comprised between 381–481 could be the putative palmitoyl-CoA binding site. Moreover, the abolition of activity after mutation of H473A strongly suggests that this His473 is the catalytic site. McGarry and co-workers (11Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after mutagenesis of homologous histidine in CPT II, proposed that this was the catalytic site. This was confirmed in a previous study in COT, in which mutant H327A abolished the catalytic activity (45Morillas M. Clotet J. Rubı́ B. Serra D. Ariño J. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 495-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dai et al. (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) questioned whether these histidines were the catalytic sites after the observation that chemical modification of mitochondria from yeast strains expressing L-CPT I and M-CPT I by diethylpyrocarbonate had no effect on catalytic activity. It is possible that expressed CPT I in yeast mitochondria makes this histidine inaccessible for diethylpyrocarbonate modification. Brown et al. (11Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that a charge-relay system involving this His coupled with an Asp extracts a proton from the C-3 hydroxyl group of carnitine, allowing for nucleophilic attack of the resulting oxyanion of the carbonyl group of the acyl-CoA thioester. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments in carnitine acetyltransferase supports this model, which tends to exclude a modified enzyme intermediate from the reaction pathway (46Cronin C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238 (; Correction (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.247, 803–804): 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The question of whether the substrates of carnitine acyltransferases bind to the same locus as malonyl-CoA has been subject of much discussion. Under this view, malonyl-CoA could be a competitive inhibitor of palmitoyl-CoA as substrate in CPT I. Whereas mutation of A381D (in the middle of the catalytic channel) strongly decreases catalytic activity, it does not modify the inhibition to malonyl-CoA in the range 1–200 μm in CPT I and in COT. These specific mutants behave similarly to the mutants reported in Ref. 13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, since in most of them the capacity of malonyl-CoA to inhibit the mutated enzymes is maintained. On the contrary, natural mutant P479L (43Brown N.F. Mullur R.S. Subramanian I. Esser V. Bennett M.J. Saudubray J.M. Feigenbaum A.S. Kobari J.A. Macleod P.M. McGarry J.D. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), located in a domain that is facing toward the middle of the substrate-binding channel, has decreased sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, whereas the CPT I activity is not severely decreased (21.6% residual activity). Therefore, Ala381, although located in the model near Pro479, appears not to mediate the malonyl-CoA inhibitory effect, suggesting fine interactions in the amino acids involved in the binding of malonyl-CoA.Mutation of residues described previously also supports the model: amino acids Trp391, Arg451, Trp452 (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Asp454 (42Ijist L. Mandel H. Oostheim W. Ruiter J.P. Gutman A. Wanders R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), because they are in the channel in which substrates are fitted in the catalytic event, and the amino acids Arg388 and Arg395(13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), located in the neighborhood of the catalytic channel, because the change in charge probably disrupts the delicate charge environment. Mutant L484P (43Brown N.F. Mullur R.S. Subramanian I. Esser V. Bennett M.J. Saudubray J.M. Feigenbaum A.S. Kobari J.A. Macleod P.M. McGarry J.D. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also present at the end of the catalytic channel, which confirms the absence of activity. The similar trace of the amino acid backbone of enoyl-CoA hydratase (determined by x-ray), the location in the model of amino acids previously shown as important in the catalytic event and the functional location of alanines, predicted to be placed at least 4 Å from the catalytic histidine in CPT I and COT confirm the model. This model will facilitate in the future the studies of interaction of the substrates (palmitoyl-CoA or octanoyl-CoA) or the physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, with CPT I and COT and their role in the physiological regulation of fatty acid β oxidation. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I1; EC 2.3.1.21) and carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT; EC 2.3.1.137) facilitate the transport of long and medium chain acyl-CoA in mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. Both carnitine acyltransferases facilitate the generation of energy by β-oxidation of fatty acids in the organella in which they are present. Mammalian tissues express two different isoforms of CPT I, a liver isoform (L-CPT I) (1Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. Mc Garry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Britton C.H. Schultz R.A. Zhang B. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in β-oxidation, CPT I is tightly regulated by its physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA. In regulating CPT I, malonyl-CoA confers the ability to signal to the cell the availability of lipid and carbohydrate fuels (5McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). CPT I has a critical metabolic role in general metabolism in heart, liver, and β-cells of the pancreas and is a potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders involving diabetes and coronary heart disease. Peroxisomal COT is also inhibited in physiological conditions by malonyl-CoA (6A'Bhaird N.N. Ramsay R.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but to a lesser extent than CPT I. Other enzymes of the family, which are not regulated by malonyl-CoA, are CPT II, which catalyzes long-chain acyl-CoA in the mitochondria, and carnitine acetyltransferase, which has acetyl-CoA as substrate. These enzymes have recently generated much interest, especially the spatial organization of CPT I in the mitochondrial outer membrane. CPT I is an integral membrane protein, and both the N and C termini project to the cytosol, since it has two trans-membrane segments within the first 130 N-terminal residues of its primary sequence (7Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interaction between amino acids from the N and C termini may determine the kinetic characteristics of the enzyme, not only in the inhibitory effect of malonyl-CoA but also in the catalytic activity (8Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). COT appears not to be an integral protein of peroxisomes. Sequence alignment between CPT I and COT shows that COT lacks the first 152 amino acid residues, which indicates that it has no transmembrane regions. However, the two show high sequence identity, which suggests a common genetic origin (9van der Leij F.R. Huijkman N.C. Boomsma C. Kuipers J.R. Bartelds B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although several attempts have been made to identify the malonyl-CoA site, few data are available on the structure of the catalytic site of carnitine acyltransferases. It has been proposed that a histidine residue is critical in catalysis (10Schmalix W. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27428-27439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated an essential catalytic role for histidine 372 in CPT II (11Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the homologous histidine 327 in COT (12Morillas M. Clotet J. Rubı́ B. Serra D. Asins G. Ariño J. Hegardt F.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However the role of a histidine in catalysis has been questioned for both CPT I and COT (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Nic a'Bhaird N. Yankovskaya V. Ramsay R.R. Biochem.

Dai et al. observed that overexpressed CPT I in yeast treated with diethylpyrocarbonate did not decrease the enzyme activity at variance with wild type rat mitochondria, although differences in the folding of CPT I in yeast and in rat liver could lead to an alternative interpretation. Other amino acids residues have been also implicated in catalysis. Mutation of several conserved arginines (Arg388, Arg451) and tryptophans (Trp391, Trp452) comprised between amino acids 381 and 481 of CPT I decreased enzyme activity (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that this segment could be the putative palmitoyl-CoA binding site of CPT I. In this fragment, mutants D376A and D464A in rat CPT II were completely inactive (11Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As to the carnitine binding site, arginine 505 in beef COT, which lies outside the proposed palmitoyl-CoA binding site, has been implicated (15Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we propose three-dimensional models of the catalytic site comprising amino acids 368–568 in CPT I and 226–417 in COT. These models were made using an integrative approach of several threading procedures taking into account different parameters such as solvatation potentials, contacts, environment-specific substitution tables, and structure-dependent gap penalties. The fold recognition analysis using these procedures showed a common template for the catalytic site of the carnitine/choline acyltransferase family of proteins, corresponding to the structure of the enoyl-CoA hydratase enzyme (Protein Data Bank entry 2dub; Ref. 16Engel C.K. Kiema T.R. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); this motif was also found in CPT I and COT. The three-dimensional models for CPT I and COT are practically identical and show a common architecture for the catalytic site. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that CPT I His473 and COT His327 are the catalytic residues. These histidines are located near the thioester bond in the acyl-CoA, which is broken in catalysis. Mutation of CPT I A381 and COT A238, located close to the catalytic histidine decreased the enzyme activity by 80–86% without modifying the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA. DISCUSSIONDespite efforts in biochemical characterization of carnitine palmitoyltransferases and their related enzymes, their mode of action is not completely understood, probably due to the lack of any structural characterization of the catalytic site. In the absence of an appropriate crystallized reference, some bioinformatics tools can be applied to obtain a structural model able to approximately address some important questions related to these proteins' activity.The threading or “remote homology design” is a three-dimensional structure prediction technique useful when there is not enough sequence similarity of the input sequence and a known three-dimensional structure and, therefore, the “homology modeling” is not applicable. The process adapts the sequence to different known foldings and evaluates the fitting. The meaning of “fitting” varies from one threading program to others: secondary structure coincidence, similar accessibility, or solvatation energy, etc. Methods of protein fold recognition attempt to detect similarities between protein three-dimensional structure that are not accompanied by any significant sequence similarity. There are many approaches, but the unifying theme is to try and find folds that are comparable with a particular sequence. Unlike sequence-only comparison, these methods take advantage of the extra information made available by three-dimensional structural data.To detect structural homologies between CPT I and COT and any other three-dimensional representation, we used an integrative approach of two programs, THREADER2 (22Jones D.T. Miller R.T. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and FUGUE threading server (23Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Whereas the first one uses solvatation potentials and predicted contacts, the latter performs a fold recognition analysis using structural environment-specific substitution tables and structure-dependent gap penalties. The integration of both methodologies revealed that the three-dimensional fold of the central site of all acyl-CoA transferases can be structured in the same way as the enoyl-CoA hydratase monomer (Protein Data Bank entry 2dub, chain E). What was more important was to observe that CPT I and COT had nearly identical structural models for the central region, which putatively contains the catalytic site (amino acids 368–567 of CPT I and amino acids 226–417 of COT). The predicted secondary structure for the 200 amino acids that putatively contains the palmitoyl-CoA or decanoyl-CoA binding region consists of 6 α-helices and 4 β-sheets.Additional support of this fold as template is based on the fact that these proteins bind very similar ligands, all of them acyl-CoA derivatives; the crystal structure of the enoyl-CoA hydratase monomer includes precisely a molecule of octanoyl-CoA, used as inhibitor in this case, the natural substrate of COT. Enoyl-CoA hydratase (Protein Data Bank code 2dub), also known as crotonase, belongs to the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase family. It is a homohexameric enzyme, located at the mitochondrial matrix. It catalyzes the second step in the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, transforming the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA into trans-2(or 3)-enoyl-CoA plus H2O.The model predicts that although CPT I Ala381(Ala238 in COT) is 92 amino acids away from the CPT I His473 (His327 in COT) it is very close to the catalytic histidines. The important decrease in activity (14–20% of residual activity with respect to the wild type) after mutation CPT I A381D or COT A238D confirms the function of these alanines and supports the three-dimensional model. The marked modification ofKm for acyl-CoA of the mutants supports the role of these alanines in locating the substrates to the catalytic site.In addition, these alanine residues had been implicated in CPT and COT activity by a tree determinant study of the complete alignment of the carnitine-choline acyltransferase family of proteins. In a protein family alignment, the positions considered as tree determinants, or subfamily conserved residues, are usually accepted to be implicated in key catalytic activities, being responsible for the different substrate specificities or enzymatic activities of the different subfamilies of the alignment (37Casari G. Sander C. Valencia A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 38Pazos F. Sanchez-Pulido L. Garcı́a-Ranea J.A. Andrade M.A. Atrian S. Valencia A. Lundh D. Olsson B. Narayanan A. Biocomputing and Emergent Computation. World Scientific, Singapore1997: 132-145Google Scholar). A clear example of this type of analysis was made previously in this same family of proteins related to the carnitine versus choline affinity (44Cronin C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24465-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structure-based alignment of the template sequence with all the other transferases sequences used in the extensive threading procedure can also be used to build three-dimensional models of all the other members of the family in the future.The group of Woldegiorgis (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggested that the region comprised between 381–481 could be the putative palmitoyl-CoA binding site. Moreover, the abolition of activity after mutation of H473A strongly suggests that this His473 is the catalytic site. McGarry and co-workers (11Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after mutagenesis of homologous histidine in CPT II, proposed that this was the catalytic site. This was confirmed in a previous study in COT, in which mutant H327A abolished the catalytic activity (45Morillas M. Clotet J. Rubı́ B. Serra D. Ariño J. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 495-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dai et al. (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) questioned whether these histidines were the catalytic sites after the observation that chemical modification of mitochondria from yeast strains expressing L-CPT I and M-CPT I by diethylpyrocarbonate had no effect on catalytic activity. It is possible that expressed CPT I in yeast mitochondria makes this histidine inaccessible for diethylpyrocarbonate modification. Brown et al. (11Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that a charge-relay system involving this His coupled with an Asp extracts a proton from the C-3 hydroxyl group of carnitine, allowing for nucleophilic attack of the resulting oxyanion of the carbonyl group of the acyl-CoA thioester. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments in carnitine acetyltransferase supports this model, which tends to exclude a modified enzyme intermediate from the reaction pathway (46Cronin C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238 (; Correction (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.247, 803–804): 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The question of whether the substrates of carnitine acyltransferases bind to the same locus as malonyl-CoA has been subject of much discussion. Under this view, malonyl-CoA could be a competitive inhibitor of palmitoyl-CoA as substrate in CPT I. Whereas mutation of A381D (in the middle of the catalytic channel) strongly decreases catalytic activity, it does not modify the inhibition to malonyl-CoA in the range 1–200 μm in CPT I and in COT. These specific mutants behave similarly to the mutants reported in Ref. 13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, since in most of them the capacity of malonyl-CoA to inhibit the mutated enzymes is maintained. On the contrary, natural mutant P479L (43Brown N.F. Mullur R.S. Subramanian I. Esser V. Bennett M.J. Saudubray J.M. Feigenbaum A.S. Kobari J.A. Macleod P.M. McGarry J.D. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), located in a domain that is facing toward the middle of the substrate-binding channel, has decreased sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, whereas the CPT I activity is not severely decreased (21.6% residual activity). Therefore, Ala381, although located in the model near Pro479, appears not to mediate the malonyl-CoA inhibitory effect, suggesting fine interactions in the amino acids involved in the binding of malonyl-CoA.Mutation of residues described previously also supports the model: amino acids Trp391, Arg451, Trp452 (13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Asp454 (42Ijist L. Mandel H. Oostheim W. Ruiter J.P. Gutman A. Wanders R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), because they are in the channel in which substrates are fitted in the catalytic event, and the amino acids Arg388 and Arg395(13Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), located in the neighborhood of the catalytic channel, because the change in charge probably disrupts the delicate charge environment. Mutant L484P (43Brown N.F. Mullur R.S. Subramanian I. Esser V. Bennett M.J. Saudubray J.M. Feigenbaum A.S. Kobari J.A. Macleod P.M. McGarry J.D. Cohen J.C. J.

The similar trace of the amino acid backbone of enoyl-CoA hydratase (determined by x-ray), the location in the model of amino acids previously shown as important in the catalytic event and the functional location of alanines, predicted to be placed at least 4 Å from the catalytic histidine in CPT I and COT confirm the model. This model will facilitate in the future the studies of interaction of the substrates (palmitoyl-CoA or octanoyl-CoA) or the physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, with CPT I and COT and their role in the physiological regulation of fatty acid β oxidation.

Ion channels and receptors are typically clustered and localized at the specific subcellular sites of neurons such as synapses. Clustering of ion channels is important for concentrating current flux across a small area of membrane and for maximizing responses to local neurotransmitters. Moreover, changes in the distribution and density of channels and receptors may play a role in long term synaptic plasticity and information storage in the brain. In the excitatory synapses, signal transmission is mediated primarily byN-methyl-d-aspartate and AMPA1 glutamate receptors. PDZ (PSD-95, Disc-large, and ZO-1) homologous domain-containing proteins play fundamental roles in clustering ion channels/receptors as well as assembling their downstream signaling components (1Craven S.E.

The interaction between the AMPA receptor and GRIP/ABP may serve a major role in the receptor insertion to the synaptic membrane, a process directly linked to the synaptic plasticity (19Matsuda S.

The requirement of two PDZ domains for proper function is certainly not unique to GRIP proteins. Both in vitro syntenin-syndecan binding and proper membrane localization of syntenin require the paired PDZ domains of syntenin (23Grootjans J.J. Reekmans G. Ceulemans H. David G. J. Biol.

The first and second PDZ domains of hDlg together are essential for its binding to cytoskeletal protein 4.1 (25Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These emerging observations suggest that tandemly arranged PDZ repeats possess functional features that differ from the simple sum of the properties of the individual PDZ domains. However, current biochemical and structural data cannot provide mechanistic insights into the unique biological functions presented by tandem PDZ domains. In this work, we report that PDZ4 of GRIP induces de novofolding of PDZ5, which, by itself, is unstructured in solution. The mutual chaperoning of PDZ4 and PDZ5 requires the two domains to be covalently linked to each other. The well folded PDZ45 can interact with the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor. The results presented in this work expand our current knowledge of the functional roles of PDZ domains. A synthetic peptide (NVYGIESVKI) corresponding to the last 10 amino acid residues of GluR2 (Asn874–Ile883) was synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, VA). The peptide was purified using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. DNA fragments encoding PDZ4 (amino acids 462–567), PDZ5 (amino acids 564–663), and PDZ45 (amino acids 462–663) of rat GRIP1 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the full-length cDNA of the protein (provided by Dr. Morgan Sheng) with specific primers. The amplified DNA fragments of PDZ4, PDZ5, and PDZ45 were inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of a modified version of pET32a (Novagen) in which the DNA sequences encoding the S-tag and thioredoxin were removed. The recombinant plasmids harboring the respective target genes were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) host cells individually for large scale protein preparation. Uniformly 15N-labeled proteins were prepared by growing bacteria in M9 minimal medium using15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source. His-tagged PDZ4, PDZ5, and PDZ45 were purified by a combination of a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity (Qiagen), gel filtration, and DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatographic techniques. The cDNA encoding the COOH-terminal 50 residues of the GluR2 cytoplasmic tail was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the full-length clone (provided by Dr. Morgan Sheng) and inserted into a modified version of pET32a vector. The His-tagged, thioredoxin-fused GluR2 was expressed as described for the PDZ domains of GRIP. The fusion protein was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The His tag and thioredoxin parts of the fusion protein were cleaved by thrombin digestion and removed by a second round of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The remaining contaminating proteins were removed by passing the GluR2 peptide containing mixture through a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column. The purified GluR2 fragment was dialyzed in the NMR sample buffer and subsequently concentrated by ultrafiltration for NMR studies. The molecular masses of various PDZ domains of GRIP were determined by analytical gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column buffer was 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. The purified COOH-terminal 50-amino acid residue fragment of GluR2 fused to the COOH-terminal end of GST was first resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. GST-GluR2 was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was subsequently blocked with 10% skim milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane strips were then incubated with purified, His-tagged PDZ4, PDZ5, and PDZ45, respectively, in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the bound His-tagged PDZ proteins on the strips were immunodetected by anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CD spectra of PDZ proteins were measured on a JASCO J-720 CD spectropolarimeter at room temperature using a cell path length of 1 mm. Each spectrum was collected with 10 scans spanning a spectral window of 190–250 nm. The proteins were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol. The protein concentration used in the CD experiment was 15 μm. All NMR samples were dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10 mm d10-dithiothreitol in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on a four-channel Varian Inova 750-MHz spectrometer equipped with an actively z-gradient shielded triple resonance probe. To better understand the functional role of the cytoplasmic tail of GluR2, we characterized its structure by NMR spectroscopy. Large quantities of 15N-labeled whole cytoplasmic tail domain of GluR2 (amino acids 834–883) were obtained using the protein expression and purification scheme developed in this work. Fig. 1 shows the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the domain in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The narrow1H and 15N chemical shift dispersions in Fig. 1clearly indicated that the cytoplasmic tail of GluR2 adopts a random coil structure in aqueous solution. A 15N-separated three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiment of the same sample further confirmed the random coil structure of the domain (data not shown). To dissect functional roles of PDZ4 and PDZ5 of GRIP in binding to GluR2, we studied the structure of the individual PDZ domains in solution. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the freshly prepared PDZ4 displayed good chemical shift dispersions in both 1H and 15N dimensions typical for structured proteins (Fig. 2A,red). Detailed inspection of the NMR spectrum of the freshly prepared PDZ4 (Fig. 2 A, red) revealed a second set of weak resonances with very narrow line width and narrow1H chemical shift dispersion (7.8–8.7 ppm), suggesting the existence of a random coil-like conformation in PDZ4. The CD spectrum of the freshly prepared PDZ4 was also somewhat anomalous (Fig.3 A), since the α-helix content of the domain estimated from the spectrum was far more than that expected for the conventional PDZ domains (∼15% of amino acids adopt α-helical structure in PDZ domains). We further observed that the intensities of peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of PDZ4 corresponding to the random coil conformation continuously increased as a function of time (both at 30 and 4 °C). Fig. 2 B shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of PDZ4 after the sample had been stored in a 4 °C refrigerator for 5 days. In this spectrum, the resonances corresponding to the random coil conformation of the protein dominated the spectrum. Although still detectable, the resonances for the folded PDZ4 became much weaker. CD spectra of PDZ4 also experienced dramatic changes with time. The CD spectrum of a 5-day-old PDZ4 sample resembled that of a random coil protein (Fig. 3 A). Possible proteolytic degradation of the aged PDZ4 samples was ruled out by checking the integrity of the protein using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown).Figure 3Stability of PDZ4, PDZ5, and PDZ45 of GRIP. A, characterization of the folding of PDZ4, PDZ5, and PDZ45 by far-UV-CD spectroscopy. The freshly prepared PDZ4 spectrum was shown using a solid line (labeledPDZ4), and the spectrum for the “aged” PDZ4 was drawn as a dashed line (labeled PDZ4*). The CD spectra of PDZ5 and PDZ45 were labeled with their respective names.B, denaturation profiles of PDZ4 (freshly prepared) and PDZ45 as a concentration of urea. The CD spectra of the proteins at different concentrations of urea were measured. The ellipticities of each spectrum at 222 nm were used to construct the denaturation curves shown in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Unexpectedly, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of GRIP PDZ5 is typical for a completely unstructured protein (Fig.2 C). The CD spectrum of the protein at a much lower concentration also indicated that PDZ5 adopts a random coil structure in solution (Fig. 3 A). Analytical gel filtration chromatography experiment showed that PDZ5 did not form large molecular weight aggregates at concentrations used for both CD and NMR experiments (data not shown). We next assayed possible interactions between GluR2 and PDZ4 and PDZ5, respectively. The addition of excess molar ratio amount of a 10-residue GluR2 tail peptide (NVYGIESVKI) to 15N-labeled PDZ4 or PDZ5 did not induce chemical shift changes in the1H-15N HSQC spectra of both PDZ domains (data not shown), indicating that the GluR2 peptide does not bind to either PDZ domain. We also used a blot overlay assay to detect potential binding of GluR2 to PDZ4 and PDZ5. In this assay, the entire COOH-terminal tail of GluR2 was fused to GST. GST-GluR2 was chosen as the immobilized phase in the overlay assay, since GluR2 adopts a random coil structure in solution (Fig. 1), and proper refolding of GluR2 was not a concern in the experiment. Consistent with the NMR titration experiment, neither PDZ4 nor PDZ5 showed detectable interaction with GST-GluR2 (Fig. 4 A). To compare structural difference of PDZ45 with individual PDZ domains of PDZ4 and PDZ5, a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of PDZ45 was recorded under the identical condition used for the individual PDZ domains (Fig. 2 A, blue). The chemical shift dispersion and line width of the spectrum indicated that both domains of PDZ45 were well folded with a uniform conformation in solution. The CD spectrum of PDZ45 also showed that the protein was well folded (Fig. 3 A). The NMR and CD spectra of PDZ45 remained identical when the protein samples were “aged” for 2 weeks, suggesting that the folded PDZ45 conformation is stable in solution. We compared denaturation profiles of PDZ4 and PDZ45 as a concentration of urea (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with NMR studies, the freshly prepared PDZ4 readily denatured in the presence of low concentrations of urea, whereas PDZ45 displayed a clear transition from folded to denatured states when the concentration of urea increased. The overlay plot of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of PDZ4 (red) and PDZ45 (blue) showed that the majority of resonances of PDZ4 did not overlap with the peaks of PDZ45, suggesting that PDZ4 undergoes a significant structural change when it is linked with PDZ5. Such structural changes presumably resulted from direct contacts between PDZ4 and PDZ5. The de novo folding of PDZ5 induced by PDZ4 was obvious from the complete disappearance of the random coil peaks in the PDZ45 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. Taken together, we conclude that PDZ4 and PDZ5 mutually promote each other's folding and stability. We then investigated whether the chaperoning effect between PDZ4 and PDZ5 was intra- or intermolecular in nature. Mixing of equal or excess molar ratio amount of unlabeled PDZ4 with 15N-labeled PDZ5 did not change the NMR spectrum of PDZ5. In a reverse experiment, the addition of unlabeled PDZ5 did not change the NMR spectrum of15N-labeled PDZ4 (data not shown). The above data strongly indicated that the chaperoning effect requires both PDZ domains to be covalently connected to each other and that the two PDZ domains stabilize each other in an intramolecular fashion. To assess functional consequence of the mutual chaperoning effect between PDZ4 and PDZ5, we assayed interaction between GluR2 and PDZ45. A number of backbone amide resonances of PDZ45 experienced peptide-induced chemical shift changes in the overlay plot of the1H-15N HSQC spectra of free PDZ45 (black) and PDZ45 saturated with the 10-residue GluR2 peptide (red), indicating that PDZ45 binds to the GluR2 peptide (Fig. 4 B). The interaction between GluR2 and PDZ45 was also confirmed in the blot overlay assay (Fig. 4 A). PDZ domain-mediated multimerization represents an important property of the GRIP/ABP family multi-PDZ domain proteins (13Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B. Daly C.

Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 603-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand how PDZ domains of GRIP1 might associate with each other, we measured molecular masses of various PDZ domains by analytical gel filtration chromatography (Fig.5). His-tagged PDZ4 and PDZ45 were eluted at molecular masses of 23.9 and 46.8 kDa, respectively, which matched the dimer molecular weight of both proteins. The data indicated that PDZ4 forms homodimer in solution. The result also suggested that PDZ5 is not likely to be involved in the dimerization of PDZ45. Increasing experimental evidence suggests that PDZ domains in multi-PDZ domain-containing proteins are grouped into functional units. Two or more PDZ domains are often found to be necessary to mediate specific interactions with the COOH-terminal peptides of target proteins. We chose to study GRIP PDZ45 in this work, hoping to gain insights into the structural interplay of the two PDZ domains and to provide a mechanistic understanding of grouped PDZ domain-mediated target recognition. The most important discovery of this work is that PDZ domains in GRIP mutually chaperone each other, enabling the tandem PDZ domains (PDZ45 of GRIP) to interact with its target (GluR2). We showed that PDZ5 alone is completely unstructured in solution. Although it is largely folded, the freshly prepared PDZ4 domain can spontaneously unfold. In PDZ45, both PDZ domains are well folded and stable. It is interesting to note that the mutual chaperoning effect between PDZ4 and PDZ5 occurs only when the two PDZ domains are covalently connected, since simple mixing of the two individual domains does not change their respective structures. This result also implies that the biological function of tandem PDZ domain may not be attained by association of two PDZ domains from different proteins. Since the folded PDZ4 cannot bind to GluR2, we suggest that PDZ5 in the GRIP is directly involved in binding to GluR2. Consistent with this interpretation, PDZ5, but not PDZ4, of ABP robustly interacts with GluR2 (13Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B. Daly C. DeSouza S. Abagyan R. Valtschanoff J.G. Weinberg R.J. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 1998; 21: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Although PDZ4 in GRIP is not likely to be involved in binding to GluR2, this domain may bind to other neuronal proteins. In a recent yeast two-hybrid screening, a number of proteins were found to interact with PDZ456 of GRIP (26Ye B. Liao D. Zhang X. Zhang P. Dong H. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 603-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further work is required to determine whether PDZ4 is direct involved in binding to these targets. We further note that PDZ4 domain can dimerize. The dimerization of PDZ4 is somewhat intriguing, since the construct of PDZ4 domain used in this work contains only a canonical PDZ domain sequence. It is unlikely that PDZ4 can dimerize using a β-finger-mediated mechanism observed in the PSD-95/neuronal nitric-oxide synthase PDZ dimmer (11Tochio H. Zhang Q. Mandal P. Li M. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A.

Biol. 2000; 303: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Detailed structural studies will be required to elucidate how two canonical PDZ domains might interact with each other to form a dimmer. The data in this study suggested that the function of PDZ4 in GRIP is likely to promote folding of PDZ5 and to assemble GRIP into a multimeric complex (27Dong H. Zhang P. Song I. Petralia R.S. Liao D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6930-6941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of PDZ5 to PDZ4 in PDZ45 in turn stabilizes the structure of PDZ4. The mutual chaperoning function of PDZ domains represents a previously uncharacterized property of PDZ domains. The work provides a mechanistic understanding of why both PDZ4 and PDZ5 are required for the binding between GRIP and GluR2. Further work is necessary to determine whether chaperoning effect between PDZ domains also occurs in other PDZ domain-containing proteins. What we do know is that tandemly arranged PDZ domains (e.g. PDZ1 and PDZ2 in PSD-95) may use different mechanisms in ensuring their targeting specificity. 2M. Zhang, unpublished data. It is clear that combinations of protein modules often render new biological functions in addition to the ones provided by the individual domains in multidomain proteins. The much more complicated protein domain organizations found in human proteins with respect to yeast andCaenorhabditis elegans partially explain why we only need ∼30,000 genes in our genome (28Consortium I.H.G.S.

Functional AMPA receptors contain at least one GluR2 subunit. The cytoplasmic tail of GluR2 contains 50 amino acid residues. This 50-amino acid segment plays central roles in regulating AMPA receptor-mediated signaling events by binding to a number of regulatory proteins. For example, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein binds to a short segment of the GluR2 tail (30Nishimune A. Isaac J.T. Molnar E. Noel J. Nash S.R. Tagaya M. Collingridge G.L. Nakanishi S.

Interaction between protein-tyrosine kinase Lyn and GluR2 was also confined to the GluR2 tail (33Hayashi T. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1999; 397: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A number of PDZ domain proteins including GRIP, ABP, and PICK1 interact with the extreme carboxyl terminus of GluR2 (13Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B. Daly C.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In addition, the GluR2 tail can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (19Matsuda S. Mikawa S. Hirai H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 22Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is rather mysterious how this short stretch of peptide fragment encodes such an incredible number of functions of the receptor. We show by NMR spectroscopy that the GluR2 tail is completely unstructured in aqueous solution, suggesting that the linear amino acid sequence rather than its higher order structure defines the function of the receptor tails. However, it is possible that the GluR2 tail may adopt a different conformation when it is covalently linked to the fourth transmembrane segment of the receptor.

Subnanomolar concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and type C natriuretic peptide (CNP) stimulated proliferation in all four cell lines. These actions were associated with cGMP elevation and were blocked by a protein kinase G inhibitor. These data imply the involvement of guanylyl cyclase (GC)-coupled natriuretic receptors. However, higher concentrations of ANP and CNP, and low concentrations of des-[Gln18,Ser19,Gly20,Leu21,Gly22]-ANP4–23-NH2(desANP4–23) (analog for NPR-C receptor) exerted antiproliferative actions in three of the cell lines. These effects were insensitive to a protein kinase G inhibitor and to HS-142-1, suggesting that growth-inhibitory actions involved a non-GC receptor. They did not appear to involve cAMP, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, or calcium mobilization but were abolished when constitutive mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was inhibited. Radioligand binding experiments revealed the presence of a uniform class of binding sites in NG108 cells and multiple binding sites in Neuro2a cells. Northern and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed differential gene expression for NPR-A/B/C in NG108 and Neuro2a cells. The results indicate that natriuretic peptides stimulate neuroblastoma cell proliferation through type NPR-A/B (GC) receptors. Higher concentrations of ANP and CNP exerted a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent antiproliferative action mediated by a non-GC receptor that interacts with desANP4–23 with relatively high affinity.

Receptor subtypes A and B (NPR-A and NPR-B, respectively) contain a single transmembrane domain and possess intrinsic GC activity (5Pandey K.N. Singh S. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 252: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The type C receptor (NPR-C) is similar to types A and B but lacks the intracellular GC domain (7Fuller F. Porter J.G.

Despite widespread expression of NPR-C, initial studies were unable to identify its signaling pathways. Because NPR-C was found to internalize after binding natriuretic peptides, it was proposed that the receptor is involved in removing ANP peptides from the circulation (8Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A.

However, more recent studies that have utilized relatively specific ligands for NPR-C suggest that it may be positively coupled to phospholipase C (9Hirata M. Chang C.H. Murad F. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, a recent report indicated that the NPR-C-mediated inhibition of astrocyte proliferation occurs in association with decreased MAP kinase activation (11Prins B.A. Weber M.J. Hu R.M.

In contrast to these inhibitory actions, ANP stimulated the proliferation of embryonic cardiomyocytes (19Koide M. Akins R.E. Harayama H. Yasui K. Yokota M. Tuan R.S.

Moreover, NPR-C knockout mice and transgenic mice overexpressing brain natriuretic peptide exhibit pronounced skeletal overgrowth (21Suda M. Ogawa Y. Tanaka K. Tamura N. Yasoda A. Takigawa T.

Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 356-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Natriuretic binding sites are reported to be present in the proliferative zones of the embryonic brain (25Brown J. Zuo Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R261-R273PubMed Google Scholar) and in neuroblastoma tumor cell lines (26Delporte C. Poloczek P. Gossen D. Tastenoy M. Winand J. Christophe J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 207: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma cells have also been reported to express natriuretic peptides (27Niimura S. Mizuno K. Yabe R. Tani M. Suenaga K. Naruse M. Inagami T. Fukuchi S. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1989; 63: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar) and to secrete certain endopeptidases (28Delporte C. Winand J. Poloczek P. Von Geldern T. Christophe J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that are capable of cleaving natriuretic peptides. Despite these findings, relevant biological actions of natriuretic peptides in embryonic neuroblasts and neuroblastoma cells have not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that natriuretic peptides regulate the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells through specific ANP receptor subtypes. These studies utilized ANP, which binds with high affinity to NPR-A and NPR-C; CNP, which binds with highest affinity to NPR-B; and an NPR-C-specific angonist des-[Gln18,Ser19,Gly20,Leu21,Gly22]-ANP4–23-NH2(desANP4–23) (29Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A. Lewicki J.A. Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). We also studied the sensitivity of the proliferative actions to various kinase inhibitors and characterized at molecular and pharmacological levels the type of ANP receptors that were expressed. Finally, we measured the peptide-induced changes in the levels of cyclic second messengers, cAMP and cGMP, by radioimmunoassay and intracellular calcium by fura-2 cytofluorometry. The data obtained indicate that natriuretic peptides stimulate proliferation through NPR-A and/or NPR-B (GC) receptors, whereas antiproliferative actions appear to be mediated by a non-GC natriuretic receptor that interacts with desANP4–23 with relatively high affinity. Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). SK-N-SH neuroblastoma subclones SHIN and SY-5Y were obtained from Dr. June Biedler (Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute, Rye, NY). NG108 neuroblastoma/glioma hybrid cells were obtained from Dr. Chris Evans (UCLA). All cell lines were maintained in 75-cm2 flasks (Falcon) in 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellbio/Fisher). Medium was supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) under a 5% CO2, 95% air controlled atmosphere at 37 °C. Medium was changed every 3 days. Routine subculture of cells was performed by trypsinization (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA, Life Technologies). Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (80,000 cells/well) in 1 ml of medium and cultured for 24 h. Medium was then replaced with fresh serum-free medium. After 1.5 h at 37 °C, cells were preincubated for an additional 1 h with vehicle or signal transduction inhibitors (GF109203X, H89, and Rp-8-pCTP-cGMPS from Calbiochem and PD98059 from New England Biolabs) or the NPR-A/NPR-B antagonist HS-142-1 (kindly provided by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Shizuoka, Japan). Inhibitor efficiencies and specificities were tested in preliminary studies across a range of concentrations (from 1 to 100 μm) using stimulators of the specific kinases (PACAP for protein kinase A, platelet-derived growth factor for mitogen-activated protein kinase, and ANP for G-kinase). The lowest doses causing full but specific inhibitions were used in subsequent assays. After preincubation with the specified inhibitors, peptides (desANP4–23, ANP, and CNP from Sigma) were added for 1 h prior to distribution of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well). Four hours after radiotracer addition, cells were harvested, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined as previously described (30Lelièvre V. Pineau N. Du J. Wen C.H. Nguyen T.B. Janet T. Muller J.M. Waschek J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19685-19690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells (80,000/well) were cultured for 3 days in 24-well plates. Medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine and, in the case of cAMP measurement, with or without 10 μm forskolin (Sigma). After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, peptides were added and cells were incubated further for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 6% trichloroacetic acid solution, and radioimmunoassays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 125I-ANP (2200 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Time course and saturation studies were performed in six-well plates (Falcon) seeded 24 h earlier with 400,000 cells/well. Displacement experiments were conducted on freshly suspended cells in microcentrifuge tubes (800,000 cells/ml). Incubations in all cases were performed in binding medium consisting of culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with bovine serum albumin, HEPES, and protease inhibitors (o-phenanthroline and bacitracin). Saturation studies were performed in binding medium containing increasing concentrations (from 1 pm to 0.15 nm) of radioligand in the presence or absence of 5 μm native ANP (to determine nonspecific and total binding, respectively). In competition and kinetic studies, binding medium contained 36 pm125I-ANP and the specified concentrations of competitive analogs. Incubation time for competition and saturation experiments was fixed at 120 min based on the time course study. All incubations were performed at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Rinses were performed, and bound radioactivity measurements were determined as previously described (30Lelièvre V. Pineau N. Du J. Wen C.H. Nguyen T.B. Janet T. Muller J.M. Waschek J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19685-19690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Neuro2a and NG108 cells were cultured in seven flasks (75 cm2) and harvested at 90% confluence with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin was neutralized with the tissue culture medium (containing 8% serum), and cells were centrifuged and then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Total RNA from control tissues (brain, kidney, and lung) was obtained from two male ND4 mice. Total RNA from cells and tissues was extracted and purified according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Subsequent poly(A)-selection of mRNA was accomplished using the Poly(A)Pure™ kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)-selected mRNA from Neuro2a and NG108 neuroblastoma cells, as well as control mouse brain, kidney, and liver tissues were loaded (6 μg/lane) on a 0.8% agarose 2% formaldehyde MOPS gel (30Lelièvre V.

After transfer to nylon membranes (MSI), blots were prehybridized for 2 h and then hybridized for 16 h in UltrahybTM hybridization solution (Ambion) at 44 °C. Northern hybridizations were performed sequentially (NPR-C, NPR-B, and NPR-A, respectively) using 200,000 cpm/ml of each probe. Probes consisted of EcoRI-excised cDNA inserts (see below) labeled by random incorporation of [32P]dCTP (Random Primers kit; Life Technologies, Inc.). Membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS solution at 44 °C for 5 min, and then washed twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 44 °C. Blots were exposed for 3 days and signals detected with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Natriuretic receptor probes were obtained by RT-PCR using mouse kidney total RNA as template. Primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were designed using the on-line Primer3 software (33Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on mouse or rat natriuretic peptide receptor sequences published in the NCBI data base (GenBankTM accession numbers L31932, X14177, and D78175). The sense primers for natriuretic receptor subtypes A, B, and C were 5′-ATTTGTGGGAGCTTGTACCG-3′, 5′-GTGTACCCTGCTGCCTCTGT-3, and 5′-CTTCCAGGTGGCCTACGAA-3′, and antisense primers were 5′-GGCAATTTCCTGAAGGATGA-3′, 5′-CCGCAGATATACACAATGCG-3′, and 5′-GGCACACATGATCACCACTC-3′, respectively. These were designed to generate PCR fragments of 389, 379, and 492 base pairs, corresponding to nucleotides 1790–2179, 376–755, and 279–771 for natriuretic receptor subtypes A, B, and C respectively. Amplifications were carried out for 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 50 s), annealing (54 °C, 45 s), and extension (72 °C, 45 s). PCR was finished by an incubation for 5 min at 72 °C. RT-PCR reactions yielded products of the expected size. To validate the nature of the PCR products, one-fifth of the PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels, followed by overnight transfer to nylon membrane (Magna, MSI). Membranes were baked, UV-cross-linked, and then preincubated for 6 h at 37 °C in the hybridization solution described (30Lelièvre V. Pineau N. Du J. Wen C.H. Nguyen T.B. Janet T. Muller J.M. Waschek J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19685-19690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed at 37 °C for 6 h, using the following 32P-end-labeled internal oligonucleotides: 5′-GCGTGGTAGATGGACGTTTT-3′, 5′-GTATCTGGATGCTCGCACAG-3′, and 5′-CTGGACGACATAGTGCGCTA-3′. These corresponded to the nucleotides 1996–2015, 579–598, and 715–734 of the sequences of natriuretic receptor subtypes A, B, and C, respectively. Membranes were washed three times at 42 °C for 20 min in 1× SSC buffer containing 0.1% SDS. Signals were detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) (exposure time from 2 h to overnight). In parallel, PCR products were subcloned into PCR2.1 vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced to confirm their identity. RT-PCR was performed on RNA from Neuro2a cells and NG108 cells and positive control such as mouse brain and mouse embryonic neural tube after DNase treatment (DNA-freeTMkit; Ambion). The same RT-PCR conditions were used as those used to obtain the hybridization probes from mouse kidney (see above). Southern analysis of one-fifth of the PCR products utilized32P-labeled oligonucleotides internal to the PCR primers (i.e. the same as those used above to validate the cDNA probes used on Northern blots). Another fraction of the PCR products was subcloned and sequenced. In subsequent experiments, we designed several additional sets of primers covering nearly the entire NPR-C mRNA sequence (Fig. 11,top panel). These primers corresponded to highly conserved regions between mouse, human, bovine, and eel NPRC sequences. These primers, named OPRCX1+ (5′-TGAGGACAGCG AAACCTGAGTT-3′), OPRCX2+ (5′-ATGTTTGTTGAAGGATTCCA-3′), OPRCX1− (5′-GCAGATTCTTCTAGGCCAC-3′), and OPRCX2− (5′-TTCTTCCTGAAAAGTAGAAGGC-3′), corresponded to the mouse sequences 959–980, 1051–1070, 1434–1415, and 1505–1483, respectively. Amplifications with these latter primer sets were carried out for 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 40 s), annealing (50–52 °C, 45 s), and extension (72 °C, 45 s). PCR products were subjected to Southern analysis as described above, using the following 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides: OMPRC2+ (for the set OMPRC1+/OMPRC3−) and OPRCX4+ for the other amplifications (5′-CGAATGTCAAATATCCTTGGGG-3′, corresponding to the mouse sequence 1322–1343). These oligonucleotide probes corresponded to NPRC sequences between the individual sets of PCR primers. After hybridization, three rinses were performed using a low stringency buffer (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 40 °C. Signals were detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) (exposure time from 2 h to overnight). Thymidine incorporation was determined during the four final hours of a 5-h period of peptide treatment. These studies revealed that natriuretic peptides modulated proliferation in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested. Natriuretic peptides stimulated NG108 growth dose-dependently (Fig.1 A). Proliferation was significantly stimulated by ANP at 0.1 nm and reached a nearly maximum 33% increase in proliferation at 10 nm. CNP also stimulated the growth of these cells, although less potently. In contrast, the NPR-C-selective analog desANP4–23 (29Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A. Lewicki J.A. Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) had no effect on NG108 cells. In all other neuroblastoma cell lines, a biphasic action of ANP and CNP was observed (Fig. 1, B–D). ANP and CNP slightly but significantly stimulated proliferation in all of these cell lines at subnanomolar concentrations but inhibited cell proliferation at higher doses. Treatment with desANP4–23did not stimulate proliferation at any concentration but inhibited growth beginning at 0.1 nm. Stimulatory and inhibitory effects of natriuretic peptides were unaffected by o-phenanthroline and bacitracin (data not shown), which have been shown to potently inhibit endopeptidase activities that cleave natriuretic peptides in other neuroblastoma cells (28Delporte C. Winand J. Poloczek P. Von Geldern T. Christophe J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This indicates that the actions of natriuretic analogs were not likely to be due to degradation products. To obtain information regarding the signaling pathways used by natriuretic peptides to control cell proliferation, peptide actions were studied in the presence and absence of various protein kinase inhibitors. NG108 and Neuro2a cells were selected for these studies. To determine the role of cGMP signaling, cells were pretreated with Rp-8-pCTP-cGMPS (20 μm), a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor (34Zhuo M. Hu Y. Schultz C. Kandel E.R. Hawkins R.D. Nature. 1994; 368: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Stimulatory effects of natriuretic peptides in both cell lines were completely blocked by Rp-8-pCTP-cGMPS (Fig.2, A and B). In Neuro2a cells, blockade of this stimulation revealed more potent and pronounced growth inhibitory effects of ANP and CNP (Fig. 2 B versus Fig. 1 D). In contrast to the PKG inhibitor, the MEK1/2 kinase inhibitor PD98059 (35Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar) did not block the induction of proliferation by ANP or CNP, although it significantly decreased the basal rate of proliferation of NG108 cells at the concentration of 20 μm (Fig.3 A). The same was true in Neuro2a cells (Fig. 3 B). Growth-inhibitory actions of higher doses of ANP, CNP, and desANP4–23 in Neuro2a cells were no longer observed in the presence of PD98059. Thus, the antiproliferative actions of natriuretic peptides appeared to require basal activity of a MEK1/2 pathway. Inhibitors of protein kinase A (H89, 20 μm) (36Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PKC (GF109203X, 10 μm) (37Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not significantly alter the inhibitory actions of any of the natriuretic analogs tested (data not shown). One possible explanation for the inhibitory actions of high concentrations of ANP and CNP in SK-N-SH subclones and Neuro2a cells is that NPR-A and/or NPR-B switch from GC activation to MAP kinase inhibition when presented with higher concentrations of ligands and thereby inhibit proliferation. To determine if both effects were mediated by NPR-A and/or NPR-B, DNA synthesis was determined in Neuro2a and NG108 cells incubated with natriuretic peptides in the presence or absence of the NPR-A/NPR-B-selective antagonist HS-142-1 (38Matsuda Y. Samson W.K. Levin E.R. Contemporary Endocrinology: Natriuretic Peptides in Health and Disease. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 289-307Google Scholar) (Fig.4). The stimulatory actions of the natriuretic peptides ANP and CNP on NG108 cells were antagonized by HS-142-1, confirming that the growth-stimulatory actions of natriuretic peptides were mediated by GC-coupled receptors (Fig. 4, Aand B). In contrast, the antiproliferative actions of ANP, CNP, and desANP4–23 in Neuro2a cells were unaffected by this drug (Fig. 4 C), indicating that the growth-inhibitory effects were probably not mediated by NPR-A or NPR-B. HS-142-1 (20 μg/ml), by itself, had a negligible effect on DNA synthesis in untreated Neuro2a and NG108 cells. To better delineate the dual actions of natriuretic peptides on Neuro2a cell proliferation, we measured natriuretic peptide-induced changes in intracellular levels of various second messengers. Changes in cGMP levels were measured in the presence of 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity. ANP and CNP potently triggered an approximate 6-fold increase of cGMP levels in Neuro2a cells, whereas desANP4–23 did not produce any measurable change (Fig.5). In agreement with the pharmacological results, these data suggested that ANP and CNP stimulated growth by a cGMP/PKG pathway, presumably via NPR-A and/or NPR-B. Alternatively, NPR-C (the only known receptor with which desANP4–23interacts) has been shown in some systems to couple to adenylyl cyclase modulation and calcium influx (9Hirata M. Chang C.H. Murad F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Sellitti D.F. Perrella G. Doi S.Q. Curcio F. Regul.

Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Thus, natriuretic peptide-induced changes in cAMP levels were measured in Neuro2a cells in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine with or without forskolin. None of the ANP analogs affected cAMP levels under these conditions (data not shown). Changes in intracellular calcium levels were measured in Neuro2a cells grown on glass coverslips, in response to 0.1, 10, or 20 nm concentrations of natriuretic peptides ANP, CNP, and desANP4–23. None of the natriuretic peptides induced changes in intracellular calcium levels (data not shown). In contrast, other neuropeptides (1 nm PACAP-38, 10 nmPACAP-27, or 20 nm VIP), used as internal positive controls, stimulated increases in intracellular calcium, presumably due to action of these peptides on the PACAP-preferring PAC1receptor in these cells (30Lelièvre V.

https://openalex.org/W1999895476,"The neurotransmitter glycine is removed from the synaptic cleft by two Na+-and Cl−-dependent transporters, the glial (GLYT1) and neuronal (GLYT2) glycine transporters. GLYT2 lacks a conserved cysteine in the first hydrophilic loop (EL1) that is reactive to [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) in related transporters. A chimeric GLYT2 (GLYT2a-EL1) that contains GLYT1 sequences in this region, including the relevant cysteine, was sensitive to the reagent, and its sensitivity was decreased by co-substrates. We combined cysteine-specific biotinylation to detect transporter-reagent interactions with MTSET inactivation assays and temperature dependence analysis to study the mechanism by which Cl−, Na+, and glycine reduce methanethiosulfonate reagent inhibition. We demonstrate a Na+ protective effect rather than an increased susceptibility to the reagent exerted by Li+, as reported for the serotonin transporter. The different inhibition, protection, and reactivation properties between GLYT2a-EL1 and serotonin transporter suggest that EL1 is a source of structural heterogeneity involved in the specific effect of lithium on serotonin transport. The protection by Na+ or Cl− on GLYT2a-EL1 was clearly dependent on temperature, suggesting that EL1 is not involved in ion binding but is subjected to ion-induced conformational changes. Na+ and Cl− were required for glycine protection, indicating the necessity of prior ion interaction with the transporter for the binding of glycine. We conclude that EL1 acts as a fluctuating hinge undergoing sequential conformational changes during the transport cycle.

The different inhibition, protection, and reactivation properties between GLYT2a-EL1 and serotonin transporter suggest that EL1 is a source of structural heterogeneity involved in the specific effect of lithium on serotonin transport. The protection by Na+ or Cl− on GLYT2a-EL1 was clearly dependent on temperature, suggesting that EL1 is not involved in ion binding but is subjected to ion-induced conformational changes. Na+ and Cl− were required for glycine protection, indicating the necessity of prior ion interaction with the transporter for the binding of glycine. We conclude that EL1 acts as a fluctuating hinge undergoing sequential conformational changes during the transport cycle. serotonin transporter Na+- and Cl−-dependent neutral and cationic amino acid transporter B0+ extracellular loop 1 γ-aminobutyric acid transporter 1 glycine transporters 1 and 2 HEPES-buffered saline methanethiosulfonate 2-aminoethyl-MTS [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-MTS sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate N-methyl-d-glucamine The role of glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and the brain stem of vertebrates is well established. There, it participates in the processing of motor and sensory information involved in several functions like movement, vision, and audition (1Werman R. Davidoff R.A. Aprison M.H. Nature. 1967; 214: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Additionally, glycine exerts a positive modulation on the action of glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, through postsynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. The re-uptake of glycine into presynaptic nerve terminals or surrounding glial processes plays a major role in the maintenance of low synaptic levels of the transmitter (2Iversen L.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1971; 41: 571-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 3Kanner B.I. Shuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Glycine uptake is mediated by specific Na+-and Cl−-dependent transporters that are members of the neurotransmitter transporter family (4Amara S.G. Kuhar J. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 1992; 13: 421-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A new role for the glycine transporters as targets for future therapeutic drugs is now emerging. It has been demonstrated that hypofunction of glutamatergic (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated) neurotransmission is involved in symptoms of schizophrenia (12Tsai G. Yang P. Chung L.C. Lange N. Coyle J.T. Biol. Psychiatry. 1998; 44: 1081-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Because glycine is required for glutamate activation ofN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, this hypofunction could be relieved by inhibiting glycine transporters in the receptor surroundings. It is also likely that a decrease in the glycinergic inputs is involved in pathologies of the muscle tone regulation (13Simpson Jr., R.K. Gondo M. Robertson C.S. Goodman J.C. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, compounds able to potentiate glycinergic neurotransmission by inhibition of glycine re-uptake may find applications in the treatment of psychiatric diseases and spasticity. Glycine transporters are encoded by two genes (glyt1 andglyt2) that produce several alternative isoforms (14Guastella J. Brecha N. Weigmann C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the absence of three-dimensional information of the glycine transporters, a structure-function relationship can be obtained from site-directed mutagenesis approaches on different members of the family, taking advantage of the homology between these proteins. Previous work on related dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GAT-1), and serotonin (SERT)1transporters identify amino acid residues that may be critical for the transport function. These amino acids are located in the first (26Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently shown that Tyr-289 in the third transmembrane domain of GLYT2 plays an essential role in the mechanism of transport (35Ponce J. Biton B. Benavides J. Avenet P. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13856-13862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thus confirming the relevance of the NH2-terminal third of these transporters for their transport activity. Lately, we have focused our studies on the functional involvement of other structural domains contained in this region, the hydrophilic loop connecting transmembrane domain 1 and transmembrane domain 2. This loop seems to be externally located according to the recently confirmed original topology for this transporter family (36Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of EL1 in the Na+- and Cl−-dependent transporter superfamily shows that GLYT2, proline transporter (37Fremeau Jr., R.T. Caron M.G. Blakely R.D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and ATBo+ (38Sloan J.L. Mager S. J. Biol.

Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and SERT (40Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as a primary target for the membrane-impermeant MTS reagents. By using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method and electrophysiological techniques, we have also shown that the reactivity to MTS reagents is mainly due to the cysteine present in EL1 (positions 62 of GLYT1, homologous to 223 of GLYT2) (41Roux M.J. Martı́nez-Maza R. Le Goff A. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. Supplisson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17699-17705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the work reported here, we have extended these studies by further investigating, using biochemical methods, the dynamic properties of the EL1 domain of GLYT2. Cysteine-specific biotinylation of GLYT2 wild type and a chimera containing the EL1 region of GLYT1 under the GLYT2a context (GLYT2a-EL1) was compared, and functional consequences were assessed by glycine uptake assays. We demonstrate that the decrease of EL1 accessibility to aqueous external medium and of the rate of reaction by membrane-impermeant MTS reagents produced by the substrates Na+, Cl−, and glycine, is promoted by cosubstrate-induced sequential conformational rearrangements during the transport cycle. Thus, the GLYT2a 223 position is not involved in the direct binding of ions, but the loop in which this residue is located may act as a hinge, showing different degrees of exposure during substrate binding and translocation. GLYT2a-EL1 chimeric transporter was created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For the modifications, the primer (5′-AGGTTTCCCTACCTGTGCTATCGCAACGGGGGAGGTGCT-3′) was used together with an antisense primer (5′-CCTCCCCCGTTGCGATAGCACAGGTAGGGAAACCTC-3′). The mutated region was subcloned into a plasmid containing the wild type GLYT2a cDNA by using flanking restriction sites and was sequenced to ensure that unwanted modifications were not introduced. Individual replacement of GLYT2a Ala223 by Cys to construct the A223C point mutant was performed using a modification of the method of Higuchi (42Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar) as de- scribed (9Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild type cDNAs were subcloned downstream the cytomegalovirus promoter of pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS 7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient expression in COS 7 cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the procedure indicated by the supplier. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and then used for modification and/or transport assays. Transport assays in transfected COS 7 cells were performed at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm Ca2Cl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose) as previously described (10Martı́nez-Maza R. Poyatos I. López-Corcuera B. Núñez E. Giménez C. Zafra F. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2168-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for the indicated times in 0.3 ml of an uptake solution that contained an isotopic dilution of3H-labeled glycine (1.6 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the former solution, yielding a 10 μmfinal glycine concentration. Kinetics for glycine were performed by varying glycine concentrations from 1 to 1000 μm. For the experiments of Na+ and Cl− dependence of glycine transport, NaCl in HBS was isotonically replaced by the indicated salt to obtain the desired Na+ or Cl− concentrations. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic reagent MTSET (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto, Canada) was used for irreversible, covalent modification of cysteine residues. The day before the experiment, transfected or mock-transfected COS 7 cells were plated at 30% confluency (72,000 cells/well) on polylysine-covered 24-well plates. The next day, cells were washed with 1 ml of HBS solution or HBS in which NaCl was isotonically replaced by the indicated salt. In protection experiments, protecting agents were added to this solution. After washing, each well was preincubated at room temperature (22 °C, unless indicated in the figure legends) with 300 μl of the former medium containing the indicated concentrations of the MTSET reagent. After a 6- or 10-min incubation (as specified in the figure legends), the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with 1 ml of the former solution and at least twice with 1 ml of HBS at the desired temperature and immediately assayed for [3H]glycine transport as described above. For the reactivation experiments, a 10-min incubation in the indicated medium was performed after the post-MTSET washing and before the transport assay. MTSET was dissolved in water as a 100 mmstock solution and was always freshly prepared immediately prior to use. Thiol-specific biotinylation of GLYT2a and GLYT2a-EL1 chimera was performed by reaction with the biotinylating reagent MTSEA-biotin (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.). COS 7 cells were grown in 12-well plates and transfected as described above. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with 1.0 ml/well of HBS or HBS containing the desired replacing salt (see the paragraph above) at the indicated temperature. In protection experiments, protecting agents were added to this solution. This was followed by a 6- or 10-min incubation with MTSEA-biotin (2 mm stock solution, dissolved in water immediately before use) in the desired HBS medium at the concentration and temperature indicated in the figure legends. After washing three times with 1 ml of the same solution, cells were scraped in 0.6 ml of 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.004 mm pepstatin, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed (equal amounts of total proteins from each well) using SDS lysis solution (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.004 mm pepstatin, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min on ice. Biotinylated proteins were recovered by overnight incubation with 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads/sample (Sigma) at 4 °C in an end-over-end shaker. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 100 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.004% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 80 °C. Aliquots of each sample were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose for Western blotting (24López-Corcuera B. Martı́nez-Maza R. Núñez E. Roux M. Supplisson S. Aragón C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized with the ECL detection method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified on a model 300A densitometer in combination with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) by using film exposures that were in the linear range. Standard errors in biotinylation studies were calculated after densitometry from at least three separate experiments. MTSEA-biotinylated samples were compared with NHS-SS-biotinylated samples. Sulfo-N-succinimidyl-6-biotinamidohexanoate (2 mg/ml, Pierce) was used to detect the total surface expression of each transporter as described (44Geerlings A. Núñez E. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17584-17590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Non-linear regression fits of experimental data were performed with ORIGIN (Microcal Software, Northamton, MA). The effect of MTSET on uptake is expressed as either the percent of inhibition (PI = 100 − (100 × uptake after/uptake before)) or the fraction of uptake remaining (F = 100 × uptake after/uptake before). F was plotted as a function of concentration of MTSET in molar, and the data were fitted to a first order exponential decay equation (F =Fmin + Fmax ×e exp(−kct)). The resulting 1st order apparent rate constant was divided by the incubation time in s to give the second order apparent rate constants (k) shown. In experiments studying the dependence on Na+, Cl−, or glycine, data were fitted to the Hill equation using non-linear regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed on transport data from at least three experiments. We showed previously that GLYT1b contains a reactive cysteine residue, Cys-62, in the first external loop (EL1) that is homologous to Ala-223 in GLYT2a. The construction of a chimeric transporter GLYT1b-GLYT2a in which the EL1 region of GLYT1b containing the reactive cysteine (sequence CYR), was exchanged by the homologous sequence (AFQ) of GLYT2a on the GLYT2a transporter (GLYT2a-EL1, Fig.1 A), yields a fully active chimeric transporter that is sensitive to externally exposed MTS reagents (41Roux M.J. Martı́nez-Maza R. Le Goff A. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. Supplisson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17699-17705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Blot in Fig. 1 B shows the cysteine-specific biotinylation of cells expressing GLYT2a-EL1 compared with those expressing wild type GLYT2a. The MTSEA-biotin reacts with externally exposed cysteine residues to attach a covalent biotin tag that can be detected by the capture of the transporter, after cell solubilization, on streptavidin-coupled beads followed by Western blot with GLYT2-specific antibodies. The cell surface form of the transporter appears as a band migrating at ∼97 kDa. For GLYT2a this band was not labeled with 0.1 mm MTSEA-biotin, but for GLYT2a-EL1, the labeling was maximum when it was performed in lithium acetate medium, reduced in the presence of NaCl, and further decreased by a saturating concentration of glycine. Thus, it seems that the maximum MTSEA-biotin labeling corresponds to the unoccupied state of the transporter. Note that a 60-kDa band corresponding to the immature transporter was labeled in lithium acetate. This is consistent with a limited access of the reagent to the inside of the cell that tags the improperly folded immature protein. Wild type GLYT2a was not MTSEA-biotin-labeled in any condition despite the fact that its membrane expression was similar to that of GLYT2a-EL1, as assessed by reaction with the extracellular cell surface marker NHS-SS-biotin, which targets primary amines instead of cysteines (Fig. 1 B, Total). Direct physical detection of MTSEA-biotin reaction and functional effects of MTSET treatment on transport by GLYT2a-EL1 were totally consistent. Thus, a reduction of the MTSET-induced transporter inactivation by NaCl and a further decrease of its inhibition exerted by glycine in NaCl medium was observed (see “Results”). The ability of NaCl to reduce the inhibition caused by MTSET on the transport activity by GLYT2a-EL1 was further studied by performing two sets of experiments. Fig.2 A depicts a dose-response curve showing the decrease of glycine transport by COS 7 cells expressing GLYT2a-EL1 as a function of MTSET concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 mm. As expected, MTSET had a significantly greater effect on transport in the absence of Na+ and Cl− (lithium acetate medium (LiAc)). The apparent second-order rate constant (k) for the MTSET reaction increased 12-fold (kNaCl = 0.667 ± 0.07m−1 s−1, andkLiAc = 8.3 ± 0.92m−1 s−1), and the concentration of MTSET that resulted in a 50% inhibition of the transport activity was decreased from 1 to ∼0.1 mm. These observations were confirmed by the results of reactivation experiments, where the ability of externally applied free cysteine to reduce the disulfide bond formed between the transporter Cys-223 and MTSET to the active thiol form, was tested. The results shown in Fig. 2 B demonstrate that the relief of the MTSET inhibitory effect was only possible when the reactivation reaction was performed in lithium acetate medium, where ∼70% activity (75 ± 8.6%) could be recovered. However, when the Cys-223-modified transporter was incubated in NaCl medium, external thiols such as cysteine or dithiothreitol were unable to reactivate the GLYT2a-EL1 (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Spontaneous recovery of activity in the absence of added external thiols was not observed after 60 min of MTSET reaction (data not shown). These results may indicate that upon Na+ and Cl− binding to the transporter, the region where Cys-223 resides is sterically hindered, decreasing the accessibility of Cys either to disulfide bond formation (as showed in Fig. 1) and, once established, also for its reduction from outside the cell. However, data shown on Fig. 2 could also be explained by an increase in Cys-223 accessibility produced in the lithium acetate medium. In fact, a lithium-induced conformational change that exposes the equivalent cysteine in SERT (Cys-109) and, therefore, increases its MTSET reactivity has been recently reported (45Ni Y.G. Chen J.G. Androutsellis-Theotokis H. Moczydlowski E. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30942-30947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate the selectivity of the NaCl effect, we tested the ability of other replacing salts during the MTSET treatment to reduce the inhibition caused by the reagent on the GLYT2a-EL1 activity. TableI shows that only in the presence of NaCl, there is no inhibition caused by 0.3 mm MTSET, indicating that this effect is a specific NaCl protection and not a lithium-enhanced MTSET inhibition. Additionally, data shown on Table Ireveal that the NaCl protective effect requires the simultaneous presence of Na+ and Cl−, because the protection does not take place when Na+ or Cl−are, respectively, replaced by other cations or anions. Only SCN−, a more permeant anion that can partially drive the glycine transport by GLYT2a-EL1, is able to increase its remaining activity after the MTSET treatment.Table IIon dependence of MTSET inactivation of GLYT2a-EL1Replacing saltRemaining activitypercent of controlCation substitution NaCl98.4 ± 8.3 LiCl18.6 ± 2.1 KCl29.1 ± 3.5 RbCl24.9 ± 5.0 CsCl19.5 ± 3.6 Choline chloride30.7 ± 4.2 NMDG chloride21.4 ± 4.5Anion substitution NaNO331.3 ± 3.6 NaSCN50.8 ± 6.2 Sodium acetate19.7 ± 6.5 Na2SO433.4 ± 4.2 Sodium gluconate32.6 ± 2.8Cells expressing GLYT2a-EL1 were treated without or with 0.5 mm MTSET for 6 min in HBS or HBS in which the NaCl was replaced by the indicated salts.

Data are the means ± S.E. of at least three determinations. NaCl control value was 3.12 ± 0.32 nmol of glycine/mg of protein/6 min. Open table in a new tab Cells expressing GLYT2a-EL1 were treated without or with 0.5 mm MTSET for 6 min in HBS or HBS in which the NaCl was replaced by the indicated salts. After this incubation, cells were washed with HBS and assayed for glycine transport as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For every ionic condition, the results are expressed as percent of remaining activity relative to each control value. Data are the means ± S.E. of at least three determinations. NaCl control value was 3.12 ± 0.32 nmol of glycine/mg of protein/6 min. In NaCl medium, glycine exerts an additional protection of GLYT2a-EL1 labeling by MTSEA-biotin (see Fig. 1 B). To determine if the substrate protection also requires the two transport-driving ions, we performed 0.1 mm MTSEA-biotin labeling (Fig.3 A) as well as transport measurements after 1 mm MTSET treatment (Fig.3 B) in the presence or absence of glycine in different ionic conditions. As shown, in order for glycine to exert its protective effect, the co-substrates Na+ and Cl− have to be simultaneously present, because there is no protection in lithium acetate medium, sodium acetate, or lithium chloride media. Because the Cys-223 reacts much faster in the absence of NaCl and the MTS derivative concentration used in these experiments could represent a tremendous excess of reagent, one possibility is that the reversible binding of glycine was unable to protect against the irreversible reaction of MTS reagents at saturating concentrations. To overcome this problem, we chose non-saturating MTSET concentrations (0.05–0.5 mm range) and a saturating glycine concentration (1 mm) and repeated the experiment shown on Fig. 3 Bin lithium acetate. Also, under these conditions glycine was unable to protect against the inhibition (data not shown). Wild type GLYT2a was equally insensitive to MTS reagents in every condition assayed, suggesting that there were no changes in the accessibility of endogenous cysteine residues. The protection by glycine was specific, because compounds that are not substrates for the transporter such as l-proline, γ-aminobutyric acid, or d-glucose did not protect. Moreover, the structural analog of glycine, sarcosine (N-methylglycine), which is a substrate of GLYT1 but not of GLYT2, was unable to protect GLYT2a-EL1 against MTSET inhibition (Fig.4).

(Peripherin/rds is also known as photoreceptor peripherin, peripherin/rds, rds/peripherin, rds, and peripherin-2.) Peripherin/rds appears to act as a structural element in outer segment architecture.

This report initiates a systematic investigation of protein domain structure and function by examining the molecular and cellular consequences of a series of 14 insertional mutations distributed throughout the polypeptide sequence. Protein expression, disulfide bonding, sedimentation velocity, and subcellular localization of the COS-1 cell-expressed mutant variants were examined to test the hypothesis that protein folding and tetrameric subunit assembly are mediated primarily by EC2, a conserved extracellular/intradiskal domain. Protein folding and tetrameric subunit assembly were not affected by insertion of either an uncharged dipeptide (GA) or a highly charged hendecapeptide (GDYKDDDDKAA) into any one of nine sites residing outside of EC2 as assayed by nonreducing Western blot analysis, sedimentation velocity, and subcellular localization. In contrast, insertions at five positions within the EC2 domain did cause either gross protein misfolding (two sites) or a reduction in protein sedimentation coefficient (two sites) or both (one site). These results indicate that although the vast majority of extramembranous polypeptide sequence makes no measurable contribution to protein folding and tetramerization, discrete regions within the EC2 domain do contain determinants for normal subunit assembly.

The OS is an architecturally complex organelle. It contains hundreds of precisely stacked membranous disks that undergo a polarized renewal process; a complete turnover of OS membrane protein occurs approximately once every 10 days in primate rod cells (1Young R.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1976; 15: 700-725PubMed Google Scholar). Although the renewal process and OS stability are essential for photoreceptor viability, their underlying molecular bases remain largely undefined. Evidence from several laboratories has implicated the integral membrane protein peripherin/rds in OS morphogenesis and the renewal process (2Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar, 3Travis G.H. Brennan M.B. Danielson P.E. Kozak C.A. Sutcliffe J.G. Nature. 1989; 338: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Sanyal S. Jansen H.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1981; 21: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is present in all vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors examined to date and causes a variety of progressive retinal diseases in humans when defective (5Kohl S. Giddings I. Besch D. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Zrenner E. Wissinger B. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1998; 162: 75-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite continued interest and study, neither the normal molecular action of peripherin/rds in OS renewal nor its role in the pathophysiology of retinal disease is well understood. Several suggestions for molecular function have been proposed based largely on the molecular genetic identification of peripherin/rds as the primary trigger for the murine retinal degeneration slow (rds) phenotype and the immunochemical localization of this protein to rod and cone OS disc rim regions (6Arikawa K. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. Williams D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Travis G.H. Groshan K.R. Lloyd M. Bok D.

Proposals for function include stabilization of the highly curved disc rims, maintenance of flattened disc structure through adhesive interactions, morphogenesis of disc membranes/rim regions, catalysis of disc shedding, and/or scaffolding of disc stacks (2Molday R.S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The recent finding that OS morphogenesis as well as photoreceptor function can be rescued in postnatal (10-day-old) rds mice reinforces the notion that this protein is a building block for the normally continuous OS renewal process (12Ali R.R. Sarra G.M. Stephens C. Alwis M.D. Bainbridge J.W. Munro P.M. Fauser S. Reichel M.B. Kinnon C. Hunt D.M. Bhattacharya S.S. Thrasher A.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, the reported flattening of canine pancreatic microsomes by peripherin/rds in vitro is consistent with a direct role in OS structure (13Wrigley J.D. Ahmed T. Nevett C.L. Findlay J.B. J.

The cloning and identification of nearly a dozen highly conserved peripherin/rds orthologs (from humans to fish) has suggested that the proteins share several distinctive features, including four hydrophobic transmembrane segments, a large extracellular/intradiskal loop domain (EC2), seven conserved cysteine residues, and a covalently attached carbohydrate moiety (3Travis G.H.

Hydrodynamic studies performed under reducing conditions indicate that WT peripherin/rds polypeptides can self-assemble to form homotetramers and also can co-assemble with rom-1 (a homologous polypeptide) to form heterotetramers (10Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The noncovalently associated tetramers can join via disulfide bonds to generate larger polymers of indeterminate size; polymerization appears to be mediated by a single conserved cysteine residue in peripherin/rds and inhibited by the presence of rom-1 (24Goldberg A.F. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although tetramerization and polymerization are believed integral for function, their place in the mechanism of peripherin/rds action has yet to be established. Because OS formation is observed in the complete absence of rom-1 (26Clarke G. Goldberg A.F. Vidgen D. Collins L. Ploder L. Schwarz L. Molday L.L. Rossant J. Szel A. Molday R.S. Birch D.G. McInnes R.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), peripherin/rds-containing tetramers appear to be the essential units of function for OS morphogenesis. Several instances of inherited retinal degeneration have been associated with the disruption of peripherin/rds folding and subunit assembly, yet other cases do not appear to impact these processes at all (24Goldberg A.F. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Such observations of discrete (versus global) disruptions caused by missense mutations has led us to question whether partial loss-of-function defects may account for some of the phenotypic heterogeneity characteristic of peripherin/rds-associated retinal diseases. To improve our understanding of protein domain structure and function, we have initiated an insertional mutagenesis approach similar to one taken previously for rhodopsin (28Borjigin J. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14715-14722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This report provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that the EC2 domain is particularly important for proper folding and subunit assembly of peripherin/rds. A series of 14 Phase I insertion mutants, each containing a unique Nar I endonuclease restriction site (5′-GGCGCC-3′), was constructed using subcloned regions of the WT peripherin/rds sequence as templates, synthetic oligonucleotide primers (TableI), and methods described previously (29Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 671-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of designed, and absence of spurious, mutations was confirmed by complete (single-stranded) DNA sequencing using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing cycle kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Mutagenized regions were returned to a WT peripherin/rds expression vector background by subcloning, and final constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping. Each Phase I mutation introduces a dipeptide (GA) into the WT protein sequence at the indicated position (see Fig.1).Table ISynthetic oligonuclueotides used for Phase I mutagenesisSynthetic oligonucleotide primers (shown) were employed to create 14 Phase I insertion mutants using a WT peripherin/rds template; each contains a unique Nar I endonuclease restriction site (underlined).

BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) flanked by Nar I sticky ends (sense, 5′-CGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGGC-3′; antisense, 5′-CGGCCTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGT-3′) into the Phase I mutants described. The presence, copy number, and orientation of the FLAG cassette were determined by DNA sequencing with a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Each of the Phase II mutants contains a nonapeptide insertion encoding a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDKA) at the indicated position within the Phase I mutant sequences (see Fig.1). Anti-peripherin/rds monoclonal antibody C6 was a kind gift of Dr. John Saari and Dr. Krzysztof Palczewski of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Washington. Anti-rom-1 polyclonal antibody MUTT was generated by immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with an affinity-purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. The coding sequence for the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of bovine rom-1 was amplified from a λGT-11 bovine retinal library and then cloned in-frame into the pGEX-2T expression vector. Bacterial fusion protein expression and affinity purification were performed essentially as described (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Each antibody was characterized with respect to its specificity in Western blot analyses using authentic proteins from rod outer segment membranes, and recombinant proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells; no cross-reactivity was observed. The anti-peripherin/rds monoclonal antibody (MAb) C6 epitope was mapped using a series of synthetic peptides kindly provided by Dr. Kathleen Boesze-Battaglia, and it was found to reside within 15 amino acids of the full-length protein C terminus. It was not expected to be affected by any of the mutations examined in this report. Peptide competition was also used to confirm MAb C6 specificity for other immunochemical procedures, including immunofluorescence localization and immunoprecipitation studies not reported here. COS-1 cells (∼1 × 106/100-mm dish) were transfected with the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics Co.) and 8 μg of the indicated expression plasmid essentially as suggested by the manufacturer. Detergent extracts were prepared using 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline at 48 h post-transfection essentially as described (30Chubet R.G. Brizzard B.L. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Methods for Western blot analysis of recombinant peripherin/rds expression and disulfide bonding have been reported previously (23Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells (∼3 × 104/4-cm2 slide chamber) were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics Co.) and 1 μg of the indicated expression plasmid essentially as suggested by the manufacturer. Cells were fixed briefly with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and processed using MAb C6 and a secondary anti-mouse IgG covalently labeled with the Cy3 fluorophore (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) essentially as described (23Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Images were collected with a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with an epi-fluorescent illuminator and a SPOT RT digital imaging system (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., v3.0 software). S20, w estimates were made in a Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge using a TLA-55 rotor or in a Sorvall RC-M120EX centrifuge using an RP55-S rotor as described (29Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 671-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. Sucrose gradient fractions (2.1-ml) were collected by piercing tube bottoms in an offset fashion; particulate fractions were obtained by resealing punctured centrifuge tubes with laboratory film, adding 90 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer and vortexing vigorously. Digital analysis of chemiluminescent Western blots was performed using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Total peripherin/rds reactivity was calculated by pixel summation over soluble and particulate fractions. Regions of peripherin/rds consensus sequence predicted to form hydrophilic domains were evaluated for their tendency to form polypeptide secondary structure, and 14 sites within regions lacking strongly predicted structural motifs were identified (Fig.1). A series of 14 Phase I mutants, each containing a unique Nar I endonuclease restriction site, were constructed using synthetic oligonucleotides and the polymerase chain reaction. These mutations were designed to produce minimal perturbation to protein structure as they add only two relatively small, uncharged amino acids (GA) to the WT sequence. An additional series of 14 Phase II mutants, expected to be more highly disruptive, was constructed by ligation of a single copy FLAG epitope cassette (coding for a nonapeptide, DYKDDDDKA) into the Nar I site of each Phase I mutant. Each of the 28 mutant expression plasmids was transfected individually into COS-1 cells in culture. Protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-peripherin/rds MAb C6. This reagent is useful as a measure of full-length protein expression because it recognizes a 15-amino acid epitope at the C terminus of peripherin/rds. Although none of the insertional mutations interrupt or lie immediately adjacent to the MAb C6 epitope, it was not known a priori whether the antibody would react with all mutants. In fact, expression of each of the 14 Phase I mutants is detected by MAb C6 in COS-1 cells. Similar to WT peripherin/rds, the mutants typically migrate as closely spaced doublets under denaturing and reducing conditions (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, peripherin/rds reactivity is also observed in extracts from COS-1 cells transfected with each of the 14 Phase II mutants (Fig.2 B). The Phase II mutants migrate somewhat more slowly than the WT protein and show a greater variation in electrophoretic mobility. The added mass and charge of the FLAG epitope insertion, heterogeneous post-translational modification, and/or residual secondary structure may be responsible for the observed differences. Identical results were obtained when Phase II mutant expression was assayed by probing Western blots with the anti-FLAG MAb M2 (not shown). Although we expected that the relatively large insertions introduced into the Phase II mutants might cause degradation and absent or reduced protein expression, reproducible differences in expression levels between the Phase I and Phase II mutants were not observed. These results demonstrate that neither minor (uncharged dipeptide) nor more major (charged hendecapeptide) insertions at any of 14 sites distributed throughout the primary sequence prevent peripherin/rds protein expression in COS-1 cells. WT peripherin/rds is extracted from vertebrate retina and COS-1 cells both as monomeric and disulfide-bonded dimeric forms, as assayed by nonreducing Western blot analysis. Abnormal disulfide bonding has been associated with several instances of human retinal disease. We therefore examined the mobility of each insertional mutant by Western analysis in the absence of added reducing agent. Eleven of the 14 Phase I mutants appear roughly similar to WT; they migrate primarily as both monomeric and dimeric forms (Fig.3 A). In contrast, three Phase I mutants (IM5, IM7, and IM11) show a banding pattern dissimilar from WT (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5, 7, and11). These mutants exhibit a strong tendency to form large aggregates that remain trapped in the stacking gel. Essentially identical results were obtained for the Phase II series of mutations (Fig. 3 B). The combined data indicate that neither Phase I nor Phase II mutations at any of 11 insertion sites prevents normal disulfide bonding but that a mutation at any one of three sites (IM5, IM7, or IM11) disrupts normal disulfide bonding and destabilizes protein structure. WT peripherin/rds is assembled as a tetrameric protein in both retinal photoreceptors and transfected COS-1 cells. Tetramerization appears to be essential for function as impaired subunit assembly has been linked to dysmorphic OSs in mice and several forms of retinal degeneration in humans (24Goldberg A.F. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have previously developed a reliable method for the assay of tetramer formation in COS-1 by characterizing protein sedimentation velocity (29Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 671-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and apply it here to determine whether any of the insertional mutations affect this process. Phase I and Phase II mutants were centrifuged through sucrose density gradients, and fractionated gradients were analyzed by Western blotting using MAb C6. This approach generated sedimentation profiles that fall into four main classes; raw data for particular Phase II mutants typical of each class are presented (Fig.4, B–E). A representative sedimentation profile for WT peripherin/rds is given for comparison (Fig. 4 A).

Mutants that were recovered from the particulate fraction are indicated (P). Neither Phase I nor Phase II insertional mutations affected velocity sedimentation profiles at most (9 of 14) sites, including IM1, IM2, IM3, IM4, IM6, IM9, IM12, IM13, and IM14. All were essentially indistinguishable from WT (Fig. 4, A and B and Table II). These sites are distributed throughout the polypeptide primary sequence (Fig. 1), and their lack of effect demonstrates that subregions within every predicted hydrophilic domain can tolerate both small (uncharged) and large (highly charged) insertional mutations without global disruption of WT structure. In contrast, either large or small insertions into any one of five sites, all contained within the EC2 domain, resulted in largely non-WT sedimentation behavior. Insertions into two sites, IM5 and IM7, caused increased sedimentation velocities and recovery of the aggregated mutants from the particulate fraction (Fig. 4 B and TableII). These effects illustrate sites at which insertional mutations sufficiently reduce protein structural stability to generate global misfolding. More interestingly, mutants at IM8 and IM10 sediment with a velocity substantially less than that of WT (Fig. 4 Dand Table II). Mutations at these sites result in sedimentation coefficients that are more characteristic of peripherin/rds dimers than tetramers, and they appear to disrupt normal subunit assembly without impairing protein folding. Finally, IM11 mutants revealed more complex and variable behavior than insertions in other sites (Fig.4 E). Phase I (IM11) insertions generated both grossly misfolded and WT species, in an approximately equal ratio, whereas Phase II (IM11) insertions produced variable amounts of aggregated protein and hydrodynamic species of variable (non-WT) mobility (Fig.4 E and Table II). In sum, these results demonstrate that insertional mutations at five of seven sites within EC2 cause measurable changes in protein structure; these insertions produced either global structural disruption (IM5 and IM7), altered subunit assembly (IM8 and IM10), or both (IM11). WT peripherin/rds expressed in COS-1 cells is retained largely within intracellular membranes; a previous study (23Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported a distinctly perinuclear subcellular distribution and suggested that the protein was localized within the Golgi apparatus. Our more recent co-localization studies utilize a Golgi-specific marker and support this interpretation. 2N. Khattree and A. Goldberg, unpublished observations. Because quality control mechanisms are known to prevent misfolded membrane proteins from exiting the endoplasmic reticulum and entering the Golgi apparatus (32Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), we speculated that mutations that alter peripherin/rds folding and subunit assembly might also affect its subcellular localization. We used immunofluorescence microscopy to examine whether insertions in EC2 that were disruptive for protein folding or assembly also affected subcellular localization. It should be noted that flu"

We also show that Bs1 has maintained a truncated gagdomain with similarity to the magellan gypsy-like long terminal repeat retrotransposon and a region that may correspond to an env-like domain. Our findings suggest that, like oncogenic retroviruses, the three transduced gene fragments and the Bs1 gag domain encode a fusion protein that has the potential to be expressed. We suggest that transduction by retroelements may facilitate the formation of novel hybrid genes in plants. The discovery that vertebrate retroviruses could transduce cellular sequences was central to cancer etiology and research. Although not well documented, transduction of cellular sequences by retroelements has been suggested to modify cellular functions.

We suggest that transduction by retroelements may facilitate the formation of novel hybrid genes in plants. long terminal repeat open reading frame base pair Retroelements comprise a diverse array of mobile elements that all share a common property, the copying of RNA into DNA during a step in their life cycle. Retroelements include endogenous retroviruses and class I transposable elements (i.e.LTR1 retrotransposons, long interspersed nuclear elements, short interspersed nuclear elements, and processed pseudogenes). Infectious retroviruses have been suggested to be highly evolved types of retroelements that acquired the ability to infect with the acquisition of an envelope (env) gene (1Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Eickbush T.H. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,2Temin H.M. Cell. 1980; 21: 599-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Alternatively, LTR retrotransposons may have evolved from an ancestral retrovirus through the loss of an env gene and hence the loss of infectivity (3Finnegan D.J. Nature. 1983; 302: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). copia-like LTR retrotransposons have recently been reported to be horizontally transmitted (4Jordan I.K. Matyunina L.V. McDonald J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12621-12625Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and some copia-like (5Laten H.M. Majumdar A. Gaucher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6897-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and gypsy-like (6Britten R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Kim A. Terzian C. Santamaria P. Pelisson A. Prud'Homme N. Bucheton A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 8Wright D.A. Voytas D.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 703-715PubMed Google Scholar) elements have been found to contain an env-like gene. Retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons thus share conserved structural, functional, and mechanistic features (9Boeke J.D. Stoye J.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1997: 343-435Google Scholar). The structural and sequence similarities between gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses led to the postulation that they are related evolutionarily (2Temin H.M. Cell. 1980; 21: 599-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 10Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Retroviruses have the potential to capture cellular genes, a process commonly known as cellular gene transduction. Cellular gene transduction by retroviruses has been fundamental in studying neoplastic transformation in animals (11Cooper G.M. Oncogenes. 2nd Ed. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Sudbury, MA1995: 21-65Google Scholar). Cellular gene-containing retroviruses were found to induce tumors in animals and transform cells in culture. This was central to the discovery of cellular genes with oncogenic potential (proto-oncogenes) (11Cooper G.M. Oncogenes. 2nd Ed. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Sudbury, MA1995: 21-65Google Scholar). Cellular gene transduction is not limited to retroviruses however. For example, the maize Bs1 retroelement was reported to have acquired a segment of a plasma membrane proton ATPase gene (pma) (12Bureau T.E. White S.E. Wessler S.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 479-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Jin Y.-K. Bennetzen J.L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Palmgren M.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This raised the question as to the significance of transduction for genomes in the absence of neoplastic transformation. The impact of retrotransposons on genome organization and function has been suggested (15Kazazian H.H.J. Moran J.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Li W.-H. Gu Z. Wang H. Nekrutenko A. Nature. 2001; 409: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). L1 and Alu sequences were found in many known proteins (16Li W.-H. Gu Z. Wang H. Nekrutenko A. Nature. 2001; 409: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and L1-mediated exon shuffling (by transduction) was shown to occur in an experimental system with cultured human cells and suggested to represent a general mechanism for the evolution of new genes (17Moran J.V. DeBerardinis R.J. Kazazian H.H.J. Science. 1999; 283: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The characterization of the human genome then revealed that transduction of 3′-flanking sequences is a common feature of L1 retrotransposition (18Goodier J.L. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although the human PMCH1 gene is believed to have evolved by exon shuffling through retrotransposition of an antisense transcript of the MCH gene (19Courseaux A. Nahon J.-L. Science. 2001; 291: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the evolution of a new gene by transduction of genomic sequences adjacent to an LTR retrotransposon has not been documented. Bs1 was identified as an insertion that inactivated the maize Adh1-S allele (20Johns M.A. Mottinger J. Freeling M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Mottinger J.P. Johns M.A. Freeling M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Subsequent cloning and characterization revealed that Bs1 is 3203 bp in length, has 302-bp identical LTRs that are terminated by the retroviral consensus terminal sequences TG … CA, and is immediately flanked by a 5-bp target site duplication (22Jin Y.-K. Bennetzen J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6235-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Johns M.A. Babcock M.S. Fuerstenberg S.M. Fuerstenberg S.I. Freeling M. Simpson R.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 12: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Other features that are common to retroelements include a canonical primer binding site that immediately follows the 5′-LTR and shares similarity with plant initiator methionyl-tRNA and a polypurine tract that precedes the 3′-LTR. Although the internal sequence of Bs1 potentially encodes two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2), convincing similarity to typical retroelement-encoded peptides has not been demonstrated (22Jin Y.-K. Bennetzen J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6235-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The finding that Bs1 has transduced a portion of a cellular gene (pma) suggested either that, like retroviruses, an LTR retrotransposon can transduce cellular genes or that Bs1 is actually a defective retrovirus (12Bureau T.E. White S.E. Wessler S.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 479-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Jin Y.-K. Bennetzen J.L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We report that the maize Bs1 retroelement has transduced segments from at least three different cellular genes. We show that most of the Bs1 internal sequence was replaced by the cellular gene sequences, which explains the lack of similarity to known retroelement proteins. Bs1, thus, remains the only clearly documented transduction event outside of the vertebrate retroviruses. Furthermore, Bs1 seems to have retained a truncated gag domain with similarity to the gypsy-like magellan LTR retrotransposon and a region that may correspond to an env-like gene. The transduction of multiple cellular gene segments by Bs1 seems to have generated a hybrid ORF that has the potential to be expressed. We discuss that this may be a general mechanism for the evolution of new genes. The entire Bs1 nucleotide sequence (GI 168648) and putative ORFs, ORF1 (GI 806301), ORF2 (GI 806303), and a short internal ORF (ORF3, GI 806302) that is spanned by ORF1, were used as queries inblast searches against GenBankTM (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71417) Google Scholar) (version 2.0, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). Exon and coding sequence predictions of c-bg and c-xe were performed using GENSCAN (genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Nucleotide sequence was translated into amino acid sequence using a modified version of the GDE translate program (bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/translate/) developed at the BioInformatics and Molecular Analysis Section of the National Institutes of Health. Sequence alignments were generated using the pileup program as part of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group suite of programs (version 10.0) and were further manipulated usinggenedoc (25Nicholas K.B. Nicholas H.B.J. Deerfield D.W.I. EMBNEW. News. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar). Zea maysssp. mays CV W22 germplasm was obtained from Susan Wessler (University of Georgia). Seedlings were grown under greenhouse conditions for 3 weeks, and genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (26Dellaporta S.L. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Malmberg R. Messing J. Sussex I. Molecular Biology of Plants: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1985: 36-37Google Scholar). To isolate the maize cellular genes for 1,3-β-glucanase (c-bg) and 1,4-β-xylan endohydrolase (c-xe), we made use of homologous sequences available in the data bases. For c-bg, the Bs1 sequence (GI 168648, position 917–1270) was conceptually translated and used as a query inblastp searches. Similar proteins were used in multiple alignments, and degenerate oligonucleotides were then designed following the codon usage for Z. mays(www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). These primers were then used in polymerase chain reactions. c-bg was amplified using a sense primer (BG21, 5′-GGTGAAGCT(G/C)TTCGAGGC(C/G)G-3′) that starts at codon number 21 of a hypothetical Arabidopsis BG protein (GI 5042412) and an antisense primer (BG1A, 5′-GGATCTGTATGGTGAAGTTGC-3′) that corresponds to the 3′ end of r-bg (GI 168648, position 1156–1176). Compared with the barley xe (GI 1813594), r-xe corresponds to a part of the 5′-untranslated region and a part of the amino terminus of the coding region. Thus, we chose a conserved region that spans the active site of the enzyme (27Banik M. Garrett T.P.J. Fincher G.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and that is located approximately in the middle of the protein to design the downstream primer (XEIV-1A, 5′-CATCTCGTTGTT(G/C/A)ACGTCGTAGTG-3′). For the upstream primer, we aligned the amino acid sequences of barley (GI 1718238) (27Banik M. Garrett T.P.J. Fincher G.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), wheat (GI 5306060) (28Sidhu P.K. Fincher G.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 685-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and two putative Arabidopsis XE proteins (GI 12321045 and GI 8979937) with the region corresponding to the predicted protein of r-xe(GI 168648, position 1463–1664) and designed primers that span the initiation codon (RXE1478S, 5′-CA(A/T)GGGCG(T/C)GTTCCG(G/C)C-3′). All polymerase chain reactions conditions and cloning of amplification products were as described previously (29Elrouby N. Bureau T.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed using a SequiTherm EXCEL II DNA sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies; Madison, WI) with a Li-Cor LongReader IR 4200 DNA sequencer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Previous characterization of Bs1 established lack of similarity to any known retroelement sequences (22Jin Y.-K. Bennetzen J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6235-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the wealth of new sequence information currently available prompted us to re-examine Bs1. We used the Bs1 nucleotide sequence (GI 168648) and previously identified ORFs (GI 806301-3) in extensive sequence similarity searches of the GenBankTM data base (May, 2001) (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71417) Google Scholar). This revealed that Bs1 contains several domains, each of which shares similarity to multiple entries in GenBankTM. The results are represented schematically in Fig. 1. The region immediately downstream from the Bs1 5′-LTR (position 303–890) corresponds to a truncated gag domain.tblastn searches using the Bs1 ORF1 as a query revealed similarity with the maize gypsy-like LTR retrotransposon magellan (Fig. 2) (GI 2343274; 30% identity and 58% similarity). blastx searches using the Bs1sequence as a query also reveals significant similarity (35% identity and 46% similarity) to the GAG protein of a Bombyx morinon-LTR retrotransposon (GI 4521268). Interestingly, the similarity of the Bs1 GAG domain extends to several viral capsid proteins (data not shown). For example, when the amino-terminal-most 180 residues of ORF1 were used in Position-specific Iteratedblast searches (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60210) Google Scholar), sequence similarity with turnip crinkle virus coat protein (GI 335196; 24% identity and 40% similarity) was observed. The Bs1 GAG region also shares similarity (29% identity and 46% similarity) with the 55-kDa protein of human adenovirus type 41 (GI 209892). In addition, the Bs1 GAG domain shares amino acid sequence similarity with many animal tropomyosins including the Xenopus non-muscle tropomyosin (GI 530992; 44% identity and 60% similarity). The significance of this result is unclear. blastx searches also revealed similarity between the Bs1 sequence (position 917–1270; frame +2) and several basic 1,3-β-glucanases (bg) (41–47% identity; 44–60% similarity). This observation suggests that this region corresponds to a portion of a maize 1,3-β-glucanase cellular gene (c-bg) that has been transduced by Bs1. The region corresponding to bg within Bs1 is referred to as retroelement bg (r-bg) (12Bureau T.E. White S.E. Wessler S.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 479-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). r-bg corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues 336–419 of a hypothetical Arabidopsis BG protein (GI 5042412) (Fig. 3). Although genes encoding 1,3-β-glucanases have been cloned from a wide range of plant and fungal species (including a maize cDNA that encodes acidic 1,3-β-glucanase (31Wu S. Kriz A.L. Widholm J.M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1709-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but shares no similarity to r-bg), a maize c-bg that contributed r-bg has not been characterized. In addition, several expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from both monocots (e.g. maize, rice, sorghum, and barley) and dicots (e.g. Arabidopsis and tomato) corresponding to 1,3-β-glucanases share no significant sequence similarity to r-bg. However, two sorghum ESTs (GI 6675471 and 9303089) were found to overlap and, when assembled, reconstitute a cDNA with 83% nucleotide sequence identity to r-bg. In addition, blastx searches uncovered similarity between Bs1 (position 1310–1664; frame +3) and 1,4-β-xylan endohydrolase (xe) from barley, wheat,Arabidopsis, and many fungi and bacteria. Relative to the barley xe isoenzyme X-II (GI 1718238), the transduced region of xe (r-xe) corresponds to amino acid residues 1–35 fused to residues 86–118, which suggested that r-xehas sustained a deletion of sequences coding for 51 amino acids (Fig. 3). As in the case of bg, a maize cellular gene (c-xe) that contributed r-xe was not found in our searches. Bs1 (position 1865–2521) shares similarity to a maize plasma membrane proton ATPase. A detailed description of r-pma and the identification of the maize c-pmahas been reported previously (12Bureau T.E. White S.E. Wessler S.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 479-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Jin Y.-K. Bennetzen J.L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Palmgren M.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons containing env-like genes, the env is always located at the 3′-most region of the internal sequence, i.e. downstream from poland just upstream from the 3′-LTR. blastx (position 2541–2853, frame +2) searches revealed similarity between the 3′-most region of the Bs1 internal sequence and members of a very large gene family that constitutes ∼1% of the Arabidopsisgenome (>200 members) (32Aubourg S. Boudet N. Kreis M. Lecharny A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Small I.D. Peeters N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 46-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first gene of this family to be characterized encodes a membrane-associated salt-inducible protein (GI 473873) (34Chang P.-F. Damsz B. Kononowicz A.K. Reuveni M. Chen Z. Xu Y. Hedges K. Tseng C.C. Singh N.K. Binzel M.L. Narasimhan M.L. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 98: 505-516Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Proteins encoded by this family do not share significant overall amino acid sequence similarity. However, they do share the presence of a degenerate 35-amino acid repeat called the “PPR repeat” (33Small I.D. Peeters N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 46-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Careful examination of the Bs1sequence revealed that the similarity with the PPR proteins is restricted to two tandem repeats of the PPR motif (Fig. 4). Data base searches using the Bs1 nucleotide sequence as a query revealed a maize EST (GI 7238199) with similarity to the Bs1 LTRs. The EST is 595 bp in length and was isolated from a Z. mays CV Ohio43 cDNA library of mixed stages of anther and pollen. The 5′-most 366 bp of this EST is nearly identical to the Bs1 sequence (99.5%; position 2834–3199). Specifically, the region of similarity begins 68 bp upstream of the start of the 3′-LTR to 4 bp upstream of the end of the 3′-LTR (Fig. 5). The corresponding region within the EST is followed by a poly(A) tract (18 bp). The putative Bs1polyadenylation signal is located 18 bp upstream of the poly(A) tract of the EST. The remaining portion of the EST (immediately downstream from the poly(A) tract) is identical to a part of another maize EST (GI 5005895) that corresponds to a gene encoding aminotransferase. Similarity with an EST (GI 7238199) suggests that Bs1 is possibly expressed. To establish direct evidence that the r-bg and r-xe domains of Bs1correspond to transduced portions of maize cellular genes, we cloned the maize c-bg and c-xe. Nucleotide sequence analysis suggests that c-bg contains two introns and three exons (Fig. 6). Sequence alignment of r-bg and c-bg (Fig. 6) indicates that they share ∼81% sequence identity and that r-bg corresponds to a portion of the third exon of c-bg (position 1091–1350). Because r-bg shows slightly higher identity with the sorghum ESTs (83%, GI 6675471 and 9303089), it is possible that a different maize cellular gene contributed to r-bg. Regardless, the high similarity between the Bs1 sequence and both of the sorghum ESTs and c-bg confirms that r-bgcorresponds to a transduced bg gene. Maize c-xe, on the other hand, appears to contain one intron and two exons. Compared with c-xe, r-xe corresponds to a part of the first exon (108 bp downstream from the ATG) fused to a part of the second exon (position 495–588 relative to the ATG) (Fig. 7). This suggests that r-xehas sustained a deletion that removed 44 bp from the first exon, all of the intervening intron, and 82 bp of the second exon (Fig. 7). This deletion thus eliminated 42 amino acid residues in r-xecompared with c-xe (Fig. 3). Overall, r-xe and c-xe share ∼86% nucleotide sequence identity.Figure 7Acquisition of a portion of c-xeby Bs1. Schematic representation (A) and sequence alignment (B) of c-xeand r-xe. Exons are represented by black rectangles, and introns are represented by a thick black line. The white line dividing the r -xesequence in A corresponds to the point where a portion of exon I and a portion of exon II are fused. Sequence in lowercase letters corresponds to the intron sequence. Nucleotide sequence positions within Bs1 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Relative to their cellular counterparts, the mutation patterns of r-bg and r-xe are different. Whereas r-xe has sustained a large deletion of 385 bp, r-bg has only a single nucleotide insertion. Base substitution patterns are also different, whereas r-xe has sustained 34 nucleotide substitutions (23 transitions and 11 transversions), a comparison of r-bg and c-bgindicates that r-bg bears 59 nucleotide substitutions (27 transitions and 32 transversions). Although base substitutions in r-xe have resulted in 19 amino acid changes (of the 67 amino acid residues contributed to ORF1 by r-xe), 9 of these mutations are changes into residues conserved in the barley XE protein (Fig. 3). Overall, integration of the c-xe sequence into Bs1 and subsequent mutations in r-xe seem to have occurred in a non-random fashion and conserved the XE frame within Bs1 ORF1 (Fig. 3). On the other hand, r-bgintegration into Bs1 did not maintain the BG frame within ORF1 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, compared with c-bg, base substitutions have resulted in 43 amino acid changes (of 85), two of them being stop codons (Fig. 3). Our results reveal significant similarity between the amino-terminal-most 100 residues of ORF1 and GAG of the maize gypsy-like LTR retrotransposon magellan (Fig. 2), GAG of a non-LTR retrotransposon from B. mori (35Abe H. Ohbayashi F. Shimada T. Sugasaki T. Kawai S. Oshiki T. Genes Genet. Syst. 1998; 73: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the capsid protein of turnip crinkle virus (36Carrington J.C. Heaton L.A. Zuidema D. Hillman B.I. Morris T.J. Virology. 1989; 170: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). magellan was isolated as a recent insertion in the wx-M allele (37Purugganan M.D. Wessler S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11674-11678Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and as an independent insertion in a maize gene that encodes for the pl transcriptional factor (38Marillonnet S. Wessler S.R. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1245-1256PubMed Google Scholar) (GI 2343274). The recent insertion of magellan into wx and pl suggests it retains the coding capacity for all proteins necessary for retrotransposition, including GAG.magellan was established as a member of the gypsy/Ty3 LTR retrotransposons by a comparison of its integrase and reverse transcriptase domains with those of the yeast Ty3 and Lilium del gypsy-type LTR retrotransposons (37Purugganan M.D. Wessler S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11674-11678Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that a functional copy of Bs1 may belong to the gypsy/Ty3 class of LTR retrotransposons. The similarity between Bs1 and magellan GAG proteins is intriguing because homology between GAG proteins of different retrotransposons is usually low or not significant (39Eickbush T.H. Morse S.S. The Evolutionary Biology of Viruses. Raven Press, New York1994: 121-155Google Scholar). This may indicate that Bs1 and magellan are, in fact, closely related. Retroviruses and some LTR retrotransposons have an envdomain located in the 3′ region of their internal sequence (5Laten H.M. Majumdar A. Gaucher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of the Bs1 3′-most region reveals similarity to a large family of proteins that contain tandem PPR repeats. Given its location and shared structural similarities with the envdomains of retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons (8Wright D.A. Voytas D.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 703-715PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that this region may correspond to an env-like domain. For example, ENV proteins are typically plasma membrane-associated glycoproteins. The putative Bs1 ENV-like protein, as well as PPR proteins in general, contains several potential N- and O-glycosylation sites, have hydrophobicity profiles consistent with membrane-associated proteins, and at least some PPR proteins are targeted to the plasma membrane (34Chang P.-F.

This is because of the presence of stretches of variable sequence within otherwise conserved sequence (40Battini J.L. Heard J.M. Danos O. J.

Our finding that Bs1 may have transduced portions of genes that encode for 1,3-β-glucanase and 1,4-β-xylan endohydrolase prompted us to clone these genes from maize. β-Glucanases are enzymes that hydrolyze β-linked glucans and are implicated in various physiological processes that involve the structure and function of plant cell walls. Plant β-glucanases fall into two types, 1,3-β-glucanases and 1,3;1,4-β-glucanases. Based on their isoelectric properties 1,3-β-glucanases may be further divided into two classes, n"

This mutant receptor, hP1R-H223R (hP1RCAM-HR), was originally identified in Jansen's chondrodysplasia and is altered in transmembrane domain (TM) 2. We utilized the PTHrP analog, [Bpa2,Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide (Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36)), which has valine 2 replaced byp-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa); this substitution renders the peptide a photoreactive inverse agonist at hP1RCAM-HR. This analog cross-linked to hP1RCAM-HR at two contiguous receptor regions as follows: the principal cross-link site (site A) was between receptor residues Pro415–Met441, spanning the TM6/extracellular loop three boundary; the second cross-link site (site B) was within the TM4/TM5 region. Within the site A interval, substitution of Met425 to Leu converted Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) from an inverse agonist to a weak partial agonist; this conversion was accompanied by a relative shift of cross-linking from site A to site B. The functional effect of the M425L mutation was specific for Bpa2-containing analogs, as inverse agonism of Bpa2-PTH-(1–34) was similarly eliminated, whereas inverse agonism of [Leu11,d-Trp12]PTHrP-(5–36) was not affected.

The amino-terminal fragments PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP-(1–36) bind to the P1R with high affinity (K d ∼3 nm) and activate this receptor with full efficacy (1Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Brown E.M.

Despite having only limited amino acid sequence homology that is restricted to the first 13 residues, both ligands have similar functional domains; the amino-terminal portion (residues 1–14) is important for receptor activation, whereas the carboxyl-terminal portion (residues 15–34) is important for high affinity receptor binding (3Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Goldring S.R. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26469-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cross-linking and mutagenesis studies suggest that the activation domain of the ligand interacts with the juxtamembrane portion of the receptor composed of the extracellular loops and the extracellular ends of the TM helices, and that the binding domain of the ligand interacts with the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor (4Gensure R.C.

Consistent with this model, certain amino-terminal modifications or deletions in either PTH or PTHrP result in analogs that act as P1R antagonists (8Horiuchi N. Holick M.F. Potts Jr., J.T. Rosenblatt M. Science. 1983; 220: 1053-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Carter P.H. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 491-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inverse agonists are ligands that reduce receptor signaling activity to below the basal signaling level seen with the unoccupied receptor (11de Ligt R.A.F. Kourounakis A.P. Ijzerman A.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,12Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These compounds are thus functionally different from agonists, which activate the receptor, and neutral antagonists, which have no efficacy of their own but can prevent the actions of both agonists and inverse agonists by a simple competitive mechanism (13Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 390-394PubMed Google Scholar). At least some constitutive activity of a receptor is required in order for inverse agonist activity to be detected; in general, such constitutive activity may be induced by certain receptor mutations or by overexpressing the wild-type form of a receptor (14Lattion A. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 45: 302-306Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Smit M.J. Leurs R. Alewijnse A.E. Blauw J. Van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Van De Vrede Y.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By using either method to increase basal receptor signaling, many ligands that were previously classified as neutral antagonists were subsequently shown to be inverse agonists (14Lattion A. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 45: 302-306Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Smit M.J. Leurs R. Alewijnse A.E. Blauw J. Van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Van De Vrede Y. Roovers E.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Some of these ligands have gained clinical significance, for example as histamine-1 blockers (17Bakker R.A. Wieland K. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 387: R5-R7Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), histamine-2 blockers (18Alewijnse A.E. Smit M.J. Hoffmann M. Verzijl D. Timmerman H. Leurs R. J.

How the inverse agonist activities of these compounds relate to their clinical effectiveness has not yet been determined. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which inverse agonists reduce receptor signaling activity remain largely unknown, although the pharmacological behavior of these ligands has been discussed in theoretical terms (12Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 13Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 390-394PubMed Google Scholar, 21Costa T. Herz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). One crucial question is whether or not the receptor contact points that mediate inverse agonism are distinct from those that induce receptor activation. Jansen's chondrodysplasia is a rare human disease caused by mutations in the P1R that result in constitutive activity (22Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Patients with this disorder have skeletal abnormalities, hypercalcemia, and low serum PTH and PTHrP levels; clinical manifestations that are consistent with the important role that the P1R plays in skeletal development and calcium homeostasis (23Kronenberg H.M. Lanske B. Kovacs C.S. Chung U.I. Lee K. Segre G.V. Schipani E. Juppner H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53 (, 301–303): 283-301PubMed Google Scholar). Three different P1R mutations have been identified in these patients: His223 → Arg (hP1RCAM-HR), Thr410 → Pro (hP1RCAM-TP), and Ile458 → Arg (hP1RCAM-IR) (22Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 24Schipani E. Langman C.B. Parfitt A.M. Jensen G.S. Kikuchi S. Kooh S.W. Cole W.G. Jüppner H. N. Engl. J.

Metab. 1999; 84: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which alter residues in TM2, TM6, and TM7, respectively. Each of these receptor mutants exhibits significantly elevated basal cAMP signaling activity when testedin vitro (5–10-fold above wild-type receptor levels). The P1R receptor containing the His223 → Arg mutation was recently expressed in transgenic mice and shown to result in a substantial increase in trabecular bone volume and a decrease in cortical bone thickness (26Calvi L.M. Sims N.A. Hunzelman J.L. Knight M.C. Giovannetti A. Saxton J.M. Kronenberg H.M. Baron R. Schipani E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, systems are now emerging for the study of P1R constitutive activity and, potentially, ligand inverse agonist activity in model disease states. In cell-based settings, inverse agonist activity at both hP1RCAM-HR and hP1RCAM-TP has been demonstrated with the previously described antagonist peptides [Leu11,d-Trp12]hPTHrP-(7–34)-amide and [d-Trp12]bPTH-(7–34)-amide (27Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Jensen G.S. Schipani E. Potts Jr., J.T. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported (28Carter P.H. Petroni B. Gensure R.C. Schipani E Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) the characterization of several new PTH and PTHrP antagonist analogs that act as inverse agonists at each of the constitutively active P1R mutants. One of these analogs, [Bpa2,Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide (Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36)), contains a photolabile amino acid derivative (p -benzoyl-l-phenylalanine) at position 2 and functions as an inverse agonist at hP1RCAM-HR; however, it is not an inverse agonist at hP1RCAM-TP or hP1RCAM-IR, and it is a weak partial agonist at the wild-type receptor (28Carter P.H. Petroni B. Gensure R.C. Schipani E Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Importantly, the photolabile position 2 amino acid derivative itself is responsible for the inverse agonist activity of this analog at hP1RCAM-HR, as the otherwise isosteric parent peptide [Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide (valine at position 2) is an agonist at hP1RCAM-HR, as it is at the wild-type hP1R. The structural requirements for inverse agonist activity at position 2 in PTHrP-(1–36) are highly specific, because none of several other position 2 modifications that are structurally similar to Bpa, including tryptophan and thed-Bpa stereoisomer, confer inverse agonism to the peptide ligand (28Carter P.H. Petroni B. Gensure R.C. Schipani E Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recent photoaffinity mapping studies performed with the wild-type hP1R have indicated that the benzophenone group of a similar antagonist analog, [Bpa2,Ile5,Arg11,13,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide, cross-links at or near Met425, in the extracellular end of TM6 (6Behar V. Bisello A. Bitan G. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that mapping the cross-link site for Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) in hP1RCAM-HR would help identify receptor residues that play a role in mediating the inverse agonist activity of this analog, as well as residues that play a role in converting the receptor between active and inactive conformations. Thus, we physically mapped the cross-linking site of Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) in hP1RCAM-HR. We also showed by mutational methods that a residue within the mapped receptor interval is involved in mediating the inverse agonist effect of Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36).

Mutants were verified by automated nucleotide sequence analysis of single-stranded plasmid DNA.

After 4 days, cells were used for experiments. Radiolabeled peptides were prepared by chloramine-T iodination, followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification using a 30–50% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min. Binding assays were performed as described previously (31Bergwitz C Juseaume S.A. Luck M.D. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28861-28868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, the 125I-labeled radioligand bPTH-(3–34) was incubated with cells expressing wild-type or mutant P1R in the presence of varying concentrations (0–10−6m) of unlabeled peptide. After a 4-h incubation at 15 °C, the binding mixture was removed, and the cells were lysed, and the entire lysate was counted for γ-irradiation. Intracellular cAMP accumulation after 30-min treatments at room temperature with or without ligand was measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (9Carter P.H. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4972-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells transiently expressing wild-type or mutant P1R were incubated with125I-labeled Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) (3 million cpm/well in 6-well plates) for 6 h at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed twice and covered with cold buffer. The plates were placed on an ice tray under a UV light source (Blak Ray long-wave lamp, 366 nm, 7 milliwatts/cm2; UV Products, San Gabriel, CA) at a distance of ∼5 cm for 15 min. Cells were lysed using 1% Triton buffer and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then mixed 1:1 with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer to give final concentrations of 4% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 100 mmdithiothreitol. The samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (10% acrylamide) performed according to the method of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For visualization of the intact cross-linking products prior to digestion, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. For purification of cross-linked ligand-receptor complexes, wet gels were cut into strips and counted for γ-irradiation, and the gel strips with peak counts were subjected to electroelution in a dialysis bag (molecular mass cut-off = 12,000 Da) at 100 V for 2 h. Eluted samples were concentrated using Centricon-10 tubes (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). For cleavage of the receptor at methionine residues (Fig. 1), the gel-purified radiolabeled ligand-receptor complexes were incubated with CNBr (100 mm) in 70% formic acid at 20 °C for 24 h. After digestion, CNBr and formic acid were removed by repetitive lyophilization. Samples were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, incubated at room temperature for 2 h, and then analyzed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) performed according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. For all studies shown, similar results were obtained in at least three separate experiments. Calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel. Nonlinear regression analyses of binding and cAMP dose-response data were performed using the four-parameter equation:y p = Min + ((Max − Min)/(1 + (IC50/x)slope)). The Excel Solver function was utilized for parameter optimization, as described previously (9Carter P.H. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4972-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Bowen W.P. Jerman J.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Surface receptor density (Bmax) was calculated by the method of Scatchard assuming a single class of binding site and equivalent binding of radiolabeled and unlabeled peptides. The statistical significance between two data sets was determined using a two-tailed Student'st test, assuming unequal variances for the two sets. For both hP1RCAM-HR and wild-type hP1R, cross-linking of 125I-Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) followed by SDS-PAGE autoradiography of the resulting COS-7 cell lysates yielded a single large (∼79 kDa) protein band that was consistent with specific cross-linking to intact glycosylated PTH-1 receptors (Fig. 2 A). No cross-linking was observed in COS-7 cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). To map the cross-linked sites in the two receptors, we gel-purified the ligand-receptor complexes, treated the resulting complexes with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) in formic acid to cleave at the carboxyl-end of methionine residues (Fig.1), size-separated the digestion products on tricine gels, and visualized the results by autoradiography. Digestion of the complexes formed between Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) and either hP1RCAM-HR or hP1R with CNBr yielded similar but not identical banding patterns. With each receptor, a prominent radiolabeled protein band of ∼3.5 kDa and a slightly weaker band of ∼5 kDa was observed (Fig.2 B, lanes 2 and4). In hP1RCAM-HR, but not in hP1R, a third band of ∼17 kDa was observed (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The origin of the ∼3.5-kDa band was assessed but proved to be refractory to identification. Treatment of the purified complexes with formic acid alone confirmed that the bulk of the radioactivity in this band arose from CNBr-dependent mechanisms (Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and 3). The mobility of the ∼3.5-kDa band was indistinguishable from that of free radioligand (see Fig. 4). The release of free ligand by a CNBr-dependent cleavage process is known to occur if the ligand has cross-linked to the side chain methyl group of a methionine residue (35Kage R. Leeman S.E.

Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Chorev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22498-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In fact, such CNBr-dependent release of free ligand was observed previously by others (6Behar V. Bisello A. Bitan G. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) for a related Bpa2-containing PTHrP analog ([Bpa2,Ile5,Arg11,13,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide) cross-linked to the wild-type hP1R, and it was concluded in this study that cross-linking occurred to Met425 because mutation of this residue to leucine markedly reduced cross-linking efficiency. In our current study, introduction of the Met425 → Leu mutation in hP1R resulted in a moderate reduction in the yield of cross-linking product (Fig.3 A, lanes 3 and4); however, when introduced into hP1RCAM-HR, this same mutation resulted in a comparable if not greater yield of cross-linking product, relative to that obtained with the control hP1RCAM-HR (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2). Upon CNBr digestion, both hP1R-M425L and hP1RCAM-HR-M425L complexes yielded a prominent ∼3.5-kDa band (Fig. 3 B). These results imply that within both hP1R and hP1RCAM-HR at least some cross-linking occurred to a residue other than Met425 that can also yield free ligand upon CNBr digestion. We examined the possibility that Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) cross-linked to one of the other methionine residues in the juxtamembrane region (e.g. at positions 224, 231, 414, 441, and 445; cf. Fig. 1) by constructing hP1R mutants with these residues mutated individually or in combination. Each of the resulting mutant receptor complexes continued to show a prominent ∼3.5-kDa band after CNBr digestion (Fig. 4); thus, this band could not be attributed to cross-linking of the ligand to the methyl group of any of the methionine residues tested. Whereas the origins of the ∼3.5-kDa band remain uncertain, one possibility is that Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) cross-links to another oxidation-sensitive amino acid (e.g. Trp, Asn, Gln, and Tyr) that could be cleaved by CNBr, although such a mechanism has not previously been appreciated.Figure 3Cross-linking of Bpa2-PTHrP-(1–36) to hP1RCAM-HR, hP1RCAM-HR-M425L, hP1R, and hP1R-M425L.

In native TMADH reduction of the flavin by substrate (perdeuterated trimethylamine) is influenced by two ionizations in the Michaelis complex with pK a values of 6.5 and 8.4; maximal activity is realized in the alkaline region. The latter ionization has been attributed to residue His-172 and, more recently, the former to the ionization of substrate itself. In the Michaelis complex, the ionization of substrate (pK a ∼ 6.5 for perdeuterated substrate) is perturbed by ∼−3.3 to −3.6 pH units compared with that of free trimethylamine (pK a = 9.8) and free perdeuterated trimethylamine (pK a = 10.1), respectively, thus stabilizing trimethylamine base by ∼2 kJ mol−1. We show, by targeted mutagenesis and stopped-flow studies that this reduction of the pK a is a consequence of electronic interaction with residues Tyr-60 and His-172, thus these two residues are key for optimizing catalysis in the physiological pH range. We also show that residue Tyr-174, the remaining ionizable group in the active site that we have not targeted previously by mutagenesis, is not implicated in the pH dependence of flavin reduction. Formation of a Michaelis complex with trimethylamine base is consistent with a mechanism of amine oxidation that we advanced in our previous computational and kinetic studies which involves nucleophilic attack by the substrate nitrogen atom on the electrophilic C4a atom of the flavin isoalloxazine ring. Stabilization of trimethylamine base in the Michaelis complex over that in free solution is key to optimizing catalysis at physiological pH in TMADH, and may be of general importance in the mechanism of other amine dehydrogenases that require the unprotonated form of the substrate for catalysis.

The oxidoreductases responsible for these reactions can be grouped broadly into the flavoprotein and quinoprotein families. The mechanism of amine oxidation catalyzed by the quinoprotein amine oxidases is understood reasonably well and occurs through the formation of enzyme-substrate covalent adducts with topaquinone or tryptophan tryptophylquinone redox centers (1Halcrow M. Phillips S. Knowles P. Holzenburg A. Scrutton N.S. Enzyme Catalyzed Electron and Radical Transfer. 35. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, London2000: 183-231Google Scholar, 2Davidson V. Holzenburg A. Scrutton N.S. Enzyme Catalyzed Electron and Radical Transfer. 35. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, London2000: 119-143Google Scholar). In some cases C-H bond cleavage by these enzymes has been shown to involve quantum tunneling mechanisms for transfer of the H nucleus to a base in the enzyme active site (3Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J.

By contrast, the mechanism of amine oxidation by flavoproteins is understood less well. Although H-transfer has been shown to occur by vibrationally assisted tunneling in two flavoprotein amine dehydrogenases (6Harris R.J. Meskys R. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S.

The cleavage of the reactive C-H bond in amine substrates by flavoproteins has been reviewed (8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol.

Kluwer Academic/Plenum, London2000: 145-181Google Scholar) and discussed in terms of (i) a proton abstraction mechanism involving an active site base to generate a carbanion species (originally proposed for trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH)1 (10Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), (ii) an aminium radical cation mechanism, originally proposed for monoamine oxidase (11Silverman R.B. Accts. Chem. Res. 1995; 28: 335-342Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar), (iii) a mechanism involving H-atom abstraction by an active site radical species (12Edmondson D.E. Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 735-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and (iv) a mechanism involving nucleophilic attack by the substrate nitrogen on the flavin C4a atom, followed by proton abstraction by an active site base (13Kim J.-M. Bogdon M.A. Mariano P.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 10591-10595Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In a modification of the latter mechanism Edmondson and colleagues (14Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13670-13683Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have suggested that the flavin N-5 atom in monoamine oxidase A acts as a base during substrate C-H bond cleavage. A similar mechanism was also proposed for oxidation of substrates by D-amino acid oxidase (15Miura R. Setoyama C. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have in recent years investigated the mechanism of C-H bond cleavage catalyzed by the complex iron-sulfur flavoprotein TMADH (EC 1.5.99.7), whose structure is known at high resolution (16Lim L.W.

TMADH catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine, forming dimethylamine and formaldehyde (18Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys.

Following bond cleavage, electrons are transferred subsequently from the dihydroflavin in two single electron transfer events to electron transferring flavoprotein, via the 4Fe-4S center of TMADH (20Steenkamp D.J.

Flavin reduction in native TMADH is fast, prohibiting detailed studies of flavin reduction at elevated temperatures (8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although the use of perdeuterated trimethylamine has opened up detailed stopped-flow studies of native enzyme (19Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar). In mutant studies we have been unable to identify a critical active site base, thus disfavoring a base abstraction/carbanion-type mechanism (19Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem.

It was thought previously that trimethylammonium cation was the reactive species, and this was used to argue against mechanisms requiring trimethylamine base (or more explicitly a substrate nitrogen lone pair) in theES complex. In studies with perdeuterated trimethylamine, however, we demonstrated recently that this is not the case. We proposed a mechanism (Fig. 1) for substrate oxidation that is consistent with kinetic (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol.

Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13670-13683Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Herein, we have extended our studies by performing a detailed kinetic characterization of mutant TMADH enzymes altered in the region of the substrate-binding site. We show that interaction of substrate with TMADH perturbs substantially the substrate pK a from 9.81 (free trimethylamine) to ∼6.5 (in the native ES complex). The electronic environment of the substrate in the ES complex is therefore key to stabilizing trimethylamine base at physiological pH values, thus facilitating catalysis. Our results may have general implications for the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of amine substrates.

All mutant genes were completely sequenced to ensure that spurious changes had not arisen during the mutagenesis reaction. The expression and purification of the mutant TMADH enzymes was as described for other recombinant forms of TMADH (27Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol.

Stopped-flow studies of flavin reduction in TMADH were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer as described elsewhere (8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S.

Data were collected at 443 nm (flavin reduction) and were analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression analysis on an Acorn RISC PC using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). Experiments were performed by mixing TMADH contained in buffer of the desired pH, with an equal volume of substrate contained in the same buffer at the desired concentration. The concentration of substrate was always at least 10-fold greater than that of TMADH, thereby ensuring pseudo-first order reaction conditions. Absorption changes at 443 nm were analyzed as monophasic processes, consistent with previous studies with TMADH (8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For each substrate concentration, at least five replica measurements were collected and averaged. The error for individual rates measured by fitting to a single transient was less than 0.5% in all cases, and the error for the rate fitted to averaged transients was <0.4%. Substrate-reduced TMADH is quite stable to reoxidation by molecular oxygen (half-life about 50 min (28Wilson E.K. Mathews F.S. Packman L.C. Scrutton N.S.

Reaction scheme modeling for the reduction of TMADH by trimethylamine has been described in detail elsewhere (8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reduction of the 6-S-cysteinyl FMN of TMADH involves the reversible formation of a Michaelis complex followed by the C-H bond cleavage/flavin reduction step, E+S⇌k2k1ES→k3EPEq. 2 The observed rate constant for flavin reduction,kobs, is dependent on substrate concentration as described by the general hyperbolic expression (Equation 3) (29Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kobs=k3[S]K+[S]Eq. 3 where K is a constant and equal to (k2 +k3)/k1. As discussed elsewhere (8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in reactions of TMADH with trimethylamine the reaction is modeled such that k2 ≫k3, and K thus approximates to the enzyme-substrate dissociation constant, K d. Enzyme and substrate were equilibrated for 10 min in the stopped-flow apparatus at the appropriate temperature prior to mixing and the acquisition of stopped-flow data. The optimal time for equilibration was determined empirically. Temperature control was achieved using a thermostatic circulating water bath and the temperature was monitored directly in the stopped-flow apparatus using a semiconductor sensor (model LM35CZ, National Semiconductor). Studies of the pH dependence of flavin reduction were conducted at 5 °C. Buffers used were: 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH range 6.0 to 7.5), 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH range 8.0 to 8.5), 100 mm sodium borate buffer (pH range 9.0 to 10.0), and 100 mm glycine/NaCl, pH 10.5 and 11.0. Previous studies have established that increased ionic strength on addition of substrate (trimethylammonium chloride) over the range employed in these studies does not affect the rate of flavin reduction (19Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar). pH profiles for the kinetic parameters k3and k3/K were constructed and the data fitted to the appropriate equations describing single or double ionizations as described previously (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24581-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol.

We have in previous work targeted a number of ionizable residues in the active site of TMADH to assess their role in the mechanism of flavin reduction/substrate C-H bond cleavage, and to identify the residues contributing to kinetically influential ionizations observed in the native enzyme (8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13155-13161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Plots of k3 versus pH for enzyme with perdeuterated trimethylamine indicate the presence of two kinetically influential ionizations (Fig.3 B) in the ES complex with macroscopic pK a values 6.5 ± 0.2 and 8.4 ± 0.1 (19Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions performed with protiated trimethylamine are fast (>1000 s−1) in the high pH regime making analysis difficult with this substrate. The relatively large isotope effect for flavin reduction observed with perdeuterated substrate enables the pH dependence of the native enzyme to be investigated from pH 6 to 11. The upper ionization of 8.4 ± 0.1 has been assigned to residue His-172, since this ionization is lost in a H172Q mutant TMADH (19Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar) and is perturbed in the Y169F mutant TMADH (the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-169 forms a hydrogen-bond with the imidazole side chain of His-172 in native TMADH (Fig. 2) (26Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13155-13161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). The lower pK a value was recently attributed to the ionization of trimethylammonium cation to form free trimethylamine base ((CH3)3NH+ → (CH3)3N) (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24581-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This assignment was made following the observation that the pK a value is elevated by ∼0.5 pH units when perdeuterated trimethylamine is used as substrate. This was rationalized on the basis of force constant effects for the C-H versus C-D bond. The shorter C-D bond results in a larger charge density, and thus is electron supplying (i.e. stabilizing the N-H bond) relative to C-H; also the perdeuterated substrate has a greater reduced mass for the (CD3)3N—H stretching vibration, and therefore lies lower in the asymmetric potential energy well. Thus, the (CH3)3N—H bond dissociates more readily than the (CD3)3N—H bond, accounting for the elevated macroscopic pK a value seen with perdeuterated substrate in our kinetic studies.Figure 3The pH dependence of the reductive half-reaction of Y174F and native TMADH.

A bell-shaped dependence is seen for native TMADH (Fig. 3 B, inset), which is retained in all the active site mutants we have studied to date. The acid side of the bell is perturbed (∼+0.4 pH units) to higher pH with perdeuterated trimethylamine, consistent with it representing the ionization of free substrate (pK a 9.8 and 10.1 for trimethylamine and perdeuterated trimethylamine, respectively (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24581-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). The ionization represented by the alkaline limb has not yet been assigned, but it may represent the flavin N-3 atom (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24581-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), or indeed Tyr-174 whose phenolic side chain interacts closely with substrate in the ES complex (Fig. 2). The macroscopic pK a values derived from curve-fitting are probably a poor reflection of the true pK a values owing to (i) the narrowness of the bell in the plot (30Dixon H.B. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and (ii) the relatively low number of points defining the bell. For this reason the plot is of qualitative value in indicating the presence of kinetically influential ionizations, but we do not place too much prominence on the actual pK a values that are obtained from curve-fitting. The potential involvement of Tyr-174 in the plot ofk3/K d versus pH was investigated by isolating a mutant (Y174F) in which the phenolic hydroxyl group was removed. Tyr-174 is the only remaining ionizable side chain found in close proximity to the substrate-binding site that we have not targeted previously by mutagenesis. Plots ofk3 versus pH andk3/K d versus pH for mutant Y174F (Fig. 3A) were constructed from the data shown in Table I and are very similar to those constructed for native TMADH, indicating that the side chain of Tyr-174 does not contribute to the pH-dependent kinetic behavior of TMADH. The lack of additional ionizable side chains in the active site of TMADH, that could lead to the pH-dependent effects observed in the reductive half-reaction, leads us to the conclusion that the alkaline limb of thek3/K d versus pH plot may be attributed to the ionization of a group on the 6-S-cysteinyl FMN. The obvious candidate is the N3-H group of the flavin isoalloxazine ring, since the pK a of this group is expected to be ∼10 (31Muller F. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 1.

A crystallographic study with the inhibitor and substrate analogue tetramethylammonium chloride suggests that these three residues form the substrate-binding site (32Bellamy H.D. Lim L.W. Mathews F.S. Dunham W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11887-11892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with the results of mutagenesis and kinetic studies (33Basran J. Mewies M. Mathews F.S. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Mewies M. Basran J. Packman L.C. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7162-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Given the close proximity of residue Tyr-60 to substrate (it forms an amino-aromatic interaction with trimethylamine) and the 6-S-cysteinyl FMN, it was conjectured that the side chain of Tyr-60 might contribute to the pH-dependent behavior of the reductive half-reaction. Plots of k3 versus pH (from the data shown in Table II) for the Y60F mutant TMADH indicate some key differences compared with comparable plots generated for native enzyme (Fig. 4 A). The most striking difference is that the k3 versus pH curve for the Y60F TMADH is displaced significantly toward the alkaline region. The pH-dependent data are complicated by the presence of two ionizations in thek3 versus pH plot for native TMADH. In the Y60F TMADH one expects to see the ionization attributed to His-172 (although it may be perturbed) and also the substrate ((CH3)3NH+ → (CH3)3N) ionization. Curve-fitting to an equation describing a double ionization satisfies the data better than a single ionization; the latter deviates from the data points in the more acidic region. The fit to an equation describing a double ionization is shown in Fig. 4 A and yields pK a values of 7.7 ± 0.7 and 10.0 ± 0.1. Clearly, a more precise determination of the more acidic pK a value is difficult given the small elevation ink3 in this region of the plot. Comparable analyses were performed using perdeuterated trimethylamine (Fig.4 B). In this case the k3 versus pH plot has a more defined shoulder on the main transition and fitting to an equation describing a double ionization yielded pK a values of 8.8 ± 0.2 and 10.2 ± 0.1. As discussed in our previous work (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24581-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) the effect of perdeuteration is to displace the pK a value for the ionization of substrate to higher pH owing to force constant effects on the C-D bonds of the methyl groups. We argue, therefore, that the lower ionization seen in the k3 versus pH plots for Y60F TMADH is attributable to the ionization of substrate bound in the ES complex, and the upper ionization (which is not affected by perdeuteration of substrate) is attributable to His-172 (again in the ES complex). The latter value is elevated by ∼1.6 pH units compared with the pK a value (8.4 ± 0.1) (19Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar) attributed to His-172 in the nativeES complex. The data shown in Fig. 4 B suggest that maximal catalytic activity is achieved following deprotonation of His-172. With protiated substrate, the first phase in the Y60F TMADH titration is smaller than that seen with perdeuterated substrate (Fig. 4 B), which is a result of the larger separation in the pK a values of His-172 and protiated substrate than the separation seen with perdeuterated substrate. As the pK a values approach each other it is expected that the size of the shoulder attributable to the ionization of substrate will become larger. The inset to Fig. 4 Bindicates the bell-shapedk3/K d versus pH curve observed for native TMADH is retained with the Y60F TMADH. We conclude, therefore, that the unidentified ionization in TMADH found on the alkaline side of the bell (Fig. 4 B, inset) does not correspond to Tyr-60; in this regard it is noteworthy that the hydroxyl group of Tyr-60 is hydrogen-bonded to the indole side chain of Trp-355 in the crystallographic structure of unliganded TMADH (Fig. 2; Tyr-60 and Trp-355 form part of the substrate-binding “aromatic bowl” (32Bellamy H.D.

Reactions were performed at 5 °C; buffer conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” To simplify analysis of the k3 versus pH plot for TMADH containing the Y60F mutation, the H172Q mutation was also included to generate the double mutant Y60F/H172Q. A k3 versus pH plot for the Y60F/H172Q mutant constructed from the data shown in TableIII is illustrated (Fig.5 A). Fitting the data to an expression describing a single ionization yielded a pK a value of 8.5 ± 0.1, which we attribute to the ionization of substrate in the ES complex. Confirmation that this ionization represents substrate was obtained by performing reactions with perdeuterated trimethylamine; in this case the pK a value is perturbed by ∼+0.8 pH units (pK a 9.3 ± 0.1; Fig. 5 A), consistent with force constant effects on the ionization of substrate which have been discussed previously in the context of the H172Q mutant TMADH (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24581-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The effect of removing His-172 in the Y60F/H172Q double mutant is to displace (to the more alkaline region) the pK a for ionization of bound substrate by about 0.5 pH units compared with the value seen in the Y60F TMADH single mutant (Fig. 5 B). This is clearly a result of the altered environment around the substrate-binding site as a result of replacing His-172 with Gln-172. This observation is also consistent with a similar pK a shift (∼+0.9 pH units) seen for the ionization of enzyme-bound substrate in comparable studies performed with native TMADH and the H172Q mutant enzyme using perdeuterated substrate (Table IV) (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24581-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Experimental errors are those from curve-fitting. Reactions were performed at 5 °C; buffer conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Our data (summarized in Table IV) for the Y60F and Y60F/H172Q mutant TMADH enzymes clearly indicate that residues Tyr-60 and His-172 play a major role in stabilizing trimethylamine base in the ES complex. This stabilization of over 3 pH units (equivalent to ∼2 kJ mol−1; pK a of free trimethylamine is 9.8) is a direct result of the different electronic environment of the substrate in the ES complex consequent on the formation of an amino-aromatic interaction between substrate, the phenolic side chain of Tyr-60, and the imidazolium side chain of His-172. Removal of the hydroxyl group of Tyr-60 (mutant Y60F) destabilizes significantly (by ∼1.3 kJ mol −1) the basic form of the ES complex (pK a for the [(CH3)3NH+ → (CH3)3N] ionization in the complex is shifted to 8.8). The stability of trimethylamine base is further reduced (by an additional ∼0.3 kJ mol −1) in a double mutant TMADH, in which both Tyr-60 and His-172 side chains have been exchanged for nonionizing counterparts; the pK a value for substrate ionization in the ES complex of this mutant enzyme is only 0.5 pH units more acidic than that of free trimethylamine (Table IV). Our work also indicates that the ionization state of His-172 is important in controlling the rate of flavin reduction. The ionization states in native and H172Q TMADH are shown in Fig.6. For native TMADH (Fig. 6, Scheme A) the major catalytic species is the one in which the imidazolium side chain of His-172 and substrate are deprotonated. The need to deprotonate His-172 is especially apparent in our data for Y60F TMADH where the two pK a values for substrate and His-172 are widely separated (Fig. 4 A). In this case it is clear that deprotonation of substrate (pK a 7.7 ± 0.7) alone is insufficient to achieve the maximum rate of flavin reduction, this being realized only following deprotonation of His-172 (pK a 10.0 ± 0.1). Mutagenesis of His-172 removes this additional complexity in the reductive half-reaction of TMADH (Fig. 6, Scheme B) and flavin reduction proceeds following substrate ionization. Our analyses of the reductive half-reaction of mutant forms of TMADH indicate that the trimethylamine base (and not, as previously thought (8Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the protonated cation) is the catalytically relevant form of the substrate in the ES complex. Our mutagenesis studies have identified Tyr-60 and His-172 as being the main residues responsible for stabilizing trimethylamine base in the ES complex. We have also ruled out a role for residue Tyr-174 in the pH-dependent behavior of TMADH. Our work demonstrates that TMADH is poised to initiate flavin reduction by nucleophilic addition of the substrate lone pair at the flavin C4a atom by perturbing the substrate ionization by over 3 pH units (equivalent to ∼2 kJ mol−1) on forming the ES complex. Our studies are consistent with a mechanism of flavin reduction proposed in our previous work (7Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24581-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), and may have general implications for the mechanism of amine oxidation by flavoproteins."

To investigate this aspect of SCP function, a series of internally quenched fluorescent substrates was designed based on the cleavage sites identified in the autocatalytic processing of SpeB to mature SCP. The best substrates for SCP contain three amino acids in the nonprimed position (i.e. AIK in P3-P2-P1). Varying the length of the substrate on the primed side of the scissile bond has a relatively lower effect on activity. The highest activity (kcat/KM = 2.8 ± 0.6 (105 ×m−1s−1) is observed for the pentamer 3-aminobenzoic acid-AIKAG-3-nitrotyrosine, which spans subsites S3 to S2′ on the enzyme. High pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses show that the substrates are cleaved at the site predicted from the autoprocessing experiments. These results show that SCP can display an important level of endopeptidase activity. Substitutions at position P2 of the substrate clearly indicate that the S2 subsite of SCP can readily accommodate substrates containing a hydrophobic residue at that position and that some topological preference exists for that subsite. Substitutions in positions P3, P1, and P1′ had little or no effect on SCP activity. The substrate specificity outlined in this work further supports the similarity between SCP and the cysteine proteases of the papain family. From the data regarding the identified or proposed natural substrates for SCP, it appears that this substrate specificity profile may also apply to the processing of mammalian and streptococcal protein targets by SCP.

S. pyogenes is also the cause of more systemic infections that can result in toxic shock-like syndrome, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, and scarlet fever (1Bisno A.L. Stevens D.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 2Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). A growing concern over the rising incidence of the antibiotic resistant strains of this bacterium (3Sutcliffe J. Tait Kamradt A. Wondrack L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) intensified studies aimed at resolving the mechanism of infection and prompted the search for new treatments. S. pyogenes produces a number of virulence factors, of which the most studied is the exotoxin known as the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB)1 (4Gerlach D. Knoll H. Kohler W. Ozegowski J.H. Hribalova V. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Hyg. I. Abt. Orig. A. 1983; 255: 221-233PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hauser A.R. Schlievert P.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4536-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SpeB is the 39-kDa protein precursor of a cysteine protease (EC3.4.22.10). It is a highly conserved protein, which unlike the other exotoxins (SpeA and SpeC) is encoded by the chromosomal DNA. There is significant evidence for an important role of SCP in mediating invasion of the endothelium (6Lukomski S. Sreevatsan S. Amberg C. Reichardt W. Woischnik M. Podbielski A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2574-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The mature protease was shown to cleave human fibronectin and to degrade vitronectin (7Kapur V. Topouzis S. Majesky M.W. Li L.

All mice infected with a wild type pathogen died, whereas most of those challenged with S. pyogenes carrying the altered speB gene survived. In microbial cultures of S. pyogenes, SpeB is secreted to the culture medium. The proenzyme has only one cysteine residue that can be oxidized readily (13Bustin M. Lin M.C. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 846-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under a reducing environment (DTT, β-mercapthoethanol) the protein catalyzes its own processing. In a previous study we characterized the in vitro stepwise autoprocessing of SpeB and identified five cleavage sites (14Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Griffith D. Ménard R. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown by Kagawa et al. (15Kagawa T.F. Cooney J.C. Baker H.M. McSweeney S. Liu M. Gubba S. Musser J.M. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), four of these sites occupy accessible loops in the pro-region, explaining the bimolecular autoprocessing of the proenzyme (14Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Griffith D. Ménard R. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Kagawa T.F. Cooney J.C. Baker H.M. McSweeney S. Liu M. Gubba S. Musser J.M. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Three of the four accessible sites have the same amino acids (Ile-Lys) in positions P2-P1 (16Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of Abz-peptides corresponding to the SpeB autoprocessing sites occurs at the same peptide bond as expected from the zymogen autoprocessing studies. The substrate Abz-AAIKAGAR, homologous to the first autoprocessing cleavage site, showed the highestkcat/KM value (7.7 103 ×m−1s−1). Therefore, this sequence was chosen to design a series of IQF substrates. The IQF substrates are composed of a varying length peptide flanked at the N terminus by a fluorophore, o-aminobenzoic acid, and at the C-terminal end by 3-nitrotyrosine or 4-nitrophenylalanine that acts as a fluorescence quencher. The use of extended IQF substrates will allow the determination of the endopeptidase activity of SCP and permit a more systematic evaluation of substrate specificity. In this study, several IQF substrates were prepared and tested against the mature streptococcal cysteine protease. All IQF and p-nitroanilide substrates were synthesized using amino acid derivatives purchased from Bachem Inc. (Torrance, CA) and resins from Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). DTT was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and E-64 from IAF Biochem International Inc. (Laval, Quebec, Canada). The S. pyogenes strain B220 was used for production and purification of SpeB. The proenzyme was purified from the culture broth in two steps as described previously (14Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Griffith D. Ménard R. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture broth was fractionated by ion exchange chromatography on CM-Sepharose (0–1 m NaCl gradient, 20 mmacetate buffer, pH 5.0) followed by the hydrophobic chromatography on butyl-Sepharose (1.6–0 m ammonium sulfate gradient in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0). Fractions of pure zymogen were concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mm bis-Tris propane buffer, 100 μm mercuric chloride, pH 7.0. To prepare mature SCP, the zymogen was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm DTT. Excess DTT was removed from the processed SCP by filtration on Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 20 mm bis-Tris propane, 100 μm mercuric chloride, pH 7.0. The enzyme was then concentrated, filter-sterilized, and stored at 4 °C. All quenched fluorescent substrates were synthesized manually by the Fmoc strategy and prepared in the C-terminal amide form as described previously (17Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Song S.Y. Ponce M.L. Hoffman M.P. Powell S.K. Miyoshi K. Otaki A. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32198-32205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized in a stepwise manner using 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxy resin (Rink acid resin). N-Methyl pyrrolidone was used as a solvent and diisopropylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxybenzotriazole as condensing agents. For deprotection of N-α-Fmoc groups, 20% piperidine in N-methyl pyrrolidone was employed. The following side chain-protecting groups were used: trityl-asparagine, glutamine, and histidine; t-butyl-aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, threonine, and tyrosine; 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl-arginine; andt-butoxycarbonyl-lysine. Peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, thioanisole, m-cresol, ethanedithiol, H2O (80:5:5:5:5, v/v) at 20 °C for 2 h. Crude peptide products were precipitated and washed with ethyl ether, redissolved in 50% acetic acid, and purified by reverse-phase HPLC (using a Vydac C18 column and a gradient of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The purity and identity of the peptides were confirmed by HPLC and mass spectrometry (Sciex API IIIE triple quadrupole electronspray mass spectrometer, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). This substrate was synthesized by reacting H-AIK(Boc)-pNA with benzoic acid/ dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (18Nomizu M. Iwaki T. Yamashita T. Inagaki Y. Asano K. Akamatsu M. Fujita T. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1993; 42: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). H-AIK(Boc)-pNA was obtained from Fmoc-AIK(Boc)-pNA, which in turn was obtained by coupling of Fmoc-A-OH and H-IK(Boc)-pNA. The Fmoc group was removed with 20% piperidine, and the t-Boc blocking group with trifluoroacetic acid. Crude pNA substrate preparations were precipitated with diethyl ether, redissolved in 20% acetic acid, and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. The purity and identity of the substrate were confirmed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. SCP activity was determined in a 96-well plate format by monitoring the changes in fluorescence upon substrate hydrolysis using the Cytofluor Multiwell Plate Reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with excitation (320 ± 20 nm) and emission (440 ± 40 nm) filters. Because the experiments were carried out at (S) < KM , thekcat/KM values were calculated by dividing initial velocities by enzyme and substrate concentrations. The concentration of SCP was estimated spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficientE280 nm = 45 244m−1 cm−1 (19Liu T.-Y. Elliott S.D. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1971: 609-647Google Scholar) and verified by active site titration with E-64 (20Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). For the IQF substrates, calibration curves were obtained as described previously (21Nägler D.K. Storer A.C. Portaro F.C.V. Carmona E. Juliano L. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12608-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An important inner filter effect can be observed at high substrate concentrations, but this effect is not significant at substrate concentrations lower than 20 μm and did not interfere with the experiments carried out at 10 μm substrate. The kinetic characterization of SCP using Abz-peptides (non-quenched) as substrates was done as described previously (14Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Griffith D. Ménard R. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The influence of pH on the endopeptidase activity of SCP was obtained by determiningkcat/KM values for selected IQF substrates in the pH range of 3 to 10. The calibration curves were obtained for the entire pH range used in the study, to take into account the pH dependence of Abz fluorescence. The pKa for ionization of 3-nitrotyrosine in Abz-AIKAG-Y(3NO2) was determined from a plot of absorbance at 430 nm as a function of pH. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. The activity of SCP against Bz-AIK-pNA was determined in a 96-well plate assay. Each well contained 200 μl of the reaction mixture, composed of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 25–1000 μm substrate. The reaction was initiated with 24 nm SCP, and change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored in 5-s intervals using a Spectra MAX 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The kinetic parameters were calculated from initial rates by nonlinear regression of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Samples containing 25 μm IQF substrate were hydrolyzed up to 50% with SCP in 50 mm phosphate, 2 mm β-mercapthoethanol, pH 7.0. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.5%. A 50-μl sample was injected onto C18 silica gel column and separated with a linear gradient (1%/min) of acetonitrile in water, both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Intact substrate and hydrolysis products were detected using UV (210 nm) and fluorescence detectors (Waters, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The HPLC peaks were collected, freeze-dried, re-dissolved in 5% acetic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and analyzed by MS. The presence of both H-GA-Y(3NO2) and Abz-AIK-OH in substrate hydrolysates (see Table II) was also verified by HPLC (retention times 21.3 and 23.5 min, respectively). In most cases only one fluorescent product was observed on the HPLC chromatogram. Any deviation from this pattern is indicated in the text.Table IIInfluence of substitutions at positions P1 ′, P1 , P2 , and P3 on the rate of IQF substrate hydrolysis by SCPAbz-P3-P2-P1 ↓ P1′-P2′-Y(3NO2)kcat/KMCleavage site (HPLC/MS)m−1 · s−1Control (Abz-AIKAG-Y(3NO2))2.8 ± 0.6 × 105K-AP1 position (Abz-AIXAG-Y(3NO2)) X = arginine2.2 ± 0.4 × 105R-A norleucine8.2 ± 1.3 × 103Nle-A glutamic acid1.7 ± 0.2 × 104E-A glycine5.0 ± 1.1 × 104G-A and 2-nd minor siteP2 position (Abz-AXKAG-Y(3NO2)) X = phenylalanine1.6 ± 0.3 × 105K-A valine4.0 ± 1.4 × 104K-A norleucine2.1 ± 1.1 × 104K-A leucine3.3 ± 0.3 × 103K-A alanine1.6 ± 0.8 × 103K-A2-aOnly free Abz and AG-Y(3NO2) were detected by HPLC. tert-butlylglycine6.4 ± 0.4 × 102K-A cyclohexylglycine5.4 ± 0.1 × 102K-A phenylglycine5.8 ± 0.1 × 102G-Y(3NO2) glycine<5 × 102P3 position (Abz-XIKAG-Y(3NO2)) X = glycine1.9 ± 0.5 × 105K-A valine2.6 ± 1.1 × 105K-A leucine3.3 ± 0.6 × 105K-A phenylalanine2.7 ± 0.1 × 105K-A glutamic acid2.7 ± 0.2 × 105K-A lysine1.5 ± 0.3 × 105K-A proline1.5 ± 1.1 × 103K-AP1′ position (Abz-AIKXG-Y(3NO2)) X = valine1.8 ± 0.6 × 105K-V glycine2.1 ± 0.7 × 105K-G isoleucine3.2 ± 1.5 × 105K-I leucine2.9 ± 0.3 × 105K-L phenylalanine3.2 ± 0.7 × 105K-FThe kcat/KM values were determined as described in Table I.2-a Only free Abz and AG-Y(3NO2) were detected by HPLC. Open table in a new tab The kcat/KM values were determined as described in Table I. To probe the endopeptidase activity of SCP, internally quenched fluorescent substrates derived from the autoprocessing sites of SpeB were synthesized and tested against mature SCP (Table I). The first IQF substrates synthesized were octamer derivatives of the identified processing sites in SpeB. The results obtained with these substrates show the same pattern of relative activity as obtained earlier with Abz-peptide octamers (14Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Griffith D. Ménard R. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the IQF substrate Abz-SAAIKAGA-Y(3NO2) by SCP displayed the highestkcat/KM value (2.6 ± 0.6 104 ×m−1s−1), and the HPLC and mass spectrometry analyses showed that cleavage occurs at the predicted site (K↓A). This peptide, corresponding to the first autoprocessing site, was therefore chosen as a template for the substrates used in this investigation.Table IHydrolysis of IQF substrates corresponding to octamer and pentamer homologues of the SpeB autoprocessing sites by SCPAutoprocessing siteSubstrate sequencekcat/KMm−1 · s−1Octamers 1Abz-SAAIK↓AGA-Y(3NO2)2.6 ± 0.6 × 104 2Abz-LDKVN↓LGG-Y(3NO2)1.9 ± 0.3 × 104 3Abz-VEQIK↓ENK-Y(3NO2)4.5 ± 0.6 × 103 4Abz-DTTYA↓GT↓A-Y(3NO2)2.2 ± 0.9 × 103 5Abz-TAEIK↓QPV-Y(3NO2)9.6 ± 2.2 × 103Pentamers 1Abz-AIK↓AG-Y(3NO2)2.8 ± 0.6 × 105 2Abz-KVN↓LG-Y(3NO2)2.2 ± 0.5 × 104 3Abz-QIK↓EN-Y(3NO2)7.3 ± 2.4 × 104 4Abz-TYA↓GT-Y(3NO2)5.5 ± 1.7 × 104 5Abz-EIK↓QP-Y(3NO2)1.1 ± 0.3 × 105The reaction was carried out in 96-well plates using 10 μm substrate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 4 nmSCP.

To define how subsite occupancy affects the endopeptidase activity of SCP, a series of IQF substrates of varied length was first synthesized. The longest substrates contain eight amino acid residues in the peptide portion separating the fluorescence donor from the quencher group. As shown in Fig. 1, they are hydrolyzed by SCP with relatively lowkcat/KM values (2.6 104 × m−1s−1 or lower). The best substrates obtained contain three amino acids in the nonprimed position (i.e. AIK in P3-P2-P1). When the unprimed side of the substrate is extended beyond alanine in P3, 6–17-fold decreases inkcat/KM are observed. However, the presence of the amino acid residue in P3 is important because a significant decrease in activity results from replacement of alanine by Abz in P3 (Fig. 1). On the other hand, varying the length of the substrate on the primed side of the scissile bond has a relatively low effect on activity. The highest activity (kcat/KM = 2.8 ± 0.6 105 × m−1s−1) is observed for the pentamer Abz-AIKAG-Y(3NO2), which spans subsites S3 to S2′ on the enzyme. It is important to note that all of the substrates shown in Fig. 1 are cleaved after lysine. Similar effects were noted for other substrates corresponding to the autoprocessing sites reported in Table I. Decreasing the length of the peptide portion of these substrates from octamers to pentamers has no effect on the position of the scissile bond but leads to an overall 10–25-fold increase inkcat/KM except for the octamer/pentamer substrates representing the second autoprocessing site, where no change in activity is observed (Table I). The best endopeptidase activity is therefore observed when subsites S3 to S1′ on the enzyme are occupied by amino acid residues for the substrate. It must be noted that in a previous study it was shown that Z-VR-MCA (benzyloxycarbonyl-l-valine-l-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) is a rather poor substrate for SCP (14Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Griffith D. Ménard R. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Considering the need for a substrate to contain an amino acid residue able to interact in subsite S3 of the enzyme, the peptidyl p-nitroanilide derivative Bz-AIK-pNA was synthesized and tested as a substrate for SCP. Thekcat/KM was determined to be 3.5 ± 0.5 103 ×m−1s−1, a value 39-fold lower than the kcat/KM for hydrolysis of Abz-AIK-Y(3NO2). The 3-nitrotyrosine group was chosen as the fluorescence quencher to assure a better reduction of basal fluorescence for the uncleaved substrates. Under assay conditions, the signal to background ratio for these substrates ranged from 20 to 40 with the Y(3NO2) residue compared with a ratio of ∼4 when using 4-nitrophenylalanine with the more extended substrates (e.g. 6 amino acids). The fact that the quencher possesses an ionizable group (Y(3NO2)) could however present a problem in result interpretation, because this ionization might affect or modulate the rate of substrate hydrolysis. To verify this hypothesis, the pH activity profile for hydrolysis of substrates containing the Y(3NO2) group was determined and compared with that of a corresponding substrate containing the non-ionizable F(4NO2) group as quencher. The results are presented in Fig. 2. The data can be fitted to models that consider that either one or two ionizable group(s) modulates activity. For the substrate Abz-AIKAG-F(4NO2), only one pH-dependent transition is observed in the acid range of the profile, with a pKa of 4.78. A similar sigmoidal pH activity profile with only one pKa value (4.44) was observed by Kortt and Liu (22Kortt A.A. Liu T.-Y. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) when testing SCP activity against neutral and positively charged acyl-amino acid esters. For the substrate Abz-AIKAG-Y(3NO2), in addition to the transition in acidic pH region (pKa = 4.70), the activity is observed to decrease at pH higher than ∼7, with a pKa of 7.57 (Fig. 2). This modulation of activity in the pH range 6.5–8.5 is attributed to ionization of the Y(3NO2) group. The pKa for ionization of the substrate Y(3NO2) group, determined by measuring the influence of pH on absorbance at 430 nm, was evaluated at 7.13. In addition, it must be noted that despite the difference in the pH activity profiles, thekcat/KM values determined for Abz-AIKAG-Y(3NO2) and Abz-AIKAG-F(4NO2) at pH 7.0 are very similar. From the pH activity profiles presented in Fig.2, it is clear that ionization of the Y(3NO2) group does not interfere with the determination of kinetic (kcat/KM ) parameters. Three of five identified autoprocessing sites in SpeB bear theXIK-X′ motif (14Doran J.D. Nomizu M. Takebe S. Griffith D. Ménard R. Ziomek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In particular, a hydrophobic residue is found in P2 of all five autoprocessing sites (Ile, Tyr, or Val). This suggests that the nature of the residue in position P2 could be important for substrate recognition by SCP. To investigate the effect of the P2residue on substrate hydrolysis by SCP, Abz-AXKAG-Y(3NO2) substrates were prepared withX = Phe, Leu, Asn, Val, Ala, or Gly. The results are presented in Table II. The highest activity was observed for the substrate with isoleucine in P2, which corresponds to the residue found in the consensus sequence XIK-X′. The substrate with phenylanine at P2 gave a slightly lower activity. Another hydrophobic residue (Val) also yielded a substrate that was hydrolyzed rapidly by SCP (kcat/KM 7-fold lower than for P2 = Ile). A notable exception is leucine, where kcat/KM was found to be 86-fold lower than observed for the substrate with isoleucine in P2. Lack of detectable enzymatic activity against Abz-ALKAG-OH (data not shown) further supports the preference of SCP for isoleucine over leucine in P2 position. This result is quite interesting, because the two amino acids differ only by side-chain branching. To probe further the effect of side-chain length and branching, four IQF substrates with unnatural amino acids (norleucine (Nle), tert-butylglycine (Tbg), phenylglycine (Phg), and cyclohexylglycine (Chg)) were synthesized. All four substrates showed from 13- (Nle) to 470-fold (Tbg, Chg, and Phg) lower activities compared with the substrate Abz-AIKAG-Y(3NO2). It must be noted that although Abz-APhgKAG-Y(3NO2) was hydrolyzed by SCP, it was cleaved between residues Gly and Y(3NO2). Finally, very low or undetectable enzymatic activity was observed for IQF substrates with alanine and glycine in P2. The structural diversity of the side chains for the residues present at position P2 of the various substrates can be used to probe the topology of the S2 subsite of SCP. A more detailed analysis of the data is in progress; however, it is clear that SCP can readily accommodate substrates containing an hydrophobic residue at position P2, and that the enzyme displays some topological preference (Ile > Phe > Val > Nle > Leu > Ala > Tbg > Chg > Phg, Gly) for the P2 residue in a substrate. Substrates were also synthesized to investigate the specificity at positions P1, P3, and P1′. Four derivatives of Abz-AIKAG-Y(3NO2) with different residues in position P1 were prepared (P1 = Arg, Nle, Glu, Gly). The highestkcat/KM is observed for the substrates with lysine or arginine in P1 (Table II). Thekcat/KM value is 5-fold lower when glycine is in P1, and 17- or 35-fold lower with glutamic acid and norleucine, respectively. A similar difference inkcat/KM was observed for nonquenched Abz-peptides with lysine and glutamic acid in P1 position (data not shown). As pointed out earlier in this article, the presence of an amino acid residue in the position P3 of IQF substrates appears to be important for SCP activity. To define how the nature of the P3 residue affects specificity, alanine in the control substrate (Abz-AIKAG-Y(3NO2)) was replaced by Gly, Val, Leu, Phe, Glu, Lys, and Pro (Table II). No significant effect was observed on the rates of hydrolysis except for the substitution of alanine by proline, which led to a 180-fold decrease inkcat/KM . However, removal of alanine and shifting Abz to the P3 position led to a 9-fold decrease in kcat/KM value (Fig. 1). Our data also show no significant effect of P1′ substitutions on the second order rate constant,kcat/KM (Table II). SpeB is only one of many virulence factors forS. pyogen"

High intracellular osmolarity increases cellular volume because of a net movement of water into the cell. The activation of highly regulated efflux mechanisms for intracellular ions elicited by cell swelling contributes to cellular regulatory volume decrease.

The involvement of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway in the regulation of the expression of KCC1 mRNA, the most abundant KCC isoform expressed in VSMCs (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C.

We used primary cultures of freshly isolated rat VSMCs expressing sGC (α1/β1) mRNAs and the two type I versions of PKG (α/β) to determine whether the NO/cGMP signal transduction pathway is involved in the regulation of KCC1 mRNA expression, as well as the role ofde novo transcription and translation. As recently reported for KCC3 mRNA expression in VSMCs (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol.

In addition to SNP, we tested the effect of YC-1, a NO-independent activator of sGC. Activation and inhibition of PKG-I by 8-Br-cGMP and KT5823, respectively, were also assessed on KCC1 mRNA expression. Actinomycin D, an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis, and cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, were used to determine the mechanism involved in KCC1 mRNA expression. SNP, YC-1, LY83583, KT5823, 8-Br-cGMP, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium, TRIzol reagent for total RNA extraction, and all tissue culture grade or molecular biology reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

VSMCs, grown in 6-well culture flasks were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum/antibiotics as described elsewhere (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K.

Only 90–95% confluent rat VSMCs at passage 1 were used for our experiments after 24 h of serum deprivation. Total RNA from rat VSMCs in primary culture was obtained by using the TRIzol reagent following the instructions of the manufacturer. Specific sets of primers for rat KCC1, sGC (α1/β1), and human PKG-I (α/β) mRNAs were synthesized according to the sequences published previously (7Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III., B. J.

The primers were used to obtain the first cDNA strand by RT at 48 °C for 45 min and denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C. The subsequent amplification of the cDNAs was done by PCR: denaturation, 1 min at 94 °C; annealing, 1 min at 55 °C; and extension, 1 min at 68 °C during 40 cycles in a PerkinElmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The bands (KCC1, 419 bp; sGCα1, 466 bp; sGCβ1, 284 bp; PKG-Iα, 262 bp, PKG-Iβ, 471 bp; and actin, 285 bp) were visualized with ethidium bromide. All of the ethidium bromide-stained gels were depicted as inverse images for clear results. Negative RT-PCR controls were done in the absence of RNA and/or reverse transcriptase. The semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis for KCC1 mRNA expression relative to actin mRNA was done as published previously (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with some modifications. RT-PCR reactions were performed preparing a master RT-PCR mix containing 0.5 μg of total RNA from VSMCs and aliquoted in two separate tubes containing 100 pmol of each of the specific primers for KCC1 and 50 pmol for actin, respectively. RT-PCR followed the same conditions as described above during 28 cycles for KCC1 and 23 cycles for actin. Under these conditions the efficiency of the RT-PCR reaction for those genes did not plateau, and the number of cycles used in these experiments was kept to a minimum. Ethidium bromide-stained gels were scanned (Photodyne) and analyzed with Scion imaging software (Scion Corp.). The analysis of multiple intergroup differences in each experiment was conducted by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. A pvalue of <0.05 was used as the criterion of statistical significance. Except where indicated, all values were obtained from three independent experiments in which at least triplicate samples were assayed. To ensure that primary cultures of VSMCs at passage 1 express the main components of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway under our experimental conditions, we performed RT-PCR with a specific set of primers to test whether both isoforms of the sGC (36Papapetropoulos A. Marczin N. Mora G. Milici A. Murad F. Catravas J.D. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), as well as the two different isoforms of PKG-I (23Soff G.A. Cornwell T.L. Cundiff D.L. Gately S. Lincoln T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), were present. Fig.1 shows that primary cultures of rat VSMCs at passage 1 express sGCα1 and sGCβ1 mRNAs as well as PKG-Iα and KCC1 mRNAs of the expected sizes. We also detected very low levels of the PKG-Iβ mRNA under our experimental conditions. These results indicate that the major components of the NO/cGMP signaling cascade are present at the mRNA level and show optimal conditions for studying the actions of NO donors and cGMP analogs in VSMCs. KCC1 mRNA is expressed at higher levels than KCC3 mRNA in VSMCs, and the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway is involved in the acute regulation of KCC3 gene expression (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the mechanisms involved in KCC1 mRNA regulation by using SNP as a NO donor, because most of the actions of nitrosovasodilators are mediated through stimulation of the cGMP-generating enzyme, sGC (18Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar, 20Andreopoulos S. Papapetropoulos A. Gen. Pharmacol. 2000; 34: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fig.2, A and C, show the time course and concentration-dependent effects, respectively, of 2 h of SNP treatment on KCC1 mRNA expression levels. The respective semiquantitative actin-normalized densitometric analyses are also shown (Fig. 2, B and D). These results clearly show that SNP was able to induce KCC1 mRNA expression in sGC/PKG-I expressing rat VSMCs in primary culture in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. The involvement of sGC in SNP-induced KCC1 mRNA expression was studied by incubating VSMCs with SNP in the presence or absence of the well characterized sGC inhibitor, LY83583. As shown in Fig. 3, SNP-induced KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs was effectively blocked by LY83583, suggesting an sGC-dependent mechanism for SNP. However, we corroborated the direct participation of sGC in the regulation of KCC1 mRNA expression by incubating VSMCs with YC-1, a NO-independent stimulator of sGC (37Lee Y.C. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, A and B, YC-1 increased the KCC1 mRNA expression levels up to a concentration of 50 μm. Higher YC-1 concentrations resulted in a visible crystallization of the drug in the culture medium. As anticipated, YC-1-stimulated KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs was abolished by coincubation with 50 μm LY83583 (Fig. 4, C andD), validating the role of sGC on KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs.Figure 4Effect of YC-1 on KCC1 mRNA expression levels in VSMCs.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to test whether PKG activity is involved in the regulation of KCC1 mRNA expression, we incubated freshly isolated rat VSMCs with 8-Br-cGMP at concentrations known to stimulate PKG-I (38Lincoln T.M. Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Cornwell T.L. Soff G.A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), protein phosphorylation (27Kim S.O. Xu Y.-J. Katz S. Pelech S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and KCC3 mRNA expression (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in VSMCs. As shown in Fig. 5,A and B, KCC1 mRNA expression was acutely stimulated by the cGMP analog at the indicated exposure time and drug concentrations. Because not all the effects of cGMP are mediated by activation of PKG-I (39Lincoln T.M. Komalavilas P. Boerth N.J. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Cornwell T.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 305-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the above results suggest, but do not prove, that PKG-I activity participates in the acute regulation of KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs. In fact, 8-Br-cGMP- induced KCC1 mRNA expression partially disappeared in the presence of KT5823, a known inhibitor of PKG-I (23Soff G.A. Cornwell T.L. Cundiff D.L. Gately S. Lincoln T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 6,A and B. KT5823 per se had no effect on basal KCC1 mRNA expression (Fig. 6, B andC). Higher KT5823 concentrations (>5.0 μm) resulted in visible cellular detachment from the culture plates and were not investigated further. The NO/cGMP signaling pathway regulates the expression of several genes via RNA-polymerase II-independent mechanisms (31Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For example, KCC3 mRNA expression is acutely up-regulated by 8-Br-cGMP in the presence of actinomycin D in VSMCs (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether de novo mRNA synthesis participates in the changes observed in 8-Br-cGMP-induced KCC1 mRNA expression. To this end, we incubated VSMCs with 8-Br-cGMP in the presence or absence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D and with actinomycin D alone for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, 8-Br-cGMP stimulated KCC1 mRNA expression even in the presence of actinomycin D, suggesting that 8-Br-cGMP increases KCC1 mRNA expression at the post-transcriptional level. Note that actinomycin D per se increased basal KCC1 mRNA expression by about 2-fold, probably by blocking transcription of a factor(s) that negatively regulates KCC1 mRNA levels or by directly stabilizing KCC1 mRNA. Both possibilities appear to be plausible because prolonged incubation of VSMCs with actinomycin D alone increase KCC1 mRNA expression (Fig. 7, C, bottom, andD, filled circles). Additionally, the 2-h effect of 8-Br-cGMP on KCC1 mRNA expression persisted after the removal of the analog from the culture medium even in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 7, C, top, and D, open circles). The latter result resembles the time course effect of 8-Br-cGMP alone on KCC1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5, A andB). The post-transcriptional up-regulation of KCC1 mRNA expression in response to 8-Br-cGMP and actinomycin D appears to operate through a similar mechanism(s), as suggested by the nonadditive effect of both drugs (Fig. 7, A and B). See “Discussion” for a further interpretation of Fig.7 D. Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs may or may not require ongoing protein synthesis. Hence, the role of translation in 8-Br-cGMP-induced KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs was investigated using cycloheximide as a protein synthesis inhibitor. VSMCs in primary culture were incubated with 8-Br-cGMP in the presence or absence of cycloheximide and with cycloheximide alone for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 8, 8-Br-cGMP, and inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide resulted in an increase in KCC1 mRNA expression to a similar extent. However, KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs that had been treated with 8-Br-cGMP was not increased further in the presence of cycloheximide. These results suggest that cycloheximide and 8-Br-cGMP utilize similar mechanisms to increase KCC1 mRNA expression. Because both cycloheximide and actinomycin D increased KCC1 mRNA expression (Figs. 7 and 8), but to a different extent, we tested the possibility of an additive effect between cycloheximide and actinomycin D on KCC1 mRNA expression. Thus, VSMCs in primary culture were coincubated with actinomycin D and cycloheximide for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 9, actinomycin D and cycloheximide alone increased basal KCC1 mRNA expression (≈2.0- and 3.9-fold over the control value, respectively), whereas cycloheximide when coincubated with actinomycin D increased KCC1 mRNA expression in an additive manner (≈6.1-fold increase over control value). Similar results were obtained when actinomycin D was added to the culture medium after a 2-h treatment with cycloheximide (results not shown). These results suggest that both actinomycin D and cycloheximide increased the expression of KCC1 mRNA apparently via different mechanism(s). Tissue and VSMC distribution of sGC and PKG-I isoforms and their physiological relevance are well established (17Hofmann F. Ammendola A. Schlossman J. J.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, dramatic changes in sGC and PKG-Iα mRNA levels and function have been reported in several normal, physiological, and pathological conditions depending on the tissue sources and culture conditions (20Andreopoulos S. Papapetropoulos A. Gen. Pharmacol. 2000; 34: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We detected α1 and β1 sGC mRNA as well as PKG-Iα and very low levels of PKG-Iβ mRNAs in rat VSMCs in primary culture by specific RT-PCR (Fig. 1). The presence of PKG-Iβ mRNA was not detected previously in rat VSMCs by Northern blot using specific probes (23Soff G.A. Cornwell T.L. Cundiff D.L. Gately S. Lincoln T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but its product was found in aortic smooth muscle by specific antibodies against PKG-Iβ (24Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This finding may reflect the fact that transcripts at very low expression levels are usually not detected by Northern blot. Taken together, these results indicate that the main components of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway were present in our primary cultures of rat VSMCs. Furthermore, the potential of VSMCs to respond to NO/cGMP signaling was demonstrated under our experimental conditions. Commensurate with and extending our previous reports on KCC activity and KCC3 mRNA expression in VSMCs (5Adragna N.C. White R.E. Orlov S.N. Lauf P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C381-C390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Adragna N.C. Zhang J. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: A114Google Scholar, 13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we show here that the NO donor SNP is able to induce KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs (Fig.2). Additionally, and because many of the biological actions of NO are mediated through the activation of sGC, we investigated the actions of LY83583, a known sGC inhibitor, on the NO donor-induced KCC1 mRNA expression. The inhibitor blocked the SNP-induced KCC1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3), commensurate with a sGC-mediated effect of SNP in KCC1 mRNA regulation. Although our data are consistent with a sGC-mediated increase in KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs, actions of NO donor byproducts cannot be ruled out. Independently of the mechanism(s) utilized by SNP or its derivatives in the induction of KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs, a direct role of sGC was validated using YC-1, a NO-independent stimulator of sGC (37Lee Y.C. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). YC-1 increased KCC1 mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). However, high concentrations (>50 μm) of YC-1 were unable to preserve the effect, most likely because of a visible crystallization of the drug in the culture medium. Taken together, and because LY83583 also inhibited the YC-1-stimulated KCC1 mRNA expression under our experimental conditions (Fig. 4, C and D), these results suggest that sGC participates in the induction of KCC1 mRNA expression, probably by increasing the intracellular levels of cGMP. Activation of sGC by NO donors produces cGMP (18Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 34: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a well known activator of PKG-I in VSMCs (16Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. Komalavilas P. Boerth N. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 149-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hofmann F. Ammendola A. Schlossman J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lincoln T.M. Dey N.B.

The hypothesis of a PKG-I-mediated effect on KCC1 mRNA expression was addressed in our study by using 8-Br-cGMP as a cGMP analog. We showed that 8-Br-cGMP increased KCC1 mRNA expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The maximal effect of 0.1 mm 8-Br-cGMP on KCC1 mRNA expression was seen beyond 2 h of stimulus, whereas it was reported at 1 h for KCC3 mRNA (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating the differential sensitivity of both closely related genes to the same stimulus. Furthermore, the maximal effect of the analog was reported to be at 0.1 mm for KCC3 mRNA (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as compared with 1.0 mm for KCC1 mRNA expression in the present study. The physiological relevance of the differential response of these two closely related volume regulator genes remains to be further investigated. We have shown previously that the maximal 8-Br-cGMP-induced KCC3 mRNA expression in VSMCs was completely blocked by 5 μm KT5823 (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a selective inhibitor of PKG with little or no effect at this concentration on other potential cGMP-activated kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinases (34Komalavilas P. Shah P.K. Jo H. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34301-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, KT5823, under identical experimental conditions as reported previously (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was unable to completely reduce 8-Br-cGMP-induced KCC1 mRNA expression levels to control values (Fig. 6). These results imply that, in VSMCs, the effects of 8-Br-cGMP on KCC1 mRNA up-regulation are mediated, at least in part, through activation of PKG itself. However, a differential sensitivity of KCC1 mRNA to the inhibitory actions of KT5823 with respect to KCC3 mRNA cannot be excluded. The absence of an effect of KT5823per se on basal KCC1 mRNA levels (Fig. 6, Band C) is in line with the observation that PKG-I is not required for basal KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs (41Di Fulvio M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: A114Google Scholar). The involvement of an alternative signaling transduction cascade cannot be ruled out because cGMP may target cAMP-dependent protein kinases, directly or indirectly, by increasing cAMP levels through inhibition of cAMP-phosphodiesterases (16Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. Komalavilas P. Boerth N. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 149-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Papapetropoulos A. Marczin N. Mora G. Milici A. Murad F. Catravas J.D. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the NO/sGC/PKG signaling transduction pathway is an up-regulator of KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs. In agreement with our previous results (13Di Fulvio M. Lincoln T.M. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21046-21052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and with the concept that NO is able to promote stabilization of different mRNAs in the absence of transcription (31Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), is the fact that inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D did not lower the 8-Br-cGMP-induced KCC1 mRNA expression to control values (Fig. 7, A andB). Additionally, the short-term effect (2 h) of 8-Br-cGMP still persisted for 24 h after removal of the analog even in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 7, C and D), resembling the time course effect of 8-Br-cGMP alone on KCC1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5). Therefore, the 8-Br-cGMP-mediated increase in KCC1 mRNA expression appears to occur at the post-transcriptional level rather than at the KCC1 gene transcription. On the other hand, actinomycin D alone increased basal KCC1 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7, Cand D), pointing to the existence of a short-lived mRNA(s) that either by itself or by its protein products negatively regulates KCC1 mRNA turnover. However, the presence of a putative short-lived protein(s) involved in KCC1 mRNA turnover is contradicted by the observation that actinomycin D-induced KCC1 mRNA expression was additive when coincubated with cycloheximide (Fig. 9) or with puromycin, another protein synthesis inhibitor (results not shown). These data indicate that transcriptional inhibition by actinomycin D may induce KCC1 mRNA expression independently of translation (and vice versa). Several lines of evidence support the view that transcriptional blockage increases stability of certain mRNAs in the absence of protein synthesis through the redistribution from nucleus to cytoplasm of pre-existing mRNA-stabilizing proteins (42Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 43Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 44Myer V.W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Whether the increase in KCC1 mRNA expression by actinomycin D correlates with redistribution of mRNA-stabilizing proteins in VSMCs remains to be determined. The role of active translation on KCC1 mRNA expression in VSMCs appears to be complex. We found that cycloheximide alone (as well as puromycin and anisomycin in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; results not shown), increased basal KCC1 mRNA expression (Fig. 8). At least two mechanisms (not mutually exclusive) may contribute to the induction of gene expression in response to cycloheximide: direct induction of gene transcription or stabilization of mRNAs independently of transcription (31Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 46Beelman C.A. Parker R. J. Biol.

Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Although the reason for the increase in KCC1 mRNA expression in response to cycloheximide is not clear at this point, the mechanism(s) appear to be independent of transcription, as it still occurs in the presence of actinomycin D. This idea is further in line with the concept that different mechanisms are utilized by both inhibitors because both effects were additive (Fig. 9) and with the concept that inhibition of elongation by cycloheximide and mRNA stability are intimately linked in eukaryotic cells (46Beelman C.A. Parker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9687-9692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Whether cycloheximide increases KCC1 mRNA stability in addition to, or independently of, its ability to block protein synthesis needs to be established. Most importantly, the fact that 8-Br-cGMP increased KCC1 mRNA expression to a similar extent as cycloheximide but in a nonadditive manner (as with puromycin; results not shown) suggests that protein synthesis inhibition and 8-Br-cGMP increase KCC1 mRNA expression via similar mechanism(s), probably by increasing the stability of KCC1 mRNA in a transcriptionally independent manner, because both effects were still observed in the presence of actinomycin D. Additionally, and because the effects of cycloheximide and actinomycin D on KCC1 mRNA expression were additive, the results suggest not only that transcription and translation blockage may increase, independently, KCC1 mRNA stability in VSMCs, but they also imply that 8-Br-cGMP might regulate KCC1 mRNA turnover through at least two different mechanisms. In conclusion, this study shows that SNP and direct stimulation of sGC by YC-1, as well as PKG-I stimulation by 8-Br-cGMP, increased KCC1 mRNA levels in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. SNP and YC-1 effects were abolished by LY83583, a sGC inhibitor, whereas PKG-I inhibition by KT5823 partially blocked KCC1 mRNA expression in response to 8-Br-cGMP. On the other hand, 8-Br-cGMP increased KCC1 mRNA expression at the post-transcriptional level, probably by increasing its stability. Thus, effects in addition to inhibition of transcription and translation by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, respectively, appear to determine KCC1 mRNA expression.

The enzyme was discovered in Escherichia coli by Foor and Brown (1Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who noted the apparently simultaneous formation of three products from GTP, namely formate, pyrophosphate, and an organic compound that was assigned as 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3 H)-pyrimidinone 5′-phosphate (Compound 2) on basis of indirect evidence (Fig.1). GTP cyclohydrolase II constitutes a potential antibiotics target for the following reasons: (i) numerous pathogenic bacteria, in particular Gram-negative organisms, are absolutely dependent on endogenous synthesis of the vitamin, because they are unable to absorb the vitamin from the environment because of the absence of an appropriate uptake system; (ii) GTP cyclohydrolase II is absent in animals that are dependent on exogenous supply of vitamin. The exploration of novel antibiotic targets is urgent in light of the fast development of microbial resistance against all antibiotic agents that are currently used. Studies on the reaction mechanism of riboflavin biosynthetic enzymes from bacteria could benefit the development of bactericidal inhibitors. It should also be noted that the enzymes of the riboflavin pathway are potential herbicide targets. The mechanistical details of GTP cyclohydrolase II are incompletely understood. Blau and co-workers (2Blau N. Bosshard R. Redweik U. Niederwieser A. Biochem. Clin. Asp.

The unknown second product was recently identified as the α anomer of Compound 2, which is formed by spontaneous isomerization of the enzyme product and constitutes an in vitro artifact (3Ritz H.

The hydrolytic opening of the imidazole ring of GTP catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase II has notable parallels in the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I, which converts GTP to dihydroneopterin 3′-triphosphate, the first committed intermediate in the biosynthetic pathways of tetrahydrobiopterin (4Kwon N.S.

GTP cyclohydrolase I was shown to hydrolyze the C-8–N-9 bond of GTP affording the formamide derivative, Compound 4, which is then converted to the 5-aminopyrimidine derivative, Compound 5, by hydrolytic release of formate (8Bracher A.

Compound 5 subsequently undergoes an Amadori reaction followed by ring closure affording the pteridine chromophore of dihydroneopterin 3′-triphosphate (Compound 6). Despite the mechanistic similarity, GTP cyclohydrolases I and II have no detectable sequence similarity. The rate-determining step of GTP cyclohydrolase I occurs relatively late in the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I (9Schramek N. Bracher A. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2622-2626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, this paper shows that the rate-determining step of GTP cyclohydrolase II is located at the start of the reaction sequence. 2-Amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3 H)-pyrimidinone 5′-triphosphate (Compound 4) was prepared as described earlier (8Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol.

Eberhardt S. Fischer M. Krieger C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Stopped flow experiments were performed with an SFM4/QS apparatus (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) equipped with a linear array of three mixers and four independent syringes. For stopped flow measurements, the content of a 1.5-mm light path quartz cuvette behind the last mixer was monitored with a Tidas diode array spectrophotometer (200–610 nm) equipped with a 15-watt deuterium lamp as light source (J&M Analytische Meβ- und Regeltechnik, Aalen, Germany). The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, and 5 mm MgCl2. GTP cyclohydrolase II was used at a concentration of 6.3 mg ml−1 (equivalent to 290 μm enzyme subunits), GTP was used at a concentration of 210 μm, and an equilibrium mixture of Compound 4 isomers (8Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used at a concentration of 440 μm. The enzyme solution was mixed with substrate solution at 30 °C at a ratio of 1:1 with a total flow rate of 4 ml s−1. At that flow rate, the calculated dead time is 7.6 ms. During the reaction, spectra integrated over 48 ms were recorded at intervals of 100 ms. Quenched flow experiments were performed with a SFM4/QS apparatus (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) equipped with a linear array of mixers, four independent syringes, and a computer-controlled valve. The apparatus was thermostated at 30 °C. A delay loop of 230-μl nominal volume was used. Syringe 1 contained a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, and 5 mmMgCl2. Syringe 2 contained 210 μm GTP in reaction buffer. Syringe 3 contained 6.3 mg ml−1GTP-cyclohydrolase II (equivalent to 290 μm active sites) in 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5, and 5 mmMgCl2. At the start of each experiment, the delay loop was washed with reaction buffer from syringe 1 and was then loaded with substrate solution from syringe 2 and with enzyme solution from syringe 3. The solutions were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) and at a flow rate of 4 ml s−1. After an appropriate delay, the reaction mixture in the delay loop was quenched by mixing with 0.2 mtrichloroacetic acid from syringe 4 at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) and a flow rate of 4 ml s−1. The effluent was collected. Samples were centrifuged to remove protein and were frozen at −70 °C until further analysis. Aliquots of 100 μl were injected into a reversed phase column (4.6 × 250 mm, Hypersil RP18, 5 μm, Schambeck, Bad Honnef, Germany). The column was developed with isopropanol/triethylamine/85% phosphoric acid/water (8:10:3:979, v/v, pH 7.0) at room temperature and a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored by a diode array photometer (J&M Analytische Meβ- und Regeltechnik, Aalen, Germany). Data were evaluated using the following parameters: GTP and GMP, ε254 nm = 13,700 m−1 cm−1 (11Dawson R.C.M. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1986: 109Google Scholar); 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3 H)-pyrimidindione 5′-phosphate (Compound 2), ε292 nm = 9,600m−1 cm−1 (12Dietrich R. Bencovic S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 6144-6145Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All calculations were run on an Intel PIII-600 personal computer. Rate constants were calculated by the program Scientist 2.02 (MicroMath Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Prior to numerical analysis, the data were corrected for absorbance of buffer and enzyme by subtraction of a blank data set obtained without addition of substrate. Data reduction and stronger weighting of early spectra were achieved by extracting 300 spectra on a pseudo-logarithmic time base from the difference data sets. These data sets were then analyzed using the program SPECFIT/32 3.0.17 (Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA). Single turnover quenched flow experiments were performed by mixing recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase II of E. coli with substoichiometric amounts of GTP (0.72 equivalents per enzyme subunit) at 30 °C. Reaction mixtures were quenched with trifluoroacetic acid. The substrate, GTP, the major product, Compound 2, and the minor product, GMP, were all detected in the quenched reaction mixture by HPLC. A typical experiment is shown in Fig.3. The depletion of GTP proceeded over a period of ∼50 s. The formation of 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3 H)-pyrimidinone 5′-monophosphate (Compound 2) was observed in the same time interval. The overall shape of the two respective curves was remarkably similar. In parallel with the formation of Compound 2, the formation of GMP was observed, albeit at a lower rate. The amount of GMP formed in the reaction over a period of 50 s was ∼7% as compared with the amount of Compound 2. The relative fractions of Compound 2 and GMP formed were similar to the partitioning observed in earlier steady state kinetic experiments (∼10%) (3Ritz H. Schramek N. Bracher A. Herz S. Eisenreich W. Richter G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22273-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No other heterocyclic species besides GTP, Compound 2, and GMP were observed in the chromatograms of the quenched flow reaction mixtures. These findings suggested tentatively that low molecular weight intermediates of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction such as the hypothetical 5-formamide type intermediate (e.g. Compound 4) were at best present in very low concentrations below the detection limits of HPLC analysis.

The best fit was obtained with the rate constants summarized in Table I. The lines in Fig. 3 were calculated with that data set.Table IRate constants obtained from quenched flow experiments (based on Eq. 1–4 using the program Scientist, MicroMath Inc., Salt Lake City, UT)Rate constant (s −1)k10.052 ± 0.002k20.0023 ± 0.00091 Open table in a new tab The production of Compound 2 requires the hydrolytic cleavage of 3 bonds (specifically, the N-7–C-8, and N-9–C-8 bonds in the imidazole ring and the α–β phosphoanhydride bond). Because the consumption of the substrate is essentially equivalent to the formation of products throughout the reaction sequence, the rate-determining step must be the first hydrolytic bond cleavage in the reaction sequence. Otherwise, a sigmoidal curve should have been observed for the formation of product. In an extended search for reaction intermediates, we performed stopped flow experiments monitored by multiwavelength photometry. These experiments were designed on basis of the absorbance properties of the reactants. GTP and the minor product, GMP, are virtually indistinguishable by ultraviolet spectrometry, because both compounds have the same chromophore with absorbance maxima at 254 nm and shoulders around 273 nm (Fig. 4). The major product, Compound 2, has an absorption maximum at 293 nm. The hypothetical formamide type intermediate, Compound 8, which had been expected to be formed on the basis of earlier experiments with GTP cyclohydrolase I (8Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), can be assumed to have the same ultraviolet absorbance as Compound 4, which has been reported earlier (Fig. 2) (8Bracher A. Fischer M. Eisenreich W. Ritz H. Schramek N. Boyle P. Gentili P. Huber R. Nar H. Auerbach G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The experimental conditions were similar to those used in the quenched flow experiments. The enzyme and the substrate, GTP, were mixed at a substoichiometric ratio of 0.7. Ultraviolet spectra were acquired at intervals of 100 ms. The spectra were corrected for the absorption contribution of the protein. A series of spectra from a typical experiment is shown in Fig.5 A. Selected spectra from that experiment are shown superimposed in Fig.6 A. The absorbance at 254 nm (i.e. at the λmax value of GTP) is characterized by a relatively rapid increase followed by a steady decrease (Fig. 7, A and B). On the other hand, the absorbance at 295 nm (i.e. at the λmax of the enzyme product, Compound 2) shows a steady increase. Notably, this trace does not appear to contain a sigmoidal component.Figure 6Selected spectra from the single turnover experiments shown in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Absorbance changes observed during single turnover stopped flow experiments with GTP cyclohydrolase II and GTP, respectively, Compound 4.

Solid lines represent the data obtained from numerical simulation using the kinetic constants in Table II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The absorbance at 279 nm remained virtually constant over a period of 280 s (Fig. 7, A and B). This is equivalent to the presence of an apparent isosbestic point at that wavelength (Fig. 6 A). The formation, in substantial amounts, of a formamide-type intermediate similar or identical to the intermediate 4 in the reaction sequence catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I would have been expected to afford a temporary increase of absorbance at 279 nm, which was not observed. The optical spectrum showed a slow increase of absorbance in the long wavelength range of about 340 nm (Fig. 7, A and B). The formation of that component continues progressively even after the conversion of GTP to product is virtually complete. The process conducive to the long wavelength absorption can therefore not be part of the enzyme reaction. In fact, a similar formation of components with long wavelength absorption had been noted earlier in studies with GTP cyclohydrolase I where it could be conclusively attributed to photo-oxidation of reaction components caused by the intense ultraviolet irradiation required for high-speed optical monitoring of the reaction process (13Bracher A. Schramek N. Bacher A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7896-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Numerical deconvolution of the data was performed using the program package SPECFIT/32. The analysis revealed an optical transient with a reconstructed spectrum closely similar to that of GTP. Moreover, the numerical deconvolution afforded spectra with clear similarity to these of GTP/GMP, the enzyme product, Compound 2, and the photoproduct. The reaction can be described by the following scheme. By combining the concentrations of Compound 2 and the artifactual photoproduct resulting from its decomposition, this scheme can be simplified as follows. It is important to note that the rapid appearance of the optical transient with a λmax of 248 nm appears not to be associated with a modification of the covalent structure of the substrate, GTP. More specifically, the transient reaches a maximum at 2 s, but the acid quench of the reaction mixture at that time showed hardly any decrease of GTP (see above). Hence, the optical transient in Fig. 8 A is suggested to represent a conformational modulation of substrate and/or enzyme. The rate constants for the optically observed processes are summarized in Table II. Values of 0.052 and 0.062 s−1 were obtained for the rate constants of the formation of enzyme product by quenched flow and stopped flow analysis in close agreement.Table IIRate constants obtained from stopped flow experiments with GTP (based on Eq. 5), respectively, Compound 4 (based on Eq. 7) and GTP cyclohydrolase IIRate constants (s −1)GTP as substrateCompound 4 as substratek30.92 ± 0.020.55 ± 0.02k40.062 ± 0.00020.028 ± 0.003k50.0020 ± 0.00010.0087 ± 0.0005k20.0023 Open table in a new tab Throughout the reaction sequence, the sum of the GMP, Compound 2, and the artifactual photoproducts rather accurately reflected the amount of GTP consumed. In agreement with the quenched flow data, we found no evidence for formation of an intermediate between GTP and the product, Compound 2, in appreciable concentrations. Most notably, we obtained no evidence for the formation of a formamide-type intermediate identical or similar to the intermediate 4 in the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I. This failure prompted additional stopped flow experiments using Compound 4 as substrate (see Fig. 5 B, Fig. 6 B, Fig. 7, C and D, and Fig. 8, C and D). This non-natural substrate is characterized by an absorbance maximum at 272 nm (Fig. 6). At this wavelength, we note a monotonous decrease of absorbance in Fig. 7, C and D. It is accompanied by a steady increase of absorbance at 295 nm, i.e. the λmax of the enzyme product, Compound 2. However, the increase of absorbance at that wavelength is substantially slower as compared with the experiment with GTP as substrate, thus indicating that the formamide 4 is less rapidly converted to product than the natural substrate, GTP. Numerical deconvolution disclosed a transient species whose optical spectrum was distinct from, but closely similar to, that of the substrate (Fig. 8 C). This transient was characterized by a slight shift of absorption properties as compared with Compound 4 and is reminiscent of the optical transient found with GTP as substrate (see A in Fig. 8 A). There was no evidence for the formation of GTP or GMP (i.e. by ring closure). The formation of a photoproduct caused by the intense ultraviolet exposure was similar to that observed in the earlier experiment with GTP as substrate. The reaction sequence can be described by the following scheme. This scheme can be simplified as follows. The numerical deconvolution of the absorbance data in Fig. 5 shows that the pyrimidine product, Compound 2, is produced less rapidly from Compound 4 than from GTP. Thus, Compound 4 does not fulfill the criteria for a kinetically competent intermediate. The GTP cyclohydrolases catalyzing the initial steps in the biosynthesis of folate and unconjugated pteridines (type I enzymes) and of riboflavin (type II enzymes) are slow catalysts with turnover numbers in the range of 1 to 5 per min and per subunit. The slow enzymes are likely to be rate-limiting for the biosynthesis of the heterocyclic cofactors that are only required in small amounts by comparison with bulk metabolites such as amino acids and nucleic acid precursors. Earlier studies on pre-steady state kinetics of GTP cyclohydrolase I identified the Amadori rearrangement of the carbohydrate side chain as the rate-determining step. The data in the present study suggest that the rate-limiting reaction in the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase II is the release of pyrophosphate under formation of a covalently protein-bound intermediate that can undergo three rapid hydrolytic reactions resulting in the opening of the imidazole ring, the release of formamide from the resulting formamide type intermediate, and the cleavage of the phosphoester or phosphoamide bond affording the enzyme product, Compound 2. More specifically, the covalently bound intermediate could be GMP linked to an amino acid side chain via a phosphoester or phosphoamide bond. This hypothetical scenario can explain the formation of the second enzyme product, GMP, if the hydrolysis of the covalent linkage of the intermediate to the enzyme is prior to the release of formate. The observed partitioning factor for the formation of GMP and Compound 2 of ∼10 would then suggest that the reactions conducive to ring opening proceed ∼10 times more rapidly than the hydrolysis of the covalent enzyme/substrate linkage. According to this hypothesis, one would also expect the formation of a formamide-type monophosphate (see Compound 10, Fig.9) that would arise if the enzyme/substrate linkage is broken after the opening of the imidazole ring but prior to the hydrolysis of the formamide motif of the hypothetical intermediate, Compound 8. Our failure to detect that product could be easily explained if the hydrolysis of the formamide proceeds more rapidly than the previous opening of the imidazole ring. In that case, the transient concentration of the covalently bound intermediate would be quite low, and consequently the amount of Compound 10 produced by partitioning of the various hydrolytic pathways may well be below the detection limit. In fact, our recent studies have suggested that the release of the formamide intermediate 4 by GTP cyclohydrolase I is more rapid than the preceding ring-opening reaction (9Schramek N. Bracher A. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2622-2626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Bracher A. Schramek N. Bacher A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7896-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Compound 4 can be converted to the product, Compound 2, but the reaction is less rapid as compared with GTP as substrate. Compound 4 is therefore not a kinetically competent intermediate but a substrate analog capable of undergoing catalytic transformation to Compound 2. The rate-determining step in the enzymatic conversion of Compound 4 should be the formation of the covalent adduct 7. Apparently, the formation of that adduct proceeds less rapidly with Compound 4 as substrate as compared with the physiological substrate, GTP, although the latter must pass through two hydrolytic reaction steps on its way to the covalent intermediate 9. The formation of a covalent linkage between enzyme and substrate is supported by the failure of GMP to serve as substrate for GTP cyclohydrolase II, which had already been noted by Foor and Brown (1Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also in line with the finding that 18O from solvent is incorporated into Compound 2 but not into pyrophosphate as shown recently (3Ritz H. Schramek N. Bracher A. Herz S. Eisenreich W. Richter G. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22273-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the involvement of a covalently enzyme-bound intermediate is as yet hypothetical. In light of the data reported in this paper, it is also obvious that the concentration of the enzyme-bound species would always be low, because the rate-determining step is the formation and not the decay of the enzyme-bound species. In any case, we must conclude that the initial section of the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase II proceeds in a strictly ordered fashion in which the release of pyrophosphate must precede the hydrolysis of the imidazole ring. In contrast, the second part of the reaction is subject to partitioning, which results in the formation of GMP as a minor product. The failure of the enzyme to convert Compound 4 into GTP by ring closure is also well in line with the hypothetical mechanism in Fig. 9. If the release of pyrophosphate is an obligatory first reaction step for any substrate to enter the reaction cascade, the enzyme-catalyzed transformation of Compound 4 to GTP would be impossible despite the favorable equilibrium constant for that reversible reaction. It should be noted in this context that Compound 4 is reversibly converted to GTP by the H179A mutant of GTP cyclohydrolase I. On the other hand, wild type GTP cyclohydrolase I does not detectably catalyze that reaction, probably because the transformation of the 5-formamide-type intermediate, Compound 4, to the 5-amino-type intermediate, Compound 5, is a relatively rapid reaction."

Several large DNA viruses encode their own capping enzymes, including poxviruses, African swine fever virus, baculoviruses, and Chlorella virus PBCV-1. The DNA virus enzymes catalyze the same series of three reactions as the cellular 5′ processing enzymes, in which the 5′ triphosphate end of the transcript is first hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase, the diphosphate end is then capped with GMP by GTP:RNA guanylyltransferase, and the GpppN cap is methylated by AdoMet:RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (1Shuman S.

All of the motifs in AcNPV Lef4 are conserved in the capping enzymes from other baculoviruses (Fig. 1) and in the 545-amino acid triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase domain of vaccinia virus capping enzyme (4Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yu L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol.

In contrast to the baculoviruses and poxviruses, Chlorella virus PBCV-1 encodes separate RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase enzymes, which are more closely related to the separately encoded triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components of the fungal capping apparatus than they are to the enzymes from other DNA viruses (11Ho C.K. Gong C. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1744-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6658-6664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The order of the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase motifs in the primary structures of baculovirus and vaccinia capping enzymes (H2N-triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase-COOH) mimics the temporal order of the cap-forming reactions. Are the two enzymatic functions linked in some way structurally? Mutational analyses of the vaccinia D1 protein showed that the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase active sites are distinct, i.e. single glutamate-to-alanine mutations in motifs A and C inactivate the vaccinia triphosphatase but spare the guanylyltransferase, whereas single alanine mutations in the COOH-terminal motifs affect the guanylyltransferase but spare the triphosphatase (6Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cong P. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6222-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was found that double glutamate-to-alanine mutations in motifs A and C of baculovirus Lef4 selectively inactivated the triphosphatase (4Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear if the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase domains of Lef4 or D1 are truly autonomous,e.g. as is the case for the bifunctional mammalian capping enzyme. Attempts to produce catalytically active subdomains of the vaccinia capping enzyme have thus far been unsuccessful (6Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A goal of the present study was to test whether an autonomous triphosphatase domain exists within baculovirus Lef4. Motifs A and C that define the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family consist of alternating glutamate side chains, usually interdigitated with alternating aliphatic/aromatic side chains. In the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase Cet1, motifs A and C are located within β strands (19Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The glutamate side chains of the β strands are pointed into the active site, whereas the hydrophobic side chains of the strands point down into the globular core of the protein. Three of the glutamates directly coordinate the manganese cofactor at the active site and a fourth glutamate coordinates a water molecule bound to the metal (19Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This hydrophilic/hydrophobic sequence pattern is reprised in Lef4 motif C and, with some variation, in motif A, suggesting that the structural context for metal binding by Lef4 may be similar to that of Cet1. To test the hypothesis that motifs A and C are involved in metal binding, we subjected the four glutamates of motifs A and C and the aspartates surrounding motif C to alanine scanning and conservative mutational analysis. A related goal of this effort was to explore the basis for the characteristic activation of NTP hydrolysis by manganese and cobalt, and the apparent inability of Lef4 to hydrolyze NTPs in the presence of magnesium, even though magnesium is perfectly able to activate the RNA triphosphatase function of Lef4 (3Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same divalent cation specificity in NTP hydrolysis is observed for other metal-dependent triphosphatase family members (7Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,9Pei Y. Lehman K. Tian L. Shuman S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with the exception of vaccinia D1, which is activated by magnesium to hydrolyze free NTPs (16Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Shuman S. Surks M. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11588-11598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Key questions are as follows: is this capacity truly unique to the poxvirus enzyme or does it require exceptional reaction conditions not tested previously with Lef4? Are there structural determinants at the active site of Lef4 that dictate selection of the divalent cation cofactor? Silent diagnostic restriction sites and single alanine or conservative amino acid substitutions were introduced into the Lef4 gene by PCR2 using the two-stage overlap extension method. Plasmid pET-LEF4 (4Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was the template for the first-stage PCR amplification. The mutated Lef4 genes were digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET-16b. The inserts were sequenced completely to confirm the presence of the desired substitutions and to ensure that no extra mutations had been acquired during amplification or cloning. Carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants were amplified by PCR using antisense primers that introduced a translation stop codon in lieu of the codons for Trp402 or Ile237 and a BamHI restriction site immediately downstream of the new stop codons. The 5′ sense primer introduced a BamHI restriction site immediately upstream of the start codon. The wild-type Lef4 gene was amplified in parallel to introduce a 5′ BamHI site. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and inserted into theBamHI site of the vector pET28-His-Smt3 (a gift from Dr. Chris Lima, Cornell Medical College). The resulting plasmids encode Lef4 polypeptides fused to an NH2-terminal His6-tagged Smt3 leader. The truncated proteins were named Lef4-(1–401) and Lef4-(1–236), respectively. The inserts were sequenced completely to confirm the presence of the desired substitutions and to ensure that no extra mutations were introduced during amplification or cloning. The His10-tagged versions of the wild-type and missense mutant Lef4 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (4Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant His10-Lef4 proteins were recovered in the 200 mm imidazole eluate fractions. The His6-Smt3-Lef4 proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as follows. One-liter cultures ofE. coli BL21(DE3)/pET28-His-Smt3-Lef4 were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin until theA 600 reached 0.6. The cultures were adjusted to 2% ethanol, chilled on ice for 30 min, and then incubated at 17 °C for 16 h with continuous shaking. The recombinant His6-Smt3-Lef4 proteins were isolated from the soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography (4Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recovered in the 50 and 100 mm imidazole eluate fractions. The enzyme preparations were dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 50 mm NaCl and then concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration using Millipore filter units with a 30-kDa cut-off pore size. The protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of serial dilutions of the Lef4 preparations in parallel with serial dilutions of a BSA standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the staining intensities of the Lef4 and BSA polypeptides were quantitated using a Digital Imaging and Analysis System from Alpha Innotech Corporation. ATPase activity of the Lef4 proteins was determined by measuring the extent of hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of different metal cofactors. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained various amounts of enzyme and either (a) 1 mm MnCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP; (b) 2 mmCoCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP; or (c) 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated with 1m formic acid. Aliquots of the mixtures were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates, which were developed with 0.5m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The reaction products were visualized and quantitated by scanning the TLC plates with a FUJIX BAS2000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μmγ-32P-labeled poly(A), either 0.3 mmMnCl2 or 1 mm MgCl2, and varying amounts of Lef4 were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and then quenched with 1 m formic acid. Aliquots of the mixtures were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates, which were developed with 0.75 m potassium phosphate, pH 4.3. The reaction products were visualized and quantitated by scanning the plates with a phosphorimager. γ-32P-Labeled poly(A) was synthesized as described previously (20Shuman S. Surks M. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11588-11598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of vaccinia D1-(1–545) indicated that its divalent cation specificity for ATP hydrolysis was pH-dependent (21Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5486-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether variations in pH might unmask a latent magnesium-dependent ATPase activity of baculovirus Lef4. We assayed ATP hydrolysis in Tris buffers from pH 4.0 to 9.5 in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP and either 2 mm MnCl, or 2 mm CoCl2, or 20 mm MgCl2 (Fig.2 A). Manganese-dependent ATPase was optimal at pH 7.5 to 8.0 and declined at lower or higher pH values. Cobalt-dependent ATPase was optimal at pH 6.5 to 7.5, yet was virtually nil at pH 8.5, where manganese was still quite active. As noted previously, magnesium did not support ATP hydrolysis at neutral pH, the favored range for manganese and cobalt (Fig. 2 A). The instructive finding was that low levels of magnesium-activated ATP hydrolysis were detected as the pH was increased to 9.0. Additional experiments compared the pH profiles of magnesium-dependent ATP hydrolysis at 0.1 mmATP and 1 mm ATP. We found that the extent of hydrolysis of 1 mm ATP was an order of magnitude higher than 0.1 mm ATP and that the activity with 1 mm ATP again showed a distinctive alkaline pH optimum, with little or no activity at neutral pH (Fig. 2 B). We then measured ATP hydrolysis at pH 9.0 as a function of magnesium concentration at two concentrations of ATP (1 and 3 mm). Activity with 1 mm ATP was optimal at 10–40 mm magnesium, whereas hydrolysis of 3 mm ATP was optimal at 20–40 mm magnesium. Little or no activity was observed when the magnesium concentration was below the level of input ATP. The salient finding was that the extent of ATP hydrolysis at 3 mm ATP at 20–40 mm magnesium was 3-fold higher than the activity with 1 mm ATP (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that much higher concentrations of ATP were required for activity in magnesium compared with the other divalent cations. Kinetic parameters for the manganese- and magnesium-dependent ATPase activities of Lef4 were determined by measuring the extent of 32Piformation as a function of [γ-32P]ATP concentration. Double-reciprocal plots of the data fit well to linear functions (Fig.2 D). We calculated a K m of 0.1 mm ATP and k cat of 13 s−1 for manganese-dependent ATP hydrolysis at pH 7.5 and a K m of 4 mm ATP andk cat of 30 s−1 for the magnesium-dependent ATPase at pH 9.0. TheK m for ATP was 40-fold higher with magnesium. These findings make clear that the prior failure to detect a magnesium-dependent ATPase activity of Lef4 stemmed from the choice of suboptimal pH and substrate concentrations for the activity measurements (3Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jin et al. (3Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that double mutants E9A,E11A (motif A) and E181A, E183A (motif C) abolished the RNA triphosphatase and ATPase activities of Lef4 without affecting the guanylyltransferase. The recently reported crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase revealed that the glutamates in motif A and motif C comprise the metal-binding site (19Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To better evaluate the contributions of the conserved acidic residues to catalysis by Lef4, we replaced Glu9, Glu11, Glu181, and Glu183 individually with alanine. Alanine mutations were also introduced at flanking acidic positions Asp172(conserved in all other Lef4 homologs aligned in Fig. 1), Asp185 (conserved as an acidic residue in most of the Lef4 homologs), Asp186, and Asp187. The Lef4-Ala proteins were produced in E. coli as His10fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the nickel-agarose imidazole eluates revealed a predominant 57-kDa polypeptide corresponding to His10-Lef4 (Fig. 3). The guanylyltransferase activity of each of the Lef4 and Lef-Ala preparations was demonstrated by label transfer from [α-32P]GTP to the enzyme to form a covalent enzyme-GMP adduct (data not shown). That the mutant enzymes retained guanylyltransferase activity indicated that the alanine mutations did not affect the global folding of the Lef4 protein. The RNA triphosphatase activities of the Lef4 and Lef4-Ala preparations were assayed by the release of 32Pi from γ-32P-labeled poly(A) during a 15-min incubation at pH 7.5 in the presence of 1 mm magnesium or 0.3 mmmanganese (the optimal pH and metal concentrations for the Lef4 RNA triphosphatase). The specific activities of the Lef4-Ala mutants were normalized to that of the wild-type enzyme and are shown in TableI. The salient findings were that: (i) the E9A and E11A mutations in motif A and the E181A mutation in motif C abrogated RNA triphosphatase activity with either magnesium or manganese as the cofactor (≤0.1% of wild-type specific activity); (ii) the E183A change in motif C abolished magnesium-dependent RNA triphosphatase activity, but the E183A mutant retained 4% residual activity in the presence of manganese; (iii) the D185A, D186A, and D187A mutants were as active as wild-type RNA triphosphatase with either magnesium or manganese; and (iv) the D172A mutant was 3–4-fold more active than wild-type RNA triphosphatase.Table IMutational effects on the phosphohydrolase activity of Lef4Lef4 mutantATPaseRNA TriphosphataseMnCl2CoCl2MgCl2MnCl2MgCl2% of WT% of WTE9A<0.10.10.40.1<0.1E9D16111.2481E9Q<0.1<0.10.70.1<0.1E11A<0.1<0.10.4<0.1<0.1E11D<0.1<0.10.10.90.1E11Q<0.1<0.10.40.20.1D172A9596130300410E181A0.4<0.10.40.10.1E181D70.91.9210.3E181Q<0.1<0.10.70.50.1E183A0.90.60.640.1E183D7656140130100E183Q410.9120.3D185A140180110140130D186A190310190140230D187A22033014060140The purified wild-type and mutant Lef4 proteins were titrated for ATPase activity in reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing either: (a) 1 mm MnCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP; (b) 2 mm CoCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP; or (c) 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP. The proteins were titrated for RNA triphosphatase activity in reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μmγ-32P-labeled poly(A), and either 0.3 mmMnCl2 or 1 mm MgCl2. All reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. ATPase and RNA triphosphatase specific activities were determined in the linear range of protein dependence and are expressed as percentages of the specific activity of wild-type Lef4. Each value is the average of at least two independent titration experiments. The ATPase turnover numbers for wild-type Lef4 were 8 s−1 for manganese, 5 s−1 for cobalt, and 4 s−1 for magnesium. The RNA triphosphatase turnover numbers were 30 min−1 for manganese and 23 min−1 for magnesium. Open table in a new tab The purified wild-type and mutant Lef4 proteins were titrated for ATPase activity in reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing either: (a) 1 mm MnCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP; (b) 2 mm CoCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP; or (c) 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP.

All reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. ATPase and RNA triphosphatase specific activities were determined in the linear range of protein dependence and are expressed as percentages of the specific activity of wild-type Lef4. Each value is the average of at least two independent titration experiments. The ATPase turnover numbers for wild-type Lef4 were 8 s−1 for manganese, 5 s−1 for cobalt, and 4 s−1 for magnesium. The RNA triphosphatase turnover numbers were 30 min−1 for manganese and 23 min−1 for magnesium. The ATPase specific activities were determined with three different divalent cation cofactors at their respective pH optima, and the activities were normalized to that of wild-type Lef4. The mutational effects on ATPase mirrored those observed for the RNA triphosphatase, to wit: (i) mutants E9A, E11A, E181A, and E183A were grossly defective in ATP hydrolysis with manganese, cobalt, and magnesium; (ii) mutants D172A, D185A, D186A, and D187A were at least as active as wild-type Lef4 (Table I). These results extend the work of Jin et al. (3Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and establish that each of the four conserved glutamates in motifs A and C is essential for Lef4 phosphohydrolase activity. The glutamate mutational effects are specific, insofar as alanine substitutions for four other neighboring carboxylate side chains were without deleterious effect on Lef4 activity. The four essential glutamates were substituted conservatively by aspartate and glutamine. The E9D, E9Q, E11D, E11Q, E181D, E181Q, E183D, and E183Q proteins were produced in E. coli as His10 fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose column chromatography (Fig. 3). Their RNA triphosphatase and ATPase specific activities (expressed as the percent of the wild-type specific activity) are shown in TableI. The expectation is that if an essential glutamate side chain is directly coordinating the metal cofactor via electrostatic interactions, then replacement of glutamate by glutamine would not restore triphosphatase activity above the residual level catalyzed the glutamate-to-alanine mutant. Whether an aspartate (which has a shorter distance from main chain to carboxylate) will restore activity depends on how well the “retracted” carboxylate can be accommodated within the coordination sphere of the metal cofactor. These heuristic points are illustrated by the contrasting effects of conservative mutations in the glutamates of motif A (Table I). We found that the E11D and E11Q mutants were defective in their RNA triphosphatase and ATPase functions with all of the metal cofactors tested. Thus, we construe that: (i) Glu11 is likely to coordinate the divalent metal directly, and (ii) the enzyme cannot flex its structure to bring an aspartate into the metal coordination sphere. Replacing Glu9 with glutamine also resulted in a gross catalytic defect with all of the metals, but the E9D mutant was selectively defective in magnesium-dependent phosphohydrolase function, with both RNA and free NTP substrates. Remarkably, the introduction of aspartate restored manganese-dependent RNA triphosphatase to 48% of the wild-type activity and partially restored manganese-dependent and cobalt-dependent ATPase to 16 and 11% of the respective wild-type levels. This represents a substantial gain-of-function compared with the activities of the E9A mutant. We surmise that: (i) Glu9 likely interacts directly with the metal cofactor, (ii) the enzyme can accommodate Asp9 in the metal coordination sphere, and (iii) the E9D mutation dramatically alters the divalent cation specificity of the Lef4 RNA triphosphatase. Possible explanations for this effect will be discussed. In motif C, the E181Q change did not revive triphosphatase activity with either RNA or free nucleotide. However, the E181D substitution restored significant manganese-dependent RNA triphosphatase (21% of wild-type Lef4 activity) while failing to hydrolyze the RNA substrate in the presence of magnesium (0.3% activity) (Table I). The E181D mutation also elicited a modest but significant gain-of-function in manganese-dependent ATP hydrolysis, with little salutary effect on cobalt-dependent and magnesium-dependent ATPase. The enzyme could apparently accommodate manganese, but not cobalt or magnesium. Changing Glu183 to glutamine resulted in 3–4-fold gains of activity in manganese-dependent RNA triphosphatase and manganese-dependent ATPase activities compared with the level of the E183A mutant (Table I). The striking finding was that introduction of aspartate restored activity across the board to wild-type or near wild-type levels. Thus, the enzyme easily accommodated the shortened linker arm of the aspartate side chain. Recombinant His10-Lef4 was subjected to proteolysis with increasing amounts of trypsin and V8 proteases. NH2-terminal sequencing of the undigested polypeptide by automated Edman chemistry after transfer from an SDS gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane confirmed that the NH2-terminal sequence (GHHHHH) corresponded to that of the recombinant gene product starting from the second residue of the His-tag (Fig.4 A). Apparently, the capping enzyme suffered removal of the initiating methionine during expression in E. coli. Scission of Lef4 by trypsin yielded two major products that were stable at levels of trypsin sufficient to cleavage all of the input Lef4: (i) a ∼16-kDa species (sequence HMDGYD) resulting from tryptic cleavage of the His-tag 2 residues upstream of Met1 of the Lef4 protein, and (ii) a mixture of two tryptic products migrating at ∼27 kDa, one of which (sequence IVYGDD) resulted from cleavage between Lys236 and Ile237 and a second fragment (sequence HMDGYD) originating from the N terminus of Lef4 absent the His-tag (Fig. 4 B). The Lys236-Ile237 cleavage site, denoted by anarrow above the Lef4 sequence in Fig. 1, is located downstream of triphosphate motif C and upstream of guanylyltransferase motif I. Treatment of Lef4 with V8 protease yielded multiple products that were resistant to digestion by V8 concentrations sufficient to cleavage all of the input Lef4 (Fig. 4 A). Initial scission at limiting V8 concentration produced an ∼40-kDa species that retained the original NH2 terminus of the His-tag (GHHHHH) and a ∼14-kDa species (sequence CGVNAS) arising from cleavage between Glu326 and Cys327. The Glu326-Cys327 cleavage site is conserved in other Lef4 homologs and is located within guanylyltransferase motif IIIa (see Fig. 1). Also arising at limiting V8 concentrations was a minor ∼12-kDa species (sequence CINYMN) generated by cleavage between Glu332 and Cys343; this site is located just downstream of guanylyltransferase motif IIIa (Fig. 1). At higher V8 concentrations, the ∼40-kDa species decayed and gave rise to an ∼24-kDa fragment that retained the NH2-terminal His-tag plus a ∼27-kDa species (sequence SKEIKL) arising from scission between Glu94 and Ser95. This site is located between triphosphatase motifs A and C within a segment of Lef4 that is not well conserved in other viral homologs. Thus, the Glu94-Ser95 dipeptide may demarcate a surface accessible loop within a putative triphosphatase domain. At the highest levels of V8, there appeared three new protease-resistant fragments. A ∼17-kDa band contained a mixture of two species, one (sequence YEFDDD) arising from cleavage between Glu181 and Tyr182 within triphosphatase motif C and a second (sequence ISYSIN) generated by cleavage between Glu11 and Ile12 in triphosphatase motif A (Fig. 1). This finding is remarkable in light of previous studies showing that the principal sites of V8 accessibility in the vaccinia triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase also mapped to the glutamates within motif A and C (6Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A ∼16-kDa fragment (sequence ILARIR) was formed by scission between Glu173 and Ile174, just upstream of motif C (Fig. 1). A small (∼10 kDa) fragment produced at the highest V8 concentration (sequence QKIVYG) resulted from scission between Glu234 and Gln235 (Fig. 4 A). The Glu234-Gln235 V8 site is immediately vicinal to the Lys236-Ile237 tryptic cleavage site (Fig. 1). This protease-sensitive segment between the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase motifs may therefore demarcate an interdomain linker. To determine whether the NH2 terminus of Lef4 comprises an autonomous triphosphatase domain, we engineered two COOH-terminal deletion mutants, Lef4-(1–401) and Lef4-(1–236). The Lef4-(1–401) derivative is truncated within guanylyltransferase motif V. Crystallographic analysis of Chlorella virus guanylyltransferase revealed that the protein consists of two structural domains separated by an interdomain cleft (14Håkansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The larger NH2-terminal domain includes motifs I, III, IIIa, and IV, whereas the COOH-terminal domain includes motif VI. Motif V resides within a flexible β strand that links the two folded domains. Thus, we chose to truncate Lef4 after residue 401, which demarcates the boundary between the two guanylyltransferase structural domains in theChlorella virus protein. The Lef4-(1–236) derivative is truncated at the trypsin-accessible site that we suggested might represent a boundary between putative triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase functional domains. Recombinant Lef4, Lef4-(1–401), and Lef4-(1–236) were produced in bacteria as NH2-terminal His6-Smt3 fusions (22Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and then purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 5). The use of the His6-Smt3 fusion system improved the solubility of the truncated recombinant Lef4 proteins. His6-Smt3-Lef4 migrated more slowly than His10-Lef4 during SDS-PAGE, as expected from the larger size of the His6-Smt3 leader. The truncated versions migrated more rapidly during SDS-PAGE, as expected. The recombinant proteins were assayed for manganese-dependent ATPase activity. Control titrations showed that the specific activity of the His6-Smt3-Lef4 protein was 90% of the activity of His10-Lef4, indicating that the His6-Smt3 tag did not adversely affect Lef4 function. Lef4-(1–401) was just as active as full-length Lef4 in manganese-dependent ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5), but was completely inert in enzyme-GMP adduct formation (not shown). We conclude that the COOH-terminal structural component of the guanylyltransferase domain does not include any residues involved in phosphohydrolase reaction chemistry. The more instructive finding was that Lef4-(1–236), which includes none of the guanylyltransferase motifs, retained nearly half of the of the wild-type triphosphatase activity (Fig. 5). ATP hydrolysis by Lef4-(1–236) was completely dependent on a divalent cation cofactor (not shown). We constructed and purified a mutated version of Lef4-(1–236) in which Glu11in motif A was replaced by alanine. The E11A change completely abrogated the manganese-dependent ATPase of the truncated Lef4-(1–236) protein (Fig. 5). We conclude that the 236-amino acid NH2-terminal fragment of Lef4 defined by limited digestion with trypsin comprises a fully autonomous metal-dependent triphosphatase domain. This is the first instance in which an autonomous triphosphatase domain has been delineated within a bifunctional viral triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase enzyme. Baculovirus Lef4 and vaccinia virus D1-(1–545) are bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase enzymes that catalyze the first two steps of mRNA cap formation. Both viral proteins contain the signature triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase motifs, which are arrayed in the order H2N-triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase-COOH. A similar organization of the catalytic motifs is seen in the bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase enzyme encoded by theKluyveromyces lactis cytoplasmic linear DNA plasmid pGKL2 (23Tiggemann M. Jeske S. Larsen M. Meinhardt F. Yeast. 2001; 18: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase enzymes of fungi and Chlorella virus contain the same constellations of catalytic motifs, the component activities reside on separate polypeptides. Whereas efforts to partition the vaccinia capping enzyme into triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase domains have not met with success, we show here that the NH2-terminal 236-amino acid segment of baculovirus Lef4 constitutes a “stand-alone” metal-dependent phosphohydrolase domain. The Lef4 triphosphatase domain boundary is demarcated within native Lef4 by closely spaced sites of accessibility to trypsin and V8 proteases, consistent with the existence of a flexible interdomain linker or a surface-exposed interdomain loop. Treatment of vaccinia D1-(1–545) with V8 did not result in cleavage between triphosphatase motif C and guanylyltransferase motif I (this interval in the D1 polypeptide contains four potential sites for V8 cleavage at glutamate); rather the principal V8-sensitive sites in D1 were located at the second glutamate in motif A at the first glutamate in motif C (6Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the same sites were cleaved during V8 proteolysis of Lef4. Therefore, we surmise that the metal-binding sites of the baculovirus and vaccinia triphosphatases are likely to be exposed on the protein surface, rather than enclosed within a tunnel, as it is in the yeast RNA triphosphatase Cet1 (19Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of Lef4 motifs A and C provides strong evidence that Glu9, Glu11, Glu181, and Glu183 are the constituents of the metal-binding site of the triphosphatase. Because glutamine substitutions at positions 9, 11, and 181 reduced RNA triphosphatase and ATPase activity by at least 2 orders of magnitude, we suspect that Glu9, Glu11, and Glu181 coordinate directly to the metal cofactor via a “hard” ionic interaction (24Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E183Q mutant displays a low but significant residual manganese-dependent RNA triphosphatase activity (12% of wild-type), which may signify that: (i) direct interaction between manganese and the side chain carbonyl of glutamine supports this residual activity or (ii) the side chain at position 183 coordinates the metal indirectly through a water molecule. The effects of Glu-to-Gln changes on Lef4 triphosphatase activity are consistent with the effects reported previously for the motif A and C residues of vaccinia D1-(1–545), i.e. glutamines were not tolerated at either Glu37, Glu39, or Glu192 of the vaccinia triphosphatase, but the E194Q mutant retained 80% of the wild-type RNA triphosphatase activity (21Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5486-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of yeast RNA triphosphatase shows that three of the four glutamates coordinate manganese directly (i.e. both glutamates in motif A and the distal glutamate in motif C), whereas the fourth glutamate interacts with a water molecule in the octahedral coordination complex of the manganese ion (19Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Perhaps the direct versusindirect metal-binding modes of the motif C glutamates have been inverted in the baculovirus and vaccinia RNA triphosphatases compared with the yeast enzyme. The most striking outcome of the mutational analysis was the change in metal cofactor specificity elicited by the E9D and E181D mutations. These conservative substitutions ablated the magnesium-dependent phosphohydrolase activities of Lef4 and transformed it into a strictly manganese-dependent RNA triphosphatase. A plausible interpretation of the altered metal specificity is that introduction of the shorter aspartate side chain makes Lef4 acutely sensitive to the atomic radius of the available divalent metal ion cofactor. The atomic radius of Mg(II) with a coordination number of 6 is 0.65 Å, whereas the radius of Co(II) is 0.70 Å, and the radius of Mn(II) is 0.80 Å (24Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an aspartate at position 9 or position 181 might be able to access the coordination complex with manganese, because manganese has the longest atomic radius, whereas Asp9 would not reach the coordination complex of magnesium, which has the shortest radius. Cobalt, with its intermediate atomic radius, appears to accommodate the aspartate at position 9 to effect ATP hydrolysis, but not the aspartate at position 181. The abrogation of triphosphatase activity with all metal cofactors by the E11D mutation implies that the shorter side chain cannot reach even the largest of the three metal coordination spheres. On the other hand, the robust activity of the E183D mutant suggests there is little difficulty in placing the shorter carboxylate (directly or indirectly) in the metal coordination complex. This easy accommodation may reflect flexibility of the main chain, or it may indicate that the natural Glu183 side chain is not in a fully extended conformation when it binds either to the metal or to a metal-bound water. Delineation of the geometry of the metal-binding site of the baculovirus capping enzyme and the tertiary structure of its active site will hinge on obtaining a crystal structure of either the complete Lef4 protein or the autonomous NH2-terminal triphosphatase domain identified presently."

While the majority of biochemical signaling elements are triggered by either CD2 or TcR-CD3 receptors, a small number of proteins are engaged by only one receptor. Recently, p62 dok (Dok1), a member of the Dok family of adapter molecules, has been reported to be activated by CD2 and not by CD3 engagement. Here we have examined the role of p62 dok in CD2-dependent signaling in Jurkat T cells. As previously reported, we find that ligation of the CD2 molecule by mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs led to phosphorylation of p62 dok . While CD2-induced p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation was independent of both the p36/38 membrane adapter protein linker of activated T cells (LAT) and the ZAP70/Syk family of kinases, it was dependent upon the Src family of kinases including Lck and Fyn. We find further that CD2 engagement induced the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 dok to Crk-L. The CD2-dependent association of p62 dok to Crk-L was independent of expression of the ZAP70/Syk family of kinases. Of note, while T cell receptor-CD3 engagement did not induce either p62 dok phosphorylation or Crk-L association in Jurkat T cells, it did inhibit CD2-dependent p62 dok -Crk-L complexes; this TcR-CD3-mediated regulation was dependent upon ZAP70 kinase activity. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of p62 dok and its interaction with other signaling proteins may depend upon integrated signals emanating from the CD2 receptor, utilizing a ZAP70/LAT-independent pathway, and the TcR-CD3 receptor, which is ZAP70/Syk-dependent.

In order to identify CD2-dependent (apparently TcR-CD3-independent) signaling events, we characterized early biochemical signaling in the model Jurkat T cell line deficient in expression of the LAT adaptor molecule, a molecule previously shown to be required for NFAT and interleukin-2 transcriptional activation through both the CD2 and TcR-CD3 receptors and to be necessary for normal T cell development. We demonstrate preferential, CD2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of a 62-kDa protein identified as p62 dok . CD2-mediated p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation was also independent of expression of the ZAP70/Syk kinases but, as previously shown (33Nemorin J.G. Duplay P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14590-14597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), dependent upon Src kinase activity. We demonstrate further that CD2-mediated signal transduction results in the association of p62 dok with Crk-L but that this association is negatively regulated by CD3 engagement, the latter utilizing a signal transduction pathway that requires expression of ZAP70 kinase.

Treatment with tetracycline (Calbiochem) (1 μg/ml) for at least 4 days was used to down-regulate Lck expression. Neither cell viability nor CD3, CD2, or CD28 cell surface receptor expression was affected by tetracycline treatment (data not shown) (19Martelli M.P. Lin H. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Bierer B.E.

Reinherz (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA); the murine anti-human CD3ε mAb OKT3 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and used as purified ascites fluid. The rabbit polyclonal anti-PI3K (p85 subunit) antiserum, the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, and the murine anti-Crk-L mAb were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

(Santa Cruz, CA). For stimulation, Jurkat cells (1 × 107/test) were washed in RPMI 1640 (without additives), resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then either left unstimulated, stimulated with OKT3 (1 μg), or stimulated with T112 plus T113 purified ascites (1:100 dilution) at 37 °C for the indicated times followed by rapid centrifugation and resuspension of the pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Brij 97, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 20 min, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. When indicated, 30 μl of postnuclear lysate from each sample was set aside prior to immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitations, 1 μg of specific antibody and 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added together to the clarified cell lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Clarified cell lysates from the same conditions of stimulation incubated with 20 μl protein A-agarose beads alone served as the control for carryover of stimulating mAbs, as indicated. For immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, 20 μl of anti-Tyr(P) (PY99) directly conjugated to agarose beads were used. The beads were then washed three times with washing buffer (0.1% Brij 97, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1 mmNa3VO4). Proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and probed with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Polypeptides recognized in the Western blot were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) methods according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each result shown is representative of between two and six independent experiments; representative blots are shown.

LAT-deficient mutants of the Jurkat T-cell line (ANJ3) were compared with the LAT-reconstituted clone, ANJ3-LATwt. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated via mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs or anti-CD3ε mAb directed against the TCR-CD3 complex; anti-phosphotyrosine antisera were used to probe postnuclear lysates (Fig. 1 A). A prominent phosphoprotein of 62–64 kDa was observed in the LAT-deficient cells, diminished upon reexpression of the LAT adapter protein, and enhanced by CD2 engagement. Comparably treated cells were subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-p62 dok specific antibody (Fig. 1 B) to demonstrate that the 62–64-kDa protein was detected by p62 dok antisera. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that p62 dok was indeed tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD2 stimulation independently of LAT kinase expression (Fig. 1 C, upper panel). Reprobing the stripped membrane with anti-p62 dok antisera confirmed equivalent loading of the immunoprecipitated protein in all lanes (Fig. 1 C,lower panel). This demonstration of CD2-induced p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells is consistent with an earlier observation by Hubert et al. (31Hubert P. Debre P. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), who identified a p62 RasGAP-associated protein phosphorylated by CD2 engagement, an observation recently confirmed by others (33Nemorin J.G.

Here, we extend these findings to demonstrate that the induction of p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation was independent of LAT expression; indeed, the basal and stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p62 dok was enhanced in the absence of LAT expression, suggesting reciprocal regulation of the protein by an as yet uncharacterized pathway. Given that LAT phosphorylation and function depends upon the ZAP70/Syk kinase family in T cells, we wished to determine whether CD2-dependent p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation would be dependent upon ZAP70 kinase activity. Antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from resting or stimulated wild type Jurkat (J77) cells or the ZAP70/Syk-deficient Jurkat mutant (P116) cells were analyzed using an anti-p62 dok specific antibody (Fig.2 A). p62 dok was basally tyrosine-phosphorylated in Jurkat T cells. Upon CD2 engagement, but not upon CD3 ligation, the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 dok precipitated was increased, and the appearance of a slower migrating species was observed. The same pattern, but even greater tyrosine phosphorylation following CD2 ligation, was observed in the ZAP70/Syk kinase-deficient P116 T cells. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation confirmed that CD2-dependent p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation was independent of ZAP70/Syk kinase expression (Fig. 2 B). The identity of the upstream tyrosine kinase required for CD2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p62 dok remains unclear. Previous reports have concluded that the Src-related Lck kinase is able to mediate p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation (33Nemorin J.G. Duplay P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14590-14597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); murine p62 dok was tyrosine-phosphorylated in human CD2-expressing cells derived from Fyn+/+ mice (38Fukai I. Hussey R.E. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To explore the specific role of Lck in CD2-mediated p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation, we used the CD2-positive Lck-reconstituted clone of JCaM1.6, the Lck-deficient Jurkat cell line in which Lck kinase was expressed under the control of a tetracycline-repressible TetR-VP16 fusion protein. Prolonged (∼8 days) tetracycline (1 μg/ml) treatment of these cells induced complete inhibition of Lck expression, as evaluated by Western blot (data not shown) (19Martelli M.P. Lin H. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Bierer B.E. Blood. 2000; 96: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Untreated or tetracycline-treated cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated via either CD2 or CD3 receptors for the indicated periods of time, and the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was analyzed. As expected, both basal and receptor-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation were severely diminished by inhibition of Lck expression. In particular, the CD2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 62–64-kDa protein (Fig.3 A), recognized as p62 dok by immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 3 B), was affected. In these Jurkat T cells, Fyn kinase is expressed at low levels. The residual phosphorylation of p62 dok and of other proteins (e.g. p97 and p120) observed upon CD2 and not upon CD3 stimulation in the tetracycline-treated cells (Fig. 3, longer exposure) may be due to CD2-dependent Fyn activation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in Jurkat T cells, CD2-mediated p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation was regulated, at least in part, by the Src-kinase family member Lck. Hyperphosphorylated p62 dok was recently shown to coprecipitate with Crk-L in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells (41Bhat A. Johnson K.J. Oda T. Corbin A.S. Druker B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32360-32368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 42Sattler M. Verma S. Pride Y.B. Salgia R. Rohrschneider L.R. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2451-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); whether p62 dok associated with Crk-L in the absence of the Bcr/Abl kinase or in the absence of transformation was not examined. We have recently shown that, like CD3 stimulation, CD2 stimulation of Jurkat T cells induced the association of Crk-L with the proto-oncogene c-Cbl and the p85 subunit of PI3K in a multicomponent complex (20Lin H. Martelli M.P. Bierer B.E. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here we questioned whether the CD2-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 dok protein in Jurkat T cells was found to associate with Crk-L, Cbl, or the p85 subunit of PI3K. For this purpose, wild type Jurkat T cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 5 min via either TcR-CD3 or CD2, after which Crk-L protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a rabbit anti-Crk-L-specific antibody. As previously described (20Lin H. Martelli M.P. Bierer B.E. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the phosphoproteins p120 c-Cbl and the p85 subunit of PI3K were found to coprecipitate with Crk-L upon either TcR-CD3 or CD2 stimulation (Fig.4 A, upper panel). Upon CD2 stimulation but not upon TcR-CD3 engagement, a phosphoprotein of ∼62–64-kDa was found to coprecipitate with Crk-L (Fig.4 A, upper panel). The 62–64-kDa phosphoprotein was identified as the docking protein p62 dok by reblotting the stripped membrane with a rabbit anti-p62 dok -specific antibody (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). Since the identification of p62 dok was performed on stripped membranes, further analysis was performed. Immunoprecipitations using a mouse anti-Crk-L-specific antibody followed by protein A-agarose or with protein A-agarose alone (to control for carryover of the stimulating antibody) from clarified postnuclear lysates of unstimulated or CD3- or CD2-stimulated Jurkat T cells were blotted directly with a rabbit anti-p62 dok -specific antibody (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). Again, p62 dok protein was detected in Crk-L immunoprecipitates specifically from CD2-stimulated cells (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). Reblotting the stripped membrane with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that the Crk-l-associated p62 dok was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 4 B, middle panel). Quantitatively similar amounts of Crk-L protein were immunoprecipitated in each lane (Fig.4 B, lower panel). Kinetic analysis demonstrated that, following CD2 stimulation, p62 dok associated with Crk-L transiently, peaking at early (2–5 min) time points and undetectable 15 min after stimulation (data not shown). To determine whether the Crk-L-p62 dok complex coprecipitated c-Cbl and/or the p85 subunit of PI3K in a multicomponent complex, we performed a series of reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments. While both CD2 and CD3 stimulation induced the association of both c-Cbl and p85 PI3K with Crk-L (data not shown) (20Lin H. Martelli M.P. Bierer B.E. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), no p62 dok protein was detected in c-Cbl or p85 PI3K immunoprecipitates (data not shown). While these negative results do not preclude an association under different experimental conditions, they leave open the possibility that 1) the p62 dok -Crk-L complex is distinct from the Crk-L-c-Cbl-p85PI3K complex previously described or 2) the association of c-Cbl or p85 PI3K with p62 dok is too weak to withstand the conditions of immunoprecipitation. Knowing that CD2-mediated p62 dok tyrosine phosphorylation was independent of LAT protein expression (Fig. 2), we asked whether the p62 dok /Crk-L association was also independent of LAT. Crk-L immunoprecipitates from resting or CD2- or CD3-stimulated LAT-deficient Jurkat cells ANJ3 and the LAT-reconstituted clone ANJ3-LATwt were immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Fig.5, upper panel). Independent of LAT protein expression, phosphoproteins of 120 and 85 kDa, corresponding to c-Cbl and p85PI3K, respectively (demonstrated by reblotting the stripped membrane with specific antibody; data not shown), coprecipitated with Crk-L. A 62–64-kDa phosphoprotein, recognized as p62 dok (data not shown), was also detected in the complex upon CD2 stimulation of either the LAT-deficient or LAT-reconstituted Jurkat cells. Similar amounts of Crk-L were immunoprecipitated in each lane, as confirmed by stripping and reprobing the membrane with an anti-Crk-L specific antibody (Fig. 5, lower panel). A similar experiment was performed using the ZAP70/Syk-deficient Jurkat T cell line P116 and the ZAP70-reconstituted cells P116-ZAP70. As shown in Fig.6, p62 dok coprecipitated with Crk-L upon CD2 stimulation independently of ZAP70/Syk kinase expression.Figure 6Tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 dok coprecipitates with Crk-L upon CD2 stimulation of Jurkat T cells independently of ZAP70/Syk kinases expression. The ZAP70/Syk-deficient Jurkat T cell line P116 and the P116 reconstituted with wild-type ZAP70 (P116-ZAP70) Jurkat cells (107cells/test) were left either unstimulated or stimulated with either OKT3 for 5 min or T112 + T113 for 2 and 5 min. Crk-L immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. Crk-L immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-p62 dok specific antibody (upper panel). The same membrane was also blotted with an anti-Crk-L-specific antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While the functional role of the CD2-induced p62 dok -Crk-L complex in T cells has not yet been elucidated, it is clear that CD2 functions as a coreceptor in cellular adhesion and to modulate signal transduction events in TcR-CD3-stimulated cells. Because our data supported a model in which CD2 regulated p62 dok /Crk-L association independently of TcR-CD3 (and ZAP70) engagement, we questioned whether TCR-CD3 ligation modulated the CD2-mediated and -specific association of p62 dok with Crk-L. Wild type Jurkat T cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 2 and 5 min with either anti-CD3 mAb, mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs or a combination of anti-CD3 and pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs. Clarified postnuclear lysates were subjected to anti-Crk-L-specific immunoprecipitation and blotted directly with an anti-p62 dok -specific antibody (Fig.7, upper panel).

Although the mechanism of transmembrane signaling by bacterial chemoreceptors is unknown, the functionality of chimeric receptor constructs suggests that the mechanism may be general.

High resolution crystal structure information is available for a fully amidated cytoplasmic fragment from the serine receptor ofE. coli consisting of residues 284–520 (the methylation sites are Gln residues in this construct, which mimics the fully methylated signaling state (29Dunten P. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1491-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The domain is organized as a dimer in which each subunit has a coiled-coil hairpin structure that associates to form an extended four-helix bundle (30Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subunit hairpins interact with two other dimers to form a trimer of dimers.A number of studies suggests that structural rearrangements of the dimer interface are involved in signaling. Disulfide cross-links formed in the cytoplasmic domain of the intact receptor across the dimer interface perturb signaling (22Bass R.B. Coleman M.D. Falke J.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Early approaches to investigating structural differences between signaling states compared properties of soluble cytoplasmic fragment proteins with single missense mutations (33Oosawa K. Mutoh N. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which locked the receptor into the smooth-swimming (kinase-inactivating) or tumble (kinase-activating) signaling states (34Ames P. Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 817-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Mutoh N. Oosawa K. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins exhibited monomer/oligomer equilibria that correlated with the signaling state; kinase-inactivating mutants were found to form oligomers, whereas the wild-type and kinase-activating mutants remained monomeric (36Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9904-9911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Studies of the association-dissociation kinetics of two oligomer-forming fragments demonstrated a high energy barrier to interconversion, which led us to suggest that oligomer dissociation/association requires protein unfolding (27Seeley S.K. Wittrock G.K. Thompson L.K. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16336-16345Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, both the monomer and oligomer states are highly dynamic and possess a small core (∼10%) that undergoes slow hydrogen exchange (37Seeley S.K. Weis R.M. Thompson L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5199-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).We have used hydrogen exchange to analyze the relationship between the stable core and dimer dissociation in the aspartate receptor c-fragment.1 Our results establish that (i) decreasing pH stabilizes the dimeric state, (ii) the stable core is present also in the transition state for dissociation, and (iii) changes in electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which expand this core, stabilize both the monomeric and the dimeric structure. We propose that the helix hairpin at the tip of this domain is the stable core, and we speculate that interactions within the monomer and dimer are key to the kinase-inactivating state, whereas interactions between dimers are critical to the kinase-activating state. The bacterial chemotaxis system is a simple well studied system in which detailed investigations of signal transduction mechanisms can be conducted. Although the mechanism of transmembrane signaling by bacterial chemoreceptors is unknown, the functionality of chimeric receptor constructs suggests that the mechanism may be general. For example, ligand-mediated regulation of the kinase activity has been demonstrated in chimeric proteins containing the ligand binding domain of the aspartate receptor and the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor (1Biemann H.P.

The chemoreceptors are largely α-helical, homodimeric transmembrane proteins with an extracellular sensing domain, an intracellular signaling domain, and two transmembrane helices per subunit. The receptor regulates the activity of an associated histidine kinase, CheA, within a ternary complex consisting of receptor, CheA, and CheW (7Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc.

In addition, the receptor mediates temporal adaptation to ongoing stimuli via methylation of 4–5 Glu residues in the signaling domain of the receptor (10Jurica M.S. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 809-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mechanism of transmembrane signaling has been probed by comparing the properties of signaling states in both the intact receptor and receptor fragments. Small ligand-induced conformational changes in the periplasmic and transmembrane domains of the receptor have been revealed by crystallographic and solution state NMR studies of soluble periplasmic constructs (11Chervitz S.A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have been used to investigate the structural changes in this domain that activate the CheA kinase. High resolution crystal structure information is available for a fully amidated cytoplasmic fragment from the serine receptor ofE. coli consisting of residues 284–520 (the methylation sites are Gln residues in this construct, which mimics the fully methylated signaling state (29Dunten P. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1491-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The domain is organized as a dimer in which each subunit has a coiled-coil hairpin structure that associates to form an extended four-helix bundle (30Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subunit hairpins interact with two other dimers to form a trimer of dimers. A number of studies suggests that structural rearrangements of the dimer interface are involved in signaling. Disulfide cross-links formed in the cytoplasmic domain of the intact receptor across the dimer interface perturb signaling (22Bass R.B. Coleman M.D. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9317-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Trammell M.A. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Bass R.B. Falke J.J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Dimerization of the cytoplasmic fragment in leucine zipper fusion proteins can activate the CheA kinase (26Surette M.G. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M.G. Stock J.B.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and different degrees of activation can be achieved by altering the orientation of subunits at the zipper/domain junction and by varying the extent of covalent modification (25Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,32Levit M.N. Liu Y. Stock J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Early approaches to investigating structural differences between signaling states compared properties of soluble cytoplasmic fragment proteins with single missense mutations (33Oosawa K. Mutoh N. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which locked the receptor into the smooth-swimming (kinase-inactivating) or tumble (kinase-activating) signaling states (34Ames P. Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 817-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Mutoh N. Oosawa K. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins exhibited monomer/oligomer equilibria that correlated with the signaling state; kinase-inactivating mutants were found to form oligomers, whereas the wild-type and kinase-activating mutants remained monomeric (36Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9904-9911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Studies of the association-dissociation kinetics of two oligomer-forming fragments demonstrated a high energy barrier to interconversion, which led us to suggest that oligomer dissociation/association requires protein unfolding (27Seeley S.K. Wittrock G.K. Thompson L.K. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16336-16345Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, both the monomer and oligomer states are highly dynamic and possess a small core (∼10%) that undergoes slow hydrogen exchange (37Seeley S.K. Weis R.M. Thompson L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5199-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have used hydrogen exchange to analyze the relationship between the stable core and dimer dissociation in the aspartate receptor c-fragment.1 Our results establish that (i) decreasing pH stabilizes the dimeric state, (ii) the stable core is present also in the transition state for dissociation, and (iii) changes in electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, which expand this core, stabilize both the monomeric and the dimeric structure. We propose that the helix hairpin at the tip of this domain is the stable core, and we speculate that interactions within the monomer and dimer are key to the kinase-inactivating state, whereas interactions between dimers are critical to the kinase-activating state.
