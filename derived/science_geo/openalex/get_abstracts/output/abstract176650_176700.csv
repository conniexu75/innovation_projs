https://openalex.org/W2106639712,"pi-Conjugated polymers that are electrochemically cycled in ionic liquids have enhanced lifetimes without failure (up to 1 million cycles) and fast cycle switching speeds (100 ms). We report results for electrochemical mechanical actuators, electrochromic windows, and numeric displays made from three types of pi-conjugated polymers: polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiophene. Experiments were performed under ambient conditions, yet the polymers showed negligible loss in electroactivity. These performance advantages were obtained by using environmentally stable, room-temperature ionic liquids composed of 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium cations together with anions such as tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1996949194,"Pharmacological inactivation of oncogenes is being investigated as a possible therapeutic strategy for cancer. One potential drawback is that cessation of such therapy may allow reactivation of the oncogene and tumor regrowth. We used a conditional transgenic mouse model for MYC -induced tumorigenesis to demonstrate that brief inactivation of MYC results in the sustained regression of tumors and the differentiation of osteogenic sarcoma cells into mature osteocytes. Subsequent reactivation of MYC did not restore the cells' malignant properties but instead induced apoptosis. Thus, brief MYC inactivation appears to cause epigenetic changes in tumor cells that render them insensitive to MYC -induced tumorigenesis. These results raise the possibility that transient inactivation of MYC may be an effective therapy for certain cancers."

We examined light signaling by exploiting the light sensitivity of the Neurospora biological clock, specifically the rapid induction by light of the clock component frequency ( frq ). Light induction of frq is transcriptionally controlled and requires two cis-acting elements (LREs) in the frq promoter. Both LREs are bound by a White Collar–1 (WC-1)/White Collar–2 (WC-2)–containing complex (WCC), and light causes decreased mobility of the WCC bound to the LREs. The use of in vitro–translated WC-1 and WC-2 confirmed that WC-1, with flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor, is the blue light photoreceptor that mediates light input to the circadian system through direct binding (with WC-2) to the frq promoter."

However, the structural basis of CD36 lipoprotein ligand recognition is unknown. We now identify a novel class of oxidized phospholipids that serve as high affinity ligands for CD36 and mediate recognition of oxidized forms of LDL by CD36 on macrophages. Small unilamellar vesicles of homogeneous phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species were oxidized by the myeloperoxidase (MPO)-H2O2-NO 2−system, and products were separated by sequential LC/ESI/MS/MS. In parallel, fractions were tested for their ability to bind to CD36. Four major structurally related phospholipids with CD36 binding activity were identified from oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-PC, and four corresponding structural analogs with CD36 binding activity were identified from oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-PC. Each was then synthetically prepared, its structure confirmed by multinuclear NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry, and shown to possess identical CD36 binding activity and LC/ESI/MS/MS characteristics in both native and derivatized forms. Based upon the structures of the active compounds identified, and structure-function studies with a variety of synthetic analogs, we conclude that the structural characteristics required for high affinity binding of oxidized PC species to CD36 are a phospholipid with an sn-2 acyl group that incorporates a terminal γ-hydroxy(or oxo)-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (oxPCCD36). LC/ESI/MS/MS studies demonstrate that oxPCCD36 are formed during LDL oxidation by multiple distinct pathways. Formation of this novel class of oxidized PC species contributes to CD36-mediated recognition of LDL oxidized by MPO and other biologically relevant mechanisms. The present results offer structural insights into the molecular patterns recognized by the scavenger receptor CD36 and provide a platform for the development of potential therapeutic inhibitory agents.

Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). In addition, uptake of oxLDL through CD36 plays a role in differentiation of monocytes and in the induction of nuclear receptors such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a receptor that participates in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (12Huh H.Y. Pearce S.F. Yesner L.M. Schindler J.L. Silverstein R.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M.

We recently described a pathway for oxidative modification of LDL by the myeloperoxidase (MPO)-H2O2-NO 2−system of monocytes (17Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). LDL modified by MPO-generated reactive nitrogen species (NO2-LDL) is avidly taken up and degraded by macrophages in vitro, leading to cholesterol deposition and foam cell formation. The macrophage scavenger receptor CD36 is responsible for recognition of NO2-LDL and is essential for foam cell formation in this model (10Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D. Silverstein R.L. Hajjar D.P. Cohen P.A. Frazier W.A. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The pathway appears physiologically plausible for several reasons. First, a number of studies demonstrated that enzymatically active MPO accumulates in subendothelial space, leading to MPO-dependent nitration and chlorination of targets (18Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 19Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17415-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Second, recent genetics and clinical studies further suggest a role for MPO in development of atherosclerosis in human subjects. A cross-sectional analysis of nearly 100 individuals with MPO deficiency showed that MPO-deficient subjects have a reduced rate of cardiovascular disease (23Kutter D. Devaquet P. Vanderstocken G. Paulus J.M. Marchal V. Gothot A. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 2000; 104: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Similarly, decreased prevalence of atherosclerosis was recently reported for subjects containing a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the MPO gene that results in decreased expression in reporter constructs in vitro (24Nikpoor B. Turecki G. Fournier C. Theroux P. Rouleau G.A. Am. Heart J. 2001; 142: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Third, we have demonstrated that MPO-generated reactive nitrogen species convert LDL into a form recognized by CD36 at pathophysiological concentrations of nitrite and in the presence of serum constituents, in contrast to LDL oxidation by free transition metal ions (e.g. Cu2+) (10Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D. Silverstein R.L. Hajjar D.P. Cohen P.A. Frazier W.A. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies examining peroxidation of endogenous plasma lipids by activated leukocytes isolated from normal and MPO-deficient subjects strongly supports a role for the MPO-H2O2system of human leukocytes as a physiological mechanism for initiating lipid peroxidation in vivo (25Zhang R. Shen Z. Nauseef W.M. Hazen S.L. Blood. 2002; 85: 950-958Google Scholar). Finally, a recent clinical study (26Zhang R. Brennan M.L., Fu, X. Aviles R.J. Pearce G.L. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Sprecher D.L. Hazen S.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) identified MPO levels in blood and leukocytes as strong independent predictors of coronary artery disease in angiographically defined subjects. Although the scavenger receptor functions of CD36 are well documented, the exact molecular structure(s) of the ligand(s) recognized by CD36 remain unknown. Oxidized lipids were first suggested to participate in recognition of oxLDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) based on studies using liposomes generated from lipid extracts of LDL that was extensively oxidized by Cu2+ (Cu2+-oxLDL) (27Terpstra V. Bird D.A. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1806-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A role for CD36 as the receptor responsible for recognition of oxidized lipids extracted from Cu2+-oxLDL was subsequently shown (10Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D. Silverstein R.L. Hajjar D.P. Cohen P.A. Frazier W.A. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 11Boullier A. Gillotte K.L. Horkko S. Green S.R. Friedman P.

Oxidized phospholipids covalently linked to apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) in extensively oxidized LDL (e.g.Cu2+-oxLDL) have also been suggested to serve as ligands for CD36 based upon indirect competition studies using a monoclonal antibody to oxidized PAPC-protein adducts and either reconstituted apoB from Cu2+-oxLDL or adducts of BSA with the aldehydic phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleryl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OV-PC), an oxidation product of PAPC (11Boullier A.

We have shown that the lipid portion of LDL and PAPC vesicles that are mildly oxidized by the MPO-H2O2-NO 2−system serve as ligands for CD36 using stable transfected cells and MPM from wild type versus CD36 knockout mice (10Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D. Silverstein R.L. Hajjar D.P. Cohen P.A. Frazier W.A. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Conversion of LDL into a ligand for CD36 is a very early event during LDL oxidation in this system, occurring before substantial modification of apoB, as monitored by loss of free lysine residues and alteration in relative electrophoretic mobility (10Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D. Silverstein R.L. Hajjar D.P. Cohen P.A. Frazier W.A. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Although studies thus far clearly support the notion that oxidized phospholipids play a major role in the binding of oxLDL forms (including NO2-LDL) to CD36, particularly early in the oxidation process, the precise nature of the lipid ligand or ligands within the lipid phase of oxLDL species have not yet been identified. We now report the first systematic study aimed at directly identifying the structures of specific oxidized phospholipids that serve as high affinity ligands for the scavenger receptor CD36.

Synthetic lipids were routinely analyzed by HPLC with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. If lipids were found to be less than 98% pure, they were re-isolated prior to use. Stock solutions (2 mg/ml) of small unilamellar vesicles composed of PLPC, POPC, or PAPC with varying mol % of specific oxidized phospholipids were prepared in argon-sparged sodium phosphate buffer by extrusion (10 times) through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter using an Avanti Mini-Extruder Set (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) at 37 °C. For direct binding experiments, [3H]DPPC (25 μCi/mg of phospholipids) or 1 mol % of the fluorescent dye 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate was added to phospholipids. CD36 ligands were isolated from PAPC or PLPC vesicles (0.2 mg lipid/ml) following incubation with MPO (30 nm), an H2O2-generating system (constant flux of 0.80 μm/min) composed of glucose (100 μm) and glucose oxidase (100 ng/ml), and NaNO2 (0.5 mm) at 37 °C for 20 h. Reactions were stopped by the addition of BHT (50 μm) and catalase (300 nm) and stored under argon atmosphere at −80 °C. LDL modified by MPO-generated nitrating intermediates (NO2-LDL) was formed by incubating LDL (0.2 mg of protein/ml) at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 μm DTPA, 30 nm MPO, 100 μg/ml glucose, 20 ng/ml glucose oxidase, and 0.5 mmNaNO2 for 8 h. Oxidation reactions were terminated by addition of 40 μm BHT and 300 nm catalase to the reaction mixture. LDL acetylation was performed as described earlier (17Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Oxidation of LDL (0.2 mg protein/ml) by copper was performed by dialysis versus 5 μmCuSO4 in PBS for 24 h at 37 °C. Oxidation was terminated by addition of BHT (40 μm) and DTPA (100 μm) and dialysis against PBS containing DTPA (100 μm). Oxidation of LDL by ceruloplasmin-bound copper was performed as described (33Ehrenwald E. Fox P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thioglycollate-elicited MPMs from wild type (C57BL/6) were isolated and cultured as described (17Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were cultured as described previously (17Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing mouse scavenger receptor class A, type I (CHO-mSR-AI), and control vector-transfected parental LDL receptor-negative CHO cells were a generous gift from Dr. M. Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston) (34Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with CHO-mSR-AI were performed on confluent cell monolayers in Ham's F-12 medium containing 3% lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum, BHT (20 μm), DTPA (100 μm), and catalase (300 nm). 293 cells (embryonic kidney epithelial cells transformed with adenovirus) were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM with 5% FCS. CD36 expressing 293 cells were a generous gift from Dr. W. Frazier (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (35Sheibani N. Frazier W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6788-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 293 transfected cells were grown in the presence of G418 (500 μg/ml), and clones were isolated, and expression of CD36 was confirmed by FACS analysis using the monoclonal antibody FA6-152. Experiments with 293 cells and CHO cells were performed on confluent cell monolayers in the appropriate culturing media containing 200 μg/ml LDL, BHT (20 μm), DTPA (100 μm), and catalase (300 nm). Lipids were maintained under inert atmosphere (argon or nitrogen) at all times. Lipids from either oxidized PAPC or PLPC vesicles, or from NO2-LDL, were extracted three times sequentially by the method of Bligh and Dyer (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43112) Google Scholar) immediately after adding an equal volume of saturated NaCl solution (to enhance lipid extraction). The combined chloroform extracts were evaporated under nitrogen, and lipids were then resuspended in methanol (at ∼200 μg/0.1 ml), filtered through an Acrodisc CR PTFE filter, and applied on a reverse-phase column (Luna C18, 250 × 10 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Lipids were resolved at a flow rate of 3 ml/min using a ternary (acetonitrile/methanol/H2O) gradient (Gradient I, see below) generated by a Waters 600 E Multisolvent delivery system HPLC (Waters, Milford, MA) and monitored using an evaporative light scattering detector (Sedex 55, Sedere, Alfortville, France).

Lipids were rapidly extracted into chloroform, dried under N2, resuspended in 20 μl of PBS with 10% ethanol, and further diluted (final ethanol concentration ≤0.5%) in DMEM containing 125I-NO2-LDL (5 μg/ml), 5% FCS, 200 μg/ml LDL, BHT (20 μm), DTPA (100 μm), and catalase (300 nm) (10Podrez E.A.

The resulting mixture was incubated with CD36-transfected 293 cells for 3 h at 4 °C, and then unbound125I-NO2-LDL was removed by washing with ice-cold PBS. The amount of bound 125I-NO2-LDL was then determined. CD36 independent binding of125I-NO2-LDL was assessed in vector-transfected 293 cells and subtracted from binding to CD36-transfected 293 cells as a background. The binding to vector-transfected cells was typically less than 10–20% of that to CD36 transfected cells. Each measurement was performed in triplicate, and the percent of inhibition was calculated as follows: 10"
https://openalex.org/W1589862831,"Blue light regulates many physiological processes in fungi, but their photoreceptors are not known. In Neurospora crassa, all light responses depend on the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain-containing transcription factor white collar-1 (wc-1). By removing the WC-1 light, oxygen, or voltage domain, a specialized PAS domain that binds flavin mononucleotide in plant phototropins, we show that light responses are abolished, including light entrainment of the circadian clock. However, the WC-1-mediated dark activation of frq remains normal in this mutant, and the circadian clock can be entrained by temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the purified Neurospora WC-1-WC-2 protein complex is associated with stoichiometric amounts of the chromophore flavin-adenine dinucleotide. Together, these observations suggest that WC-1 is the blue-light photoreceptor for the circadian clock and other light responses in Neurospora."

It has been proposed that Toll does not function as a pattern recognition receptor per se but is activated through a cleaved form of the cytokine Spaetzle. The upstream events linking infection to the cleavage of Spaetzle have long remained elusive. Here we report the identification of a central component of the fungal activation of Toll. We show that ethylmethane sulfonate-induced mutations in the persephone gene, which encodes a previously unknown serine protease, block induction of the Toll pathway by fungi and resistance to this type of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1983359974,"The transcription factor Pax5 is essential for initiating B cell lineage commitment, but its role in maintaining commitment is unknown. Using conditional Pax5 inactivation in committed pro-B cells, we demonstrate that Pax5 is required not only to initiate its B lymphoid transcription program, but also to maintain it in early B cell development. As a consequence of Pax5 inactivation, previously committed pro-B cells regained the capacity to differentiate into macrophages in vitro and to reconstitute T cell development in vivo in RAG2 −/− mice. Hence, Pax5 expression is continuously required to maintain B cell lineage commitment, because its loss converts committed pro-B cells into hematopoietic progenitors with multilineage potential."

Using a well characterized model system for breast cancer, we define here the molecular and cellular consequences of adriamycin treatment in breast tumor cells. Cells acutely exposed to adriamycin exhibited an increase in p53 activity, a decline in telomerase activity, and a dramatic increase in β-galactosidase, a marker of senescence. Inactivation of wild-type p53 resulted in a transition of the cellular response to adriamycin treatment from replicative senescence to delayed apoptosis, demonstrating that p53 plays an integral role in the fate of breast tumor cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Stable introduction of hTERT, the catalytic protein component of telomerase, into MCF-7 cells caused an increase in telomerase activity and telomere length. Treatment of MCF-7-hTERT cells with adriamycin produced an identical senescence response as controls without signs of telomere shortening, indicating that the senescence after treatment is telomere length-independent. However, we found that exposure to adriamycin resulted in an overrepresentation of cytogenetic changes involving telomeres, showing an altered telomere state induced by adriamycin is probably a causal factor leading to the senescence phenotype.

To our knowledge, these data are the first to demonstrate that the mechanism of adriamycin-induced senescence is dependent on both functional p53 and telomere dysfunction rather than overall shortening. Most normal somatic cells continually shorten their telomeres after each cell division because of incomplete replication at the end of linear chromosomes (1Olovnikoff A.M. Dokl.

The original hypothesis stated that when telomeres have become sufficiently shortened, replicative senescence is induced (3Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W.

Most cells with indefinite proliferative ability (e.g. human tumors and their derivative cell lines) express the enzyme telomerase to maintain telomeres, which allows for the continued cellular proliferation characteristic of human cancer (5Counter C.M.

Telomerase is a cellular reverse transcriptase containing two strictly required elements: a protein component, hTERT, and an RNA element, hTR (7Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S-S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A.

The introduction of telomerase into normal human cells provides for telomere maintenance, prevention of senescence, and an extension of life span, indicating that gradual telomere shortening is one of the factors contributing to the onset of cellular senescence (10Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar, 11Vaziri H.

Recent evidence suggests that although telomere length is an important trigger for the onset of senescence, increased telomere dysfunction results in a loss of chromosome end protection and induction of the senescence state (12Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). These novel findings show that senescence can be induced without net telomere shortening, and that while length remains important, preservation of telomere integrity is critical regardless of telomere length. The mechanism(s) of action of the anthracycline antibiotic adriamycin, a drug that has long been a mainstay in the treatment of breast cancer (13DeVita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A.

E6 protein show degradation of p53, a lack of overall p53 function, and conversion from a senescent phenotype to apoptosis after adriamycin treatment, demonstrating that p53 is critical for replicative senescence in drug-treated MCF-7 cells. Exogenous expression of hTERT provides for increased telomerase activity and elongated telomere lengths but does not protect MCF-7 cells from drug-induced cellular senescence. We find that adriamycin-induced DNA damage appears to preferentially target chromosome ends resulting in substantial telomere-related cytogenetic abnormalities, indicating that the observed senescence is because of telomere dysfunction rather than overall shortening. Our data clearly indicate that the senescence program observed in adriamycin-treated MCF-7 cells requires functional p53 and telomere dysfunction. RPMI 1640 medium and trypsin-EDTA (0.5% trypsin, 5.3 mm EDTA) were obtained from Invitrogen.l-Glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units penicillin/ml and streptomycin 10 mg/ml), and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Whittaker BioProducts (Walkersville, MD). Adriamycin and retinoic acid were purchased from Sigma, reconstituted in molecular biology grade water, and stored as aliquots at −20 °C until dilution in culture medium immediately before cell treatments. The MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breast tumor cell lines were obtained from the NCI Frederick Cancer Research Facility. Cells were maintained as monolayers in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine (0.292 mg/ml), penicillin/streptomycin (0.5 ml/100 ml medium), and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were exposed to 1 μm adriamycin for 2 h, rinsed once in PBS, and then maintained in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. The retroviral packaging cells, PA317 HPV-16 E6 and PA317 hTERT, and their vector controls (pLXSN and pBABEpuro, respectively) were obtained from Dr. Jerry W. Shay (UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine calf serum as described above. Target MCF-7 cells were infected and selected using standard procedures as described previously (21Savre-Train I. Gollahon L.S. Holt S.E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity was determined by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) using the TRAPeze kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) as described previously (6Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R.

The reactions were extended for 30 min at 30 °C, and extension products were PCR-amplified for 27 cycles and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then exposed to a PhosphorImaging cassette (Amersham Biosciences) and directly scanned and analyzed using ImageQuant Software (Amersham Biosciences). A positive result indicating telomerase activity was shown by the presence of a 6-bp progressive ladder. A 36-bp internal standard verified successful amplification and served as a useful standard for relative quantitation. Telomerase activity was semi-quantitatively calculated using the ratio of the intensity of the telomerase ladder to the intensity of the 36-bp internal standard. Total RNA was isolated from cells in logarithmic growth phase using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. According to the manufacturer's established protocol, 3 μg of total RNA from each cell culture were reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction volume using decamers and the regular reaction buffer provided in the first strand synthesis kit, RETROscript (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). A 2.5-μl aliquot of cDNA was used for PCR amplifications. hTERT was amplified using the oligonucleotide primer hTERT (5′-GACTCGACACCGTGTTCACCTAC-3′) paired with either Endo 1 (5′-ACGTAGAGCCCGGCGTGACAG-3′) or pBABE (5′-GACACACATTCCACAGGTCG-3′) (23Hahn W.C.

For both primer pairs, the thermocycling conditions were: 94 °C for 5 min followed by 34 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Amplification of 18 S RNA was performed as a control with 18 S PCR primer pairs (Ambion, Inc.) using the same thermocycling conditions described above with only 22 cycles completed. Amplified products (exogenous hTERT: 175-bp; endogenous hTERT: 219-bp; 18 S: 488-bp) were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Telomere length was determined using terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis as noted before (10Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W.

DNA was isolated from cells using genomic tips (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) digested with a mixture of HinfI,AluI, and RsaI restriction enzymes (Invitrogen) and resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel. The DNA ladder and G-rich telomere probe (TTAGGG)4 were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) with unincorporated label removed from the reaction using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). The dried agarose gel was subjected to in-gel hybridization with the labeled probe, washed repeatedly with varying concentrations of SSC buffer, and exposed to a PhosphorImaging cassette for 2–24 h. An estimation of median telomere length for comparison purposes only was made by measuring the radioactive smear, taking the midpoint of its length for characterization of isogenic cell lines. A more rigorous determination of average telomere length was accomplished using an established protocol as described previously (24Ouellette M. Liao M. Shea-Herbert B. Johnson M. Holt S.E. Liss H.S.

MCF-7 cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. The cells were then washed again with PBS and stained with a solution of 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-inolyl-β-galactosidase in dimethylformamide (20 mg/ml stock), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 2 mm MgCl2 as described previously (10Bodnar A.G.

Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and the percentage of positively stained cells was determined after counting three random fields of 100 cells each. As a positive control for β-galactosidase expression, MCF-7 cells were exposed to 200 nm retinoic acid for 4 days and then stained. Representative microscopic fields were photographed under a ×20 objective. MCF-7 cells (parental, HPV-16 E6, and pLXSN) were treated with 1 μm adriamycin for 2 h, washed with PBS, and then cultured for an additional 2 h prior to lysing in a standard radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). The respective isogenic untreated MCF-7 cultures were included for assessing the constitutive levels of p53 and p21waf1. Protein concentrations were determined using a Lowry-based spectrophormetric assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 15-μg aliquot of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. A standard blotting protocol was then performed using pantropic p53 (1:500 of Ab-6, Oncogene Research Products) and a p21waf-1 monoclonal (1:500, Signal Transduction Laboratories) antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000, Amersham Biosciences). A chemiluminescent reaction (ECL Reagent, Amersham) was used for detection. To control for protein loading, the membrane was subsequently probed with an actin antibody (1:5000, Sigma) and processed as described above. MDA-MB231, MCF-7, and MCF-7-E6 cells were directly seeded onto 4-well chamber slides, treated with 1 μm adriamycin for 2 h, and then after 5 days, stained by TUNEL (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) to allow easy determination of the total number of cells per field. Three random fields of at least 300 cells in monolayer culture were scored to determine the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. Values represent the mean ± S.D. Metaphase chromosomes were harvested from the MCF-7 cell cultures using standard methods (26Rooney D.E. Czepulkowski B.H. Human Cytogenetics, A Practical Approach. I. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1992: 55-89Google Scholar). Actively dividing cells were blocked in mitosis with 0.1 μg/ml colcemid for 2 h, incubated in 0.075 m KCl hypotonic solution for 20 min, and fixed in methanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1). Slides were made using standard procedures, and metaphase chromosomes were visualized using conventional Geimsa staining (27Barch M.J. The AGT Cytogenetics Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1991: 263-265Google Scholar). Metaphase spreads were scored for chromosomal findings from both the MCF-7-hTERT cell cultures before and after adriamycin treatment. A total of 200 metaphase spreads (100 each) were evaluated (28Tawn E.J. Holdsworth D. Rooney D.E. Czepulkowski B.H. 2nd Ed. Human Cytogenetics, A Practical Approach. II. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1992: 189-208Google Scholar). The frequency of the types of chromosomal abnormalities seen in the cells with and without adriamycin treatment were compared using a contingency chi-square test with an α < 0.05 significance level. In this study, our initial objective was to determine whether MCF-7 cells undergo replicative senescence following acute exposure to 1 μm adriamycin. β-Galactosidase expression, a marker of cellular senescence (10Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar, 25Dimri G.P. Xinhau L. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubej J. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5555) Google Scholar), was present in the MCF-7 cells as early as 2 days after acute exposure to adriamycin (data not shown). After 1 week, histochemical staining was intense and expressed in virtually every cell of the culture (Fig.1). Cells expressing this senescence marker were typically much larger in size and multinucleated, both of which are morphological features indicative of a senescent state. Continuous exposure to retinoic acid used as a positive control (29Chang B.D. Xuan Y. Broude E.V. Zhu H. Schott B. Roninson I.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4808-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) induced β-galactosidase activity in MCF-7 breast tumor cells as expected (data not shown). Because one could argue that β-galactosidase staining in this system may only reflect a lack of cell division rather than true senescence, MCF-7 cells were held in a non-dividing state by serum removal for 7 days and stained for β-galactosidase. In contrast to the adriamycin-treated cells, β-galactosidase expression was detected only very rarely in non-dividing MCF-7 cells, consistent with that observed for untreated MCF-7 cells (0.3% + 0.2). Because induction of senescence has been closely associated with the suppression of telomerase activity (30Holt S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2932-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 31Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10687-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we also assessed the influence of acute adriamycin treatment on telomerase activity in the MCF-7 cells. Adriamycin produced a time-dependent decline of telomerase activity in MCF-7 cells (Fig.2) that differs from the recently described early daunorubicin-mediated telomerase inhibition in lung cancer cells (85% reduction at 24 h) (32Ogretmen B. Kraveka J.M. Schady D. Usta J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32506-32514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the effects of adriamycin on telomerase activity were not significant within the first 1–3 days of drug exposure, exhibiting a half-life consistent with previous results (30Holt S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2932-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 31Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10687-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), telomerase activity was reduced 90% after 7 days with a greater than 95% reduction after 10 days (Fig.2 B). Because MCF-7 cells express wild-type p53 but lack functional caspase 3 protein (33Kagawa S., Gu, J. Honda T. McDonnell T.J. Swisher S.G. Roth J.A. Fang B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1474-1480PubMed Google Scholar), the induction of replicative senescence during adriamycin treatment may be attributed to a combination of p53-mediated senescence (34Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 33-39Crossref Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and the inability to progress down the apoptotic pathway. We tested this hypothesis using another p53-positive breast tumor cell line with functional caspase 3 (ZR-75) and found that adriamycin treatment results in an identical senescence pattern without detectable apoptosis (data not shown), consistent with that observed for the MCF-7 cells (quantitation in Fig.3 A). In addition, adriamycin-treated breast tumor cells with mutant p53 (MDA-MB231) exhibit a delayed apoptosis rather than senescence (Fig.3 A). These observations taken together suggested a pivotal role for p53 in the induction of senescence in breast tumor cells and that inactivation of p53 in MCF-7 cells may allow conversion to an apoptotic pathway following DNA damage (35Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were infected with HPV-16 E6, which resulted in the degradation and inactivation of p53 as denoted by the lack of p53-mediated transcriptional activation of its downstream target p21waf-1 (Fig. 3 B) after drug treatment. Even though we observe a slight increase (2–3-fold) in p21waf-1independent of p53, acute treatment of MCF-7-E6 cells with 1 μm adriamycin resulted in a delayed apoptotic event rather than senescence 5 days post-treatment using the TUNEL assay (quantification shown in Fig. 3 C). Collectively, these data suggest that wild-type p53 activity is necessary for the induction of the replicative senescence phenotype observed in the adriamycin-treated MCF-7 cells. To assess the involvement of telomerase and telomere length in the adriamycin-induced senescence response, we retrovirally infected the hTERT gene into MCF-7 cells and selected for stable integration using puromycin. The introduction of hTERT into MCF-7 cells resulted in elevated telomerase activity (nearly 5-fold) (Fig. 4 A), continuous expression of exogenous hTERT (Fig. 4 B), and a substantial increase in telomere length from a median length of 3.5 to 7 kb (Fig.4 C). Because MCF-7 cells already have a substantial amount of telomerase activity, it was possible that hTERT expression would not result in an increase in telomerase activity or telomere elongation. However, our data clearly show that hTERT is the limiting factor for telomerase elevation and telomere elongation in MCF-7 cells. We hypothesized that because telomere length has been shown to be a primary cause of cellular senescence in normal cells (10Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar, 11Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), elongation of telomeres using hTERT would prevent the induction of the senescence pathway in adriamycin-treated breast cancer cells or, at a minimum, postpone it. Both MCF-7- pBABEpuro cells and MCF-7-hTERT cells with elongated telomeres senesced with the same frequency and timing (Fig.5, A and B) nearly identical to uninfected MCF-7 controls. As expected, adriamycin treatment of MCF-7-hTERT cells did not result in a decline in telomerase activity levels (Fig. 5 C), whereas vector-only (pBABE) controls exhibited a decline in activity similar to uninfected MCF-7 cells (compare with Fig. 1). Because there was no lag in the timing of the onset of senescence in the MCF-7-hTERT cells, overall telomere shortening does not appear to be involved in the senescence process. To show this conclusively, at 24 (data not shown) and 72 h when the majority of cells are β-galactosidase-positive after acute treatment with adriamycin, changes in telomere length were determined for treated and untreated cells (representative TRF shown in Fig. 5 D). Mean telomere length calculations (24Ouellette M. Liao M. Shea-Herbert B. Johnson M. Holt S.E. Liss H.S. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10072-10076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) provide a quantitative estimate of changes in telomere length after treatment: MCF-7-pBABE (untreated 3.4 kb and treated 3.4 kb) and MCF-7-hTERT (untreated 8.3 kb and treated 8.1 kb). The 200-bp difference in calculated average telomere length in the MCF-7-hTERT cells is not significantly different and is within the range of experimental error. Thus, we found no substantial change in telomere length in treated and untreated MCF-7 and MCF-7-hTERT cells, demonstrating that the senescence phenotype observed in adriamycin-treated cells is not directly related to overall telomere shortening. Because recent evidence implicates telomere dysfunction as a cause of replicative senescence (12Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), we determined the types of chromosomal changes induced by adriamycin treatment. To eliminate the possible contributions of shortened telomeres, we used the MCF-7-hTERT cells and evaluated the frequency and location of structural chromosomal changes in MCF-7-hTERT cells. As expected, adriamycin induced many structural anomalies related to chromosomal ends such as end:end fusions, end breaks, and radial chromosomes (TableI). Interestingly, the number of telomere-associated breaks and rearrangements (77 total observations excluding dicentrics) were overrepresented compared with interstitial breaks (24 observations) (p ≤ 0.0001). These data suggest that adriamycin, a potent topoisomerase II inhibitor, preferentially produced breaks in distal chromosomal sequences and that these telomeric changes may ultimately contribute to the onset of replicative senescence in p53 wild-type breast tumor cells.Table ICharacterization of cytogenetic abnormalities in adriamycin-treated MCF-7 cellsCell lineMetaphases scoredMetaphases with abnormalitiesaSeveral spreads had more than one structural change, so the total number of anomalies seen is greater than the number of abnormal spreads.Structural anomalies involving chromosome endsDicentricsbThe end versusinterstitial nature of the breaks giving rise to dicentric chromosomes could not always be clearly delineated.

HCV NS5A, one of non-structural proteins of HCV, was suggested to play a role in oncogenic transformation. Since the tumor suppressor p53 is important for preventing neoplastic transformation, we investigated the functional effects of HCV NS5A on p53. In vitro and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy were used to determine the interaction of NS5A and p53. HCV NS5A binds directly to p53 and colocalizes p53 in the perinuclear region. NS5A inhibits transcriptional transactivation by p53 in a dose-dependent manner by use of a reporter assay. Down regulation of endogenous p21/waf1 expression, which is activated by p53 in Hep3B cells, by NS5A was demonstrated by using FLAG- and FLAG-NS5A Hep3B stable cell lines. The effect of NS5A on p53-mediated apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry in both NS5A permanently and transiently transfected Hep3B cells with exogenous p53. The p53-induced apoptosis was abrogated by NS5A and the inhibition effect correlates well with the binding ability of NS5A to p53. In addition, HCV NS5A protein interacts with and colocalizes hTAFII32, a component of TFIID and an essential coactivator of p53, in vivo. These results suggest that HCV NS5A interacts with and partially sequestrates p53 and hTAFII32 in the cytoplasm and suppresses p53-mediated transcriptional transactivation and apoptosis during HCV infection, which may contribute to the hepatocarcinogenesis of HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2330598934,"The progressive growth of most neoplasms is dependent upon the establishment of new blood vessels, a process regulated by tumor-secreted factors and matrix proteins. We examined the in vitro and in vivo angiogenic ability of conditioned media obtained from fibrosarcoma, carcinoma, and osteosarcoma cells and their decorin-transfected counterparts. Human endothelial cells were investigated in vitro by evaluating three essential steps of angiogenesis: migration, attachment, and differentiation. On the whole, wild-type tumor cell-secretions enhanced endothelial cell attachment, migration, and differentiation, whereas their decorin-expressing forms inhibited these processes. Similarly, decorin-containing media suppressed endothelial cell sprouting in an ex vivo aortic ring assay. Since angiogenesis is an important component of tumor expansion, the growth rate of these cells as tumor xenografts was examined by implantation in nude mice. In vivo, the decorin-expressing tumor xenografts grew at markedly lower rates and showed a significant suppression of neovascularization. Immunohistochemical, Northern and Western blot analyses indicated that the decorin-expressing cells produced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at markedly reduced rates vis-á-vis their wild-type counterparts. Specificity of this process was confirmed by experiments where addition of recombinant decorin to the wild-type tumor cells caused 80-95% suppression of VEGF mRNA and protein. These results provide a novel mechanism of action for decorin, and indicate that decorin could adversely affect in vivo tumor growth by suppressing the endogenous tumor cell production of a powerful angiogenic stimulus."

In prokaryotes, NO is encountered as an intermediate in the global nitrogen cycle, namely in the process of denitrification, i.e. reduction of nitrate/nitrite to N2. Prokaryotes not directly involved in these metabolic pathways may nevertheless be exposed to high fluxes of NO, produced either abiotically or biotically (for example by macrophages (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3520) Google Scholar)). In denitrifying bacteria, NO is reduced to N2O by nitric-oxide reductase (NOR),1 a membrane-bound enzyme containing at the catalytic subunit a hemeb3 -FeB binuclear center (2Zumft W.G. Microbiol.

The major distinctive feature of this large family is the common core unit, built by two independent structural modules: the N-terminal one characterized by a β-lactamase-like fold and the second domain, having a short chain flavodoxin-like fold (10Frazão C.

Interestingly, in these enterobacteria, downstream from the gene encoding for the A-type flavoprotein, there is a gene encoding for a NADH:rubedoxin oxidoreductase, with both genes possibly forming a dicistronic transcriptional unit. The recombinant enzyme from E. coli (named flavorubredoxin, FlRd), purified and characterized, was shown to contain one rubredoxin-like center, one FMN, and one di-iron center. It was further shown that indeed it receives electrons from the NADH:oxidoreductase (FlRd-red) encoded in the same gene locus (22Gomes C.M. Vicente J.B. Wasserfallen A. Teixeira M.

However, the same authors were unable to show that the flavorubredoxin is responsible for NO reduction, attributing this failure to enzyme instability. In this article, we show that recombinant E. coli flavorubredoxin is a NO reductase, with a turnover number (14.9 ± 6.7 mol of NO·mol FlRd−1·s−1) similar to that of canonical heme b3-FeB containing NOR enzymes (2Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar, 3Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lubben M. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus we demonstrate the existence of a novel family of NO reductases, which is likely to be widespread among strict and facultative anaerobes. Recombinant FlRd and FlRd-red were expressed and purified as described previously (8Wasserfallen A. Ragettli S. Jouanneau Y. Leisinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Gomes C.M. Vicente J.B. Wasserfallen A. Teixeira M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16230-16237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Amplification of the Rd domain of E. coli FlRd was achieved by means of a PCR reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), the recombinant plasmid pME2543 (that contains the complete E. coli orf479 (8Wasserfallen A. Ragettli S. Jouanneau Y. Leisinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)), and the following oligonucleotides: sense primer, (5′-GCTCATATGGGCCCACGGAT-3′), which introduced a NdeI site changing the codon of the residue 422 to the initiation codon ATG, and antisense primer, T7 22-mer (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′). The amplicon was digested withNdeI and HindIII, ligated into compatible sites on pT7-7 (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1995Google Scholar), and transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. The cloned insert was then sequenced in both strands by using vector-specific oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent dideoxy terminators and an ABI model 377 DNA sequencer. After confirming that the correct nucleotide sequence was amplified, the recombinant plasmid was transformed in BL21-Gold(DE3). Overnight cultures, grown aerobically at 37 °C in minimal medium M9 (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1995Google Scholar) containing ampicilin (100 μg/ml), were diluted 1/100 into the same medium, grown to anA 600 of 0.8, induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested by centrifugation after 4 h. After cell disruption in a French press at 7000 p.s.i. (in two cycles), and soluble extract separation from the membranes through 16-h ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g (at 5 °C), the rubredoxin domain of flavorubredoxin was purified in a two-step procedure, in a HiLoad Pharmacia system. The soluble extract was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (buffer A), and then loaded into a 60-ml Q-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with buffer A. The rubredoxin domain of flavorubredoxin eluted at ∼400 mmNaCl was concentrated in a Diaflo cell with a YM3 cutoff membrane and further applied to a Superdex S-75 gel filtration column, previously equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl in buffer A. The eluted protein was found to be pure, as assayed by SDS-gel electrophoresis (25Garfin D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Total protein was determined using the BCA procedure (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18792) Google Scholar) and iron quantitated by the TPTZ (2,4,6-tripyridyl-1,3,5-triazine) method (27Fischer D.S. Price D.C. Clin. Chem. 1964; 10: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Total FMN content of FlRd was assessed after protein denaturation with 8% trichloroacetic acid, using an extinction coefficient of 12500 m−1·cm−1 at λ = 450 nm to quantify the flavin. Recombinant FlRd was found to contain 1 mol of flavin/mol of protein and ∼3.3 mol of iron/mol of protein, while FlRd reductase contained 1 mol of FAD/mol of protein, and the FlRd rubredoxin domain contained 1 mol of iron/mol of protein. The detailed characterization of the rubredoxin domain will be published elsewhere. Nitric oxide consumption measurements were carried out using a World Precision Instruments ISO-NOP 2 mm electrode, at room temperature. Assays were carried out under anaerobic conditions in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH = 7.6, in the presence of EDTA (20 μm), glucose (3 mm), glucose oxidase (4 units/ml), and catalase (130 units/ml). Oxygen consumption rates were measured using a Yellow Springs micro-O2electrode, in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.6 and room temperature. The NO reductase activity of E. coli FlRd was investigated measuring NO consumption in the presence of the physiological partner, FlRd reductase, and NADH. It was observed that FlRd catalyzes efficiently the NO consumption (Fig.1); the rate of 14.9 ± 6.7 mol of NO·mol FlRd−1·s−1 was estimated by averaging 26 independent measurements carried out at different concentrations of FlRd-red (Fig. 2) and at saturating NADH concentration (> 200 μm). The activity is linearly dependent on FlRd concentration, but is essentially independent of NO concentration from ≤1 μm(approximately the physiological levels) to ∼10 μm. This shows that the enzyme has high affinity for NO (K m < 1 μm), consistent with the zero-order kinetics of the observed NO consumption (Fig. 1).Figure 2E. coli FlRd is a bifunctional NO and O2 reductase. O2 and NO reductase activity of E. coli FlRd (7.5 or 22.5 nm) were measured in the presence of NADH (>200 μm), at increasing concentration of FlRd-reductase. NO consumption was measured at [NO] = 1 ÷ 10 μm, whereas O2consumption was estimated from initial rate at high [O2],i.e. in air-equilibrated buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Control experiments showed that the observed NO consumption is exclusively attributable to FlRd-mediated catalysis: (i) in the absence of FlRd, NO consumption mediated by the NADH/FlRd-red pair was much lower (even at different FlRd-red concentrations) than in the presence of FlRd; (ii) FlRd denaturation by boiling the protein for 10 min in the presence of 10% SDS totally abolishes NO consumption, thus excluding that contaminant inorganic compounds in the medium are responsible for the observed NO degradation. Altogether, these results clearly establish that E. coli FlRd operates as a bona fide NOR, with a measured turnover number comparable with that published for NOR from P. denitrificans (in the range ∼10–50 mol of NO·mol NOR−1·s−1 (2Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar,3Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lubben M. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)). The E. coliFlRd contains two different metal centers, integrated into distinct structural domains: the rubredoxin (Rd) center in a rubredoxin-like fold and the non-heme di-iron site. Several evidences show that the di-iron center is the site of NO reduction in FlRd. We previously observed by EPR spectroscopy that the di-iron center of FlRd is able to bind NO (22Gomes C.M. Vicente J.B. Wasserfallen A. Teixeira M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16230-16237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this work we have tested a truncated form of FlRd, consisting solely of the rubredoxin domain, that proved to be unable to process NO (data not shown), despite being still efficiently reduced by the NADH/FlRd-reductase couple. 2C. M. Gomes, J. B. Vicente, L. M. Saraiva, and M. Teixeira, unpublished observations. Furthermore, the NO reductase activity is not inhibited by cyanide (even after 1-day incubation, both at 4 °C or at room temperature, and 3 mm cyanide), which is consistent with the fact that the di-iron site has low affinity for cyanide. The FlRd di-iron site is capable of reducing O2 to water, in the presence of NADH and FlRd-red (22Gomes C.M. Vicente J.B. Wasserfallen A. Teixeira M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16230-16237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Within experimental errors, the NO and O2consumption rates are similar (Fig. 2), as estimated from the initial rate at high O2 concentration, i.e. in air-equilibrated buffer. NO and O2 consumption may be thus rate-limited by the same event (for instance by internal electron transfer to the di-iron site). However, whereas NO is processed with a high affinity, O2 reduction does not follow a zero-order kinetics, as the apparent rate starts to slow down at ∼200 μm O2. This points to a relatively low affinity for O2, compared with the much higher affinity for NO (K m < 1 μm). It is interesting that a similar observation has been described for the P. denitrificans NOR (see Fig. 7 in Ref. 28Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1866-1871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results reported in this article demonstrate that in vitro E. coli FlRd has NO reductase activity, comparable with that of canonical hemeb3 -FeB containing NORs. Although at this stage it was not possible to measure this activity in other A-type flavoproteins, the large overall similarity in amino acid sequence among most members of this family, and the conservation of residues binding the di-iron site (29Gomes C.M. Frazao C. Xavier A.V. Legall J. Teixeira M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the NO reductase activity will be found in many other (if not all) A-type flavoproteins. These enzymes seem therefore to display a bifunctional activity, in so far as they are also able to catalyze the reduction of O2to water. In this respect we notice a similarity between the heme-copper oxygen reductases and the NO reductases, providing evidence for a widespread bifunctional versatility in the prokaryotic response to environmental conditions, notably detoxification of O2or NO."

Here we report that a catalytically active derivative (termed LHN/A) of the type A neurotoxin from Clostridium botulinum has been coupled to a lectin obtained from Erythrina cristagalli to form a novel conjugate. This conjugate exhibits anin vitro selectivity for nociceptive afferents compared with the anatomically adjacent spinal neurons, as assessed usingin vitro primary neuronal culture systems to measure inhibition of release of neurotransmitters. Chemical conjugates prepared between E. cristagalli lectin and either natively sourced LHN/A or recombinant LHN/A purified from Escherichia coli are assessed, and equivalence of the recombinant material are demonstrated. Furthermore, the dependence of inhibition of neurotransmitter release on the cleavage of SNAP-25 is demonstrated through the use of an endopeptidase-deficient LHN/A conjugate variant. The duration of action of inhibition of neurotransmitter released by the conjugate in vitro is assessed and is comparable with that observed withClostridium botulinum neurotoxin. Finally, in vivo electrophysiology shows that these in vitroactions have biological relevance in that sensory transmission from nociceptive afferents through the spinal cord is significantly attenuated. These data demonstrate that the potent endopeptidase activity of clostridial neurotoxins can be selectively retargeted to cells of interest and that inhibition of release of neurotransmitters from a neuronal population of therapeutic relevance to the treatment of pain can be achieved.

The clostridial neurotoxin (CNT) 1The abbreviations used are: CNT, clostridial neurotoxin; HC, heavy chain C terminus; HN, heavy chain N terminus; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; SNAP, synaptosome-associated protein-25; eDRG, embryonic dorsal root ganglia; ECL, Erythrina cristagalli lectin; eSCN, embryonic spinal cord neuron; BSS, balanced salt solution. family includes tetanus toxin (TeNT), produced by Clostridium tetani, and the seven antigenically distinct botulinum neurotoxins produced from strains of Clostridium botulinum (BoNTs). These proteins are responsible for the conditions of tetanus and botulism, respectively, that develop as a direct result of inhibition of Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release, a mechanism of action common to all the CNTs. In the case of BoNTs, intoxication of the neuromuscular junction is thought to occur in at least three phases: an initial binding phase, an internalization phase, and finally a neurotransmitter blockade phase (1Simpson L.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1981; 33: 155-188PubMed Google Scholar). All CNTs have a similar structure and consist of a heavy chain (∼100 kDa) covalently joined to a light chain (∼50 kDa) by a single disulfide bond. Proteolytic cleavage of the heavy chain ofC. botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) generates two fragments of ∼50 kDa each. The C-terminal domain (HC) is required for target cell binding, with the N-terminal domain (HN) being proposed to be involved in intracellular membrane translocation (2Shone C.C. Hambleton P. Melling J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which the disulfide bond between the light and heavy chains is maintained, trypsin cleavage results in a 100-kDa species termed LHN/A (light chain plus N-terminal heavy chain domain) representing a catalytically active, non-cell binding, non-toxic derivative of BoNT/A. In addition to obtaining LHN/A from BoNT/A, we have recently reported that LHN/A can be expressed and purified from a heterologous expression host (3Chaddock J. Prot. Exp. Purif. 2002; 25: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is proposed that CNTs bind to their target cell by a combination of specific high affinity binding events, possibly involving more than one ganglioside and glycoprotein component (4Halpern J.L. Neale E.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 221-241PubMed Google Scholar). The proposal that BoNT/B binds to synaptotagmin and the gangliosides GT1b and GD1a (5Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10498-10503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that BoNT/A and BoNT/E may also bind to synaptotagmin (6Li L. Singh B.R. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar) has supported this concept. Having accomplished the first cell intoxication stage of binding, CNTs require mechanisms to facilitate internalization into, and intracellular routing within, the target cell. Although the definitive mechanisms remain unclear, the role of an acidic compartment has been proposed (7Hoch D.H. Romero-Mira M. Ehrlich B.E. Finkelstein A. DasGupta B.R. Simpson L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) in common with a number of other bacterial protein toxins (8Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It is proposed that it is the role of the HN domain to facilitate translocation of the endopeptidase into the cytosol, and the successful retargeting of functional LHN/A into model cell lines (9Chaddock J.A. Purkiss J.R. Friis L.M. Broadbridge J.D. Duggan M.J. Fooks S.J. Shone C.C. Quinn C.P. Foster K.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has excluded the obligatory requirement of the HC domain for intracellular trafficking mechanisms. Once the CNT (or fragment) has gained access to the cytosol, the proteolytic light chains specifically hydrolyze key components of the SNARE protein complex (10Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar) required for synaptic vesicle docking, fusion, and neurotransmitter release. In the case of BoNT/A and BoNT/E the substrate is synaptosome-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25), whereas the vesicle-associated membrane protein and syntaxin families of proteins are substrates for neurotoxin types B, D, F, G, and type C, respectively (11Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S., De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R. Nature. 1993; 365: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 12Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that cleavage of these components of the SNARE complex by CNTs results in inhibition of transmitter release from a variety of neuronal cell systems. It is also known that formation of the SNARE complex is a universal mechanism of vesicle fusion and secretion, not limited to neuronal cell types. To circumvent the limited availability of the requisite toxin receptor(s) on the target cell of interest, we have previously reported the replacement of the HC domain with a variety of ligands and retargeting of the LHN/A fragment into a range of neuronal and non-neuronal cells (9Chaddock J.A. Purkiss J.R. Friis L.M. Broadbridge J.D. Duggan M.J. Fooks S.J. Shone C.C. Quinn C.P. Foster K.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Chaddock J.A. Purkiss J.R. Duggan M.J. Quinn C.P. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Growth Factors. 2000; 18: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study we have further developed the technology of retargeting clostridial endopeptidases with a view to endowing the conjugate with an ability to selectively target cells of potential therapeutic interest relative to anatomically and functionally closely related cells. Furthermore, we have investigated aspects of the duration of action of retargeted endopeptidases because a number of reports (14Brashear A. Watts M.W. Marchetti A. Magar R. Lau H. Wang L. Clin. Ther. 2000; 22: 1516-1524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,15Johnson E.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 551-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) highlight the significant longevity of action of BoNT/A when used therapeutically. As a model system we have chosen to study the effects of selectively targeting the endopeptidase domain to nociceptive afferents. In vivo, the role of nociceptive afferents is to sense noxious stimuli at the periphery and to transmit this information to the central nervous system where it is perceived as pain. Transmission of this signal is dependent on release of a number of transmitters (including glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide) from synaptic vesicles (16Dray A. Urban L. Dickenson A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 190-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Though these transmitters are found in the same terminals of small-diameter primary afferents, glutamate is released from a different population of synaptic vesicles to the neuropeptides (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) (17De Biasi S. Rustioni A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7820-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that release of substance P from a rat embryonic dorsal root ganglia (eDRG) neuronal culture system (an in vitro system representative of nociceptive afferents) is sensitive to inhibition by BoNT/A (18Welch M.J. Purkiss J.R. Foster K.A. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), indicating that release of substance P is SNARE-mediated. We theorized that if clostridial endopeptidases could be selectively targeted to the nociceptive afferents in preference to anatomically adjacent neurons inhibition of the transmission of noxious stimuli may be specifically prevented. In the search for suitable targeting ligands we observed that lectins (non-immunoglobulin proteins that recognize and bind to carbohydrates) (19Lis H. Sharon N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 35-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 20Sharon N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) had the potential to selectively bind to extracellular moieties and thus be used to differentiate between cell types. It has been reported that galactose-containing carbohydrates are selectively present on nociceptive neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system relative to other neurons (21Streit W.J. Schulte B.A. Balentine D.J. Spicer S.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1985; 33: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Streit W.J. Schulte B.A. Balentine J.D. Spicer S.S. Brain Res. 1986; 377: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). From these reports, and experiments to identify binding of fluorescent-labeled lectins, we identified Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) as a suitable ligand for selectively targeting LHN/A endopeptidase to nociceptive afferents. Here we report that LHN/A-ECL conjugate binds to, internalizes into, and inhibits stimulated neurotransmitter release from cultured eDRG neuronal cell types in preference to spinal cord neurons. Through the use of an endopeptidase-deficient conjugate variant, effects on neurotransmitter release are correlated to cleavage of the natural BoNT/A substrate SNAP-25. This ability to achieve cell-selective inhibition of secretion by retargeted LHNpoints to the potential future therapeutic use of retargeted clostridial endopeptidases and, specifically in this instance, to the treatment of pain. Recombinant and “native” (i.e. prepared by trypsin treatment of BoNT/A) LHN/A were prepared as described elsewhere (3Chaddock J. Prot. Exp. Purif. 2002; 25: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Derivatization of ECL (Sigma; reconstituted to 10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) and LHN/A (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was based on methodology described previously (9Chaddock J.A. Purkiss J.R. Friis L.M. Broadbridge J.D. Duggan M.J. Fooks S.J. Shone C.C. Quinn C.P. Foster K.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2 reactive leaving groups were introduced into LHN/A and a single sulfhydryl group was introduced into ECL, in both cases by reaction withN-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate. Initial fractionation of the conjugate mixture was performed by size exclusion chromatography (Superose-12, or Superdex G-200 depending on the scale of conjugation). Application of high molecular weight material to immobilized lactose (Sigma) isolated functional conjugate, which was eluted by the addition of 0.3 m lactose. Specifically eluted fractions were dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline to remove lactose. To create an LHN/A variant defective in endopeptidase activity, a single amino acid mutation at position 227 of the light chain sequence was performed by introduction of the codon for tyrosine (TAC) in place of histidine (CAC). Mutagenesis was performed by overlap polymerase chain reaction using a mutagenic primer pair of CACACGAGCTCATCTACGCCGGTCATCG and CGATGACCGGCGTAGATGAGCTCGTGTG. A single silent SacI site was introduced to aid screening of mutants. The integrity of the entire LHN/A(H227Y) DNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing. Mutated DNA was transformed intoEscherichia coli TG1, and expression and purification procedures followed essentially as described previously (3Chaddock J. Prot. Exp. Purif. 2002; 25: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were performed by standard protocols (Novex). Assessment of the ability ofrecLHN/A,recLHN/A(H227Y), and conjugates to cleave SNAP-25 in vitro was performed essentially as previously described (23Hallis B. James B.A.F. Shone C.C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 1934-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary neuronal cultures of eDRG and eSCN were established using modifications of existing procedures (24Ransom B.R. Neale E. Henkart M. Bullock P.N. Nelson P.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1977; 40: 1132-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 25Williamson L.C. Halpern J.L. Montecucco C. Brown J.E. Neale E.A. J. Biol.

John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1999: 389-393Google Scholar). Briefly, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord neurons were harvested from 15-day-old fetal Sprague-Dawley rats. For culture of eDRG, dissociated cells were plated onto 24-well plates coated with Matrigel at a density of 1 × 106cells/well. One day postplating the cells were treated with 10 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside for 48 h. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5 mml-glutamine, 0.6% d-glucose, 2% B27 supplement, and 100 ng/ml 2.5S mouse nerve growth factor. Cultures were maintained for 2 weeks at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2 before addition of test materials. In the case of eSCN, dissociated cells were plated onto 12-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well. After 1 week, the cells were treated with 35 μg/ml uridine and 15 μg/ml 2-fluoro 5′-deoxyuridine and grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.6%d-glucose, 40 ng/ml corticosterone, 20 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 0.15% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, and 2% N1 supplement. Cultures were maintained for 3 weeks at 37 °C in 90% air/10% CO2 before addition of test materials. Release of substance P from eDRG was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, eDRG cells were washed twice with low potassium-balanced salt solution (BSS: 5 mmKCl, 137 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 0.44 mmKH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2). Basal samples were obtained by incubating each well for 5 min with 1 ml of low potassium BSS. After removal of this buffer, the cells were stimulated to release by incubation with 1 ml of high potassium buffer (BSS as above with modification to include 100 mm KCl isotonically balanced with NaCl) for 5 min. All samples were removed to tubes on ice prior to assay of substance P. Total cell lysates were prepared by addition of 250 μl of 2 m acetic acid/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to lyse the cells, centrifugal evaporation, and resuspension in 500 μl of assay buffer. Diluted samples were assessed for substance P content. Substance P immunoreactivity was measured using Substance P Enzyme Immunoassay Kits (Cayman Chemical Company or R&D Systems) according to manufacturers' instructions. Substance P is expressed in pg/ml relative to a standard substance P curve run in parallel. Release of glutamate from eDRG was assessed as described previously (27Purkiss J.R. Welch M.J. Doward S. Foster K.A. Quinn C.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: S108Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, eDRG were exposed to 2–5 μCi/ml (1 ml/well) of [3H]-l-glutamine for 80 min at 37 °C, prior to extensive washing in low potassium BSS. Cells were stimulated to release by the addition of 100 mm KCl for 3 min. Released glutamate was identified following separation ofl-[3H]glutamate from non-metabolizedl-[3H]glutamine by ion exchange chromatography (Dowex-1). Release of transmitter from eSCN was determined essentially as described previously (25Williamson L.C. Halpern J.L. Montecucco C. Brown J.E. Neale E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7694-7699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, eSCN cells were washed with BSS and then loaded with [3H]glycine for 30 min prior to wash and then removal of basal and stimulated (using 56 mmK+ solution) samples. Cells were lysed by addition of 250 μl of 2 m acetic acid/1% trifluoroacetic acid, and a sample was used to determine total counts from which % release could be calculated. The basal, stimulated, and cell lysate readings were determined by liquid scintillation counting of the cleared superfusate collected from each treatment. Determination of the ratio of cleaved SNAP-25 to uncleaved SNAP-25 in eDRG following exposure to conjugate material was assessed as described previously (28Boyd R.S. Duggan M.J. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18216-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Test material was applied intrathecally using methodology previously described (29Dickenson A.H. Sullivan A.F. Pain. 1986; 24: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Matthews E.A. Dickenson A.H. Pain. 2001; 92: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, to assess the acute effects of test material on the responses of spinal cord neurons to stimulation of C-, Aβ- and Aδ-fibers, 100 μl of LHN/A-ECL (4.5 μg/μl) was applied to the exposed spinal cord of halothane/nitrous oxide anesthetized rats. Rats were maintained at 37 °C in a state of areflexia under 1.5–1.8% halothane. Extracellular recordings of convergent dorsal horn neurons were made with parylene-coated tungsten electrodes descended through the spinal cord (mean depth of recording neurons was 700 μm from the surface of the cord). The responses of neurons following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (2-ms wide pulses) of the center of the receptive field were recorded. Responses elicited by a train of 16 stimuli at three times the stimulation threshold for C-fibers were quantified and followed for up to 8 h following spinal application of test material. In a separate group of animals, assessment of electrophysiological response 24 h after application of conjugate was performed by modification of the above procedure. 10 μl of a 4.5 μg/μl solution of LHN/A-ECL was applied by intrathecal injection between lumbar sections L4-L5. Animals were allowed to recover, and then analysis of neuronal activity was made at 24 h postapplication, at which time 10 neurons from a single animal were assessed for response to transcutaneous electrical stimulation as described above. Recordings from 10 neurons from an untreated animal were used to establish control response. The ability of botulinum toxin and conjugate material to induce paralysis in mice (20–25 g, MF1) was evaluated following intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of test sample in gelatin-phosphate buffer (1% (w/v) Na2HPO4, 0.2% (w/v) gelatin, pH 6.5–6.6, using methodology reported previously (31Tse C.K. Dolly J.O. Hambleton P. Wray D. Melling J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To prepare a conjugate capable of selective targeting of eDRG neurons, data were obtained for the binding of a range of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled lectins to eDRG and eSCN. Data obtained for the lectin obtained from the seeds of ECL demonstrated the most appropriate pattern of eDRG localization (data not shown). Conjugation of ECL to the nLHN/A (native LHN/A) and recLHN/A (recombinant LHN/A) fragment was performed essentially as previously described for a wheat germ agglutinin-LHN/A conjugate (9Chaddock J.A. Purkiss J.R. Friis L.M. Broadbridge J.D. Duggan M.J. Fooks S.J. Shone C.C. Quinn C.P. Foster K.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), resulting in a conjugation efficiency of 15.9 ± 4.3% (mean yield of ∼5 mg of conjugate from 8 mg of LHN/A and 25 mg of ECL). There were no significant differences between the derivatization rates or final conjugate yield when nLHN/A,recLHN/A, orrecLHN/A(H227Y) was used for conjugate synthesis. Purification of the conjugate was achieved by a two-step process, involving size-exclusion chromatography to remove unconjugated ECL followed by affinity chromatography (immobilized lactose) to remove unconjugated LHN/A. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1), conjugated species of ∼160 kDa are the major component of the final material, representative of a single LHN/A endopeptidase covalently coupled to two ECL monomers. The species of ∼30 kDa apparent in lane 6 of Fig. 1represents ECL monomers that have been liberated from the conjugate in the presence of SDS, thus the final molecular mass of the predominant conjugate species is ∼200 kDa. However, it is clear from SDS-PAGE and size exclusion data that there is a range of conjugate species of varying ECL:LHN/A ratios present in the final purified mixture. Analysis of the conjugate material by native PAGE is suggestive of predominant conjugate species of 200 and 400 kDa (data not shown). In addition to the functionality of the ECL domain, as assessed by lactose binding, it was necessary to confirm that the endopeptidase activity of the conjugate was not adversely affected by the derivatization/conjugation process. By utilizing an in vitroSNAP-25 cleavage assay (23Hallis B. James B.A.F. Shone C.C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 1934-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was possible to demonstrate that the catalytic activity of LHN/A was maintained in the context of the conjugate. The concentration of material to result in 50% cleavage of SNAP-25 (EC50) was estimated to be 8.3 ± 1.7 pm, 5.4 ± 1.6 pm, 12.8 ± 7.8 pm, and 7.5 ± 2.2 pm forrecLHN/A, nLHN/A,recLHN/A-ECL, and nLHN/A-ECL, respectively. It was not possible to estimate an EC50 forrecLHN/A(H227Y) andrecLHN/A(H227Y)-ECL due to insufficient cleavage of SNAP-25; however, data indicated that the endopeptidase activity of the recLHN/A(H227Y) species was reduced ∼300-fold compared with recLHN/A. This is in reasonable agreement with the data previously reported for this H227Y mutation in the light chain of BoNT/A (32Zhou L. de Paiva A. Liu D. Aoki R. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15175-15181Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The toxicity of the conjugate compared with BoNT/A was assessed in the standard measure of toxicity for botulinum toxins, the mouse lethality assay. The mouse lethality assay is highly sensitive for BoNT, with a detection limit of only 5 pg (33Notermans S. Nagel J. Simpson L.L. Botulinum Neurotoxin and Tetanus Toxin. Academic Press, New York1989: 319-331Crossref Google Scholar). Injection of 50 μg ofrecLHN/A-ECL or nLHN/A-ECL conjugate did not result in any mouse deaths. Therefore the conjugate material has an improved toxicity profile of the order of 1 × 107, even though full endopeptidase activity is retained. This presumably reflects the differing neuronal selectivity of the two agents. In vitro DRG cultures obtained from embryonic rat tissue include neuronal populations representative of primary nociceptive afferents, and by measuring the release of appropriate neurotransmitters effects of agents on this neuronal population can be assessed. The close proximity of SCN to the DRG in vivo and the fact that SCN are exquisitely sensitive to BoNT holotoxin make the SCN system an appropriate control for the effects of inappropriately targeted endopeptidase. In addition, the outcome of treating both these cell types with BoNT has been reported previously (18Welch M.J. Purkiss J.R. Foster K.A. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 34Neale E.A. Bowers L.M. Jia M. Bateman K.E. Williamson L.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BoNT/A, nLHN/A-ECL, recLHN/A-ECL,recLHN/A(H227Y)-ECL, and unconjugated control materials were applied to eDRG and eSCN 3 days prior to assay of neurotransmitter release (substance P, and for some assays glutamate, from eDRG; glycine from eSCN). Fig. 2indicates the comparative effectiveness of nLHN/A-ECL,recLHN/A-ECL, and BoNT in their ability to inhibit release of substance P from eDRG (Fig. 2 A) and glycine from eSCN (Fig. 2 B). The IC50 values for inhibition of substance P were 17.5 ± 5.5 nm(n = 8), 17.5 ± 2.5 nm(n = 12), and 5.6 ± 0.93 pm(n = 4) for eDRG treated with nLHN/A-ECL,recLHN/A-ECL, and BoNT/A, respectively. These data, therefore, confirm the equivalence of the two conjugated ECL products. By comparison, it was not possible to calculate the IC50 for nLHN/A-,recLHN/A(H227Y)-, orrecLHN/A(H227Y)-ECL-treated cells due to the lack of effect even at high concentration. In all cases, the dose response observed for neurotransmitter release was in good agreement with the cleavage of SNAP-25. For example, cleavage of SNAP-25 (and inhibition of substance P release) from 30 μg/ml nLHN/A-ECL or recLHN/A-ECL-treated eDRG was determined to be 90.2 ± 6.0% (80.9 ± 4.3%) and 74.8 ± 6.5% (76.9 ± 2.2%), respectively. In addition to an assessment of the inhibition of release of substance P, the effect of ECL-targeted conjugates on the release of the fast neurotransmitter glutamate from eDRG was also determined. Following application of 10 μg/ml nLHN/A-ECL to eDRG for 3 days, 83.3 ± 9.1% (n = 3) inhibition of glutamate release was observed, compared with 11.4 ± 1.7% inhibition by LHN/A alone. In the eSCN model, the IC50 for inhibition of glycine by BoNT/A is 0.03 ± 0.01 pm (n = 3), whereas the IC50 for inhibition of glycine release by LHN/A-ECL conjugates could not be calculated due to the low effect (mean inhibition of release of 17.04 ± 2.1% (recLHN/A-ECL) and 40.94 ± 2.36% (nLHN/A-CL) at the maximum concentration used (30 μg/ml)). The ratio of IC50 data for inhibition of release for eSCN compared with eDRG neuron for BoNT/A-treated cells is 0.005:1. Due to the low effect of LHN/A-ECL conjugates in the eSCN model, it was not possible to accurately calculate such a ratio for LHN/A-ECL; however, it is estimated to be in the order of at least 6.9:1. Duration of action of ECL-targeted endopeptidase conjugates in vitro was assessed in the eDRG model. 40 μg/ml nLHN/A-ECL or 40 μg/mlrecLHN/A-ECL was applied to eDRG for 16 h prior to removal and assay of substance P release at specific intervals up to 24 days postapplication (Fig. 3). Maximal inhibition of substance P release was achieved after ∼10 days (71 and 68.2% for nLHN/A-ECL andrecLHN/A-ECL, respectively) with significant effects still observed to the end point of each assay. In a parallel series of experiments, effects of BoNT/A were also maintained to the end point of the assay (data not shown). The data therefore indicate that retargeted LHN/A does retain extended duration of effect in in vitro cell models akin to that of t"

Hypericin is a naturally occurring photosensitizer with promising properties for the PDT of cancer. Here we show that, in HeLa cells, photoactivated hypericin does not cause Bcl-2 degradation but induces Bcl-2 phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Bcl-2 phosphorylation is induced by sublethal PDT doses; increasing the photodynamic stress promptly leads to apoptosis, during which Bcl-2 is neither phosphorylated nor degraded. Bcl-2 phosphorylation involves mitochondrial Bcl-2 and correlates with the kinetics of a G2/M cell cycle arrest, preceding apoptosis. The co-localization of hypericin with α-tubulin and the aberrant mitotic spindles observed following sublethal PDT doses suggest that photodamage to the microtubule network provokes the G2/M phase arrest. PDT-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation is not altered by either the overexpression or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1) nor by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) or protein kinase C. By contrast, Bcl-2 phosphorylation is selectively suppressed by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK)-inhibitor roscovitine, completely blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and enhanced by the overexpression of CDK1, suggesting a role for this pathway. However, in an in vitro kinase assay, active CDK1/cyclin B1 complex failed to phosphorylate immunoprecipitated Bcl-2, suggesting that this protein kinase may not directly modify Bcl-2. Mutation of serine-70 to alanine in Bcl-2 abolishes PDT-induced phosphorylation and restores the caspase-3 activation to the same levels of the vector-transfected cells, indicating that Bcl-2 phosphorylation may be a signal to delay apoptosis in G2/M phase-arrested cells.

PDT involves the administration of a photosensitizing compound, which accumulates in the target cells, followed by selective irradiation of the lesion with visible light. This procedure results in a sequence of photochemical events that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce oxidative damage ultimately causing the killing of cancerous cells or other targets of therapeutic interest (1Pass H.I.

Merlevede W. de Witte P.A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), which have pointed to its potential as a valuable tool for clinical PDT. The molecular mechanisms underlying PDT in general, and of hypericin-PDT in particular, are not completely understood, although it has become clear that cell photosensitization initiates multiple signaling pathways that ultimately lead to cell death (6Agostinis P.

We have recently shown that PDT with hypericin induces either apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the intracellular hypericin concentration and/or the light-activating dose (9Vantieghem A. Assefa Z.

In HeLa cells, apoptosis induced by hypericin-PDT is associated with a rapid and sustained activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which is independent of caspase activation and functionally antagonizes cell death (12Assefa Z. Vantieghem A. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. de Witte P. Agostinis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8788-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although hypericin does not accumulate in mitochondria but localizes in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (6Agostinis P. Vantieghem A. Merlevede W. de Witte P.A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), its photoactivation induces a rapid loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, which is followed by a sharp increase in the activity of caspase-3 and apoptotic cell death (9Vantieghem A.

Furthermore, recent studies have shown that hypericin-PDT-induced cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis can be substantially retarded in cells overexpressing the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (10Vantieghem A., Xu, Y.

Petit P.X. Israel N. Sureau F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Members of the family of Bcl-2 proteins have emerged as key regulators of apoptosis by acting either as promoters or as suppressors of the cell death process (14Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). In addition to its anti-apoptotic function, Bcl-2 has also been found to affect cell cycle progression, wherein it favors the quiescent state by accelerating withdrawal from the cell cycle or by retarding re-entry. This effect has been shown to be separated from its pro-survival function (15Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A. Cory S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Vairo G. Innes K.M. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1511-1519PubMed Google Scholar, 17Vairo G. Soos T.J. Upton T.M. Zalvide J.

Because Bcl-2 family members are important guardians of the cell death process, post-translational modifications of Bcl-2 proteins may have a great impact on cell fate. Modifications such as degradation and phosphorylation have emerged as important devices for modulating the anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-2 (18Fadeel B. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1647-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 phosphorylation occurs in a large unstructured loop of the protein located between the BH4 and BH3 regions (amino acids 32–80), a proline-rich region called the “loop region,” which contains several serine and threonine residues and is therefore amenable to phosphorylation (19Blagosklonny M.V.

Some Bcl-2 phosphorylations have been reported to enhance the cytoprotective effects of Bcl-2, whereas others rendered the cells more susceptible to apoptosis. The Bcl-2 phosphorylation induced by growth factor withdrawal, interleukin-3, or PKC agonists enhanced the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 function (21May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A.

Some other studies suggested that the functional consequences of Bcl-2 phosphorylation might be associated with mitotic arrest rather than with the regulation of apoptosis (33Ling Y.H. Tornos C.

Leukemia. 2001; 15: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Deng X. Kornblau S.M. Ruvolo P.P. May Jr., W.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 2000; 28: 30-37Crossref Google Scholar), it is likely that the role of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in promoting or inhibiting apoptosis may depend on the phosphorylation site(s) involved and the cellular context where this event takes place, as well as on its duration. Given the established relevance of the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation in photodynamic cell killing (6Agostinis P. Vantieghem A. Merlevede W. de Witte P.A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 7Moor A.C. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2000; 57: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), several recent studies have addressed the role of Bcl-2 in PDT. In some systems overexpression of Bcl-2 has been shown to prevent or delay apoptosis-related events (10Vantieghem A., Xu, Y. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Denecker G. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. de Witte P.A Agostinis P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 43Granville D.J. Jiang H., An, M.T. Levy J.G. McManus B.M. Hunt D.W. Br. J.

Photobiol. 1996; 64: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This suggests that increased levels of Bcl-2, as found in many tumors, may hamper the efficacy of PDT. By contrast, a rapid photodestruction of Bcl-2 or its down-regulation with antisense oligonucleotides resulting in a higher Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and an increased sensitivity to cell photokilling, has been recently reported in studies utilizing porphyrin-related photosensitizers (45Kim H.R. Luo Y., Li, G. Kessel D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3429-3432PubMed Google Scholar, 46Srivastava M. Ahmad N. Gupta S. Mukhtar H. J. Biol.

Photobiol. 2001; 74: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These conflicting data on the role of Bcl-2 in PDT prompted us to undertake a study of the potential regulation of the Bcl-2 function by post-translational modifications, i.e. degradation and/or phosphorylation, and its relevance for the hypericin-induced apoptosis. In this study we report that photosensitized hypericin does not induce the loss of Bcl-2 protein but results in a dose-dependent Bcl-2 phosphorylation in the mitochondria. This event is not observed in apoptotic cells but is associated with a hypericin-PDT-induced G2/M growth arrest, which precedes the onset of apoptosis. The co-localization of hypericin with α-tubulin suggests that photodamage to the microtubule network may lead to the observed formation of dysfunctional mitotic spindles, blocking the progression of mitosis in PDT-treated cells. Interfering with the p38 MAPK, JNK1, ERK, or PKC signaling pathways does not alter the level of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in photosensitized cells. The Bcl-2 phosphorylation is enhanced in CDK1-overexpressing cells; it is inhibited by the CDK inhibitor roscovitine, and it is dependent on de novoprotein synthesis. Mutation of residue Ser70 in Bcl-2 drastically blocks PDT-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation in mutant cells and increases caspase-3 activation to levels observed in vector-transfected cells. These results suggest that Bcl-2 phosphorylation may be a signal to restrict premature apoptosis of photodamaged cells. Hypericin was prepared, purified, and dissolved in Me2SO as described in Ref. 48Vandenbogaerde A.L. Cuveele J.F. Proot P. Himpens B.E. Merlevede W.J. de Witte P.A. J. Photochem. Photobiol.

The cells were subsequently irradiated in hypericin-free medium by placing the samples on a plastic diffuser sheet 5 cm above a set of seven L18W/30 fluorescent lamps (Osram, Berlin, Germany) as described previously (9Vantieghem A. Assefa Z. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Courtois S. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. de Witte P. Agostinis P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). At the surface of the diffuser, the uniform fluence rate was 4.5 milliwatts/cm2, as measured with an IL 1400 radiometer (International Light, Newburyport, MA). The fluence or light dose (J/cm2) was calculated by multiplying the fluence rate with the time. All inhibitors used were added to the cell culture medium 1 or 2 h prior to photosensitization at concentrations indicated in the figure legend. The cell cycle profile was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining of the DNA with Sytox Green. At the indicated time points after irradiation, the cells were trypsinized, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 70% (v/v) ethanol overnight at −20 °C. After fixing, the cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in DNA extraction buffer containing 0.2 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.8, and 0.1 m citric acid, and kept at room temperature for 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged again and resuspended for 30 min in DNA staining buffer containing 1 μm Sytox Green in PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A. Finally the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a 488-nm argon laser for excitation. The green fluorescence was measured at 525 nm (FACSCalibur, BD PharMingen, Mountain View, CA). For each sample, 104cells were measured and the data were analyzed by using the Cell Quest software. Cell viability was estimated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) metabolism. Briefly, HeLa cells (5 × 103) were plated in 96-well plates and PDT-treated as described before. 20 h after irradiation 20 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added, and the cells were incubated for another 4 h at 37 °C. The MTT crystals were then dissolved by adding 10% SDS in 0.01 m HCl, and the absorbance at 550 nm was measured (SLT, Salzburg, Austria). Apoptotic cells, characterized by cellular shrinkage and membrane blebbing, were scored by phase contrast microscopic analysis following PDT in at least 10 fields with a minimum of 50 cells/field and expressed as percentage of apoptotic cells over the total number of cells. Caspase-3 activation was measured by DEVD-amc cleavage exactly as described in Ref. 10Vantieghem A., Xu, Y. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Denecker G. Vandenheede J.R.

Cell extracts were prepared at the indicated time points following photosensitization. After collecting the cells and removing the medium, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 nm microcystin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Then the cells were homogenized by repeated passage through a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce). Samples (50–100 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran®, Schleider & Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany) or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection was carried out with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Science Products). Hypericin-photosensitized cells were lysed 16 h after treatment in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar). Control samples containing the phosphatase in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitors EDTA (20 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (4 mm) or samples without phosphatase addition were incubated either at 30 °C or at 4 °C for the same length of time prior to analysis by gel electrophoresis. HeLa cells (6 × 107) were washed in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 3 ml of a hypotonic buffer (HB) containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 nm microcystin, and protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 25 min. The cells were then disrupted by repeated passage through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (S1) was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in HB. This cell disruption procedure was repeated three times. The pellet fraction (P1) was further purified by centrifugation (Beckman SW27 rotor at 17,000 × g) over a 1.6 m sucrose cushion. The nuclei were recovered at the bottom of the tubes. The supernatant S1 was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 × g. This supernatant (S2) was kept and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to give the cytosolic cell fraction. The pellet fraction (P2), corresponding to the mitochondrial fraction, was suspended in HB and further purified by centrifugation after layering it on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 1 m sucrose in HB on top of 1.5m sucrose in HB. Mitochondria were recovered at the interface of the 1 and 1.5 m sucrose layers. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. The purity of the fractions was confirmed by assessing the localization of fraction-specific proteins like cytochrome c oxidase for the mitochondria, caspase-8 for the cytosol, and the nuclear splicing factor CDC5L (51Boudrez A.

https://openalex.org/W2043890741,"The accepted paradigm for G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors involves GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation followed by the binding of arrestin proteins. Although GRKs contribute to metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) inactivation, β-arrestins do not appear to be required for mGluR1 G protein uncoupling. Therefore, we investigated whether the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues localized within the C terminus of mGluR1a is sufficient to allow GRK2-mediated attenuation of mGluR1a signaling. We find that the truncation of the mGluR1a C-terminal tail prevents mGluR1a phosphorylation and that GRK2 does not contribute to the phosphorylation of an mGluR1 splice variant (mGluR1b). However, mGluR1a-866Δ- and mGluR1b-stimulated inositol phosphate formation is attenuated following GRK2 expression. The expression of the GRK2 C-terminal domain to block membrane translocation of endogenous GRK2 increases mGluR1a-866Δ- and mGluR1b-stimulated inositol phosphate formation, presumably by blocking membrane translocation of GRK2. In contrast, expression of the kinase-deficient GRK2-K220R mutant inhibits inositol phosphate formation by these unphosphorylated receptors. Expression of the GRK2 N-terminal domain (residues 45–185) also attenuates both constitutive and agonist-stimulated mGluR1a, mGluR1a-866Δ, and mGluR1b signaling, and the GRK2 N terminus co-precipitates with mGluR1a. Taken together, our observations indicate that attenuation of mGluR1 signaling by GRK2 is phosphorylation-independent and that the interaction of the N-terminal domain of GRK2 with mGluR1 contributes to the regulation of mGluR1 G protein coupling.

The ionotropic receptors are subdivided into N-methyl-d-asparate, αamino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, and kainate type cation channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)1 are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and consist of eight distinct subtypes (1Nakanishi S.

The mGluR subtypes can be divided into three groups based on their sequence homology, pharmacology, and G protein coupling specificity. Group I receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are coupled via the heterotrimeric G protein Gq to the activation of phospholipase C, resulting in the formation of both inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, as well as increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (1Nakanishi S.

GPCR desensitization involves multiple mechanisms, the most rapid of which is thought to be receptor phosphorylation by second messenger-dependent protein kinases and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (8Ferguson S.S.G.

In particular, the expression of the C-terminal domain of GRK2 to inhibit GRK2 membrane translocation through its association with the βγ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein blocks GRK2-mediated mGluR1a phosphorylation and augmented mGluR1a signaling (12Dale L.B.

However, inconsistent with the idea that phosphorylation and β-arrestins contribute to mGluR1a desensitization, β-arrestin binding was not required for mGluR1a desensitization, and the expression of a kinase-deficient GRK2-K220R mutant attenuated mGluR1a signaling (12Dale L.B.

In the present study, we examined whether GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues localized within the extremely long C-terminal tail (C-tail) of mGluR1a contributed to mGluR1a G protein uncoupling by GRK2. In addition, we tested whether GRK2 plays a role in the attenuation of the activity of an mGluR1 alternative splice variant (mGluR1b) that lacks an extended C-tail. We found that GRK2 contributed to the desensitization of both mGluR1a and mGluR1b. However, GRK2-mediated phosphorylation was not required for effective inactivation of either mGluR1a or mGluR1b signaling, and the last 333 amino acids of the mGluR1a C-terminal tail were not required for the GRK2 binding. Furthermore, we found that expression of the N-terminal domain of GRK2, which exhibits homology to the regulator G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, associated with the receptor and was sufficient to reduce both constitutive and agonist-stimulated mGluR1a signaling. Taken together, our observations suggest that GRK2-mediated phosphorylation is not required for GRK2-dependent regulation of mGluR1a activity but rather involves the interaction of the GRK2 RGS homology domain with the receptor. HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. Inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, trypsin, and gentamicin were from Invitrogen. The rabbit polyclonal GRK2 antibody was raised against the peptide sequence DRLEARKKAKNKQLGH, which corresponds to rat GRK2 (12Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi M.

[32P]Orthophosphate was from ICN. Quisqualate was purchased from Tocris Cookson, Inc. The anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. [3H]myo-Inositol was acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) resin with 200–400 mesh was purchased from Bio-Rad. All other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, Fisher, and VWR Scientific. The C-tail truncation mutants of FLAG-mGluR1a were engineered using standard PCR techniques by introducing a stop codon following alanine residue 1149 (1149Δ), glycine residue 1049 (1049Δ), threonine residue 1000 (1000Δ), threonine residue 953 (953Δ), and proline residue 866 (866Δ). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged GRK2 (1–190) and GRK2 (45–185) were constructed by PCR amplification of bovine GRK2 cDNA and inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pcDNA3-HA (15Parent J.L. Labrecque P.

The sequence integrity of each of the mutants was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/μl gentamicin. The cells were transfected with plasmid cDNAs using a modified calcium phosphate method as described previously (12Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi M.

Following transfection (∼18 h), the cells were incubated with fresh medium, allowed to recover for 6–8 h, and then grown an additional 18 h prior to experimentation. HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with 5 μg of FLAG-mGluR1 constructs and 5 μg of either empty plasmid vector or plasmid vector containing GRK2 constructs were seeded into 24-well dishes. Inositol lipids were radiolabeled by incubating the cells overnight with 1 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Unincorporated [3H]myo-inositol was removed by washing the cells with HBSS (116 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4). The cells were preincubated for 1 h in HBSS 37 °C and then preincubated in 500 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mm LiCl for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated in either the absence or the presence of quisqualate for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped on ice by adding 500 μl of perchloric acid and then neutralized with 500 μl of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 mKHCO3. The total [3H]inositol incorporated into the cells was determined by counting the radioactivity present in 50 μl of the cell lysate. Total inositol phosphate was purified from the cell extracts by anion exchange chromatography using Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) anion exchange resin with 200–400 mesh. [3H]Inositol phosphate formation was determined by liquid scintillation using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation system. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of FLAG-mGluR1 constructs and 5 μg of either empty plasmid vector or plasmid vector containing GRK2 constructs. The cells from 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed in 400 μl of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The particulate fraction was removed by centrifugation, and 500 μg of supernatant protein was incubated in the presence of 5 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and 100 μl of 20% slurry protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed three times with lysis buffer and were solubilized in 3× SDS sample buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (12Dale L.B.

GRK2 was detected by immunoblotting with a rabbit GRK2 antibody diluted 1:1000, and HA-tagged GRK2 mutants were detected with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer (TBS-Tween: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% skim milk. The nitrocellulose membranes were rinsed three times with wash buffer and then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:2500 in wash buffer containing 3% skim milk. The nitrocellulose membranes were then rinsed twice with TBS-Tween, rinsed twice with Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents. Whole cell phosphorylation experiments were performed as described previously (16Ferguson, S. S. G., Ménard, L., Barak, L. S., Koch, W. J., Colapietro, A.-M., and Caron, M. G.

In brief, HEK 293 cells transfected with 5 μg of FLAG-tagged mGluR constructs either alone or together with 5 μg of GRK2 or empty pcDNA3 expression vector were reseeded in six-well dishes. The intracellular ATP pools were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free HEPES-buffered salt solution for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in either the absence or the presence of 10 μm quisqualate for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa2 pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.4). The FLAG-tagged mGluRs were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The extent of receptor phosphorylation was quantitated by densitometry of the resulting autoradiographs. Cells expressing FLAG-tagged mGluR1 were labeled on ice with an anti-FLAG antibody (1:500) for 45 min. The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently labeled with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to FITC (1:500) for 45 min on ice. The cells were harvested, and cell surface immunofluorescence was assessed by flow cytometry as described previously (17Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Previous studies investigating the role of GRKs in the regulation mGluR1a signaling indicated that GRK-mediated phosphorylation contributes to mGluR1a desensitization (12Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M.

There are 63 serine and threonine residues localized within the C-tail domain of mGluR1a that may serve as potential sites for GRK-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A) (12Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M.

To determine which regions of the mGluR1a C-tail might be phosphorylated by GRK2, we examined the phosphorylation of a series of mGluR1a C-tail truncation mutants and an mGluR1 splice variant, mGluR1b, for which 312 amino acid residues of the mGluR1a C-tail are replaced by 20 amino acid residues (Fig. 1 A). In HEK 293 cells, FLAG epitope-tagged mGluR1a C-tail deletion mutants lacking the final 50 (FLAG-mGluR1a-1149Δ), 150 (FLAG-mGluR1a-1049Δ), and 333 (FLAG-mGluR1a-866Δ) amino acids were expressed at the cell surface at levels that were comparable with wild-type FLAG-mGluR1a (Fig.1 B). In contrast, the cell surface expression of FLAG-mGluR1a-1000Δ and FLAG-mGluR1a-953Δ was severely impaired (Fig. 1 B), with the majority of immunostaining localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown). These results were consistent with the previous findings of Chan et al. (18Chan W.Y. Soloviev M.M. Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the deletion of amino acid residues 975–1098 in mGluR1a unmasked an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Consequently, our initial experiments focused on the phosphorylation of FLAG-mGluR1a, FLAG-mGluR1a-1149Δ, FLAG-mGluR1a-1049Δ, FLAG-mGluR1a-866Δ, and FLAG-mGluR1b. We found that the removal of the last 150 amino acids (including 29 serine and threonine residues) from the mGluR1a C-tail did not alter the pattern of constitutive and agonist-stimulated mGluR1a phosphorylation in either the absence or the presence of overexpressed GRK2 (Fig. 2). However, we found that in either the presence or the absence of overexpressed GRK2, FLAG-mGluR1b did not serve as a substrate for phosphorylation and that the removal of the last 333 amino acids from the C-terminal tail resulted in a complete loss of mGluR1a phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Because FLAG-mGluR1b and FLAG-mGluR1a-866Δ do not serve as substrates for phosphorylation in either the presence or the absence of GRK2, we tested whether GRK2 still contributes to the attenuation of mGluR1 activity. The activation of FLAG-mGluR1a, FLAG-mGluR1a-866Δ, and FLAG-mGluR1b with increasing concentrations of the Group I mGluR agonist quisqualate results in similar increases in inositol phosphate formation with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 57, 141, and 56 nm, respectively (Table I). Co-expression of GRK2 with wild-type FLAG-mGluR1a results in a 60% reduction in quisqualate-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3 A). Despite the fact that FLAG-mGluR1a-866Δ and FLAG-mGluR1b are not phosphorylated, GRK2 overexpression effectively reduces FLAG-mGluR1a-866Δ- and FLAG-mGluR1b-mediated inositol phosphate formation by 57 and 74%, respectively (Fig. 3, B andC). We demonstrated previously that GRK2 is co-precipitated by FLAG-mGluR1a (12Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi M. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38213-38220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that FLAG-mGluR1a-866Δ and FLAG-mGluR1b co-precipitate GRK2 as effectively as the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that phosphorylation is not an absolute prerequisite for the attenuation of mGluR1a signaling by GRK2 and that neither receptor phosphorylation by GRK2 nor an extended C-tail is required for GRK2 association with mGluR1 alternatively spliced isoforms.Table IHalf-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) and maximal velocity (V max ) values for mGluR1-stimulated inositol phosphate formationReceptorCo-transfection EC50 V max nm % mGluR1amGluR1aNT57100GRK28340 ± 7GRK2 (45–185)13842 ± 9GRK2 (1–190)32351 ± 7mGluR1a-866ΔNT14191 ± 10GRK227539 ± 10GRK2-K220R21339 ± 8GRK2-Ct199119 ± 8GRK2 (45–185)42644 ± 7GRK2 (1–190)40748 ± 7mGluR1bNT56115 ± 16GRK28930 ± 5GRK2-K220R19052 ± 11GRK2-Ct165140 ± 7GRK2 (45–185)38059 ± 3GRK2 (1–190)40745 ± 7The K d values represent the means of three or four independent experiments.

The overall topology of GRK family members is relatively conserved and can be subdivided into three functional domains: 1) a modestly conserved N-terminal domain that is proposed to mediate receptor interactions, 2) a central catalytic domain, and 3) a highly variable C-terminal domain that is required for membrane targeting of the kinases (19Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (Ct) of GRK2 encodes a pleckstrin homology domain that is essential for interactions with both phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and the βγ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein and is involved in the targeting of the kinase to the plasma membrane in response to receptor activation (Fig.5 A) (19Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ∼190 amino acid residues that comprise the GRK2 N-terminal domain exhibit sequence homology with the RGS box of RGS proteins (Fig.5 A) (20Siderovski D.P. Hessel A. Chung S. Mak T.W.

Consequently, we have examined the effect of co-expressing the GRK2-Ct, a catalytically inactive GRK2-K220R mutant, and GRK2 N-terminal domain constructs on FLAG-mGluR1a-866Δ and FLAG-mGluR1b signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that the co-expression of the GRK2-Ct potentiated mGluR1a signaling, whereas co-expression of a GRK2-K220R attenuates mGluR1a signaling (12Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M.

In the present study, we find that the expression of GRK2-K220R is as effective as wild-type GRK2 at attenuating inositol phosphate formation in response to agonist activation of either FLAG-mGluR1a-886Δ or FLAG-mGluR1b (Fig. 5,B and C). The maximal activation of inositol phosphate formation by either FLAG-mGluR1a-886Δ or FLAG-mGluR1b is reduced 57 and 55%, respectively, in the presence of GRK2-K220R. In contrast, the co-expression of the GRK2-Ct potentiates mGluR1a-886Δ- and FLAG-mGluR1b-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in response to increasing concentrations of quisqualate by 31 and 22%, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). The expression of two GRK2 N-terminal constructs, GRK2 (1–190) and GRK2 (45–185), encoding the GRK2 RGS domain also effectively attenuate FLAG-mGluR1a-, FLAG-mGluR1a-886Δ-, and FLAG-mGluR1b-stimulated inositol phosphate formation (Fig. 6, A–C). GRK2 (1–190) reduces FLAG-mGluR1a-, FLAG-mGluR1a-886Δ-, and FLAG-mGluR1b-stimulated inositol phosphate formation by 49, 47, and 61%, respectively, and GRK2 (45–185) reduces FLAG-mGluR1a-, FLAG-mGluR1a-886Δ-, and FLAG-mGluR1b-stimulated inositol phosphate formation by 58, 52, and 49%, respectively. Similar to what we have observed previously for wild-type GRK2 and GRK2-K220R (12Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi M. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, we find that both GRK2 (1–190) and GRK2 (45–185) can be co-immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells with FLAG-mGluR1a (Fig. 7). Taken together, these observations indicate that the association of GRK2 N terminus with mGluR1a and mGluR1b is sufficient to mediate the maximal attenuation of mGluR1 signaling.Figure 7Co-immunoprecipitation of GRK2 (45–185) and GRK2 (1–190) with mGluR1a from HEK 293 cell lysates.

For many GPCRs desensitization correlates GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation followed by the binding of arrestin proteins (8Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 9Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). However, this simple correlation does not necessarily hold for all GPCRs. For instance, unlike what is observed for many GPCRs, β-arrestins do not contribute to the attenuation of mGluR1 signaling (12Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi M. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38213-38220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have investigated whether GRK-mediated uncoupling of mGluR1a responses requires the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues localized within the extended mGluR1a C-tail domain. We find that GRK2 regulation of mGluR1 activity occurs via a phosphorylation-independent mechanism that does not require the C-tail domain of mGluR1a. Moreover, we find that effective attenuation of mGluR1a- and mGluR1b-stimulated phospholipase Cβ activity is mediated by the GRK2 N-terminal domain. The GRK2 N-terminal domain exhibits ∼20% identity to the RGS domain encoded by members of the family of RGS proteins, suggesting that the combined association of the GRK2 N terminus with mGluR1 and Gq may dampen mGluR1 signaling in the absence of phosphorylation (20Siderovski D.P.

These studies have reported a variety of effects of GRK overexpression on Gq-coupled GPCR signaling, many of which have been interpreted to involve GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation. In particular, the effectiveness of different GRK2 isoforms to mediate angiotensin II type 1A, endothelin A, and endothelin B receptor desensitization is correlated with increased agonist-stimulated receptor phosphorylation following the overexpression of different GRK subtypes (23Freedman N.J.

However, more recent studies indicate that, at least for some Gq-coupled GPCRs, GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation may not be absolutely required for GRK-dependent receptor desensitization. For example, wild-type GRK2 and GRK2-K220R are equally effective inhibitors of parathyroid receptor signaling (24Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and an angiotensin II type 1A receptor mutant that is not phosphorylated in response to agonist activation desensitizes normally (28Olivares-Reyes J.A. Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Shah B.H. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37761-37768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we find that phosphorylation of mGluR1a is not required for GRK2-dependent uncoupling of a C-tail truncated mGluR1a mutant. Furthermore, a naturally occurring mGluR1b splice variant does not serve as a substrate for phosphorylation, but this receptor variant is effectively uncoupled from phospholipase Cβ by the expression of GRK2. Taken together, these observations suggest that GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation and desensitization are dissociable, indicating that GRK2 kinase activity may be secondary to the role of GRK2 in attenuating GPCR signal transduction. In studies demonstrating the inhibitory effects of GRK2-K220R overexpression on GPCR desensitization, the dampening of GPCR signaling was interpreted to occur solely as the consequence of a direct interaction between the GPCR and the catalytically inactive GRK2 (23Freedman N.J.

Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.F. Benovic J.F. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

This inhibition of Gq-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ involved the association of the N-terminal domains of GRK2 and GRK3 with Gαq (21Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N.

The N-terminal domains of GRK2 and GRK3 exhibit 20 and 30% homology, respectively, with the RGS box found in RGS proteins but lack conservation of key residues required for RGS/G protein interactions and GTPase activating protein activity (21Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.F. Benovic J.F. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Despite this fact, similar to what has been reported for p115 Rho-GEF, GRK2 and GRK3 may function as atypical RGS proteins (30Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that in addition to functioning as a GAPase activating protein for Gαq/11 family G proteins, the N-terminal domain, specifically amino acid residues 45–185, targets GRK2 to bind mGluR1 family receptors. Consequently, it appears that a series of protein-protein interactions must occur either simultaneously or in series for GRK2 to effectively antagonize mGluR1 signaling. Not only is the GRK2 C-terminal domain essential for the membrane targeting of the kinase, but the kinase is localized to its target via the association of the N-terminal domain with both the receptor and the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. It is likely that this coordinated series of events leading to the inactivation of mGluR1 signaling is also required for the desensitization of other GPCRs. The expression of the GRK2 N terminus mediates the partial desensitization of endothelin receptors but was not as effective as the wild-type kinase in promoting the desensitization of these receptors (23Freedman N.J.

However, the corresponding amino acid residues in GRK2 do not appear to be required for GRK2 interactions with mGluR1a. Nevertheless, the ability of the GRK2 N-terminal domain to both associate with a GPCR and regulate the activity of Gαq/11 family G proteins may be akin to the ability of the N-terminal 33 amino acid residues of RGS4 to provide anchorage and receptor selectivity to RGS4 (32Chen C.

In summary, despite the fact that mGluR1 bears no sequence homology to with either the rhodopsin/β2-adrenergic or the secretin/glucagon classes of GPCRs, GRK-dependent desensitization remains a conserved regulatory mechanism for this unique class of GPCRs. We find that although GRK2 plays a central role in regulating the activity of mGluR1, this regulation is independent of its function as a receptor kinase. Instead GRK-mediated mGluR1 desensitization departs from the conventional model of GRK-mediated phosphorylation followed by β-arrestin binding and involves the binding of the GRK2 N-terminal domain to the receptor and Gαq subunit. Based on the observation that the N-terminal domain of GRK2 is sufficient to mediate mGluR1a and mGluR1b desensitization, we propose that the targeted association of the GRK2 RGS domain with the complex formed between mGluR1 family members and Gαq proteins allows GRK2 to effective regulate receptor/G protein activity in the absence of phosphorylation. It is possible that the interactions between GRK2 and the receptor, Gαq and Gβγ occur either simultaneously or independently. Further investigation will be required to dissociate these possibilities."

We report that IFN-induced IRF1 inhibits NF-κB-dependent activation of MMP-9 by binding to the promoter region overlapping the NF-κB-binding site. Recombinant human (rHu)-IFN-α 2a (specific activity 2 × 108 units/mg) was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland); rHu-IFN-β 1a (specific activity 4 × 108 units/mg) was from Area-Serono International (Geneva, Switzerland); rHu-IFN-γ (specific activity 2 × 107 units/mg) was from Roussel Uclaf (Romainville, France). IFN biologic activity was assessed by antiviral protection against vesicular stomatitis virus on human Wish cells (ATCC, CCL-25). Monoclonal antibodies against pS727-STAT1 and pY701-STAT1 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against human STAT1 (p91), IRF1, and NF-κB family members were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, France). Purified Sp-1 protein was from Promega (France). Renaissance Enhanced Luminol Reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. M-PERTM mammalian protein extraction reagent and NE-PERTM nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents were from Pierce. Human Ewing's sarcoma EW-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Myoclone Plus, Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml gentamycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator (5% CO2). EW-7/TA and EW-7/TA/IRF1 cell lines (35Sancéau J. Hiscott J. Delattre O. Wietzerbin J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3372-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were grown as parental EW-7 cells except for addition of puromycin (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma) and G418 (500 μg/ml, Invitrogen). IRF1 protein was induced by doxycycline (2 μg/ml, Sigma) which was added 24 h before cell harvesting. Human fibrosarcoma U3A and 2Ftgh cell lines (36McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Luciferase constructs containing elements of the MMP-9 promoter (−634 bp to +30 bp, −603 to +30, −531 to +30, −144 to +30, and −73 to +30) have been described by Gum et al. (14Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Plasmids DNA cloned in DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen) were prepared with the Quantum Preparation Kit (Bio-Rad). 20 × 106 cells were mixed gently with 10 μg of dried supercoiled MMP-9promoter plasmid and were electroporated as described previously (37Sancéau J. Kaisho T. Hirano T. Wietzerbin J. J..Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27920-27931Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated 16 h after electroporation with IFNs (1000 units/ml) or with TNF-α (10 units/ml), alone or in combination, in fresh medium containing 10% FCS. After 24 h of stimulation, cells were analyzed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) or for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity as described previously (37Sancéau J. Kaisho T. Hirano T. Wietzerbin J. J..Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27920-27931Scopus (198) Google Scholar). EW-7 cells (20 × 106 in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were mixed with 15 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA, p65/pc-DNA-3, or IRF1/pc-DNA-3 and were electroporated as described previously (37Sancéau J. Kaisho T. Hirano T. Wietzerbin J. J..Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27920-27931Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Basic pc-DNA3 was used as control. After 6 h, the medium was changed, and cells were distributed in a 12-well tissue culture plate, and the culture was continued for 36 h. Then supercoiledMMP-9 promoter DNA (−634) was transfected using LipofectAMINETM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (1 μg of DNA/1 × 105 cells/well). After 6 h, cells were stimulated in the same medium for 24 h with IFN-γ (1000 units/ml) or with TNF-α (10 units/ml) or both stimuli. Cells were further analyzed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). For production of recombinant proteins (IRF1, p50, and p65), IRF1/pc-DNA-3, p50/pc-DNA-3, and p65/pc-DNA-3 (1 μg each plasmid-DNA) were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase and translated by nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the manufacturer's recommendations (TNTR-T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega). Basic pc-DNA3 was used as control translation product. For construction of human IRF1 expression vector, the full-length IRF1 cDNA derived from pCMV-IRF1 vector provided by Dr. J. Hiscott was subcloned into pc-DNA3 vector (Invitrogen). P50/pc-DNA3 and p65/pc-DNA3 were from Dr. F. Arenzana. Nuclear extracts (from 40 × 106cells) were prepared, and EMSA experiments were performed as described by Sancéau et al. (37Sancéau J. Kaisho T. Hirano T. Wietzerbin J. J..Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27920-27931Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (10 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with radiolabeled probe (30,000 cpm). After resolution of the nucleoprotein complexes by a non-denaturing electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences). For competition experiments, appropriate antibodies (1 μg) were mixed directly with nuclear extracts and binding buffer for 30 min at 4 °C before adding the radiolabeled probe. For direct DNA occupancy, recombinant proteins (IRF1, p50, and p65 proteins, or recombinant Sp-1 protein, increasing volumes 0.5–2 μl) were mixed with the radiolabeled probe (30,000 cpm) in EMSA buffer conditions. After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, the reactions were resolved by non-denaturing electrophoresis, like the usual EMSA. A 44-bp DNA fragment that spans the −619 to −575 region of the human MMP-9 promoter and encompasses the NF-κB-binding site was generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides (Genset, Paris, France), 5′-AGA CAG GGG TTG CCC CAGTGGAATTCCCCA GCC TTG CCT-3′ and 3′-GTC CCC AAC GGG GTC ACC TTA AGG GGT CGG AAC GGA TCG-5′ (the NF-κB-binding site of MMP-9 is underlined). The synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-CTA GAC AGA GGG GAT TTC CGA GAG GTT-3′ covering the consensus NF-κB-binding site from the human immunoglobulin κ light chain enhancer or the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-CCT TGG GTT TTC CCA TGA GTT C-3′ covering the NF-κB-binding site of the IL-6promoter as described previously (37Sancéau J. Kaisho T. Hirano T. Wietzerbin J. J..Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27920-27931Scopus (198) Google Scholar) were used. The32P-labeling probes were generated by the Klenow fill-in reaction (Stratagene) of the annealing fragment. Following cell (10 × 106 cells/ml) stimulation with IFNs (1000 units/ml) or with TNF-α (10 units/ml), alone or in association, for the indicated times, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclear or cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (37Sancéau J. Kaisho T. Hirano T. Wietzerbin J. J..Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27920-27931Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 20 mm anti-phosphatase mixture (sodium orthovanadate, NaF, β-glycerophosphate), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors (pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin) were added to each buffer used. Protein content in the supernatants was determined using Bradford's method. Equivalent amounts of protein (60 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were hybridized and processed as described previously (35Sancéau J. Hiscott J. Delattre O. Wietzerbin J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3372-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using enhanced chemiluminescence protein detection (Renaissance Enhanced Luminol Reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by autoradiography on Hyperfilms (AmershamBiosciences). RNA extraction (by SV Total RNA Isolation System, Promega) from Ewing cells and subsequent cDNA synthesis were conducted as described previously (35Sancéau J. Hiscott J. Delattre O. Wietzerbin J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3372-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MMP-9 cDNA (296 bp) was amplified using the sense primer 5′-GGA GAC CTG AGA ACC AAT CTC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TCC AAT AGG TGA TGT TGT CGT-3′ according to published sequences (38Trocmé C. Gaudin P. Berthier S. Barro C. Zaoui P. Morel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20677-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To normalize the PCR products, the β2-microglobulin gene was amplified as described by Bauvois et al. (6Bauvois B. Dumont J. Mathiot C. Kolb J.P. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 144-151PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The NIH Image 1.44 b11 software was used for the analysis. The conditioned media from Ewing cells were harvested under sterile conditions and frozen before MMP-9 or IL-6 contents were determined using a commercial ELISA kits from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Controls included FCS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium alone incubated under the same conditions. Analysis of MMP-9 activity was carried out in 7.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE containing 0.1% gelatin (w/v) as described elsewhere (39Chintala S.K. Sawaya R. Aggarwal B.B. Majumder S. Giri D.K. Kyritsis A.P. Gokaslan Z.L. Rao J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13545-13551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of culture media (10–20 μl) were applied to the gel in Laemmli sample buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol. The recombinant pro-MMP-9 with a molecular mass of 92 kDa (R & D Systems) was used as positive control. Samples were preincubated for 60 min with 0.5 mmaminophenylmercuric acid (APMA, Sigma) which activates the pro-form to the activated form. Gelatinolytic activities of both pro-MMP-9 and active MMP-9 were detected as transparent bands on the background of Coomassie Blue-stained gelatin. The NIH Image 1.44 β11 software was used for the analysis of the bands, after acquisition in an Appligene densitometer (Oncor). As assessed by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), day 1-cultured EW-7 cells in the absence or presence of IFNs spontaneously released no detectable amounts of MMP-9 into the culture conditioned medium (Fig. 1 A). TNF-α up-regulates the expression of MMP-9 in various cell types (4Nelson A.R. Fingleton B. Rothenberg M.L. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 1135-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Opdenakker G. Van den Steen P.E. Dubois B. Nelissen I. Van Coillie E. Masure S. Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 851-859PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bond M. Rosalind P. Fabunmi P. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment of EW-7 cells with TNF-α (10 units/ml) resulted in marked stimulation of MMP-9 protein levels (Fig.1 A). MMP-9 stimulation in response to TNF-α was dose-dependent, with maximal effects being obtained for doses of 1000 units/ml. Although without any effect on unstimulated EW-7 cells, IFN-β and IFN-γ reduced production of MMP-9 of TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). Under our conditions, TNF-α/IFN combination (TNF 10 units/ml, IFN 1000 units/ml) did not induce any death signaling in EW-7 cells. Zymography analysis showed the presence of a gelatinase activity at 92 kDa in the conditioned media of TNF-α-stimulated cells, consistent with the pattern of recombinant pro-MMP-9 (Fig. 1 B, top panel). Preincubation of TNF-α-stimulated cell supernatant with APMA resulted in conversion of pro-MMP-9 to an active form of 82 kDa (Fig.1 B, top panel). Gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 was decreased in the conditioned media of TNF-α-stimulated cells treated with IFN-β or IFN-γ for 24 h (Fig. 1 B,top panel), and such inhibition of MMP-9 production in response to IFN was dose- and time-dependent; maximal inhibitory effects were obtained for doses of 5000 units/ml IFN (Fig.1 B, middle panel), and TNF-α-mediated accumulation of MMP-9 in the culture medium was blocked 12 h after addition of IFN (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). Moreover, the protein levels were related to the levels of expression of MMP-9 transcript (296 bp) detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1 C) suggesting that inhibition of MMP-9 production by IFNs reflected decreased MMP-9 mRNA amounts in TNF-α-activated cells. To define the promoter region of MMP-9 necessary for both transcriptional MMP-9 activation by TNF-α and subsequent inhibition by IFNs in EW-7 cells, functional analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the human MMP-9 gene was carried out using the −670 to +30 fragment (700 bp) as well as a series of 5′-deletions of the MMP-9 promoter, linked to a luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig.2 A). We transiently transfected EW-7 cells with these plasmids. As shown in Fig.2 B, the −670 construct of the MMP-9 5′-flanking region yielded a 9-fold increase in luciferase activity in response to TNF-α treatment. No significant response to IFNs alone was observed (Fig.2 B). Combined treatment with TNF-α and IFN resulted in significant reduction of luciferase activity (30% inhibition with IFN-α, 45% inhibition with IFN-β, and up to 70% inhibition with IFN-γ). Similar results were observed after transfection of the −634 and −603 fragments (Fig. 2 B). However, cells transfected with shorter fragments expressed a low basal luciferase activity that was not enhanced by TNF-α (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, this promoter fragment between −603 and −531 regions contained one non-consensus NF-κB-binding site (between −600 and −590) and an Sp-1-binding site (between −562 and −555) (13Bond M. Rosalind P. Fabunmi P. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 14Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Equally important, this region also contains eight nucleotides matching an IFN enhancer core sequence (5′-GGAATTCC-3′) previously identified in IFN-response genes (40Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y.

Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Thus, it is possible that this putative IFN-responsive element (IRE), which overlaps with the NF-κB-binding site (Fig. 2 A), participates in the negative regulation of MMP-9 gene transcription. The transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1 are intracellular signal-transducing molecules in IFN signaling (28Darnell J.E.

Assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex is believed to be a highly regulated process, and molecular mechanisms responsible for this regulation have yet to be fully elucidated. We have previously reported that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) expression and activity are essential for superoxide anion production in activated human monocytes. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in cPLA2 regulation of NADPH oxidase activation by evaluating the effects of cPLA2 on translocation and phosphorylation of p67 phox and p47 phox . We report that translocation and phosphorylation of p67 phox , as well as p47 phox , occur upon activation of human monocytes and that decreased cPLA2 protein expression, mediated by antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (AS-ODN) specific for cPLA2mRNA, blocked the stimulation-induced translocation of p47 phox and p67 phox from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. Inhibition of translocation of both p47 phox and p67 phox by cPLA2 AS-ODN was above 85%. Arachidonic acid (AA), a product of cPLA2 enzymatic activity, completely restored translocation of both of these oxidase components in the AS-ODN-treated, cPLA2-deficient human monocytes. These results represent the first report that cPLA2activity or AA is required for p67 phox and p47 phox translocation in human monocytes. Although cPLA2 was required for translocation of p47 phox and p67 phox , it did not influence phosphorylation of these components. These results suggest that one mechanism of cPLA2 regulation of NADPH oxidase activity is to control the arachidonate-sensitive assembly of the complete oxidase complex through modulating the translocation of both p47 phox and p67 phox .

Neutrophils and monocytes are among the most prominent of the phagocytic cells. Monocytes mediate several aspects of inflammation and host defense. One pathogenic process in which monocytes are believed to participate is the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL).1 Our laboratory was the first to report that purified human monocytes could oxidize LDL (1Cathcart M.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We found that superoxide anion is a key component involved in the oxidation of LDL by activated human monocytes and that the superoxide anion, responsible for this oxidation of LDL, is produced by the monocyte NADPH oxidase (2Cathcart M.K. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1963-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bey E.A. Cathcart M.K. J.

Thus the regulation of the monocyte NADPH oxidase is also central to the control of this potentially pathogenic process. The activated NADPH oxidase is a membrane-bound enzyme complex. Its composition has been defined in recent years through studies with intact or lysate fractions of neutrophils, and knowledge of its function has mostly been derived from patients with a lack of NADPH oxidase activity, a clinical disorder called chronic granulomatous disease (6Volpp B.D.

In resting neutrophils, NADPH oxidase is dormant, and its protein components are segregated into cytosolic components, including p47 phox , p67 phox , p40 phox , and a small GTP-binding protein, Rac, and a transmembrane-heterodimeric protein known as flavocytochromeb 558, which consists of gp91 phox , a glycoprotein, and p22 phox . Upon stimulation, the cytosolic protein components of neutrophil NADPH oxidase translocate to the plasma membrane or phagosomal membrane (8Dusi S. Rossi F. Biochem.

Also in response to activation, the cytosolic components of neutrophil NADPH oxidase become phosphorylated, including p67 phox (17Dusi S. Della Bianca V. Grzeskowiak M. Rossi F. Biochem.

The majority of what is understood about the complex formation and activity of NADPH oxidase has been derived from studies in neutrophils, and much less is known about the regulation of this complex in monocytes. In recent years, arachidonic acid (AA) has been implicated as a secondary messenger modulating many stimulation-induced cell responses such as early gene expression (21Danesch U. Weber P.C. Sellmayer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27258-27263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ion channel activity (22Kapus A. Romanek R. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4736-4745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apoptosis (23Chan T.A. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 24Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of G proteins (25Han J.W. McCormick F. Macara I.G. Science. 1991; 252: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). AA has also been shown to be a physiological amphiphilic co-factor in the in vitro activation of NADPH oxidase. For example, NADPH oxidase could only be activated in a cell-free system reconstituted with neutrophil cytochrome b 558, p47 phox , p67 phox , and the GTP-bound Rac in the presence of an anionic amphiphile such as AA or SDS (26Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A maximal response occurred with the concentration of AA within 50–100 μm. A few lines of evidence also suggest that AA regulates the production of superoxide anion in intact cells as well. For example, when the human myeloid cell line PLB-985 is rendered deficient in cPLA2 and then differentiated, exogenous AA activates the NADPH oxidase (28Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). AA has also been shown to increase the activation of NADPH oxidase in monocytic U937 cells by accelerating translocation of p47 phox (29Sellmayer A. Obermeier H. Danesch U. Aepfelbacher M. Weber P.C. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that AA release may be a modulating event for the activation of NADPH oxidase in stimulated phagocytes. In both in vivo and in vitroactivation, however, the relatively high concentration of AA (30–100 μm) has raised questions regarding its physiological relevance (30Ely E.W. Seeds M.C. Chilton F.H. Bass D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A number of studies have suggested that AA production in stimulated neutrophils or monocytes is mediated by cPLA2, a member of the intracellular phospholipase A2 family. There are at least three isoforms of PLA2 in phagocytic cells, a 14-kDa secretory form, a 85-kDa calcium-independent PLA2, and a 85-kDa isoform of cytosolic PLA2 referred to as cPLA2 that migrates as a 110-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE. cPLA2 has a high specificity for membrane phospholipids that contain sn-2-arachidonate and is believed to be an important regulator of AA availability, thereby controlling the production of potent lipid mediators. For example, a decrease in cPLA2 in monocytes treated with AS-ODN for cPLA2 resulted in significant inhibition of [3H]AA production induced by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (31Locati M. Lamorte G. Luini W. Introna M. Bernasconi S. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In human neutrophils, experiments using PLA2 inhibitors demonstrated that generation of AA is important for activation of NADPH oxidase (32Dana R. Malech H.L. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 33Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An increase in phospholipase A2 activity and a release of AA have also been reported to occur in association with stimuli that activate the NADPH oxidase (34Nakashima S. Suganuma A. Sato M. Tohmatsu T. Nozawa Y. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1295-1302PubMed Google Scholar). In a permeabilized neutrophil model (35Bauldry S.A. Wooten R.E. Bass D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), cPLA2 was also believed to be the enzyme controlling the production of AA. Therefore, cPLA2 appears to be critical for controlling AA production in phagocytes. Our laboratory demonstrated that the expression and activity of cPLA2 are essential for superoxide anion production and related LDL oxidation in activated human monocytes. ZOP-stimulated superoxide anion production by human monocytes was inhibited by pretreatment of the monocytes with AS-ODN specific for cPLA2, and this inhibition was negated by the addition of exogenous AA at a concentration of 3 μm (36Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2404-2411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although substantial evidence suggests that cPLA2-derived AA plays an essential role in NADPH oxidase activation and superoxide anion production, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this activation of NADPH oxidase still need to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated how cPLA2 and cPLA2-derived AA regulate NADPH oxidase activity by focusing our attention on the translocation and phosphorylation of p67 phox and p47 phox . Our results suggest a role for cPLA2 in the translocation but not the phosphorylation of p67 phox and p47 phox in activated human monocytes. Arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, phosphatase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies specific for β-tubulin were purchased from Sigma. Sodium okadate was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Zymosan, which was obtained from ICN Biochemicals (Cleveland, OH), was opsonized (37Johnston R.B. Adams D.O. Edelson P.J. Koren H. Methods for Studying Mononuclear Phagocytes. Academic Press, New York1981: 489-497Crossref Google Scholar) and used at a concentration of 2 mg/ml to activate human monocytes. SDS-PAGE reagents and PVDF membranes were from Bio-Rad. [32P]Orthophosphate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p67 phox and p47 phox were described previously (38Forbes L.V. Moss S.J. Segal A.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for p47 phox , horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG were from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Goat polyclonal antibodies for p67 phox , p47 phox , rabbit polyclonal antibodies for Tyk2, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated preadsorbed anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against cPLA2 were provided by the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Human monocytes were isolated and purified as described previously (3Bey E.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, heparinized whole blood was centrifuged over a Ficoll-Paque density solution, the platelets were removed by several washes through serum, and the mononuclear cells were incubated in serum-coated cell culture flasks for 2–4 h. After washing away nonadherent cells, the adherent cells were released with 5 mm EDTA and plated into 6-well dishes. The isolated human monocytes rested for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine serum at 37 °C in 10% CO2 before use in experiments. The sequences of AS-ODN and S-ODN specific for cPLA2 and p47 phox were identical to those described in our previous reports (3Bey E.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2404-2411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Human monocytes (5 × 106cells/group) were cultured for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum. The cells were then treated with AS-ODN or S-ODN as indicated. The cells were next washed, and the medium was changed to RPMI 1640 (Whittaker, Walkersville, MD) in the presence or absence of ZOP (2 mg/ml) for 1 h, followed by preparation of post-nuclear extracts or fractionation into cytosol and membrane fractions. Fractionation of human monocytes was performed according to the method described by Clark et al. (39Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were collected and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline after treatment with ODN or under the indicated conditions. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 0.6 ml of relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, 10 mm1,4-piperazine diethane sulfonic acid, pH 7.3, supplemented with 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). The cells were then disrupted by two 15-s cycles of sonication at 4 °C using a microprobe sonicator. Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant represented the soluble, cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of relaxation buffer with vigorous mixing and again centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The final pellet, representing the particulate/membrane fraction, was resuspended in 0.2 ml of relaxation buffer. Hereafter it is referred to as the membrane fraction. For preparation of post-nuclear extracts, the cells were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline after treatment. The cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:100 diluted protease inhibitor mixture). After 30 min on ice, the extract was centrifuged at 9300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as the post-nuclear extract. The samples were incubated with the relevant antibody for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation, then mixed with protein G-agarose beads (20 μl of packed volume), and further rotated at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were collected and washed three times with lysis buffer followed by release in SDS sample buffer. For Western blotting analysis, the proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking overnight with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were probed with primary antibodies and corresponding secondary antibodies as indicated and finally developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). After a 24-h treatment with ODN, each indicated fatty acid was added to the cell culture and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C with 10% CO2before the stimulation of cells with ZOP. The final concentration of each fatty acid added to the cells was 3.3 μm. Human monocytes (5 × 106/2 ml/well) were radiolabeled with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 12 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then left activated or activated with 2 mg/ml ZOP for 5, 15, 30, or 60 min. The cells were collected, washed three times by centrifugation at 200 × g in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. The cells were then lysed as described above, and the post-nuclear extracts were incubated with goat polyclonal p67 phox or p47 phox antibodies. Immune complexes were collected using Sepharose G or A beads. The immune complexes were run in 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE gels and electrophorectically transferred to PVDF membranes. The phosphorylation of p67 phox and p47 phox was visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantified by ImageQuant analysis. The PVDF membranes were processed as described above using the monoclonal antibodies to p67 phox or p47 phox . Human monocytes were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum in the presence or absence of cPLA2-specific AS-ODN or S-ODN (10 μm) for 24 h. The cells were washed with RPMI 1640 without sodium phosphate (Invitrogen) and recultured in the same phosphate-free medium with or without cPLA2 specific AS-ODN or S-ODN (10 μm); meanwhile, the cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h followed by activation with ZOP for 1 h. The cells were collected, and the post-nuclear extracts were dissolved in the above mentioned lysis buffer containing 20 nm sodium okadate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of additional phosphatase inhibitors (30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm phosphoserine, 0.5 mm phosphotyrosine, 1.0 mmphosphothreonine, 1.5 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate). Post-nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies for p67 phox or p47 phox . The final immunocomplexes were run on 8% SDS-PAGE, separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, and phosphorylated p67 phox or p47 phox was detected using PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The membranes were further probed with specific antibodies for p67 phox or p47 phox and developed by the methods described above. It has been reported that translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox of neutrophils occurs as early as 1 min after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation (17Dusi S. Della Bianca V. Grzeskowiak M. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 39Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, a time course of translocation has yet to be established for these components upon activation of the NADPH oxidase in human monocytes. In this study, we first investigated the time course of p67 phox and p47 phox translocation in ZOP-activated human monocytes. Fig.1 shows a time-dependent manner of ZOP-induced translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox in human monocytes. Detectable membrane-associated p67 phox and p47 phox was seen as early as 5 min after stimulation of monocytes with ZOP. The translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox increased significantly at the 1-h time point (Fig.1). This is the first report that translocation of p67 phox in human monocytes occurs upon activation. We previously reported that ZOP-induced maximal production of superoxide anion in human monocytes at 1 h (2Cathcart M.K. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1963-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the 1-h time point for further translocation studies. Translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox is believed to be an essential event in NADPH oxidase activation, leading to superoxide anion production. Because AA has been suggested to be involved in NADPH oxidase activation, we asked whether AA or cPLA2 played a role in the translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox . We treated monocytes with a cPLA2-specific AS-ODN and analyzed the membrane-associated p67 phox and p47 phox in cPLA2-deficient, ZOP-exposed cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, the cPLA2-specific AS-ODN significantly decreased the expression of cPLA2 protein, confirming our previous data (36Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2404-2411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Carnevale K.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3414-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas the S-ODN of cPLA2 had no detectable effect. Furthermore, treatment with cPLA2 AS-ODN had no effect on the expression of calcium-independent PLA2 (40Carnevale K.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3414-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or other control proteins such as Tyk2 and p47 phox (Fig.2 A) or p67 phox (data not shown), suggesting the specificity of cPLA2 AS-ODN. Interestingly, monocytes treated with the cPLA2-specific AS-ODN showed a dramatic decrease in ZOP-induced translocation of both p67 phox and p47 phox (Fig. 2 B). The inhibition of translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox by cPLA2 AS-ODN was above 85% (Fig. 2 C). Meanwhile, cPLA2 S-ODN had no inhibitory effect on translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox . We previously reported that treatment of human monocytes with such cPLA2-specific AS-ODN could substantially decrease ZOP-triggered superoxide anion production (36Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2404-2411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that cPLA2 may regulate the superoxide anion production of monocytes by modulating the translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox from cytosol to membrane compartments, an essential step for formation of active complex of NADPH oxidase. Our previous studies demonstrated that production of superoxide anion in cPLA2-deficient monocytes could be restored by exogenous AA (36Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2404-2411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In those studies several doses of AA were employed, and 3.3 μm AA completely restored superoxide anion production in primary human monocytes in which cPLA2 expression was inhibited by treatment with AS-ODN. We therefore studied whether the addition of AA at this concentration to cPLA2-deficient monocytes could restore translocation of both p67 phox and p47 phox induced by ZOP. The results shown in Fig.3 A indicate that the translocation-inhibiting effect of AS-ODN treatment could be completely negated by exogenous AA (3.3 μm). These data strongly suggest that cPLA2 regulates translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox via AA. Furthermore, the data presented here suggest that cPLA2, via the production of AA, regulates the superoxide anion production in monocytes through modulation of the assembly of active complex of NADPH oxidase. To address the question of whether other fatty acids could also restore the translocation of p67 phox and p47 phox in cPLA2-deficient monocytes, we next examined the effect of linoleic acid and palmitic acid. Monocytes were treated with AS-ODN specific for cPLA2 for 24 h and then exposed to ZOP in the presence of the same dose of linoleic acid, palmitic acid, or AA (3.3 μm) in each cell culture. The membrane-associated p67 phox and p47 phox of each sample was examined by immunoblots. As shown in Fig. 3 B, linoleic acid at 3.3 μm displayed effects on restoration of both p67 phox and p47 phox translocation similar to those of AA. However, palmitic acid at 3.3 μm did not restore the translocation. We observed that the addition of fatty acids with ZOP caused no greater translocation than that mediated by ZOP stimulation alone. Fatty acid addition alone was less effective in promoting translocation of p47 phox and p67 phox than ZOP (Fig.3 C). During the above studies, we found that p67 phox and p47 phox displayed very similar patterns of translocation and inhibition of translocation by cPLA2-specific AS-ODN in ZOP-stimulated human monocytes. Therefore, we investigated the possible association of p67 phox and p47 phox in human monocytes and their association during translocation. As shown in Fig.4 A, immunoprecipitation of cell lysates of untreated or ZOP-induced monocytes with p47 phox specific antibody pulled down both p47 phox and p67 phox . Also, immunoprecipitates of p67 phox -specific antibodies contained both p67 phox and"

Trx-G genes encode proteins that modulate transcriptional programs through protein-protein interactions that are mediated by PHD and SET domains, and by binding to DNA via A-T hooks and methyltransferase homology motifs. MLL5 is a homolog of the Drosophila gene CG9007; it encodes a 6.5 kb mRNA that is expressed widely. MLL5 includes a SET domain and a single PHD finger, but lacks A-T hooks and methyltransferase homology domains that are found in MLL. The leukemia cell line RCV-ACV-A carries a heterozygous missense mutation within the PHD domain; however, no mutations within the MLL5 coding region were detected in primary leukemias.

Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and facilitation of septal peptidoglycan synthesis by recruitment of FtsI (PBP3) to the division site (19Mercer K.L.N. Weiss D.S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The first topological model of FtsW based on computational methods and experimental data has recently been proposed for the FtsW of Streptococcus pneumoniae (20Gerard P. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1925-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It features 10 membrane-spanning segments, a large extracytoplasmic loop, and both N and C termini located in the cytoplasm. In E. coli, ZipA and FtsA interact with the C terminus of FtsZ. ZipA probably serves as the membrane anchor for FtsZ, and the interaction probably provides the driving force for cross-linking and clustering of FtsZ protofilaments (21Erickson H.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, ZipA is found in only a small group of bacteria related to E. coli. FtsA is similar to actin (22van den Ent F. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5300-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It may function by linking septum formation to peptidoglycan biosynthesis (23Ma X. Ehrhardt D.W. Margolin W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 12998-13003Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 24Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Ghigo J.M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 508-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A search for new binding partners for the C terminus of FtsZ may provide insights into the mechanism of cell division in bacteria lacking ZipA and FtsA, which include the globally important pathogen, M. tuberculosis. The C termini of M. tuberculosis FtsZ and FtsW carry a string of amino acid residues that are absent in theirE. coli counterparts. Clusters of oppositely charged residues at the C-terminal ends of FtsZ and FtsW raise the possibility that the cytoplasmic C-tail1of FtsW could possibly act as a membrane anchor for FtsZ. We have asked whether the C terminus of M. tuberculosis FtsZ interacts with the C terminus of M. tuberculosis FtsW. This report provides evidence that FtsZ and FtsW of M. tuberculosis are binding partners and that binding involves a cluster of aspartate residues in the C-tail of FtsZ. This is the first demonstration of the direct interaction between FtsZ and FtsW in any bacterium. Standard procedures for cloning and analysis of DNA, PCR, electroporation, and transformation were used (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Enzymes used to manipulate DNA were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DNA sequencing was performed using the Thermosequenase or the T7 Sequenase sequencing kits from AmershamBiosciences. All constructs made by PCR were sequenced to verify their integrity. The cosmid MTCY270 was a generous gift from Stewart Cole, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. Kanamycin was used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml, and ampicillin was used at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. The ftsZ gene was amplified from cosmid MTCY270 using the primer pair, 5′-TATGGATCCATATGACCCCCCCGCACAACTA-3′ (FtsZ sense) and 5′-TTTGTCAATTGCTCTCAGCGGCGCATGAAG-3′ (FtsZ antisense), with asymmetric NdeI and MunI sites (in bold) and cloned between the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the vector pET28a (Novagen) to generate pJB101. Mutants of FtsZ were generated by overlap extension PCR. The primers used are depicted in Table I. The initial rounds of PCR were carried out using the primer pairsa and b, and c and dand pJB101 as template. The products of each PCR were purified and used as templates for the second round of PCR using the primers aand d. The final products were cloned between thePstI and ClaI sites of pJB101 to generate the mutants of ftsz in pET28a. FtsW was amplified from cosmid MTCY270 using the primer pair 5′-ATCGGATCCATATGCTAACCCGGTTGCTGC-3′ (FtsW-s) and 5′-CCCGAATTCACCCGTAACGCTGACCTTC-3′(FtsW-as) with asymmetric NdeI and EcoRI sites (in bold) and cloned between the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the vector pET28a to give pJB201.Table IPrimers for amplification of derivatives of FtsZPrimers for FtsZ derivativesMutationPrimer bPrimer c5′-AGGGCGGCACGTCGCAGCGTCGTCAT CAC-3′5′-CGGCGGTGATGACGACGCTGTCGACGTGCCGCCCT-3′D367A5′-GCGGCACGTCGACGACAGCGGCGTCATCACCGCTG-3′5′-CATCGGCGGTGATGACGCCGGTGTCGACGTGCCGC-3′D367A, D368A5′-CGTCGACAGCGGCGGCAGCACCGCCGATGCTCAGG-3′5′-GAGCATCGGCGGTGATGCCGCCGCTGTCGACGTGC-3′D367A, D368A, D369A5′-CGTCGACAGCGGCGGCAGCACCGCCGATGCTCAGG-3′5′-CCTGAGCATCGGCGGTGCTGCCCCCGCTGTCG-3′D367A, D368A, D369A, D370A5′-CCTGAGCATCGGCGGTGTCGACGTGCCGCCCT-3′5′-AGGGCGGCACGTCGACACCGCCGATGCTCAGG-3′Δ(D367 to D370)Primer a5′-GTTGCTGCAGATGGGAGATGCCGCG-3′ (PstI site in bold)Primer d5′-CTATCGATTGTATGGGAAGCCCG-3′ (ClaI site in bold) Open table in a new tab The construct for expression of GST-FtsW(Ala490-Gly524) was generated using the sense primer 5′-TATGGATCCATGGCCGATCCGCCGGTTCGT-3′ (BamHI site in bold) and the antisense primer FtsW-as and cloning between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the vector pGEX-2T (AmershamBiosciences). To express the domain encompassed by residues Leu385 to Gly524 of FtsW, pJB201 was digested with PstI and EcoRI, and the resulting 417-bp fragment was gel-purified and cloned between the PstI and EcoRI sites of the vector pBAD-HisC (Invitrogen) to give pJB202. E. coliBL21(DE3)/pJB101 was grown to an A 600 of 0.6. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and growth was continued at 37 °C with shaking for 2 h. Cells were harvested and broken by sonication in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml DNase, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. The post-sonicate supernatant was loaded on a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (buffer A). After washing the column with 100 mm imidazole in buffer A, FtsZ was eluted with 200 mm imidazole in buffer A. The mutant FtsZ proteins were expressed as described above. All the mutants localized to the post-sonicate supernatant and were purified as described. Purified FtsZ (or [Δ(Asp367–Asp370)]FtsZ) 2The nomenclature is as follows: [Δ(Asp367–Asp370)]FtsZ refers to N-terminal His-tagged FtsZ with deletion of amino acid residues Asp367 to Asp370; (Leu385–Gly524)FtsW refers to amino acid residues Leu385 to Gly524 of carrying a His-tag at the N-terminus; GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) refers to amino acid residues Ala490–Gly525 of FtsW fused at the N-terminal end to GST; FtsZ(D367A) refers to FtsZ with aspartic acid residue at position 367 mutated to alanine, and so on.was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After determining the concentration of FtsZ by the Bradford assay, 10-fold molar excess of N-hydroxysuccinimido-iminobiotin was added, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with occasional gentle mixing followed by dialysis against PBS. E. coliBL21(DE3)/pJB201 was grown to an A 600 of 0.6. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 μm, and growth was continued at 25 °C for 6 h to express His-tagged FtsW. For expression of (Leu385–Gly524)FtsW,E. coli Top10/pJB202 was grown to anA 600 of 0.6, and arabinose was added at a concentration of 0.02% (w/v). Growth was continued for 4 h at 37 °C. GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) was expressed by induction of cells with 0.1 mm IPTG at 37 °C for 2 h. Extracts from cells expressing FtsW were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The blot was blocked with blocking buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, containing 3% (w/v) gelatin) for 30 min at room temperature. The blotted proteins were allowed to renature in renaturing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature. After thorough washing with ligand blot buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), the blot was incubated with 1 μm biotinylated FtsZ (or [Δ(Asp367–Asp370)]FtsZ) for 1 h at room temperature. As controls, similar blots were incubated in buffer alone without any FtsZ (or its mutant) for 1 h. After washing the blots with ligand buffer followed by incubation with streptavidin-linked alkaline phosphatase, detection was carried out using NBT/BCIP. GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) was allowed to bind to glutathione-Sepharose. The slurry was washed thoroughly. Post-sonicate supernatants from E. coli cells expressing FtsZ or its mutants as N-terminal-hexahistidine-tagged proteins were incubated in each tube containing glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) for 2 h at 30 °C. The slurry was washed thoroughly with PBS, boiled in SDS gel sample denaturing buffer, and loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gels. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked in blocking buffer (as described above), and probed with anti-His antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Color development was carried out by incubation with anti-mouse IgG (alkaline phosphatase conjugate) and NBT/BCIP. Similar experiments were performed in which the post-sonicate supernatant from E. coliexpressing GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) was incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose-bound His-tagged FtsZ or its derivatives. Detection of resin-bound GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) was carried out using anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) was adsorbed to the wells of a microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate. Adsorption was allowed to proceed for 12 h at 4 °C. The wells were washed with PBS containing 0.5% Tween (PBS-T). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with blocking buffer (1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS-T) for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed extensively with PBS-T. 100 μl of biotinylated FtsZ or its mutants (0.2–10 μm) was added to each well, and the binding was allowed to proceed for 6 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed extensively with PBS-T. Binding of biotinylated protein was measured by adding 0.1 μg/ml (in 100 μl) streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase to each well, incubating for 60 min at room temperature followed by color development by the addition of 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate prepared in 0.1 mglycine containing 0.01 m MgCl2 (pH 10.4). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. In each case, experiments were performed in which equivalent amounts of bovine serum albumin were first adsorbed to the wells. The sequences ofM. tuberculosis H37Rv FtsZ (encoded by the open reading frame Rv2150c)and FtsW (encoded by the open reading frame Rv2154c) are depicted in Fig. 1. The C-terminal extension of M. tuberculosis FtsW, which is absent in FtsW of E. coli, extends from amino acid residue 428 to residue 524 (Fig. 1 B). A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot (data not shown) suggests that this extension is hydrophilic. It encompasses a cluster of arginine residues (shaded in gray). The C-tail of FtsZ carries a stretch of aspartate residues (shaded in gray) that is absent in E. coli FtsZ (Fig. 1 A). To test whether FtsZ interacts with FtsW, full-length FtsZ was expressed with a hexahistidine tag at its N terminus, purified on Ni2+−-NTA-agarose (Fig.2 A), and biotinylated. Efforts to purify FtsW did not meet with success. We failed to extract membrane-bound FtsW with detergents since the protein appeared to be sensitive to proteolytic degradation. Cell extracts expressing FtsW (Fig. 2 B, lanes a and b) with a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred on to nitrocellulose, and renatured. The blots were then incubated successively with biotinylated FtsZ and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase followed by color development with NBT/BCIP. The reactivity of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase alone was tested by incubation with blotted proteins in the absence of biotinylated FtsZ. A band developed at the position of migration of FtsW (Fig. 2 D, lane c) The position of FtsW was verified by Western blot of a similar lane with anti-His antibody (Fig.2 D, lane k), suggesting a direct interaction between FtsZ and FtsW. A similar band was also obtained when anE. coli extract expressing (Leu385–Gly524)FtsW (as an N-terminal His-tagged protein; Fig. 2 B, lanes c andd) was used in similar assays. This domain includes the hydrophilic C-tail of FtsW, which is predicted to extend into the cytosol. (Leu385–Gly524)FtsW could also interact with biotinylated FtsZ (Fig. 2 D, lane d). These results suggested that the C-tail of FtsW is likely to be involved in a direct interaction between FtsZ and FtsW. We hypothesized that the stretch of aspartate residues (Asp367–Asp370) of FtsZ is involved in the interaction with FtsW (which possesses a stretch of arginine residues at its C-terminal end). A mutant of FtsZ in which these residues had been deleted was biotinylated and similarly tested for its ability to interact with FtsW. No interaction could be detected (Fig.2 D), leading to the conclusion that the stretch of aspartate residues at the C-tail of FtsZ is crucial for its interaction with FtsW.Figure 2Expression of proteins and blot overlay assays.

The hydrophilic C-tail of FtsW from residue Ala490 to Gly524 encompassing the cluster of arginine residues at the C terminus (Fig. 1 B) was expressed as a GST fusion protein (Fig. 2 C). Post-sonicate supernatant from E. coli cells expressing GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) was incubated in separate tubes with immobilized FtsZ or its mutants, and resins were washed and boiled in SDS gel denaturing buffer. Interactions of GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) with FtsZ or its mutants were analyzed after separation of the proteins on denaturing gels, electrotransfer, and Western blotting with anti-GST antibody. It was confirmed that His-tagged FtsZ could interact with the C-tail of FtsW (Fig. 3 A). Mutation of one Asp to Ala did not abrogate the interaction. However, mutations of two aspartates to alanine led to a visibly diminished detectability of the band corresponding to GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524), whereas no band could be detected when three aspartates had been mutated to alanines. This led us to hypothesize that the stretch of aspartates located in the C-tail of FtsZ mediates its interaction with the C-tail of FtsW with at least three aspartate residues being required for the interaction. These results were corroborated when GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, and post-sonicate supernatants of E. coli expressing FtsZ or its mutants were allowed to bind to it. FtsZ could not be pulled down in a control tube in which GST alone was bound to the resin, indicating that the interaction between the C-tail of FtsW and FtsZ was specific. After probing with anti-His antibody and color development, it was observed that the stretch of aspartate residues of FtsZ encompassed by residues 367–370 were involved in interaction with the C-tail of FtsW and that at least three aspartate residues were necessary for the interaction (Fig.3 B). Solid-phase binding assays were performed in which GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) was adsorbed to the wells of a microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate, and varying concentrations of biotinylated FtsZ or its derivatives were added, followed by color development with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Fig. 4 clearly shows that binding of FtsZ with the C-tail of FtsW was significantly diminished when two of the aspartate residues had been mutated to alanine. No detectable interaction was observed when three or more aspartate residues were changed to alanine. Cell division is a complex multistep process requiring ordered assembly of a diverse array of proteins in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. Although the molecular events coordinating cell division have been best studied in E. coli, little is known about the cell duplication process of M. tuberculosis, a slow grower with a doubling time of 24 h. ZipA and FtsA have been identified as the interacting partners of FtsZ in E. coli. However, no counterparts of these two proteins have been identified in the M. tuberculosis genome. The mechanisms of cell division are likely to be different in M. tuberculosis as compared with E. coli. Learning about this process, which is restricted to the pathogen and absent in its host, is likely to enable the choice of rational targets for the development of potential new antimicrobial drugs. Cell division presents a case for developing drugs aimed at disrupting protein-protein interactions, as opposed to enzyme inhibitors. In the absence of ZipA, we have explored the possibility that FtsW could be the binding partner for FtsZ in M. tuberculosis, making it a likely candidate for linking septum formation to peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The C-terminal region of FtsZ is a domain important in mediating protein-protein interactions. We have observed that the C-tail of FtsZ carries a stretch of aspartate residues absent in its E. coli counterpart (Fig.1 A). The C-tail of FtsW of M. tuberculosis carries an extension not present in itsE. coli counterpart. This C-tail is hydrophilic, predicted to extend into the cytosol, and carries a cluster of arginine residues (Fig. 1 B). By analogy with the observation that arginine-rich clusters of the cytoplasmic domain of the human anion exchanger 1 serve as a major binding site for a motif of opposite charge in the membrane binding domain of protein 4.1 (26Jons T. Drenckhahn D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the C-tails of FtsZ and FtsW could interact through the above mentioned clusters of oppositely charged residues. This hypothesis was tested using a range of biochemical techniques to characterize the interaction of the C-tails of FtsZ and FtsW. The results presented here validate our view that FtsZ and FtsW interact through their C-tails. Using a gel renaturation assay, we have demonstrated a direct interaction between FtsW of M. tuberculosis expressed inE. coli and biotinylated, recombinant FtsZ of M. tuberculosis. When the C-terminal domain of FtsW was expressed and used in gel renaturation assays, it was also able to interact with biotinylated FtsZ. This suggested that the C-tail of FtsW was likely to be crucial for interaction with FtsZ. At the same time, [Δ(Asp367–Asp370)]FtsZ was unable to interact with FtsW or its C-terminal domain, suggesting that the stretch of four aspartate residues in the C-tail of FtsZ is crucial for these interactions. Our predictions were further tested by mutating the aspartate residues one at a time and determining the minimum requirement of charged residues for an interaction between FtsZ and FtsW. Mutation of two aspartate residues led to a significant reduction in binding of FtsZ to FtsW, whereas no interaction was detectable when at least three of the aspartate residues had been mutated. Using immobilized GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524), pull-down assays showed that FtsZ could be precipitated from crude cell lysates, indicating that the interaction was specific. Pull-down occurred with progressively decreasing efficiency as the aspartate residues from positions 367 to 390 of FtsZ were mutated one after the other. These results strengthened the opinion that the string of aspartate residues from positions 367 to 370 was crucial in interacting with the C-tail of FtsW. Experiments in which lysates of E. coli expressing GST-FtsW(Ala490–Gly524) were allowed to interact with immobilized FtsZ or its mutants gave similar results. Taken together, these results provide, for the first time, evidence that FtsW of M. tuberculosis is an interacting partner of FtsZ from the same organism. The interactions most likely take place through the C-terminal ends of both these proteins, which carry clusters of oppositely charged residues. Survival of the pathogen within its host is likely to depend as much on protein-protein interactions as on enzymological functions. Protein-protein interactions that comprise large surface areas are unlikely to be suitable for targeted intervention. The FtsZ-FtsW interaction, on the other hand, appears likely to involve small clusters of charged residues on these proteins. The residues of FtsW involved in this interaction therefore deserve to be identified. Compounds that inhibit protein-protein interactions are far less well known than enzymological inhibitors. Taxol represents a chemotherapeutic that functions by stabilizing tubulin dimer associations (27Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B. Nature. 1979; 27: 665-667Crossref Scopus (3126) Google Scholar, 28Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). As a prerequisite for developing chemotherapeutics, it is essential to characterize protein-protein interactions involved in key cellular processes such as cell division. Demonstration of the direct interaction of FtsZ and FtsW of M. tuberculosis marks a beginning. However, the results of the present study need to be interpreted with caution until it can be demonstrated that FtsW is indeed part of the division ring in vivo. We are particularly grateful to Prof. Stewart Cole, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France for the cosmid MTCY270."
https://openalex.org/W2164303345,"Increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) has been shown to stimulate the expression of a number of genes. We previously demonstrated in glomerular mesangial and endothelial cells that both high glucose concentrations and glucosamine activated the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene promoter through the transcription factor, Sp1; and that the glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitor, 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine, inhibited the effect of high glucose, but not that of glucosamine. Here, we examined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in the regulation of the PAI-1 promoter and Sp1 transcriptional activity by the HBP. In transient transfections, exposure to 2 mm glucosamine or 20 mmglucose for 4 days increased the activities of a PAI-1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene as well as the Sp1 transcriptional activation domain fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain cotransfected with a GAL4 promoter-luciferase reporter. Cotransfected dominant negative PKC-βI and -δ completely blocked the induction of PAI-1 promoter transcription by both sugars, whereas only dominant negative PKC-βI interfered with Sp1-GAL4 activation. Both glucosamine and high glucose stimulated the in vitro kinase activity of immunoprecipitated PKC-βI and -δ. Furthermore, 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine suppressed high glucose-induced PKC kinase activity and Sp1-GAL4 transcriptional activation.

In turn, this increased flux has been proposed to stimulate gene expression.

Thus, the HBP may hasten the development of the microvascular complications of diabetes, particularly diabetic nephropathy, by augmenting the expression of genes, such as those encoding transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), TGF-β receptors, transforming growth factor-α, fibronectin, laminin, osteopontin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (15Goldberg H.J.

Subsequent steps produce the end product, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a substrate for N- and O-linked glycosylation of extracellular proteins and the synthesis of glycolipids, proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkers (35Schleicher E.D.

In addition, flux through the HBP and the generation of UDP-GlcNAc leads to intracellularO-linked protein glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation), characterized by the attachment of monomericN-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues (38Comer F.I.

High glucose-mediated flux through the HBP in mesangial cells may be related not only to increased cellular entry of glucose, but also to up-regulation of mesangial cell GFA (as noted in rats with experimental diabetes) (24Nerlich A.G. Sauer U. Kolm-Litty V. Wagner E. Koch M. Schleicher E.D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and to the increased production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondrial glucose metabolism (5Nishikawa T. Edelstein D., Du, X.L. Yamagishi S.-I. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M.

A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Using the PAI-1 gene promoter as a model, we demonstrated that both glucose and glucosamine up-regulated PAI-1 promoter activity and that the GFA inhibitor, 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON), inhibited the action of glucose but not that of glucosamine (15Goldberg H.J. Scholey J. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GFA also stimulated the PAI-1 promoter (17James L.R. Fantus G.I. Goldberg H., Ly, H. Scholey J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F718-F727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the transcription factor, Sp1, was required for activation of the PAI-1 promoter by high glucose or glucosamine (15Goldberg H.J. Scholey J. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the HBP activates Sp1 and the PAI-1 promoter are unclear. However, based on some previous data, it has been hypothesized that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 increases gene expression. There are at least nine O-GlcNAc moieties on Sp1 that are located preferentially in the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain (39Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 44Jackson S.P. Tjian R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It was reported earlier that Sp1 produced in Escherichia coli, which lacksO-GlcNAc, activates in vitro transcription to a lesser extent than mammalian Sp1, which contains O-GlcNAc (44Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Recently, high glucose has been found to activate the PAI-1 promoter via the HBP and Sp1 in endothelial cells and to increase overall Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation (16Du X.-L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F., Wu, J. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In contrast, Kudlow and colleagues (46Roos M.D., Su, L. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 47Yang X., Su, K. Roos M.D. Chang Q. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6611-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) have provided evidence suggesting thatO-GlcNAcylation of the Sp1 transcriptional activation domain suppresses, rather than stimulates, Sp1 transcriptional activation. They mapped one of the Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation sites to serine 484 in the B transcriptional activation domain (46Roos M.D., Su, L. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).O-GlcNAcylation of this site reduced interactions between Sp1 and the transcriptional cofactor, dTAFII110 (46Roos M.D., Su, L. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mutation of serine 484 to alanine enhanced the activity of a GAL4 fusion protein containing part of the Sp1 B domain in an in vitro transcription assay (47Yang X., Su, K. Roos M.D. Chang Q. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6611-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This mutant construct was also more active than wild-type in transiently transfected HIT-T15 cells, which contain high levels of OGT, but not in HepG2 or HeLa cells, containing low OGT levels (47Yang X., Su, K. Roos M.D. Chang Q. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6611-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These data led us to consider an alternate explanation for hexosamine-induced transcription, namely thatO-GlcNAcylation of cytoplasmic proteins may result in perturbations in intracellular signaling, thus impacting indirectly on transcription factors. The Sp1 site in the PAI-1 promoter could be regulated in this way. Although Sp1 is ubiquitous, constitutively expressed, and binds to GC-rich sites that are abundant in housekeeping genes (48Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol.

Classical PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, γ) are activated by calcium and diacylglycerol, novel PKC isoforms (δ, ε, η, θ) depend only on diacylglycerol, and atypical PKC isoforms (λ/ι, ζ) respond to products of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.

Because the enzyme exerts nearly total control over glucose metabolism in the β-cell, even small changes in GK activity exert effects on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and, consequently, the blood glucose concentration. Using quantitative imaging of multicolor fluorescent proteins fused to GK, we found that the association of GK with insulin granules is regulated by glucose in the β-cell. Glucose stimulation increased the rate of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GK to insulin granules, indicating that GK is released into the cytoplasm after glucose stimulation. Changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two different fluorescent protein variants inserted on opposing ends of GK were observed after glucose stimulation and correlated with increased enzyme activity. Furthermore, glucose-stimulated changes in GK regulation were blocked by two inhibitors of insulin secretion. Insulin treatment restored GK regulation in inhibited cells and stimulated GK translocation and activation by itself. Together, these data support a model for post-translational regulation of GK whereby insulin regulates both the association of GK with secretory granules and the activity of the enzyme within the pancreatic β-cell.

It has long been known that glucose is an important regulator of GK activity in the β-cell, although the mechanisms through which glucose acts to regulate GK activity in the β-cell are not yet understood. Several studies have suggested that glucose influences GK activity by affecting either the rate of gene transcription or by altering the stability of the enzyme itself (1Matschinsky F.M. Glaser B. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 6Liang Y. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol.

However, these studies were not designed to explore the regulation of GK at the post-translational level, as was suggested by several studies that reported glucose-sensitive changes in GK activity independent of changes in GK protein levels (8Liang Y. Najafi H. Smith R.M. Zimmerman E.C. Magnuson M.A. Tal M. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 792-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Chen C. Bumbalo L. Leahy J.L.

Thus, post-translational regulation of GK in the β-cell has not been clearly established, nor has a feasible mechanistic explanation for these data emerged. One potential avenue for post-translational modulation of GK function has arisen from recent observations that GK is associated with insulin secretory granules (11Toyoda Y. Yoshie S. Shironoguchi H. Miwa I. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Stubbs M. Aiston S. Agius L. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2048-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because agonist-stimulated changes in the cellular localization of proteins is an important mechanism for regulating protein function (13Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 103: 181-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and because regulation of GK in the liver is known to involve flux between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (14Agius L. Peak M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Shiota C. Coffey J. Grimsby J. Grippo J.F. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37125-37130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the prospect of GK regulation in the β-cell involving reversible association with secretory granules presented an attractive hypothesis. GK association with a variety of bound and cytoplasmic compartments has been described in recent years (12Stubbs M. Aiston S. Agius L. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2048-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Noma Y. Bonner-Weir S. Latimer J.B. Davalli A.M. Weir G.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Vanhoutte C. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Tiedge M. Steffeck H. Elsner M. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); however, these studies have not established a clear role for different GK-associated compartments in the response of the β-cell to glucose. Indeed, it is not known whether translocation between compartments even occurs. Thus, although evidence exists for the multicompartment localization of GK in β-cells, the significance of this compartmentalization, the mechanisms involved, and functional impact of alterations in GK localization remain controversial, if not wholly uncertain. One potential explanation for the lack of consensus in examining GK localization arises from the low resolution methods employed in these studies, namely biochemical fractionation techniques and immunofluorescent microscopy. Low resolution techniques, such as immunolabeling (12Stubbs M. Aiston S. Agius L. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2048-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and biochemical fractionation (18Tiedge M. Steffeck H. Elsner M. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), are of limited value in studying the association of GK with insulin granules because these techniques require destruction of the sample prior to analysis. It is especially difficult to apply these techniques to the study of proteins that are expressed in low levels, as is GK expression in β-cells, because even small losses in protein have a large impact on efforts to quantify changes in protein localization. Furthermore, these methods provide little temporal information, making characterization of dynamic processes, such as GK translocation, exceedingly difficult. Therefore, the study of GK localization in β-cells would greatly benefit from an alternative approach. Recent developments in fluorescent protein-based techniques, along with improvements in live cell imaging technology, now enable measurements of a wide variety of biochemical processes in living cells. One such technique that has been successfully used to monitor changes in protein localization and mobility in living cells is fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (19Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 20Henkel A.W. Simpson L.L. Ridge R.M. Betz W.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3960-3967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vasudevan C. Han W. Tan Y. Nie Y., Li, D. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. Romero G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Reits E.A.J. Neefjes J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E145-E147Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In FRAP, fluorophores in a region of the cell are irreversibly photobleached, which markedly reduces the signal in that region. As photobleached fluorophores diffuse away from the region, they are replaced by unbleached fluorophores that diffuse in from outside the photobleached region. Thus, the fluorescence signal recovers with time. If the photobleached fluorophores are bound to stationary intracellular components, then the fluorescence signal will not recover. Therefore, FRAP can be used to measure not only diffusion, but also binding sites within the cell. Another technique, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), has been used to expand the spatial resolution limit to the <100-Å range, thereby permitting detection of changes in protein conformation and protein-protein interactions (23Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Pollok B.A. Heim R.

These two techniques allow effective quantification of subtle changes in protein localization and structure that are often masked by the signal to noise limitations, finite collection ranges, and the physical resolution limits of current microscope systems. Not surprisingly, these high resolution techniques, when used in conjunction with more traditional approaches, have led to major advances in our understanding of protein motion and localization in the context of their natural cellular environment. Here, we have utilized FRAP, FRET, and biochemical fractionation to explore post-transcriptional regulation of GK in the β-cell. We report that, in the absence of glucose, GK is associated with insulin granules, as determined by FRAP assays and biochemical fractionation. Glucose leads to a release of GK from this bound state into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the release of GK from the granule-bound state is accompanied both by increased GK activity and a conformational change, as detected using FRET. We also found that either the inhibition of insulin secretion or insulin receptor function blocked glucose-stimulated GK translocation and conformational changes. Moreover, insulin was able to stimulate GK translocation and activation in the absence of glucose. Together, these results point to the regulation of GK localization and activity by insulin secreted from β-cells in response to glucose. These data provide an important advance to our understanding of GSIS from pancreatic β-cells and may have important implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes. Fluorescent protein expression vectors were obtained from BD CLONTECH. Fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes. Chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. PCR primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. DNA isolation reagents were obtained from Qiagen. Optical filters were obtained from Chroma. Peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Media and Reagents Core of the Diabetes Research and Training Center at Vanderbilt University. A cDNA encoding the rat β-cell GK isoform was inserted into the pEGFP-N3 vector. A pEYFP-N3 vector was made by inserting YFP from the pEYFP-N1 vector into the same position as the GFP in the N3 vector. β-Cell GK cDNA was then inserted into this construct to make GK-YFP. CFP-GK-YFP was made by transfer of CFP sequences from pECFP-N1 into the GK-YFP plasmid. The C-peptide CFP construct was made by inserting CFP into the murine proinsulin II cDNA at the native XmaI site in the C-peptide region of the gene. This construct was generated in two parts by splicing the N-terminal portion of the gene into pECFP-N3 (generated as described above for the pEYFP-N3 vector) and inserting the C-terminal portion into the pECFP-C1 construct. The full-length construct was made by insertion of the BsrGI,XbaI fragment of the C-terminal portion into the vector containing the N-terminal fragment. The dsRed C-peptide construct was made by removal of the fluorescent protein from the C-peptide CFP construct and insertion of dsRed cDNA. Details of the assembly and the plasmid maps are available upon request. All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing reactions performed by the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Shared Resource. Plasmid DNAs were introduced into βTC3 cells by 10 50-μs square wave pulses of 300 V at 500-ms intervals with a BTX ECM830 electroporator. 5 μg of each construct was used per 20% of a 80% confluent T-75 flask of βTC3 cells suspended in Dulbecco’s PBS (BioWhittaker) in a 2-mm gapped cuvette. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum with high glucose and switched to 5 mm glucose medium 24 h prior to experimentation. Cells were starved for 2–3 h in glucose-free BMHH plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (27Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Postic C. Shelton K.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) prior to experimentation. For immunofluorescent staining, cells were grown on coverslips and fixed for 30 min with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, and stained with rabbit anti-GK (28Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and/or guinea pig anti-insulin (Linco) where indicated. Anti-rabbit ALEXA-488 and anti-guinea pig ALEXA-546 were applied for the detection of GK and insulin immunostains where appropriate. Visualization was with a Zeiss LSM510 microscope (63×, 1.4 numeric aperture apochromat) using the 457-, 488-, and 514-nm argon lines and a 543-nm helium-neon laser to excite CFP, GFP/ALEXA-488, YFP, and dsRed/ALEXA-546, respectively. Emitted light was passed through bandpass filters for collection of CFP (470–510 nm), GFP/Alexa-488 (505–530 nm), and YFP (530–550 nm). Long-pass filters were used for collection of Alexa-546 (560 nm) and dsRed (590 nm). Examination of dsRed was in cells expressing this construct for at least 48 h, when emission in the “green state” of the fluorophore was no longer detectable using our standardized optical conditions. FRAP measurements were taken using procedures similar to those that have been reported as biologically useful without prohibitory phototoxic effects (19Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 20Henkel A.W. Simpson L.L. Ridge R.M. Betz W.J. J.

In our experiments, we observed no morphological changes in the cells, as would be expected from cellular photodamage. Quantification of the FRET ratio of granules was performed by selecting regions that were positive for dsRed fluorescence and calculating the ratio of YFP/CFP intensities in these regions using NIH Image software. Regions that contained no dsRed fluorescence were determined to be cytoplasmic areas. Prestimulation ratios from whole cells were normalized to 1.0 for comparison purposes in Fig. 4. Living cells were maintained at 32 °C using the Bioptechs Delta T open dished system. Identical results were obtained at 37 °C, although maintaining focus on single granules became more problematic because of increased granule motion and focal drift. Fluorescence spectra of CFP-GK-YFP was obtained from cell lysates (1.5% Triton X-100, PBS, 30 min) using a spectrofluorimeter. Spectra were normalized to cells not expressing the construct. Following stimulation as described, cells were collected in cold PBS and resuspended in cold 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 125 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, along with 20 μg/ml digitonin. Cells were incubated on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (20 min at 12,000 × g). Pellet and supernatant fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blot using rabbit anti-GK antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Observation of GK was by film exposure to nitrocellulose membranes treated with ECL+PLUS Western blot Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). GK activity from an equal number of cells lysed with 1.5% Triton X-100 was assayed by a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled reaction according to the protocol of Fernandez-Mejia et al. (29Fernandez-Mejia C. Vega-Allende J. Rojas-Ochoa A. Rodriguez-Dorantes M. Romero-Navarro G. Matschinsky F.M. Wang J. German M.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using NAD as a coenzyme. NADH production was quantified using a spectrofluorimeter (350-nm excitation, 450-nm collection). Single measurements were generated from triplicate measurements of single samples. In addition, the protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined using the Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) atA590 to ensure proper normalization across samples. Total cellular GK activity was measured by subtraction of the activity measured at 0.5 mm glucose from the activity measured at 100 mm glucose to account for hexokinase activity in our lysates. Colocalization between GK and insulin granules in βTC3 cells was detected using an affinity-purified anti-GK antibody (28Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in an immunofluorescent staining experiment (Fig.1A). This finding agrees with previous investigations into the distribution of GK in primary β-cells and insulinoma cell lines (11Toyoda Y. Yoshie S. Shironoguchi H. Miwa I. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Stubbs M. Aiston S. Agius L. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 2048-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, similar results were obtained using MIN6 cells and INS1 cells (data not shown), thereby supporting the notion that the association of GK with insulin granules is a phenomena that is not limited to certain cell lines. To more directly assess the interaction of GK with insulin granules, GK-YFP was made and expressed in cells along with a CFP construct that was targeted to insulin granules by insertion of CFP into the connecting peptide segment of the murine proinsulin II cDNA (C-peptide CFP) (30Watkins S. Geng X., Li, L. Papworth G. Robbins P.D. Drain P. Traffic. 2002; 3: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the distribution of these constructs was identical to the distribution of endogenous GK and insulin granules, indicating that this system was appropriate for monitoring the association of GK with insulin granules in living cells. Moreover, a GFP-tagged hexokinase II (HK-GFP) variant (15Shiota C. Coffey J. Grimsby J. Grippo J.F. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37125-37130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) did not localize to granules (Fig. 1C). This suggests that granule association occurs only with GK and is not a general property of all hexokinase isoforms. Quantification of the association between GK and insulin granules is a complex problem because the “bound” and “free” compartments are not readily distinguished from each other. Indeed, the bound compartment in this case involves granules that are, themselves, mobile within the free cytoplasmic compartment, thus making it difficult to measure changes in GK distribution. To be able to quantify changes in GK distribution in β-cells, we used the highly sensitive FRAP technique to measure the release of GK-YFP from CFP-labeled insulin granules into the cytoplasmic compartment. As shown in Fig.2A, a region containing several CFP-labeled granules was photobleached with a high intensity pulse of 514-nm laser to destroy the fluorescence from GK-YFP (31Patterson G. Day R.N. Piston D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 837-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the recovery of GK-YFP to the CFP-labeled granules was measured. The analysis was performed only on granules that remained in place during the course of the experiment, as indicated by the CFP fluorescence. Recovery of the GK-YFP to the photobleached granules occurred over several seconds and was considerably slower than recovery in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A, red dotted line), which recovers with a t12 of ∼100 ms (32Luby-Phelps K. Taylor D.L. Lanni F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although GK-YFP fluorescence recovered to granules after stimulation with at least 1 mm glucose for 30 min, it did not recover to granules in cells cultured with less than 1 mm glucose (Fig. 2B). At high concentrations of glucose (>10 mm), it is expected that the total amount of GK-YFP associated with the granules would decrease. However, recovery of GK-YFP to granules at higher concentrations was still much slower that recovery to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A), indicating that recovery at these concentrations cannot be explained by simple diffusion of unbound GK into the field. Translocation of the GK-YFP was also examined using a digitonin permeabilization assay (Fig. 2C). In this case, βTC3 cells were incubated with increasing glucose concentrations prior to treatment with digitonin and separation of the cell into both soluble (cytoplasmic) and membrane-bound (pellet) compartments by centrifugation. Under low glucose conditions, GK was detected only in the membrane-bound fraction. Increasing glucose concentrations resulted in a gradual redistribution of GK to the soluble compartment, corresponding with the dose-response data obtained from FRAP measurements. Together, these observations indicate that GK colocalizes with insulin granules in β-cells and that the enzyme translocates from the bound to the free compartment in response to changes in the glucose concentration. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that GK translocation in the β-cell may constitute a potential mechanism for acute regulation of GK activity. To test this possibility, we measured GK activity under the conditions that resulted either in the tight association of GK with granules (glucose starvation) or reduced granule binding and release to the cytoplasm (10 mm glucose). Stimulation of cells with 10 mm glucose for 1 h resulted in increasing the cellular GK activity 40% when compared with untreated cells (Fig.3C) (29Fernandez-Mejia C. Vega-Allende J. Rojas-Ochoa A. Rodriguez-Dorantes M. Romero-Navarro G. Matschinsky F.M. Wang J. German M.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (p < 0.05, by t test) when compared with unstimulated cells. This increase in GK activity is consistent with cytoplasmic GK having a higher activity than granule-bound GK. However, the GK activity assay was not sensitive enough to examine the relative activity of the bound and free compartments, although increased GK activity occurs under conditions where translocation to the cytoplasm has been observed. Therefore, we developed a fluorescence-based probe for examining different GK conformational and/or activity states. Changes in protein activity often reflect alterations in their conformational state and such conformational changes can be directly measured by examination of FRET between fluorescent proteins of different colors (23Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To make use of this fact, we assembled a GK fusion protein that was tagged on both the C- and N-terminal ends by attaching CFP as a donor chromophore to the N terminus of GK-YFP. Analysis of the emission spectra of extracts from cells expressing CFP-GK-YFP revealed that glucose stimulation was accompanied by a shift in the emission spectra (Fig. 3A). The relative FRET ratio of this probe was calculated from samples treated identically to those where GK activation was observed (Fig. 3, B andC), suggesting that the changes to the FRET signal from the CFP-GK-YFP construct reports changes in GK conformation that correlate with increased activity (Fig. 3D). To assess the changes in FRET spectra in single living cells, the CFP-GK-YFP construct was introduced into cells along with a C-peptide construct containing the dsRed fluorescent protein. As shown in Fig. 3 (E andF), granule-bound CFP-GK-YFP displayed a strong FRET signal, whereas cytoplasmic CFP-GK-YFP displayed a weak FRET signal. These results are consistent with GK having a lower activity when associated with insulin granules and a higher activity when released into the cytoplasm Because the quantitative imaging data we obtained supports the post-translational regulation of GK by glucose, we next focused on a mechanism that would satisfactorily explain the effect of glucose on GK activity and localization. The simplest potential mechanism for glucose-induced regulation of GK would be the induction of GK translocation and activation upon the binding of glucose to GK. Because glucose enters β-cells through facilitated diffusion, this hypothesis predicts that regulation of GK would occur concurrent with the addition of the glucose bolus. However, we did not find evidence of changes in GK localization (as determined by our FRAP assay) until 20 min after stimulation with glucose (Fig.4A). Because regulation of GK occurs much later than glucose stimulation, it is not adequately explained by simple association between GK and glucose. Moreover, the glucose concentration-response profile of this process (see above) was not consistent with reported affinities for glucose-GK interactions (Km ∼ 8 mm (Ref. 1Matschinsky F.M. Glaser B. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar)). Recent studies have shown a role for insulin signaling in β-cells in maintaining normal GSIS (33Kulkarni R.N.

Indeed, islets from mice that lack insulin receptors exhibit impaired GSIS despite maintaining a normal response to arginine (33Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin receptor signaling stimulates a broad range of intracellular signaling pathways in the β-cell, which modulate a wide variety of cellular functions. Because evidence for the regulation of GSIS by an insulin autocrine/paracrine feedback loop has recently emerged, we performed experiments to test the hypothesis that GSIS and the subsequent autostimulation of insulin receptors on the β-cell is the signal that leads to both GK translocation and activation. To assess the importance of insulin signaling in glucose-stimulated GK regulation, we pretrea"

In this study, we have analyzed mice bearing loss-of-function mutations of the insulin/IGF signaling systems. Combined inactivation of insulin receptor (Insr) and Igf1 receptor (Igf1r), but not of either receptor alone, resulted in a 90% decrease in the size of the exocrine pancreas, because of decreased cellular proliferation. In contrast to the findings in the exocrine compartment, endocrine α- and β-cell development was unperturbed. Combined ablation of Igf1 and Igf2, the ligands for these two receptors, resulted in an identical phenotype. We also examined the effect of heterozygous null Igf1r mutations on glucose homeostasis in adult mice. Igf1r haploinsufficiency did not affect insulin action and compensatory β-cell growth in insulin-resistant mice with combined Insr andIgf1r heterozygous null mutations, resulting in a considerably milder phenotype than combined haploinsufficiency forInsr and its main signaling substrates, Irs1and Irs2. We conclude that Igf1r andInsr are required for embryonic development of the exocrine but not of the endocrine pancreas and that defects of Igf1rdo not alter glucose homeostasis as long as the insulin receptor system remains intact.

Although these two abnormalities are interdependent, and lead in concert to the onset of hyperglycemia, it is unclear whether they share a common pathogenesis. Increasing evidence indicates that insulin and IGF1 signalings play overlapping roles in metabolism and pancreatic β-cell function. For example, ablation of Insr function in skeletal muscle, a key target tissue in glucose disposal, does not cause significant metabolic abnormalities (3Lauro D. Kido Y. Castle A.L. Zarnowski M.J.

On the other hand, ablation of Irs2, a closely related INSR substrate, results in impaired β-cell proliferation and diabetes (10Withers D.J. Sanchez-Gutierrez J. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M.

At present, however, the details of the involvement of INSR and IGF1R in β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion and also in compensatory functions in response to insulin resistance remain unclear (11Bonner-Weir S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1926-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of mice carrying targeted null mutations ofInsr and Igf1r indicate that the two genes have fundamentally different physiologic roles (12Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J.

Nevertheless, some data suggest that there is functional overlap between the growth-promoting functions of the two receptors (15Efstratiadis A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 955-976PubMed Google Scholar). As we have previously shown, IGF2 stimulates embryonic growth in mice not only through its cognate receptor (IGF1R) but also in part through INSR (16Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice lacking both IGF receptors, IGF1R and IGF2R, are rescued from perinatal lethality by IGF2 acting through INSR to promote growth (17Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 517-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ability of IGF1R to compensate for the metabolic actions of INSR is unclear (18Di Cola G. Cool M.H. Accili D. J. Clin.

To investigate further the functional overlap between INSR and IGF1R signaling in development, especially as it pertains to the pancreas, and also in metabolic control, we examined different mouse models. First, we analyzed pancreatic development in embryos homozygous for null mutations of the genes encoding Igf1r andInsr, alone or in combination. We also studied double mutant embryos lacking both IGF ligands, Igf1 andIgf2. Perinatal lethality precludes a metabolic analysis of nullizygotes for Insr or Igf1rmutations in adulthood. Thus, usingInsr+/−Igf1r+/− double heterozygotes, we asked whether the insulin resistance caused by theInsr mutation (31Kido Y. Philippe N. Schaeffer A.A. Accili D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) is exacerbated by Igf1rhaploinsufficiency. Because we have previously shown thatInsr haploinsufficiency has a strong diabetogenic effect in appropriate predisposing backgrounds (Irs1+/−or Irs2+/−), it was important to examine whether a similar predisposing effect of Igf1rhaploinsufficiency would be detected by this experimental approach. Generation and genotyping of mice with null alleles of Igf1, Igf2, Insr, andIgf1r have been reported in previous publications (12Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P.

Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Double heterozygousInsr+/−Igf1r+/− mice were obtained by crossing the two strains as described previously (16Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Timed pregnancies were set up to retrieveInsr−/− and Igf1r−/−embryos at gestational stages E12.5 and E18.5. Mice were housed in a barrier facility in ventilated cages with filtered air in a 12-h light-dark cycle. Guinea pig anti-insulin, mouse anti-glucagon (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal anti-pancreatic α-amylase antibodies (Calbiochem) were used at a 1:1,000 dilution for immunohistochemistry. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of IGF1R was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used at a 1:1,000 dilution and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Anti- BrdUrd antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:1,000 dilution followed by detection with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:100 dilution (34Eggenschwiler J. Ludwig T. Fisher P. Leighton P.A. Tilghman S.M. Efstratiadis A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3128-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Mice were fed regular chow ad libitum or fasted for 16 h. Blood was drawn from the retroorbital sinus of anesthetized animals between 0900 and 1100 h. For glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted starting at 1800 for 16 h. Thereafter, mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (2 g/kg body weight). Blood samples were obtained immediately before and at the indicated time points after injection. Glucose levels were measured using a glucometer (Accucheck; Roche Diagnostics). Insulin was measured in plasma samples by radioimmunoassay using a rat insulin standard (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Experiments were carried out in overnight fasted, 4–6-month-old male mice. Animals were anesthetized by the intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg), and human insulin (5 units) was injected through the inferior vena cava. Extracts of liver and hindlimb muscles (gluteus and soleus) were prepared as described (32Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and measurements of PI 3-kinase activity in skeletal muscle were performed as described previously (32Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Pancreata were removed from adult mice, cleared of fat and spleen, weighed, and fixed overnight in Bouin's solution. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, and consecutive 5-μm sections were mounted on slides (32Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Sections at 200-μm intervals were immunostained with various antibodies used at the dilutions indicated above. The cross-sectional area of the pancreas was covered systematically by accumulating images from a series of non-overlapping fields at a ×40 magnification. Images were recorded on a digital camera Nikon Coolpix 950 (Nikon) and analyzed using the “image analysis” macro of the NIH Image software, version 1.60. Areas corresponding to the whole pancreas, α- and β-cells were measured by manual tracing of the acquired images. α- and β-cell areas were calculated by dividing the area of glucagon (α-cells) and insulin-positive (β-cells) immunoreactivity by whole pancreas area (32Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To measure pancreatic size, E18.5 embryos were sacrificed; the abdominal cavity was cut open to facilitate tissue fixation, and serial transverse abdominal sections covering the entire pancreatic length were obtained. Total pancreatic size was estimated from the number of pancreas-containing sections, because pancreatic weights could not be reliably ascertained due to the small size of some mutant embryos. However, total embryo weight could be used to normalize the various comparisons, as we have shown that in normal embryos the total number of pancreatic sections obtained correlated with whole embryo weight (r 2 = 0.8, p < 0.001). Three sections, spaced at least 50 μm apart, were chosen for morphometric measurements. To closely match the position of these sections among different genotypes, we used the duodenum, liver, and spine as reference points. Three non-overlapping microscopic fields at low magnification (×10) were scored on each section, and four to six embryos were analyzed per genotype. Islet area was defined as the sum of α- and β-cells areas after staining with insulin and glucagon antisera, respectively, because the number of somatostatin- and pancreatic polypeptide-positive cells was too small to be quantitated reliably. Pregnant females were injected intraperitoneally with BrdUrd (100 mg/kg body weight) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (6.7 mg/kg body weight) at E18.5 and sacrificed 1 h later. Embryos were dissected, fixed, and analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-BrdUrd antibody as described (34Eggenschwiler J. Ludwig T. Fisher P. Leighton P.A. Tilghman S.M. Efstratiadis A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3128-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The number of BrdUrd-positive and total nuclei within a microscopic field was determined using the “cell counting” macro of the NIH Image 1.60 software. Ten sections from three different WT animals and eight sections from three differentIgf1−/−Igf2+/p−mice were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were calculated using the Statsview software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). To determine the consequences of ablation of INSR or IGF1R signaling on pancreatic development, we analyzed the morphology, size, and composition of pancreata in embryos lacking INSR, IGF1R, or both. Embryos were examined at embryonic day E18.5, corresponding to the developmental stage in which aggregation of endocrine cells into distinct islet structures was first recognizable (35Kim S.K. Hebrok M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A representative immunohistochemical analysis for markers of endocrine (insulin) and exocrine (amylase) differentiation is shown in Fig.1, a andb. As we have shown in the past, mutations of the IGF signaling system result in embryonic growth retardation. Thus, the approximate weights of mutant embryos relative to normal wereInsr−/− 90% (16Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar),Igf1r−/− 45% (14Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2560) Google Scholar), andInsr−/−Igf1r−/−30% (16Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The weight values were used to normalize pancreatic sizes, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and expressed in arbitrary units (Fig. 1 c). This morphometric analysis indicated that the normalized total pancreatic size inInsr−/− embryos was similar to WT controls, whereas it was increased by ∼2-fold inIgf1r−/− and was decreased by ∼50% inInsr−/−Igf1r−/−embryos (Fig. 1 c). Immunostaining with anti-amylase antiserum indicated that the decrease in pancreatic size observed in the double nullizygous embryos could be accounted for by a decrease of exocrine pancreatic size (Fig. 1 b) (p < 0.05 by ANOVA). In contrast, α- and β-cell areas, as assessed by immunohistochemistry with anti-insulin and anti-glucagon antisera, were not significantly different from WT in Insr−/−and Igf1r−/− embryos (Fig. 1 d). In double mutant embryos, however, relative α- and β-cell areas were increased ∼3-fold, as a result of the decreased area of exocrine pancreas (Fig. 1 d). The α/β-cell area ratio within islets was unchanged in all embryos exceptIgf1r−/−, in which a 60% increase in the relative area of α-cells was detected (p < 0.05 by ANOVA). Notably, islet architecture appeared to be disrupted in doubleInsr−/−Igf1r−/−mutants, apparently as result of the overall impairment of exocrine pancreas development.Figure 1Pancreatic morphology and morphometry in E18.5 embryos with Insr and Igf1rmutations. Pancreatic sections were processed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunohistochemistry was performed either with anti-insulin (a) or anti-amylase antibodies (b), and a representative section is shown. c, evaluation of total pancreatic size was performed by measuring pancreatic area in transverse abdominal sections and dividing the result by embryo weight.

The ratio of α/β-cells was calculated by counting nuclei of insulin- and glucagon-positive cells within each islet. An asterisk denotes a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in β-cell or α-cell area betweenInsr−/−Igf1r−/− and WT, Insr−/− andIgf1r−/− mice, and in α/β-cell ratio between Igf1r−/− and WT,Insr−/− andInsr−/−Igf1r−/− mice. Values represent means ± S.E. derived from three sections for each embryo and four to six animals for each genotype. α/β-Cell ratio was determined by counting nuclei in ∼100 islets/genotype.e, hematoxylin and eosin-stained pancreatic sections from mice with the genotypes indicated were analyzed using the NIH Image 1.60 software to determine the diameters of exocrine acini (e) and endocrine islets (f). The maximal apparent diameter was manually traced and measured using the image analysis macro. The number of acini and islets analyzed for each genotype is indicated. For each genotype, three animals were analyzed in three sections 50 μm apart. For each section, three microscopic fields were scored. *, p < 0.05 by ANOVA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These analyses indicated that, in Insr−/−embryos, pancreatic acinar size is reduced proportionately to body weight (isometric change). However, inIgf1r−/− and double nullizygous embryos the relationship of pancreatic size to body size was altered in opposite directions (i.e. increased and decreased, respectively; allometric changes). To obtain an absolute measure of exocrine pancreatic size (i.e. independently of body size), we measured islet and acinar diameters in pancreata of each genotype. Mean acinar diameter was reduced by ∼40% inInsr−/−Igf1r−/−embryos, as compared with wild-type mice, with no changes in the two types of single mutants (Fig. 1 e). In contrast, islet diameter was similar in all four genotypes (Fig. 1 f). These data indicate that exocrine pancreas growth is selectively blunted inInsr−/−Igf1r−/−embryos. Because of the known interaction of IGF2 with both IGF1R and INSR, the decrease of pancreatic exocrine tissue in double mutantsInsr−/−Igf1r−/−, but not in single Insr−/− orIgf1r−/− mutant embryos, is consistent with the hypothesis that acinar tissue growth is mediated by the IGF2 ligand (16Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Because the mutational consequences of the lack of IGF2 begin manifesting at E12.5 and precede those due to lack of IGF1 by 1 embryonic day (33Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar), we examined pancreatic development in E12.5 embryos. Interestingly, the change in pancreatic size was already apparent at this early stage, consistent with an IGF2-dependent effect (Fig.2). For further verification, we examined embryos lacking both IGF1 and IGF2 ligands, and we showed that they are phenotypically indistinguishable in their histopathology fromInsr−/−Igf1r−/−mice. Thus, they display normal endocrine pancreas architecture but a decrease of exocrine pancreatic size (Fig.3 a). Because loss of IGF function results in reduced cell proliferation (36Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we examined the proliferation potential ofIgf1−/−Igf2+/p−mice using BrdUrd labeling. The ratio of BrdUrd-positive cells to total number of cells scored inIgf1−/−Igf2+/p−mice was reduced by 35% (p < 0.04), consistent with previous observations (36Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 b). We next examined adult mice with heterozygous Igf1r mutations, either alone or in combination with Insr heterozygous mutations. Determination of body weights at different postnatal ages indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between WT and Insr+/− mutant mice or betweenIgf1r+/− and double heterozygousInsr+/−Igf1r+/− mutant mice. In agreement with the results of a detailed analysis of post-natal growth of Igf1r+/−mice, 3E. Chiao and A. Efstratiadis, unpublished results. we observed that the relative weights of mice carrying the heterozygous Igf1rmutation, alone or in combination with Insr heterozygosity, was ∼85% of WT (Fig. 4 a). Accordingly, we conclude that there is growth haploinsufficiency of IGF1R function, which is not aggravated by concomitant heterozygosity for Insr. Haploinsufficiency results from a gene dosage effect, as evidenced by the decrease in the expression of IGF1R, at least as assayed in muscle extracts (Fig. 4 b). To determine the metabolic effects of the combined Insr/Igf1r mutations, various parameters were analyzed in 6-month-old mice. Insulin levels were measured in the fasted and fed states (Fig.5, a andb). Igf1r+/− mice had normal insulin levels. In contrast, insulin levels inInsr+/− mice were 1.8- and 2.9-fold higher than in fasted and fed WT mice, respectively. CombinedInsr+/−Igf1r+/−mutations caused a further increase to 2.2- and 4.5-fold higher than WT (p < 0.05 by ANOVA versus WT andIg1r+/−). To examine the effect of these mutations on pancreatic islets, we performed immunohistochemistry of pancreatic sections with anti-insulin and anti-glucagon antisera to analyze islet morphology and morphometry. Islets were moderately enlarged in Insr+/− andInsr+/−Igf1r+/− mice compared with WT mice. Insulin (Fig. 5 h) and glucagon (not shown) immunoreactivities were unevenly distributed within islets, consistent with altered islet architecture, as typically seen in insulin-resistant states (32Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Mean β-cell area in 4-week-oldIgf1r+/− mice was similar to WT mice. In contrast, Insr+/− andInsr+/−Igf1r+/−mice showed a 1.7- and 1.9-fold increase in β-cell area, respectively (p < 0.05 by ANOVA) (Fig. 5 c). In addition, we observed an altered distribution of islets size, with an increase in the ratio of “large” islets to total islet number from 14% (WT) to 23 and 30% in Insr+/− andInsr+/−Igf1r+/− mice, respectively (p < 0.05 by ANOVA) (Fig. 5 d). These results indicate that Igf1r haploinsufficiency is associated with normal β-cell area and that combined haploinsufficiency in Insr+/−Igf1r+/− mice does not result in significant alterations of β-cell area compared with single heterozygous Insr+/− mice. Fasting glucose levels were maintained within a normal range in all mice (Fig. 5 e). Measurements of glucose levels in the fed state indicated that ∼10% ofInsr+/−Igf1r+/− mice had developed diabetes (defined as an elevation of glucose values more than the mean + 2 S.D. on at least two separate measurements), as had 1 of 10 Insr+/− mice analyzed in this cross (Fig. 5 f). These data are consistent with larger data sets reported in previous analyses (3Lauro D. Kido Y. Castle A.L. Zarnowski M.J. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Accili D. Nat.

An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test showed thatInsr+/− and Igf1r+/−mice had normal glucose tolerance.

While human TSG101 is located in a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity can be detected in a variety of cancers, no genomic deletion in TSG101 gene has been reported, casting a doubt on the role of TSG101 as a classical tumor suppressor. Some studies have revealed that TSG101 is a frequent target of splicing defects, which correlate with cellular stress and p53 status. Furthermore, recent reports have identified TSG101 as a part of the MDM2/p53 regulatory circuitry, a well-recognized circuitry that upon deregulation results in tumorigenesis. Interestingly, overexpression of tsg101 from an adventitious promoter also leads to neoplastic transformation. On the basis of this information, we have analysed TSG101 gene expression in 20 human papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) by immunohistochemistry and demonstrated that the overexpression of TSG101 protein is closely associated with human PTCs. Further sequence analysis reveals no mutation in cDNA region encoding steadiness box in these PTC specimens, indicating that the upregulation of TSG101 protein is not caused by the alteration of this region. In situ hybridization analysis confirms that overexpression of TSG101 also occurs at the transcriptional level. In addition, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and subsequent Southern hybridization verify that the amounts of TSG101 transcripts are indeed lower in three normal thyroid tissues than in PTC specimens. Here we report the upregulation of TSG101 expression in PTC cells, providing the first evidence of the association of TSG101 overexpression with human tumors and suggesting that upregulation of TSG101 steady-state level might play a role in mediating tumorigenesis of human PTC."

Here, we show that the T cell receptor-beta (TCRbeta) gene, which acquires in-frame nonsense codons at high frequency during normal lymphocyte development, gives rise to an alternatively spliced transcript [alternative messenger RNA (alt-mRNA)] that skips the offending mutations that generate such nonsense codons. This alt-mRNA is up-regulated by a transfer RNA-dependent scanning mechanism that responds specifically to mutations that disrupt the reading frame. The finding that translation signals regulate the levels of alternatively spliced mRNAs generated in the nucleus may alter the current view of how gene expression is controlled in eukaryotic cells."

Therefore, it is of vital importance to understand how a receptor and its cognate modifying enzyme(s) modulate each other through specific protein-protein interactions. In the chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, adaptation requires methylation of chemoreceptors (e.g.Tar) catalyzed by the CheR methyltransferase. CheR binds to the C-terminal NWETF sequence of a chemoreceptor that is distinct from the methylation sites. However, little is known about how CheR recognizes its methylation sites or how it is distributed in a cell. In this study, we used comparative genomics to demonstrate that the CheR chemotaxis methyltransferase contains three structurally and functionally distinct modules: (i) the catalytic domain common to a methyltransferase superfamily; (ii) the N-terminal domain; and (iii) the β-subdomain of the catalytic domain, both of which are found exclusively in chemotaxis methyltransferases. The only evolutionary conserved motif specific to CheR is the positively charged face of helix α2 in the N-terminal domain. The disulfide cross-linking analysis suggested that this face interacts with the methylation helix of Tar. We also demonstrated that CheR localizes to receptor clusters at cell poles via interaction of the β-subdomain with the NWETF sequence.

These initial responses often diminish during persisting stimulation. The latter process, termed adaptation or desensitization, is essential for the detection of temporal changes of stimuli and/or the highly sensitive detection of stimuli over a comprehensive range. Covalent modifications of a receptor are often required for adaptation. In such cases, it is of vital importance to understand a regulated interplay between a receptor and modifying enzyme(s), including their mutual recognition and their subcellular localization, that assures spatially and temporally organized information processing. Molecular mechanisms of adaptation have been well characterized in the chemotaxis of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (1Manson M.D. Adv. Microbial.

Physiol. 1999; 41: 229-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane chemoreceptors, also known as the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs),1 are methylated by the S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) CheR and demethylated by the methylesterase CheB. In the resting state, an MCP is in equilibrium between methylation and demethylation. An attractant shifts the equilibrium toward methylation and a repellent toward demethylation. Each MCP has 4–5 glutamate residues located in two separate α helices (the first and second methylation helices (MH1 and MH2)) in the cytoplasmic domain (7Bass R.B. Falke J.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). CheR has to recognize these residues (i.e. the substrate sites), but this interaction between CheR and an MCP has not been detected to date probably because it is weak and/or transient. In contrast, binding of CheR to the C-terminal pentapeptide sequence (NWETF) of the two high abundance receptors, the serine chemoreceptor Tsr and the aspartate chemoreceptor Tar, has been well characterized (9Wu J., Li, J., Li, G. Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4984-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Okumura H. Nishiyama S. Sasaki A. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J.

Homma M. Kawagishi I. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the low abundance chemoreceptors (the ribose-galactose transducer Trg and the dipeptide transducer Tap) do not have the sequence, indicating that the binding of CheR to the NWETF sequence might not be essential for its catalytic activity itself. The three-dimensional structure of CheR of S. typhimuriumrevealed that the monomeric protein consists of two domains (the N-terminal domain with no assigned function and the MTase domain) and one subdomain (the β-subdomain) (13Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The co-crystal of CheR and the pentapeptide revealed that the β-subdomain binds to the NWETF sequence (11Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the NWETF sequence of Tar demonstrated that it binds to CheR mainly through hydrophobic interaction (12Shiomi D. Okumura H. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the CheR molecule is oriented when it binds to a chemoreceptor, nor how the NWETF sequence is oriented relative to the other part of the chemoreceptor molecule. Recently, subcellular localization of some proteins involved in chemotactic signal transduction (MCPs and Che proteins) has been studied using immunoelectron and immunofluorescence microscopy and YFP fusion proteins (14Maddock J.R.

These studies demonstrated that MCPs cluster with the histidine kinase CheA and the adaptor protein CheW at cell poles. The localization and the clustering depend, at least to some extent, on CheA and CheW, but not on CheR or CheB. The localization and clustering of the chemotactic machinery at cell poles are proposed to be essential for amplification of input signals and for efficient methylation. The latter hypothesis assumes a high local concentration of CheR around the receptor/kinase cluster to provide a molecular basis of efficient methylation of both high abundance and low abundance receptors.

Moreover, the information about the structure-function relation of CheR was limited although the three-dimensional structure of S. typhimurium CheR has been determined in the absence and presence of the NWETF peptide (11Djordjevic S.

In this study, we took advantage of comparative genomic analysis to identify evolutionary conserved and therefore structurally and functionally important residues in the CheR protein family. Mutagenesis of some conserved residues in E. coli CheR demonstrated that some of them are functionally important. Characterization of GFP-CheR revealed that CheR localizes to cell poles through the interaction between its β-subdomain and the NWETF sequence of the chemoreceptor. Disulfide cross-linking assay was employed to examine the interaction between CheR and Tar and demonstrated that the positively charged residues in helix α2 of CheR are involved in the recognition of MH1. Thus, CheR interacts with the chemoreceptor through two distinct chemotaxis-specific modules to achieve efficient adaptation. BLAST searches (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J.

For the tight regulation of CheR proteins (i.e. CheR, His6-CheR, and GFP-CheR proteins), the coding regions were placed downstream of thearaBAD promoter on vector pBAD24. For the expression of MBP-Tar, the 3′ region of tar (encoding the cytoplasmic domain, i.e. residues 215–553) was introduced into the vector pMAL-c2. Swarm assays were performed essentially as described previously (10Okumura H. Nishiyama S. Sasaki A. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J.

HCB436 cells carrying pLC113 encoding wild-type Tar, pLC113-W550Op encoding Tar-N*, or the vector pACYC184 were further transformed with pBR322-based plasmids encoding the GFP-CheR fusion proteins. Cells were grown in TG medium containing appropriate antibiotics and inducers with vigorous shaking at 30 °C, harvested at late exponential phase, washed twice with MLM (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mmdl-lactate, 0.1 mm methionine), and resuspended in MLM. A small aliquot of the cell suspension was spotted onto slide glasses coated with 0.5% agarose and was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX50). The images were recorded and processed by using a digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, C4742-95) and imaging software (Scanalytics, IP Lab version 3.2). HCB1262 cells expressing any of the His6-tagged CheR proteins were suspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, and sonicated in short pulses (10 s each) on ice. After low speed (17,000 × gat 4 °C for 10 min) and high speed (100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min) centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). Each His6-tagged CheR protein was eluted with 250 mmimidazole. HCB1262 cells expressing MBP-Tar-E308C were suspended in 2 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, and sonicated in short pulses on ice. After low speed and high speed centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to the amylose column (New England BioLabs). MBP-Tar-E308C was eluted with 10 mm maltose. Each His6-tagged CheR protein and MBP-Tar-E308C were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm I2. The mixture was divided into two aliquots, which were boiled at 100 °C for 3 min with or without 2-mercaptoethanol and were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-CheR serum (12Shiomi D. Okumura H. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Mol.

The first antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (New England BioLabs) at the dilution of 1:3000 and with an ECL detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). Initial analysis of the domain architecture of the CheR protein identified not only homologous CheR proteins from a variety of species, but also several types of multidomain proteins with a core domain corresponding to that of CheR. (Fig1). Position-specific iterative BLAST searches with the N-terminal domain (residues 1–90) of S. typhimurium CheR (13Djordjevic S. Stock A.M.

Searches with the catalytic domain (residues 91–286) retrieved sequences of nonchemotactic AdoMet-dependent MTases, including DNA MTases and rRNA dimethyltransferases, from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Figs. 1 and 2 B): hundreds of functionally divergent MTases were identified in the third and forth iterations with a high degree of statistical significance (expectation valueE ranged from 10−4 to 10−8).Figure 2Multiple sequence alignments of the CheR-specific N-terminal domain (A) and a portion of the MTase (catalytic) domain including the β-subdomain (B). Each sequence is identified by the NCBI gene identification number or by the sequencing center preliminary identification number (shown in thelast column). The secondary structure (E for β-sheets and H for α-helices) shown above the alignments is based on the known three-dimensional structure ofS. typhimurium CheR. The signature sequence involved in binding to AdoMet (44Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol.

FrzF of Myxococcus xanthus, a known functional CheR homolog (39Sogaard-Andersen L. Kaiser D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2675-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), contains several tetratrico peptide repeats in its C terminus. Tetratrico peptide repeats is thought to facilitate protein-protein interactions in various signal transduction proteins (40Lamb J.R. Tuqendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 41Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). An unusual fusion protein containing catalytic domains of methylesterase and MTase as well as several PAS domains that may also facilitate protein-protein interactions (42Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been identified in several proteobacterial species, e.g. in Sinorhizobium meliloti (Fig. 1). Finally, a CheR-like protein from spirochetes lacks the N-terminal domain of a classical CheR, but instead has a CheW domain in its N terminus. The CheW protein is known to directly interact with MCPs (43Liu J.D. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8703-8707Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments of the N-terminal CheR-specific domains (Fig. 2 A) revealed a conservation pattern centered on hydrophobic and turn-like residues comprising α-helices. Residue Gly-39, which determines a crucial turn following helix α1, is strictly conserved in all CheR homologs. The only two other positions where strict conservation occurs are positively charged residues Lys/Arg-46 and Arg-53 of helix α2. Such strict conservation of a positive charge across long evolutionary distances clearly indicates functional significance, especially for Arg-53. Catalytic domains from most AdoMet-dependent MTases, including CheR, share a signature sequence (G/A)X(G/A/S)XG (Fig. 2 B) involved in the binding of AdoMet (44Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the β-subdomain is present in all CheR homologs and CheR-related proteins, such as PilK, FrzF, CheW3, and Smb20515, but is missing from all nonchemotactic single-domain MTases, such as COQ3 (Figs. 1 and2 B). This finding is consistent with the functional role of the β-subdomain, i.e. interaction with MCPs (11Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CheR proteins from all chemotactic species retain the β-subdomain, although in many species all MCPs lack the NWETF-type sequence (data not shown). On the other hand, residues His-192 and Arg-197 of S. typhimurium CheR, which interact with the Trp residue of the NWETF pentapeptide (11Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and residue Arg-187, which forms a salt bridge with the Glu residue of the pentapeptide (11Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), are absent from many CheR homologs (Fig. 2 B). We replaced some conserved residues of E. coli CheR by Ala or Glu. The resulting mutant proteins were expressed in strain RP4944 (ΔCheR) at levels similar to that of wild-type CheR (data not shown). Swarming abilities of these transformants were examined (Fig.3 A). RP4944 cells expressing either MTase domain mutants (R98A or D154A) failed to swarm, as expected. Among the β-subdomain mutations, H192A, R197A, and H192A/R197A significantly slowed the swarming rate. The defects in swarming were suppressed by the overproduction of these three mutant CheR proteins (data not shown). Thus, these three mutations may decrease the affinity of CheR for an MCP, consistent with the crystallographic study (11Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which suggested that His-192 and Arg-197 interact with the Trp residue of the pentapeptide sequence. In contrast, R187A and R187E did not affect the ability of CheR to support swarming. Residue Arg-187 is suggested to form a salt bridge with the Glu residue of the NWETF sequence (11Djordjevic S. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the E551A mutation ofE. coli Tar had little effect on its methylation (1"

Intracranial injections of synthetic β-amyloid peptide (Aβ42) in transgenic mice expressing the Alzheimer's disease-causing Swedish APP double mutations increased neuronal levels of neprilysin, a metalloendopeptidase that degrades Aβ42 in vivo, on mRNA and protein level. This increase was associated with significant reductions in brain levels of Aβ and with almost complete prevention of amyloid plaque formation throughout the brain. In addition, astrogliosis normally associated with amyloidosis was significantly reduced. Our results suggest that up-regulation of neprilysin in brain may represent an opportunity to reduce or prevent amyloid plaque formation in vivo.

Therefore, reducing Aβ production in brain or the activation of mechanisms that accelerate its clearance from brain has become major targets for the development of drugs designed to reduce amyloid plaque formation and ameliorate AD pathology (1Iwata N.

We report here that Aβ42 aggregates caused sustained increases in brain levels of NEP and that these increases were associated with dramatically reduced brain concentrations of Aβ as well as with prevention of brain amyloid plaque formation and reduced astrogliosis. Transgenic mice expressing the AD-causing Swedish double mutant of the human APP (SwAPP) were generated and bred as described previously (18Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C.

All mice used in this study were the progeny of a single SwAPP male cross-bred to non-transgenic (non-tg) littermates. The colony was housed under a light cycle of 12 h with dry food and water ad libitum. The presence of the transgene was determined by PCR on genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies using specific primers 5′-GTG GAT AAC CCC TCC CCC AGC CTA GAC CA-3′ and 5′-CTG ACC ACT CGA CCA GGT TCT GGG T-3′ to the transgene (18Hsiao K.K.

Fibrillar aggregated synthetic Aβ42 was prepared by resuspending lyophilized Aβ42 (Bachem) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, by shaking for 48 h at 37 °C. At 11 weeks of age, SwAPP (n = 5) and non-tg littermates (n = 4) were anesthetized, 1 μl of fibrillar Aβ42 (350 μm stock concentration) was stereotaxically injected unilaterally into the parietal cortex −1.7-mm anterior, 1-mm lateral, and 1-mm ventral to the bregma above the hippocampus within 1 min (20Franklin K.B.J. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). After the injection, the needle was left in place for one more minute and then was slowly withdrawn over a period of 1 min. Control groups consisted of SwAPP mice and non-tg mice that received PBS injections (n = 4 each). In a second set of experiments, we used C57BL/6 mice purchased from RCC Ltd. Biotechnology & Animal Breeding (Füllingsdorf, Switzerland) at the age of 6 weeks and housed for 5 weeks in our animal facility. At 11 weeks of age, these mice received bilateral injections of Aβ42, reversed Aβ42-peptide (Aβ42R, Bachem, aggregated as described for Aβ42), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1.61 mg/ml), or PBS as described above and were sacrificed 1, 3, 12, and 20 weeks post-injection for combined analysis of mRNA and protein levels (n = 4 for each group and time). For combined Aβ-ELISA and immunohistochemistry, SwAPP and non-tg littermates injected with Aβ42 aggregates or PBS were deeply anesthetized 20 weeks following the injections by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture containing 60 μg/g Ketaminol (Veterina, Zurich, Switzerland) and 20 μg/g Rompun (Provet, Lyssach, Switzerland) body weight and were perfused transcardially using ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and post-fixed in the same solution overnight. Tissue was washed several times in PBS, and the caudal parts of the brains reaching from interaural 0 to −1 excluding the cerebellum (20Franklin K.B.J. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar) were dissected and prepared for Aβ-ELISA. The remaining parts of the brain containing both hippocampi were embedded in paraffin and processed for IHC. 5-μm thick paraffin sections were probed with antibodies against Aβ (4G8 and 6E10, Serotec; 6H1 and 9G10, Evotec), NEP, IDE, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), 24.15 protein, and GFAP according to providers' protocols and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Sigma). For combined Western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR, mice were killed and the frontal parts of the brain containing interaural region 6–4 were processed immediately for RNA isolation. The rest of the brains excluding the cerebellum were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, and 1× Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture, pH = 8 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), for Western blotting as described previously (1Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Watanabe K. Sekiguchi M. Hosoki E. Kawashima-Morishima M. Lee H.J. Hama E. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Saido T.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by the peqGOLD RNAPureTM kit (Axon Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. NEP mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR performed on total RNA in the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) using the NEP-specific primers 5′-TAA GCA GCC TCA GCC GAA ACT ACA A-3′ and 5′-GAC TAC AGC TGC TCC ACT TAT CCA CTC A-3′ and CYBRGreen (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the reaction mixture. As a standard, mRNA levels of β-actin was amplified in same samples using 5′-TGG AAC GGT GAA GGT GAC A-3′ and 5′-GGC AAG GGA CTT CCT GTA A-3′ primers. The levels of NEP mRNA were normalized to the corresponding amount of β-actin mRNA in each mouse. The average was calculated for each group and compared with levels of uninjected mice for each time point. Protein concentration of brain extracts were determined with the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were loaded to each lane of a Novex 10–20% Tricine/SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). After the electrophoresis, proteins were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (AmershamBiosciences). Membranes were probed for NEP using the monoclonal antibody 56C6 at a dilution of 1:75. Blots were stripped in a buffer containing 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min and probed for β-actin (1:5000) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:1000) as loading controls. Similar blots were probed with IDE-1 (1:500), ACE (1:200), and the polyclonal antibody to 24.15 protein (1:600). The antibodies to NEP, ACE, GFAP, β-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Novacastra, QED Bioscience, InnoGenex, Abcam, and Biodesign, respectively. The polyclonal antibody to IDE (IDE-1) was a gift from Drs. Vekrellis and Selkoe (11Vekrellis K., Ye, Z. Qiu W.Q. Walsh D. Hartley D. Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the antibodies to 24.15 protein were gifts from Dr. C. Abraham (12Yamin R. Malgeri E.G. Sloane J.A. McGraw W.T. Abraham C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18777-18784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For quantitation of Aβ content in mouse brain, protein extracts of brain tissue reaching from the stereotaxic coordinates interaural 0 to interaural −1 were prepared. This area lies outside of the site of the brain that was injected with Aβ42. Tissue samples were homogenized in a 25-fold wet weight amount of 70% formic acid, homogenates were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and supernatant fluids were neutralized by adding the 20-fold volume of 1 mTris base. To measure the total content of brain Aβ, microtiter plates (Maxi Sorb, Nunc, Belgium) were coated with 150 μl of monoclonal mouse antibody 22C4 directed against the C terminus of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (amino acids 30–42) at a concentration of 20 μg/ml PBS. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA, 1% gelatin in 100 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6, for 4 h at 37 °C and washed three times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. 150-μl diluted samples or standards (Aβ40, Bachem) were incubated overnight, washed, and detected with biotinylated monoclonal mouse antibody 6H1 directed against amino acids 1–17 of human Aβ (Evotec), incubated at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in blocking buffer for 4 h at 37 °C, and visualized with a peroxidase reaction using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate and detected at 450 nm. The linear range (r 2 ≤ 0.99) of the used ELISA system was between 2.5 and 100 ng of Aβ/ml. Serial dilutions of samples were used for measurements in the linear range. In parallel, the concentrations of Aβ42 in each sample were determined using a commercially available kit (Innogenetics) according to provider's instructions. Blood was taken from the tail veins at the times of injections and before sacrificing the mice. Anti-Aβ antibody titers were measured by incubating of serial dilutions of blood sera on Aβ42-coated microplates that were blocked with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5% milk powder, and 0.1% Tween-20 and washed three times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. Serum samples were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C while shaking. Serial dilutions of monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 were used as positive control. Plates were washed four times and incubated with goat anti-mouse biotinylated IgG (heavy and light) antibody (Vector Laboratories) in PBS with 1% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were then washed four times and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. After five washes, plates were incubated with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine for 5 min at room temperature, and the reactions were stopped with 1 m sulfuric acid. Optical densities were read at 450 nm in a microplate reader (Victor2 Multilabel, EG&G Wallac, Turku, Finland). Brain protein extracts were dialyzed against 4000 volumes of PBS for 24 h at 4 °C by using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce) with a 10-kDa cut off. Three independent samples of 10 μg of protein from each brain were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μmZ-Ala-Ala-Leu-p-nitroanilide (ZAAL-pNA, Bachem) in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2. Thereafter, 0.4 milliunits of leucine aminopeptidase (Sigma) were added to the reaction mixtures, incubated for additional 20 min at 37 °C (21Shirotani K. Tsubuki S. Iwata N. Takaki Y. Harigaya W. Maruyama K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. Iwata H. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Saido T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21895-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and optical densities were measured at 405 nm. To inhibit NEP and related enzyme activities, 10 μm thiorphan (Sigma) was added for 5 min at room temperature before the addition of ZAAL-pNA (21Shirotani K. Tsubuki S. Iwata N. Takaki Y. Harigaya W. Maruyama K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. Iwata H. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Saido T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21895-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Data were collected by investigators blinded to the genotype and treatment of the mice and were analyzed by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests. To determine whether Aβ42 is involved in the regulation of NEP levels in vivo, we injected 1 μl of PBS or a suspension of aggregated synthetic Aβ42 into the brains of SwAPP mice and non-tg littermates and analyzed NEP by immunohistochemistry. Strongly stained NEP-immunopositive neurons were present at 20 weeks following one single injection of Aβ42 (Fig. 1). In these mice, NEP immunoreactivity was high in cellular compartments of many pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex in all cortical layers (Fig. 1,b, d, i, and k) and in the cell bodies of pyramidal hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1, f,h, j, and l). In contrast, neuronal NEP staining was weak and diffused in cerebral cortex (Fig. 1,a and c) and hippocampus (Fig. 1, eand g) of non-tg littermates (Fig. 1, a ande) and SwAPP mice (Fig. 1, c and g) injected with PBS. Together these data show that Aβ42injections increased neuronal levels of NEP protein in most brain regions. For detailed analysis of tissue levels of NEP, we injected wild type mice bilaterally with Aβ42 and analyzed them by Western blotting at 1, 3, 12, and 20 weeks following the injections. Control mice were injected with same amounts of Aβ42R, BSA, or were injected with PBS only. The levels of NEP protein were high in all injected groups 1 week after the injections (Fig.2 a). However, three weeks after the injections, 3 of 4 Aβ42-injected mice showed a higher NEP protein level than other injected mice (Fig. 2 a). At 12 weeks post-injection, all Aβ42-injected mice showed higher NEP concentrations in brain tissue (4 of 4) when compared with their control counterparts, whereas at 20 weeks post-injection, 2 of 4 mice that had been injected with Aβ42 exhibited a remarkably higher NEP protein level in the brain (Fig. 2 a). NEP protein levels in the brains of PBS- or BSA-injected groups were similar to Aβ42R group for each time point (data not shown). The persistent elevation of NEP levels was specific to Aβ42-injected mice, because none of the control injected mice showed elevated NEP protein at 3 weeks post-injection or later (Fig. 2, a and b). β-Actin (Fig. 2,a and b) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (data not shown) Western blotting was performed for all groups as loading controls giving identical results. We next tested the NEP enzymatic activity in brain homogenates of mice 20 weeks after the injections using the ZAAL-pNA peptide as the substrate (21Shirotani K. Tsubuki S. Iwata N. Takaki Y. Harigaya W. Maruyama K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. Iwata H. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Saido T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21895-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This assay revealed significantly higher NEP activities in brains that had been injected previously with Aβ42 and that had higher brain levels of NEP on Western blots. The NEP enzyme inhibitor thiorphan blocked these increases (Fig. 2 c).Figure 2Aβ42caused a marked increase in NEP levels in injected brains. a, Western blots of all Aβ42 and Aβ42R control-injected wild-type mice are shown. Levels of NEP increased in all injected mice as early as 1 week after the injections. Three weeks after the injections, 3 of 4 mice injected with Aβ42 showed a higher NEP protein level than the control-injected mice. At 12 weeks post-injection, all Aβ42-injected mice expressed a higher amount of NEP in the brain. At 20 weeks after Aβ42 injections, 2 of 4 mice showed significantly higher NEP levels. Note that only Aβ42-injected mice show long term elevated NEP protein levels. b, representative Western blot analysis of mice 12 weeks following the injections. The levels of NEP protein of control mice injected with either Aβ42R-peptide, PBS, or BSA did not differ from that of uninjected mice and was much lower than the Aβ42-injected mice. β-Actin was used to control for equal protein loading. c, twenty weeks after the injections, Aβ42-injected mice with high brain levels of NEP on Western blots exhibited also high NEP peptidase activity in brain protein extracts. This activity was blocked by thiorphan. NEP peptidase activity in brain protein homogenates was measured by using ZAAL-pNA as a substrate in absence or presence of 10 μm thiorphan. Enzymatic NEP activities in brains of Aβ42-injected mice (solid bars) were higher than the activities in brains of two randomly chosen control mice that were injected with the Aβ42R peptide (open bars). Bars represent means ± S.D. of triplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the increases in brain levels of NEP were paralleled by increased levels of NEP message, we analyzed by real time reverse transcription-PCR the NEP mRNA prepared from same mouse brains. One week after injections, the levels of NEP mRNA were 4–5-fold higher in all injected groups when compared with uninjected mice of the same age. This up-regulation was a consistent feature of the Aβ42-injected mice. At 20 weeks post-injection, the mRNA level of NEP in all other groups had dropped to the level of uninjected mice, whereas Aβ42-injected mice showed a 4.9-fold increase in NEP mRNA levels (TableI).Table INEP mRNA levels increased after Aβ42 injectionsAβ42R (± S.D.)PBS (± S.D.)Aβ42 (± S.D.)BSA (± S.D.)Uninjected (± S.D.)%%%%%1 week490 (± 190)490 (± 180)420 (± 110)460 (± 150)100 (± 160)****20 weeks57 (± 290)58 (± 160)490 (± 120)110 (± 200)100 (± 110)n.s.n.s.*n.s.A sustained overexpression of NEP mRNA was observed after Aβ42 injections.

To determine whether the Aβ42-induced increase in neuronal NEP was associated with reduced amyloid plaque formation in transgenic SwAPP mice, we counted the number of brain amyloid plaques stained by immunohistochemistry at 20 weeks after one single injection of Aβ42. Intracranially injected Aβ42 suspension generated 4G8-immunoreactive deposits that were detectable up to 20 weeks following the injections (Fig. 3,d and e, open arrow). As expected, all of the control SwAPP mice (4 of 4) tested at the end of the experiment exhibited numerous amyloid plaques that immunoreacted with the monoclonal antibody 4G8 directed against the amino acids 17–24 of human Aβ (Fig. 3, a–c). In particular, amyloid plaques were abundant throughout the cerebral cortex and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in the hippocampus. Other Aβ-specific antibodies including 6E10, 6H1, and 9G10 gave identical results. In striking contrast, 4 of 5 Aβ42-injected SwAPP mice were free of amyloid plaques at 31 weeks of age or at 20 weeks after the injection (Fig. 3,d–f). These four mice were evaluated further in this study. In these mice, 4G8-immunoreactive material was observed only around the needle tract; this material most probably represented the previous injected aggregated synthetic peptide (Fig. 3, d–e,open arrow). To quantify the numbers of amyloid plaques, we stained every fiftieth coronal section (250 μm apart) of all mice beginning with a random section of the olfactory bulbs. We found only a few 4G8-immunoreactive plaques in SwAPP mice at 20 weeks after Aβ42 injections in addition to marked staining of the fimbria and occasional vascular amyloid deposits (data not shown). Plaque counts showed a significant decrease of average numbers of 4G8-stained amyloid plaques in Aβ42-treated SwAPP mice as compared with control SwAPP littermates (Fig. 4 a). To determine whether the reduced amyloid pathology was associated with reduced concentrations of transgenic Aβ, we measured the Aβ concentrations in brain tissue by a sandwich ELISA that specifically recognized intact human Aβ. No human Aβ was detected by ELISA in wild type mice. Aβ levels measured in control SwAPP mice were significantly higher than in Aβ42-treated SwAPP mice (Fig. 4 b). In parallel, we measured serum levels of total Aβ and Aβ42 in SwAPP mice before and 20 weeks after the injections. We found that neither total Aβ nor Aβ42levels differed among these two time points in any group (data not shown). Because brain amyloidosis in SwAPP mice is accompanied by reactive astrocytosis, we analyzed GFAP-reactive astrocytes in response to Aβ42 injections (Fig.5, a–c). Twenty weeks after injections, GFAP staining of reactive astrocytes was significantly lower in brains of Aβ42-injected SwAPP mice (Fig.5 c) as compared with control SwAPP littermates (Fig.5 b) but significantly higher than in wild type littermates (Fig. 5"

https://openalex.org/W1997227045,"The human P450scc gene is regulated by the tissue-specific orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), which plays a key role in several physiologic processes including steroid synthesis, adrenal and gonadal development, and sexual differentiation. Several studies have demonstrated the interaction of SF-1 with different proteins. However, it is clear that additional factors not yet identified are involved with SF-1 to regulate different target genes. Recently, it was demonstrated that a novel transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kDa (TReP-132) regulates expression of the human P450scc gene. The overexpression of TReP-132 in adrenal cells increases the production of pregnenolone, which is associated with the activation of P450scc gene expression. Considering the colocalization of TReP-132 and SF-1 in steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal and testis, and the presence of two putative LXXLL motifs in TReP-132 that can potentially interact with SF-1, the relationship between these two factors on the P450scc gene promoter was determined. The coexpression of SF-1 and TReP-132 in adrenal NCI-H295 cells cooperates to increase promoter activity. Pull-down experiments demonstrated the interaction between TReP-132 and SF-1, and this was further confirmed in intact cells by coimmunoprecipitation/Western blot and two-hybrid analyses. Deletions and mutations of the TReP-132 cDNA sequence demonstrate that SF-1 interaction requires the LXXLL motif found at the amino-terminal region of the protein. Also, the “proximal activation domain” and the “AF-2 hexamer” motif of SF-1 are involved in interaction with TReP-132. Consistent with previous studies showing interaction between CBP/p300 and SF-1 or TReP-132, the coexpression of these three proteins results in a synergistic effect on P450scc gene promoter activity. Taken together the results in this study identify a novel function of TReP-132 as a partner in a complex with SF-1 and CBP/p300 to regulate gene transcription involved in steroidogenesis.

It is apparent that the cis-acting elements of the 5′-flanking region of the P450scc gene involved in basal and cAMP-dependent regulation are utilized in a developmentally programmed, tissue- and cell type-dependent manner. For example, in human adrenal NCI-H295 cells, the basal transcriptional activity lies within the first 79 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site of the P450scc gene (14Rodriguez H. Hum D.W. Staels B. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the region between −89 and −108 was found to significantly increase promoter activity in human placenta JEG-3 cells (15Moore C.C. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2045-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 16Guo I.C. Huang C. Chung B.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Hum D.W. Aza-Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify tissue-specific transcription factors that regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 hydroxylase genes, two separate groups cloned the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), also known as Ad4BP (18Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lala D.S. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). SF-1 was identified based on its ability to interact with a shared promoter element, PyCAAGGTCA, found in steroid hydroxylase genes and was shown to activate their expression (20Rice D.A. Mouw A.R. Bogerd A.M. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol.

McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 2929-2966Google Scholar). It has subsequently become apparent that SF-1 is a central regulator of the endocrine and reproductive system (For review see Refs. 23Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar and 24Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Front, Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 199-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was shown in mouse and human that SF-1 is expressed at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/gonadal axis, where it is required for the expression of diverse genes that are essential for steroid hormones biosynthesis. For instance, SF-1 is expressed in adrenal and gonadal steroid-producing cells (5Ramayya M.S. Zhou J. Kino T. Segars J.H. Bondy C.A. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1799-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Morohashi K. Hatano O. Nomura M. Takayama K. Hara M. Yoshii H. Takakusu A. Omura T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In these cells, SF-1 was shown to activate the expression of P450 hydroxylases (22Donohoue P. Parker K.L. C M. Scriver C.R.

Lancet. 1993; 341: 461-462Abstract PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and the gene encoding steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) (30Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated that SF-1 is expressed in Sertoli cells, where it participates directly in the process of male sex determination, and synergizes with SOX9 and WT1 in activation of Müllerian inhibitory substance (MIS) gene expression (31Shen W.H. Moore C.C. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 32Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N.

Cell. 1999; 99: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SF-1 is also expressed in pituitary gonadotropes, where it activates the promoter for α-gonadotropin, LH-β, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (24Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Front, Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 199-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the expression of SF-1 in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus is correlated with the synthesis of LH, FSH, and the GnRH receptor (34Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Shinoda K. Lei H. Yoshii H. Nomura M. Nagano M. Shiba H. Sasaki H. Osawa Y. Ninomiya Y. Niwa O. Morohashi K.-I. Li E. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 22-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the role of SF-1 in tissues involved in steroidogenesis and sexual differentiation, targeted SF-1 gene disruption produced knockout mice which completely lacked the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, adrenal glands, and gonads (reviewed in Ref. 23Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Consequently, these developmental defects were associated with phenotypic male-to-female sex reversal and adrenocortical insufficiency, resulting in neonatal death (36Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 37Sadovsky Y. Crawford P.A. Woodson K.G. Polish J.A. Clements M.A. Tourtellotte L.M. Simburger K. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10939-10943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the many studies describing the physiological functions and mechanisms of action of SF-1, it is apparent that additional regulatory mechanisms involving this factor remain to be elucidated. As with other nuclear receptors, different mechanisms, including phosphorylation and interaction with co-regulators, have been shown to regulate basal and cAMP-responsive activity of SF-1. For example, a consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation motif has been identified in SF-1 (38Bakke M. Lund J. Endocr. Res. 1995; 21: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been found to mediate cAMP-responsive P450c17 hydroxylase gene expression (39Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SF-1 has already been shown to be a component of several multiprotein complexes involved in the tissue- and promoter-specific hormonal responses of target genes. For instance, SF-1 interacts with CBP/p300 (40Monté D. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4585-4591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) to activate the P450scc gene promoter. Moreover, it was recently suggested that the c-Jun protein acts synergistically with SF-1 to activate this promoter (41Huang Y., Hu, M. Hsu N. Wang C.L. Chung B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Identifying new factors that interact with SF-1 in protein complexes, and understanding how they function with SF-1 to regulate the P450scc gene will provide important insight into understanding how SF-1 modulates transcription. The transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kDa (TReP-132) was recently cloned and shown to activate the P450scc gene via the 5′-flanking DNA region from nucleotides −155 to −131 (42Gizard F. Lavallee B. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33881-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of the predicted primary structure of TReP-132 revealed motifs characteristic of transcription factors and coactivators, which include regions rich in glutamate, proline, and glutamine residues, as well as two LXXLL motifs, suggesting the interaction of the protein with nuclear receptors (43Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). SF-1 and TReP-132 transcripts colocalize in many tissues, including the testis and adrenal cortex, which is consistent with their functional interaction in steroidogenesis (5Ramayya M.S. Zhou J. Kino T. Segars J.H. Bondy C.A. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1799-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,42Gizard F. Lavallee B. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33881-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This present study addresses the role of TReP-132 in the regulation of the human P450scc gene mediated by SF-1 in human adrenal carcinoma NCI-H295 cells. The overexpression of exogenous TReP-132 in these cells led to increased pregnenolone production, which concurs with the ability of this nuclear protein to increase P450scc expression. Reporter gene assays showed that TReP-132 cooperates with SF-1 to induce P450scc promoter activity; and the proximal SF-1 binding site at position −46 to −38 was sufficient to confer responsiveness to both proteins. The physical interaction between SF-1 and TReP-132 was demonstrated and was shown to involve the LXXLL sequence found at the amino-terminal region of TReP-132 as well as the proximal activation domain and the AF-2 hexamer of SF-1. Considering that p300 was previously shown to interact with SF-1 and TReP-132 to regulate the P450scc gene promoter (40Monté D. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4585-4591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 42Gizard F. Lavallee B. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33881-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), coexpression of these three factors showed cooperativity among them, leading to synergistic activation of the promoter. The results of this study taken together demonstrate the ability of TReP-132 to form a complex with SF-1 and CBP/p300 to regulate gene transcription involved in steroidogenesis. Human NCI-H295 adrenal tumor cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). NCI-H295 were cultured in monolayers as described previously (14Rodriguez H. Hum D.W. Staels B. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with penicillin (50 mg/liter), streptomycin (105 units/liter) (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1% ITS (containing insulin, transferrin, selenium), Roche 1% red phenol, 10−8m, and 10−8m OH-cortisone. The following constructs were made as described by Monté et al. (40Monté D. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4585-4591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar): P450scc luciferase reporter constructs containing fragments of the human P450scc gene spanning from nucleotides −1676, −155, or −110 at the 5′-end to nucleotide +49 at the 3′-end subcloned in pGL3; the construct used to express the GST-SF-1 fusion protein for electrophoretic mobility shift assays; and the construct used to express an SF-1 fusion protein containing a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the carboxyl end (SF-1-HA). The P450scc genomic clone was kindly provided by Dr. Bon-Chu Chung (Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei). The SF-1 expression construct containing the mouse SF-1 cDNA in the pCMV5 expression plasmid was kindly supplied by Dr. Keith L. Parker (University of Southwestern Texas). The TReP-132 mutants TReP-132m1, TReP-132m2, and TReP-132m1–2 were mutated in NR-box 1, NR-box 2, and in both boxes, respectively. Leucines were changed to alanines (see Fig. 4 A for the sequence). The human p300 cDNA in the pCMV-p300-HA and the mouse pCMV-CBP-HA were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences University) (44Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs expressing GST-CBP fusion proteins were supplied by Dr. Ralph Janknecht (Hanover Medical School, Hanover, Germany) (45Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar). The pFR-LUC plasmid, which comprises five GAL4 elements upstream of a minimal E1b TATA-box followed by the luciferase gene, was purchased from Stratagene. The pcDNA3-GAL4 vector was generated as described previously (42Gizard F. Lavallee B. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33881-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) from the pSG424 plasmid (a gift from Dr. Michael R. Green, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Research Laboratories, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). The GAL4-TReP-132 plasmid was created by subcloning a PCR product corresponding to the entire coding region of TReP-132 into the pcDNA3-GAL4 vector. NCI-H295 cells were cultured in 12-well plates at a density of 3 × 105cells/plate and grown for 24 h before transfection. The medium was then changed, and transient transfections were carried out for 12 h. NCI-H295 cells were transfected with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 25 μl of Effectene. Following transfection for 12 h, the cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium for 36 h in NCI-H295 cells. For luciferase assays, cells were harvested, and 20 μl of the cell lysate were assayed for luciferase activities with the Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The efficiency of transfection was verified by green fluorescent protein expression plasmid and efficiencies obtained were 60% or better. NCI-H295 cells were cultured in 60 mm tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 106/plate, grown for 24 h before transfection, and then transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3 or TReP-132. At 24 or 48 h after transfection, two extractions of culture media (5 ml) were performed with 5 ml of ethyl ether, and the organic solution was evaporated under nitrogen. The dried extract was dissolved in 100 μl of isopropanol, and a 10-μl aliquot was diluted with 90 μl of HPLC elution solvent for injection. The HPLC was carried out using the Waters Associates Millenium system (6000-A solvent pump, C-18 Novapack reverse phase column, and model 440 absorbance detector at 205 nm) and isocratic elution at 1 ml/min with acetonitrile-water (1:1). The retention time of the standard pregnenolone was 13.8 min. Results are expressed as nmol/mg protein. NCI-H295 cells were first transfected with pcDNA3 or TReP-132 as described above. Then, total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the levels of P450scc mRNAs were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Next, quantification by Real-Time PCR was performed on a MX 4000 apparatus (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using specific pairs of oligonucleotide primers, 5′-gaggccaccaagaactttttgcccc-3′ and 5′-gatggcatcaatgaatcgctgggc-3′, chosen by using the gene sequence XM_007646. Actin transcripts were quantified simultaneously for normalization using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-gatgacccagatcatgtttga-3′ and 5′-cggatgtcaacgtcacacttcatg-3′. PCR amplification was performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 100 nm each primer, 4 mm MgCl2, the Brilliant Quantitative PCR Core Reagent Kit mix as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene), and SYBR Green 0.33X (Sigma). PCR conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. P450scc mRNA levels were subsequently normalized to actin mRNA levels. SF-1 protein was expressed as a GST fusion protein and was immobilized on glutathione-coupled Sepharose as described (46Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) prior to incubation with radiolabeled TReP-132 protein and washing, also as described previously (40Monté D. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4585-4591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The pGEX2TK-containing GST-SF-1 fusion proteins were transformed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS following induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 28 °C overnight. The [35S]methionine-labeled TReP-132 was synthesized using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate and T7 RNA polymerase system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bound proteins, released from the Sepharose by boiling in SDS sample buffer, were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (200161) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to ascertain that equal amounts of GST proteins were loaded, after which the gels were incubated for 30 min with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by autoradiography. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 × 107 HeLa cells were plated in a 100-mm culture dish and incubated for 24 h. Cells were transfected using Exgen 500 at 40 μl/5 μg of DNA of SF-1 tagged with a HA epitope (SF-1-HA) and 5 μg of TReP-132 tagged with a FLAG epitope (TReP-132-FLAG) or pcDNA3 for 24 h. Immunoprecipitation was performed according to the protocol of Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Cells were collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting cell extract was preincubated for 30 min with a rabbit non-immune antibody (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The quantity of protein in the supernatant was assessed by Bradford assay as instructed by the manufacturer (BioRad, Hercules, CA). 1 mg of protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of the rabbit anti-SF-1 (06-431, Upstate Biotechnology) or non-immune antibody. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to 8–12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-FLAG antiserum (O5-447, Upstate Biotechnology) at a ratio of 1/10,000 as the first antibody. After three washes with 0.2% Tween-20 in PBS, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antisera (1/10,000, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 45 min. Membranes were washed three times with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS then with 2% Tween 20 in 10× TBS and revealed with the Renaissance ECL Plus kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In a previous study it was demonstrated that TReP-132 increases P450scc gene promoter activity (42Gizard F. Lavallee B. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33881-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which would indicate that this transcriptional regulating protein is potentially able to increase steroid synthesis. To confirm that an increased level of TReP-132 can stimulate the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone catalyzed by P450scc, NCI-H295 cells were transfected with a pcDNA3 expression plasmid encoding TReP-132 or with the empty pcDNA3 vector alone. As determined by reverse HPLC, overexpression of exogenous TReP-132 led to an increased level of pregnenolone in the medium of NCI-H295 cells (Fig.1 A). Thus it is apparent that TReP-132 expression increases pregnenolone production in intact human adrenal cells, probably via its positive activity on P450scc gene expression. To determine whether the overexpression of exogenous TReP-132 can indeed increase the level of P450scc transcript, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses was performed on RNA isolated from NCI-H295 cells transfected with the pcDNA3 expression plasmid encoding TReP-132. The overexpression of TReP-132 led to an increased level of P450scc transcript 2.9-fold over that obtained when cells were transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector alone, thus suggesting that TReP-132 increases expression of the human P450scc gene. During characterization of TReP-132, it was demonstrated that this protein can increase the expression of reporter plasmids via the 5′-flanking region of the human P450scc gene. Considering that TReP-132 was isolated based on its ability to interact with the −155/-131 element by screening a human placenta cDNA expression library, this protein was demonstrated to interact with the −155/−131 element in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and to activate promoter activity via this element (42Gizard F. Lavallee B. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33881-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). TReP-132 was shown to activate expression of the P450scc gene promoter via a fragment of the gene from −1676 to +49 (42Gizard F. Lavallee B. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33881-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, our subsequent studies in NCI-H295 cells showed the ability of TReP-132 to activate the −110/+49 sccLuc reporter plasmid which does not have the −155/−131 element but contains a single putative SF-1 binding site at position −46. The primary structure of TReP-132 contains two copies of the LXXLL motif, which is found in transcriptional coregulators and is involved in the interaction with nuclear receptors. Considering that the SF-1 nuclear receptor is an important regulator of P450scc gene expression, the present study has ascertained whether TReP-132 interaction with SF-1 is one mechanism by which TReP-132 can influence promoter activity. Prior to determining the ability of TReP-132 to regulate P450scc gene promoter activity via SF-1 and its binding site at position −46, the relevance of this site was assessed. Previous e"

It has a relatively benign relationship with most hosts but produces severe pathology, including gastric cancer, in others. Identifying the relative contributions of host, microbial, and environmental factors to the outcome of infection has been challenging. Here we describe one approach for identifying microbial genes that affect the magnitude of host responses to infection. Single colony purified H. pylori isolates were obtained from 25 cases and 71 controls in a Swedish case-control study of gastric cancer. Strains were first phenotyped based on their ability to produce adhesins that recognize two classes of human gastric epithelial receptors. Thirteen binding strains and two non-binding controls were then subjected to whole genome genotyping using H. pylori DNA microarrays. A cohort of “variable” genes was identified based on a microarray-determined call of “absent” in at least one member of the strain panel. Each strain was subsequently introduced into two types of germ-free transgenic mice, each programmed to express a different host factor postulated to pose increased risk for development of severe pathology. Expression of biomarkers of host defense was quantitated 4 weeks after inoculation, and the magnitude of the response correlated with bacterial genotype. The proportion of genes encoding HsdS homologs (specificity subunit of hetero-oligomeric type I restriction-modification systems) was significantly higher in the pool of 18 variable genes whose presence directly correlated with a robust host response than their proportion in the remaining 352 members of the variable gene pool. This suggests that the functions of these HsdS homologs may include control of expression of microbial determinants that affect the extent of gastric responses to this potentially virulent pathogen.

The organism is typically acquired in childhood, but the mechanism of transmission remains unclear (1Mitchell H. Mobley H. Mendz G. Hazell S. Helicobacter pylori: Physiology and Genetics. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2001: 7-18Google Scholar). In the absence of antibiotic treatment, H. pylori persists in the gastric ecosystem throughout adulthood. Its relationship with most hosts produces few if any symptoms. However, in a small subset of individuals, severe pathology ensues, ranging from gastric and duodenal ulcers to cancer (2Parsonnet J. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 9: 45-51PubMed Google Scholar). A central challenge has been to identify the relative contributions of host, microbial, and environmental factors to the development of severe pathology versus relatively harmless co-existence. IL-1β and HLA genotypes, and blood group/secretor phenotypes are among the few known host factors that correlate with the development of pathology (3Azuma T. Ito S. Sato F. Yamazaki Y. Miyaji H.

Scott D.R. Sachs G. Science. 2000; 287: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar)). Screening for additional bacterial virulence genes has been problematic for a number of reasons. Isolates from non-family members exhibit a remarkable degree of genetic diversity, manifested by variations in gene order, gene content, and gene sequence (11Alm R.A. Trust T.J. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Salama N. Guillemin K. McDaniel T.K. Sherlock G. Tompkins L. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14668-14673Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The organism is difficult to manipulate genetically. The ability to colonize conventionally raised animal models varies markedly as a function of isolate and host. There are relatively few molecular biomarkers of the host response. Moreover, it has been difficult to monitor bacterial gene expression in vivo (13Rokbi B. Seguin D. Guy B. Mazarin V. Vidor E. Mion F. Cadoz M. Quentin-Millet M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4759-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe an approach for identifying microbial genes that affect the magnitude of host responses to infection. Our strategy incorporates several elements. First, bacterial strains were recovered from patients enrolled in a large, Swedish case-control study of the effects of H. pylori on the development of one severe form of host pathology, gastric cancer (14Enroth H. Kraaz W. Engstrand L. Nyren O. Rohan T. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2000; 9: 981-985PubMed Google Scholar). Second, because attachment ofH. pylori to the gastric epithelium elicits a more robust host inflammatory response in some animal models (15Guruge J.L. Falk P.G. Lorenz R.G. Dans M. Wirth H.P. Blaser M.J. Berg D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 16Syder A.J. Guruge J.L., Li, Q., Hu, Y. Oleksiewicz C.M. Lorenz R.G. Karam S.M. Falk P.G. Gordon J.I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), strains from cases and controls were phenotyped based on their ability to produce adhesins that recognize two classes of human gastric epithelial receptors: (i) Lewisb(Leb)1 that is produced by gastric surface mucous cells in the majority of humans, and (ii) sialylated oncofetal epitopes containing Neuα2,3Galβ1,4 structures that are synthesized by normal gastric epithelial lineage progenitors, by subpopulations of cells in the stomachs of individuals with chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG, a histopathologic state characterized by loss of acid-producing parietal cells and believed to be a precursor to gastric cancer), and by gastric adenocarcinomas (17Sakamoto S. Watanabe T. Tokumaru T. Takagi H. Nakazato H. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 745-752PubMed Google Scholar). Third, strains that bound to one or both gastric epithelial adhesin receptors were subjected to whole genome genotyping using DNA microarrays containing 98.9% of known H. pylori genes (12Salama N. Guillemin K. McDaniel T.K. Sherlock G. Tompkins L. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14668-14673Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Fourth, these genotyped clinical isolates were introduced into two types of germ-free transgenic mice and the magnitude of change in expression of selected genes in their stomachs correlated with the bacterial genotype. Each type of mouse was programmed to express a human host factor postulated to pose increased risk for a more severe outcome of H. pylori infection. α1,3/4FT animals use the human α1,3/4-fucosyltransferase (FT) to express Lewisbreceptors for H. pylori adhesins in their pit and surface mucous cells. With the exception of this engineered Lebexpression in the pit cell lineage, the gastric epithelial cell differentiation programs and acid production appear indistinguishable in α1,3/4FT transgenic and normal littermate animals (15Guruge J.L. Falk P.G. Lorenz R.G. Dans M. Wirth H.P. Blaser M.J. Berg D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).tox176 mice have a genetically engineered ablation of their acid-producing parietal cells mediated by an attenuated diphtheria toxin A fragment (tox176 (16Syder A.J. Guruge J.L., Li, Q., Hu, Y. Oleksiewicz C.M. Lorenz R.G. Karam S.M. Falk P.G. Gordon J.I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). Ablation is associated with development of features of CAG, including loss of acid production (achlorhydria), a block in terminal differentiation of neck to zymogenic cells, and increased proliferation and amplification of NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4-glycan-positive gastric epithelial lineage progenitors (16Syder A.J. Guruge J.L., Li, Q., Hu, Y. Oleksiewicz C.M. Lorenz R.G. Karam S.M. Falk P.G. Gordon J.I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using germ-free animals eliminated one confounding environmental variable, the complex, abundant, and ill-defined indigenous gastric microflora found in conventionally raised coprophagic mice. We reasoned that in the absence of an entrenched microflora, a given clinical isolate should have a greater chance of colonizing a germ-free stomach and that any subsequent host response could be assigned to the inoculated strain. By correlating changes in expression of selected genes in these gnotobiotic transgenic mice with the results of whole genome bacterial genotyping, we have found that the presence of members of bacterial restriction-modification systems are associated with induction of a more pronounced host response to infection. Details of this case-control study have been reported recently (14Enroth H. Kraaz W. Engstrand L. Nyren O. Rohan T. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2000; 9: 981-985PubMed Google Scholar). Cases were patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Controls were the next five consecutive patients who underwent primary gastroscopy, without gastric adenocarcinoma, but having the same age (in 10-year age bands) and sex as the cases. Eight biopsies were taken from non-cancerous gastric mucosa in each case and control. Two biopsies from the distal stomach (antrum) plus two from the middle portion of the stomach (corpus) were homogenized together, and H. pylori was isolated using standard culture techniques. Sections, prepared from two additional antral biopsies, two corpus biopsies, and tumors, were scored by one pathologist blinded to both culture results and disease status. Pedigrees of FVB/N α1,3/4FT and tox176 mice (each hemizygous for their transgene) are described in earlier publications (15Guruge J.L. Falk P.G. Lorenz R.G. Dans M. Wirth H.P. Blaser M.J. Berg D.E.

They were re-derived as germ-free by Caesarian section and maintained in plastic gnotobiotic isolators, under a strict 12-h light cycle. Animals were given an autoclaved chow diet (NIH R and M/AUTO; Purina Mills, Inc) ad libitum. Feces and wipings from the inside surfaces of isolators were tested weekly for microbial contamination. All mouse experiments used protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University. Single colony-derived H. pylori strains from 96 patients in the case-control study were cultured for 3 days at 37 °C on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar, supplemented with 10% calf blood, vancomycin (6 μg/ml), trimethoprim (5 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (8 μg/ml), under microaerophilic conditions (CampyPak Plus, BD PharMingen). Each strain was harvested and incubated with formalin-fixed 5-μm-thick sections of stomach, prepared from 12-week-old conventionally raised and germ-free FVB/N normal, α1,3/4FT, and tox176 mice, using protocols described elsewhere (15Guruge J.L. Falk P.G. Lorenz R.G. Dans M. Wirth H.P. Blaser M.J. Berg D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Bound bacteria were detected using rabbit antibodies toH. pylori surface proteins (Dako; diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20/PBS)), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:200). Blocking controls were performed on binding strains by preincubating bacteria (106 CFU/100 μl of blocking buffer) for 1 h (23 °C) with 5 μg of purified neoglycoconjugates (Leb-human serum albumin (HSA), Lea-HSA, sialyl-Lex-HSA, HSA; all from IsoSep) prior to application to sections. Sections were processed as above and stained with propidium iodide to visualize host cells. Color images (512 × 512 pixels, corresponding to 270-μm2 areas of the section) were captured using a MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning system (Bio-Rad; 3 areas surveyed/section/mouse; n = 3 mice of each genotype scored per strain ± pretreatment with each neoglycoconjugate). Bound bacteria in each image were quantified using Slide Book software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Genomic DNA was isolated (QIAamp DNA mini prep kit; Qiagen) from 15 selected binding and non-binding strains plus a control strain known to bind to each class of adhesin receptor and to colonize each type of transgenic mouse (Hp1, Refs. 15Guruge J.L. Falk P.G. Lorenz R.G. Dans M. Wirth H.P. Blaser M.J. Berg D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar and 16Syder A.J.

Strains were genotyped using DNA microarrays containing duplicate copies of a set of 1660 PCR products from the two fully sequenced strains, TIGR 26695 and Astra J99 (91 ORFs unique to J99). Genomic DNA (2 μg) from each clinical isolate was labeled with Cy5, whereas DNAs from the 26695 and J99 strains (1 μg each) were labeled with Cy3. 26695/J99 DNA was co-hybridized with isolate DNA. All hybridizations were performed in duplicate so that there would be four measurements per gene (12Salama N. Guillemin K. McDaniel T.K. Sherlock G. Tompkins L. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14668-14673Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Following hybridization and washing, microarrays were scanned, and the Red/Green ratio for each gene normalized according to genome-www5.stanford.edu/MicroArray/help/results_normalization.shtml. If the normalized Red/Green ratio was less than 0.5, the gene was called absent (26695 was set as the reference strain). Each of the 15 selected genotyped clinical isolates plus the reference control strain (Hp1) was cultured for 3 days at 37 °C on selective medium. Bacteria were collected, concentrated to 108 CFU/ml PBS (pH 7.4), brought into the gnotobiotic isolator, and inoculated (single gavage of 107 CFU) into the stomachs of 6-week-old α1,3/4FT and tox176 mice (n = 4 mice/group; one bacterial strain/cage). The stomach was removed from each mouse 4 weeks after inoculation and divided in half along its cephalocaudal axis. One-half was homogenized in 0.5 ml of BHI broth and plated (with serial dilution) on selective BHI/blood medium to assay for the presence of culturable H. pylori. Total cellular RNA was isolated from the other half of the stomach and from age-matched uninfected germ-free controls (RNeasy Midi kit, Qiagen). qRT-PCR was performed with gene-specific primers (Hsp70 forward, 5′-GAATCCTATGCCTTCAACATGAAGA-3′; Hsp70 reverse, 5′-GGAGATGACCTCCTGGCACTT-3′; pIgR forward, 5′-CTTCCCTCCTGTCCTCAGAGGT-3′; pIgR reverse, 5′-GGCGTAACTAGGCCAGGCTT-3′; IL-1β forward, 5′-GTGTGTGACGTTCCCATTAGACA-3′; IL-1β reverse, 5′-AGGTGGAGAGCTTTCAGCTCAT-3′) and oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesized from DNase-treated RNAs (18Hooper L.V. Mills J.C. Roth K.A. Stappenbeck T.S. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Microbiol. 2002; 31: 559-589Crossref Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix buffer (Applied Biosystems), 0.25 units of UDP-N-glycosidase (Invitrogen), 900 nm forward and reverse primers, and cDNA. A melting curve was used to identify a temperature where only amplicon, and not primer dimers, accounted for SYBR Green-bound fluorescence. All assays were performed in triplicate (ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector, Applied Biosystems), and all data were normalized to an internal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA control (ΔΔCT analysis (18Hooper L.V. Mills J.C. Roth K.A. Stappenbeck T.S. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Microbiol. 2002; 31: 559-589Crossref Google Scholar)). Serum was obtained from each inoculated mouse at the time of sacrifice. Protein extracts from each colonizing strain were prepared by sonication in PBS (3 cycles, 5 min each; Branson model 200 ultrasonic cleaner, Branson Ultrasonics) followed by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min). Aliquots of the supernatant used to coat 96-well plates (0.5 μg of protein/isolate/well). Each serum sample was assayed in triplicate for circulating antibodies to proteins expressed by the inoculated strain. AGS cells (ATCC CRL-1739), seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates, were infected with 1 × 108 CFU of a given strain. Following a 6-h incubation, culture supernatants were collected and IL-8 concentrations defined by ELISA (IL-8 Eli-pair; Diaclone). The starting point for our studies was a collection of H. pylori strains recovered from previously characterized individuals enrolled in a Swedish case-control study of gastric cancer (72 cases and 324 controls; Ref. 14Enroth H. Kraaz W. Engstrand L. Nyren O. Rohan T. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2000; 9: 981-985PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori was originally isolated from 155 of these patients (29 cases; 126 controls), and isolates were stored at −70 °C (14Enroth H. Kraaz W. Engstrand L. Nyren O. Rohan T. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2000; 9: 981-985PubMed Google Scholar). We were able to culture 96 members of this panel 3–5 years after primary isolation. Single colony-derived strains from these 25 cases and 71 controls were then phenotyped based on their ability to bind to Fucα1,2Galβ1,3[Fucα1,4]GlcNAcβ (Leb) and/or NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4 glycan receptors expressed in the stomachs of germ-free α1,3/4FT and tox176 transgenic mice (respectively). As noted in the Introduction, binding was used as selection criteria because previous studies (15Guruge J.L. Falk P.G. Lorenz R.G. Dans M. Wirth H.P. Blaser M.J. Berg D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) of a clinical isolate had indicated that this trait can be associated with a more severe host inflammatory response. Bacterial binding to stomach sections was scored in a single blinded fashion. 13/96 clinical isolates expressed adhesins that bound to α1,3/4FT and/or tox176 gastric epithelium (TableI). Specificity for Leb or NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4 glycan receptors was established in each case by demonstrating that preincubation of a binding isolate with purified Leb-HSA or sialyl-Lex-HSA neoglycoconjugates inhibited binding (Lea-HSA and HSA were used as negative controls). None of the binding strains listed in Table I bound to sections from non-transgenic control FVB/N mice.Table ICharacteristics of clinical isolates used for whole-genome genotyping and phenotypic analysis in gnotobiotic transgenic mice1-1 Negative, no binding.

Strains indicated in red are those that produced a robust response in one or both gnotobiotic transgenic mouse models. The percentage of cancer strains with sialyl-Lex-inhibitable binding to sections oftox176 stomach (6/25; 24%) was significantly higher than the percentage of control strains that exhibited this phenotype (4/71, 6%; p < 0.05; χ2 test). Similarly, the percentage of cancer strains with Leb-inhibitable binding to sections of α1,3/4FT stomach (5/25; 20%) was significantly greater than the percentage in control strains (3/71, 5%;p < 0.05; χ2 test). Five of these 13 binding strains expressed adhesins that recognize both classes of gastric epithelial glycan receptors (Table I). Thus, in this particular panel of H. pylori isolates taken from a Swedish population, expression of adhesins that recognize these classes of glycans is a statistically significant feature of the cancer strains. The 13 binding strains were selected for further analyses. Two strains from cancer patients that did not bind to either α1,3/4FT ortox176 stomachs served as non-binding controls. Another strain, Hp1, was used as a binding- and colonization-positive control. Hp1, originally recovered from a Peruvian patient with gastritis, expresses adhesins that bind to both Leb-and NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4-containing glycan receptors, readily colonizes both conventionally raised and germ-free α1,3/4FT andtox176 mice, produces a more robust cellular and humoral immune response in both types of conventionally raised transgenic animals than in their age-matched non-transgenic littermates, and has been subjected to whole genome genotyping (12Salama N.

Each of the 13 binding strains plus the two non-binding controls were inoculated into 6-week-old germ-free α1,3/4FT andtox176 mice. When animals were sacrificed 1 month later, their stomachs were divided in half: one-half to define the number of culturable organisms; the other half to prepare RNA so that expression of selected host genes could be assayed by qRT-PCR. Age-matched uninfected germ-free mice were used as base-line host controls. Sera were collected from all germ-free and infected mice at the time of their sacrifice to measure circulating antibodies to H. pylori immunodeterminants. The culture-based assay disclosed that 6 members of the 15 strain panel from the case-control study were recoverable as viable organisms from the stomachs of ex-germ-free α1,3/4FT mice. Five of 15 strains were cultivatable from the stomachs of tox176 animals. The total number of colonizing strains was 8 because 3 strains colonized both types of gnotobiotic transgenic mice (Table I). Hp1 provided a ninth colonizing strain; it infected both hosts. Non-colonizing strains were defined as no CFU obtained from the stomachs of any mice in a group. Our criteria for studying the responses of a group of mice to a particular strain were based on the following definition of colonization: (i) at least one member of a group of four mice had to have culturable bacteria in their stomachs; (ii) all members of the group had to have antibody titers to H. pylori proteins (as measured by ELISA) that were ≥2 S.D. above the mean for age-matched germ-free α1,3/4FT and tox176 animals (n = 12 controls). A total of 11 groups of mice (n = 44 animals) inoculated with 8 different strains from the case-control study, plus the two reference control groups of α1,3/4FT andtox176 mice inoculated with Hp1, satisfied these criteria. The positive ELISA test indicated that all 9 strains persisted in their 52 hosts for a period long enough to elicit a statistically significant humoral immune response. There are few established biomarkers that can be used to follow the course of H. pylori pathogenesis in humans. In general, they are not readily applicable to mice (e.g. IL-8). Our approach for examining the effect of a particular strain on its host was influenced by two considerations. First, any surrogate biomarker of the host response should be consistently induced during the course of a 1-month infection of transgenic and normal FVB/N mice by the reference Hp1 strain. Second, the biomarker should have functions associated with host defense such as immuno-inflammatory responses and maintenance of the epithelial barrier. Ideally, the biomarker should be able to report strain- or host-specific differences in the robustness of the response to infection. We selected three biomarkers satisfying these two criteria from the results of a recent functional genomics study of the impact of Hp1 on germ-free normal, α1,3/4FT, and tox176 mice. 2A. J. Syder, J. Oh, J. L. Guruge, B. M. Bjo¨rkholm, and J. I. Gordon, manuscript in preparation. Each gene, heat shock protein (Hsp) 70, the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), and interleukin (IL)-1β, displayed a prominent and consistent increase in expression (defined by DNA microarray and real time quantitative RT-PCR studies) after Hp1 infection. Hsp70 is induced by a variety of stimuli, including pathologic stresses and may have dual effects; it is a chaperone, and it stimulates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) in human monocytes through a CD14-dependent pathway (19Asea A.

IL-1β is not only a pro-inflammatory cytokine but also a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion (21Takashima M. Furuta T. Hanai H. Sugimura H. Kaneko E. Gut. 2001; 48: 765-773"
https://openalex.org/W2011173866,"Using a binary adenoviral system, we recently showed that the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter induces tumor-specific Bax gene expression. However, the strong cytotoxicity of Bax and other pro-apoptotic genes to packaging 293 cells has so far hindered construction of the desired single adenoviral vectors expressing toxic genes. We report here the construction of a single bicistronic adenoviral vector for tumor-specific Bax expression. The vector (Ad/gBax) utilizes the Tet-Off system and expresses a GFP/Bax fusion protein for easy detection. The hTERT promoter drives the expression of tTA, a transactivator capable of binding to TRE (tetracycline-responsive element) in the absence of tetracycline, which in turn induces expression of the GFP-Bax gene. The addition of tetracycline in 293 cells blocks the binding of tTA to TRE and substantially inhibits GFP-Bax expression and toxicity, thus allowing the packaging and production of Ad/gBax. Our data show that Ad/gBax could drive the high expression of GFP-Bax in tumor cells but not in normal cells and mouse tissues. Furthermore, the expression of GFP-Bax fusion protein elicited tumor-specific apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo at a level comparable to that induced by the binary system. Thus, Ad/gBax may become a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancers."

Here we compare various properties of the R2 RT activity with those of the well characterized retroviral RT, avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). In processivity assays using heterogeneous RNA templates, R2 RT can synthesize cDNA over twice the length of that synthesized by AMV RT and can synthesize cDNA over 4 times longer than AMV RT in assays with poly(rA) templates. The higher processivity of R2 RT compared with retroviral RTs is a result of the slower rate of dissociation of the enzyme from RNA templates. The elongation rates of the two enzymes are similar. Finally, a highly distinct property of the R2 RT, compared with retroviral enzymes, is its ability to displace RNA strands annealed to RNA templates during cDNA synthesis. We suggest that both the higher processivity and displacement properties of R2 RT compared with retroviral RT result from the greater affinity of the R2 protein for the RNA template upstream of its active site.

We suggest that both the higher processivity and displacement properties of R2 RT compared with retroviral RT result from the greater affinity of the R2 protein for the RNA template upstream of its active site. The processivity of an enzyme can be defined as the number of rounds of catalysis that can be performed before the enzyme dissociates from the substrate (1Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The most processive nucleic acid polymerases are the large multisubunit polymerases involved in genomic DNA replication that can polymerize for tens of thousands of bp before dissociation. The high processivity of these complexes can be explained because they form a toroid around the DNA substrate (sliding clamp model) that prevents the complex from dissociation (2Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Structure. 1998; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Most other nucleic acid polymerases form a structure resembling a right hand, in which the palm contains the catalytic residues of the active site while the fingers and thumb grasp the template loosely to allow lateral movement along the length of the template (3Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; LTR, long terminal repeat; TPRT, target-primed reverse transcription; AMV, avian myeloblastosis virus; DTT, dithiothreitol; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; LTR, long terminal repeat; TPRT, target-primed reverse transcription; AMV, avian myeloblastosis virus; DTT, dithiothreitol; nt, nucleotide(s). have a hand structure (4Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar) and exhibit low levels of processivity for a replicative DNA polymerase (5Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4669-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In typical in vitro assays with templates of random base composition, retroviral RTs can extend a cDNA strand for only a few hundred nucleotides before dissociating. This low processivity has been suggested to be of advantage to the virus because it promotes recombination between RNA templates, thus allowing faster rates of evolution for avoidance of the vertebrate host's immune system (7Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 409-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this low processivity, production of full-length reverse transcripts occurs because polymerization occurs within a viral particle, allowing efficient reassociation of the reverse transcriptase with the RNA template (8Whitcomb J.M. Hughes S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 275-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Two other classes of mobile elements in eukaryotes also use RTs to make DNA copies of their RNA transcript. One class, the LTR retrotransposons, assume structures and utilize mechanisms of reverse transcription and integration that are highly similar to that of the retroviruses (9Boeke J.D. Stoye J.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 343-435Google Scholar). Indeed, phylogenetic analysis suggests that on a number of occasions in different classes of organisms these retrotransposons have evolved into retrovirus-like elements by the acquisition of an envelope-like gene (10Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, the processivity of LTR retrotransposon RTs is presumably similar to that of the retroviral enzymes. The second class of retrotransposons, the non-LTR retrotransposons (also called LINEs or retroposons) utilize a mechanism of retrotransposition that is very different from that of retroviruses. These elements polymerize the cDNA made from the element's RNA transcript directly onto a DNA target site that they have generated by cleavage of the host's chromosome (11Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). This process has been called target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). Whereas many questions remain concerning the mechanism of TPRT, one aspect of non-LTR retrotransposition seems clear. Sequences at the 5′-end of the elements are not required for integration; thus, if the RT fails to reach the 5′-end of the element, integration still occurs (reviewed in Ref. 12Eickbush T.H. Malik H.S. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 1111-1144Google Scholar). Because new insertions missing a large segment of their 5′-end are defective for further rounds of retrotransposition, non-LTR retrotransposons are presumably under greater selective pressure than retroviruses to evolve a RT with high processivity. In this report, we have characterized for the first time the processivity of an RT encoded by a non-LTR retrotransposon. The enzyme used for this study is encoded by the R2 element from Bombyx mori. This enzyme has been used to determine many of the early steps involved in the integration of non-LTR retrotransposons (see Ref.13Eickbush T.H. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 813-835Google Scholar for a review of the R2 system). We find that the processivity of R2 RT is indeed higher than that of retroviral RT. A second property of the R2 enzyme that distinguishes it from retroviral enzymes is its ability to displace a second RNA molecule annealed to the RNA template during cDNA synthesis. R2 protein was expressed in Escherichia coliJM109/pR260 and purified as previously described (14Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the fluorescent stain SYPRO Orange (Bio-Rad). The intensity of the R2 band was compared with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin using the fluoroimaging function of a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant. Avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase was obtained from Promega, poly(rA)/oligo(dT)13–18 was fromAmersham Biosciences, and poly(rA) was from Sigma. All heterogeneous RNA templates were generated in vitro by run-off transcription using either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (Fermentas Inc., Invitrogen). Templates for RNA synthesis were either restriction-digested pBSII(SK−) plasmids or PCR-amplified products containing the T7 promoter. The 183-nt RNA was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from a template generated by PCR amplification of pBSII(SK−)(Stratagene) using primers AB.8 (GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG) and AB.T7 (TAATACGACTCACTATAG). The 334-nt vector RNA was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from pBSII(SK−) predigested with PvuII. The 590-nt RNA was transcribed like the 334-nt RNA except that aKpnI and BamHI fragment of the R1Dm element (positions 5020–5342) was cloned into the polylinker region of pBSII(SK−) (plasmid provided by D. Eickbush). The 1094-nt vector RNA was transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase using pBSII(SK−) predigested withXmnI. The 117-nt RNA was transcribed from pBSII(SK−) predigested with KpnI using T3 RNA polymerase. In vitro transcription was performed in 80-μl volumes containing 2–5 μg of predigested plasmid DNA or gel-purified PCR fragments, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm spermidine, 1 mm each rNTP, and 150 units of T7 or T3 RNA polymerase. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C until a pyrophosphate precipitation formed (∼1.5 h). After synthesis, the DNA templates were removed by digestion with 10 units of DNase I (Ambion Inc.) for 25 min at 37 °C. The products of transcription were ethanol-precipitated and separated on 5% urea-PAGE. Full-length RNA templates were excised from the gel, eluted at room temperature in 0.3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.03% SDS for 1.5 h, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol-precipitated. Purified RNA transcripts were dissolved in 50 mm NaCl to a final RNA concentration of 0.1 μg/μl. DNA primers AB.23 (GGGGTACCGACAGGTTTCCCGACTG), AB.34 (CGTTCTTCGGGGCGAAAACTC), and oligo(dT)18 were labeled at their 5′ termini with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas) using the forward reaction procedure. Labeling reactions were performed in a 20-μl final volume containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 ng (∼6 pmol) of DNA primer, 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, the enzyme was inactivated by heating at 96 °C for 10 min. Labeled primer was subsequently annealed to the RNA template by incubation with 4 pmol of the RNA (or 50 ng of poly(rA)) at 96 °C and cooled slowly (3.5 °C/min). Fifty fmol of annealed RNA/DNA-primer or 10 ng of poly(rA)/oligo(dT) was used for each primer extension reaction. Unless otherwise specified, reverse transcription reactions were performed in 30-μl volumes. In the case of R2 RT, the preincubation and elongation mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100. The amount of R2 protein and RNA template for each assay are specified in the figure legends. Primer extension reactions with AMV RT were conducted in a manner similar to that for R2 RT with the exception that the solution contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm spermidine. RT reaction mixtures were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and reverse transcription was started by the addition of each dNTP to a final concentration of 250 μm. Only 250 μm dTTP was added in those reactions with poly(rA) templates. Polymerization reactions were for 4–7 min, depending on the length of the template. Reverse transcription reactions conducted under processive conditions were started by the simultaneous addition of 20 μg of heparin and 2 μg of poly(rA)/poly(dT)13–18 along with the dNTP at the start of the polymerization reaction (“trap” conditions). The trap with poly(rA) templates included 20 μg of heparin and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 6 μg of E. coli RNA, and 0.1 μg of oligo(dT)18. In control reactions, the trap was added at the beginning of the preincubation to block initiation. Polymerization reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 1% SDS. After precipitation, the products was separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The Gene Ruler 100-bp DNA ladder (Fermentas) was used as DNA length markers. The markers were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using the protocol for labeling 5′-protruding termini of DNA by the exchange reaction (Fermentas). The RT and template-primer complex were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C to form an initiation complex before the addition of the heparin, poly(rA)/oligo(dT) trap. After various periods of time at 37 °C, elongation was started by the addition of dNTP. The moment of the trap addition was considered as time 0. As a control for the efficiency of the trap in blocking reinitiation, the trap was also added at the beginning of the preincubation period. The yield of cDNA was assumed to be proportional to the fraction of enzyme that had remained bound to the RNA template during the incubation with the trap before the dNTP addition. Products of the extensions were separated on 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and the yield of cDNA products was determined on a PhosphorImager. To calculate the yield of product, the cDNA accumulation at each time point was subtracted from that which accumulated in the control lane and then normalized to the cDNA yield at time 0. The data were then fitted to the single exponential decay: exp(−k off × s), wherek off is the dissociation rate constant ands is the time of incubation in seconds with the trap (15Yu H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10888-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elongation rates were based on the increase of cDNA length as a function of time. For the heteropolymeric templates, 15 pmol of end-labeled DNA primers AB.34 and AB.23 were annealed to the 1094- and 590-nt templates, respectively, as described for the processivity assays. For assays with the poly(rA) template, 0.1 μg of end-labeled oligo(dT)18 was annealed to 1.5 μg of poly(rA) (weight ratio 1:15). About 150 fmol of the 1094-nt RNA/AB.34 template and 590-nt RNA/AB.23 template and 0.1 μg of poly(rA)/oligo(dT)18 template were preincubated with 10 ng (80 fmol) of R2 RT or 25 ng of AMV RT. After preincubation for 5 min at 37 °C, polymerization was initiated by the addition of dNTP to a final concentration of 250 μm and stopped by the addition of ethanol/SDS. The precipitated products were separated on 6% denaturing PAGE, and the length of the cDNA was determined relative to the DNA standards. In the case of the elongation on the heteropolymeric templates, the longest polymerization products were used in the determination of the elongation rate. The elongation rate constant was then determined by fitting these data points to a linear function. The average elongation rate for R2 RT was also determined as described under “Results.” Elongation by R2 RT on the homopolymeric template revealed two populations of the cDNA lengths at each time point. Therefore, both a fast and slow elongation rate was determined for the R2 enzyme. Because of the uniformity in length of the cDNA generated on the poly(rA) template, the main peak of cDNA lengths as well as the leading edge of the peak was determined at each time point. Secondary structures of the 590- and 1094-nt RNA templates were predicted using the program RNAstructure, available on the World Wide Web at www.chem.rochester.edu/Faculty (16Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 911-940Crossref Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Simulations were conducted on overlapping 50-nt regions of the RNA with a window size of 3, and all structures within 10% of the maximum energy difference were observed. In this approach, only the most stable short distance interactions (hairpins) are predicted. R2 non-LTR retrotransposons encode a single 120-kDa protein with both DNA endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities (11Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 17Burke W.D. Calalang C.C. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity to characterized reverse transcriptases, the R2 RT domain spans a central 450-amino acid region of the protein. This RT domain is similar in size and sequence to the RT domain of all other non-LTR retrotransposons but larger than the RT domain of retroviruses (18Burke W.D. Malik H.S. Jones J.P. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The R2 protein does not contain sequences similar to RNase H domains (19Malik H.S. Burke W.D. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and no RNase H activity has been detected in in vitro assays (11Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Located at the amino-terminal end of the R2 protein are two DNA binding motifs: a CCHH type zinc finger motif, and a c-Myb-like motif (20Yang J. Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7847-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This amino-terminal domain has been shown to specifically bind the DNA target site of the R2 element. 2S. Christensen and T. Eickbush, manuscript in preparation. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the R2 protein contains an endonuclease activity that is responsible for the DNA cleavage that initiates the TPRT reaction (20Yang J. Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7847-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The 120-kDa R2 protein exists as a monomer at low concentrations in the absence of RNA but becomes multimeric, possibly forming a dimer, in the presence of its RNA template during the DNA cleavage/TPRT reaction (20Yang J. Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7847-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Yang J. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3455-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All previous studies of the DNA cleavage and TPRT reaction by the R2 protein have been conducted in 200 mm NaCl, because lower salt concentrations result in lower rates and less specific cleavage of the DNA target site (21Yang J. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3455-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, the reverse transcriptase activity of the R2 protein, as assayed in a TPRT reaction or in a primer extension reaction, is most active near 200 mm NaCl (data not shown). Therefore, all assays in this report have been conducted in 200 mm NaCl. Retroviral enzymes, on the other hand, are typically assayed in the range of 50–75 mm KCl. In this report, 75 mm KCl has been used for all retroviral enzyme assays. AMV RT is one of the better characterized and most processive of the retroviral RTs (15Yu H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10888-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gregerson D.S. Albert J. Reid T.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7423-7431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Harrison G.P. Mayo M.S. Hunter E. Lever A.M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3433-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 compares the length of cDNA products synthesized by AMV RT with that synthesized by R2 RT. The template for this reaction was a 590-nt RNA molecule with a32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide preannealed to its 3′-end. AMV RT generated a wide range of cDNA products, the majority of which were less than 590 nt in length (AMV RT; lane 1). R2 RT also generated a range of cDNA lengths; however, full-length (590 nt) products were clearly the most prominent (R2 RT; lane 1). To directly confirm that the reaction products seen in Fig. 1represented the length of cDNA synthesized before the RT dissociated from the RNA template, and not multiple rounds of elongation, the reactions were also conducted under conditions that did not allow the reinitiation of RT. These single round reactions, frequently referred to as RT “trap assays,” involved the addition of heparin and an excess of poly(rA)/oligo(dT) (25Kim B. Ayran J.C. Sagar S.G. Adman E.T. Fuller S.M. Tran N.H. Horrigan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27666-27673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Heparin inhibits reinitiation by reverse transcriptases, whereas any reinitiation that may still occur will be associated with the more abundant, unlabeled poly(rA)/oligo(dT) template. To demonstrate the efficiency of this trap, lane 2 for each enzyme represented the addition of heparin and the poly(rA)/oligo(dT) at the same time that the 590-nt RNA-primer complex was added to the RT. When the trap was added at the beginning of the assay, neither enzyme synthesized detectable levels of cDNA primed by the oligonucleotide annealed to the RNA template. In lane 3 for each enzyme, the RTs were first bound to the 590-nt RNA template-primer complex followed by the addition of the trap along with the dNTPs to start reverse transcription. To quantify the difference in the accumulation of cDNA products generated by the R2 and AMV RTs, the radioactivity throughoutlane 3 for each enzyme was scanned on a PhosphorImager, and the results are plotted in Fig.2 A. Shown in Fig.2 B are similar processivity assays conducted in the presence of the trap with the R2 and AMV RTs using a second RNA template, which is 1094 nt in length. Again, the cDNA products generated by R2 RT on this RNA were longer than those generated by AMV RT. However, comparison of the cDNA products generated on the 590- and 1094-nt templates indicated that both enzymes had higher processivity on the 590-nt RNA template. For example, the AMV RT generated significant cDNA products longer than 300 nt on the 590-nt RNA template but few products longer than 300 nt on the 1094-nt RNA template. In the case of R2 RT, cDNA fragments of 100, 185, 210, 230, and 265 nt accumulated from the 1094-nt RNA template, whereas few short cDNA fragments were generated on the 590-nt RNA template. To describe the difference in processivity between the R2 and AMV RTs, we have calculated the probability of (premature) termination per nucleotide for each enzyme. The fraction of the total cDNA products generated on the 1094-nt RNA template that are greater than various specific lengths was determined from the scans in Fig. 2 Aand plotted in Fig. 3 A. These same values were also plotted on a log scale in Fig. 3 B. The curve fitted to these points can be described by an exponential function, exp(−P off × n), wheren represents the number of incorporated nucleotides, andP off is the probability of premature termination per nucleotide. P off for R2 RT on the 1094-nt RNA was 4.0 × 10−3/nt, whereasP off for AMV RT was 9.3 × 10−3/nt. The probability of termination for these enzymes on the 590-nt RNA template was 2.6 × 10−3/nt for R2 RT and 5.4 × 10−3/nt for AMV RT. Similar processivity assays were also conducted with the homopolymeric template, poly(rA), using end-labeled oligo(dT)18 as primer (Fig. 3 C). Both AMV and R2 RTs exhibited significantly lower termination on this homopolymeric template. P offwas determined to be 0.4 × 10−3/nt and 1.5 × 10−3/nt for R2 and AMV RT, respectively. The greater processivity of AMV and other retroviral RTs on poly(rA) templates has been previously reported (5Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4669-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gregerson D.S. Albert J. Reid T.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An alternative measure for the processivity of an enzyme is a determination of the probability of chain elongation (26McClure W.R. Chow Y. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 277-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The probability of chain elongation can be readily calculated for R2 and AMV RT by subtracting the P off value we have determined from 1.0 (1 − P off). The probabilities of chain elongation for R2 are therefore 0.9960, 0.9974, and 0.9994 on the 1094-nt, 590-nt, and poly(rA) templates. The corresponding values for AMV RT are 0.9907, 0.9946, and 0.9985. To determine whether the higher processivity of R2 RT compared with AMV RT is a result of its lower rate of dissociation from the RNA templates or its faster rate of polymerization, we next compared the dissociation rates of R2 RT and AMV RT. A 183-nt RNA template with a32P-labeled DNA primer annealed to its 3′-end was preincubated with each RT to allow formation of an initiation complex. To this complex was then added the heparin, poly(rA)/oligo(dT) trap for different periods of time before the addition of dNTPs to initiate polymerization. Because the trap prevented any released polymerase from reassociating with the RNA template, the proportion of cDNA products observed after dNTP addition represented the level of polymerase that remained bound to the template during incubation with the trap. The separated cDNA products are shown in Fig.4 A, and the total amount of cDNA synthesized at each time point (irrespective of size) was plotted in Fig. 4 B. A dramatic difference in the rate of dissociation by the two RTs was found. The level of cDNA products generated by the AMV-RT decreased ∼10-fold after a 2-min preincubation with the trap, whereas even after a 45-min incubation the level of cDNA products generated by R2 RT decreased only 2-fold. Note also that the greater processivity of the R2 RT could even be observed on this short RNA template. Virtually all of the cDNA product generated by R2-RT was full-length, whereas many of the cDNA products generated by AMV-RT were truncated. The decreasing fraction of enzyme that remained associated with the template over time (Fig. 4 B) was fit using a decreasing exponential function (exp(−k off × s)), where s represents seconds, and the dissociation rate for R2 RT was determined (k off = 3.8 ± 2.4 × 10−4/s). Because the absence of substrate dNTP may change the properties of the protein-template complex and thus affect its stability, an additional dissociation experiment was conducted similar to that in Fig. 4 but with the addition of 5 μm dATP to the preincubation mixture (data not shown). dATP is the first nucleotide to be incorporated on the 183-nt RNA template; thus, its presence should permit complexes that more closely represent those that have initiated reverse transcription. The k offdetermined for R2 RT under these conditions (k off = 2.7 × 10−4s−1) was not significantly different from that determined in the absence of dATP. A similar determination of the dissociation rate for AMV RT can only be crudely estimated, because most of the enzyme had already dissociated at the shortest time point tested. However, this rate would be ∼50-fold faster than R2 RT, or similar to values previously reported (15Yu H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

To determine the elongation rate of R2 RT, the enzyme was incubated with either the 590- or the 1094-nt RNA template preannealed with the end-labeled DNA primer to allow ternary complex formation. The four dNTPs were then added to start the reaction, and after short time periods the reaction was rapidly stopped by the addition of SDS and ethanol. The cDNA products generated by R2 RT on the 1094-nt template are shown in Fig. 5 A(left panel). The maximum lengths of cDNA synthesized at each time point on the two templates are plotted in Fig. 5 B and used to determine an elongation rate. An identical set of experiments has also been conducted with AMV RT using the 590-nt template, and the maximum cDNA lengths for this RT are plotted in Fig. 5 B. The elongation rates for R2 were found to be 14.2 nt/s and 11.0 nt/s on the 590- and 1094-nt templates, respectively, similar to the rate of 12.9 nt/s determined for AMV RT on the"

Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of wild-type SAP-1, but not that of a catalytically inactive mutant of this enzyme, has now been shown to induce apoptosis in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. This effect of SAP-1 was dependent on cellular caspase activities and was preceded by inactivation of two serine-threonine protein kinases, Akt and integrin-linked kinase (ILK), both of which function downstream of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase to promote cell survival. Coexpression of constitutively active forms of PI 3-kinase or Akt (which fully restored Akt and ILK activities) resulted in partial inhibition of SAP-1-induced cell death. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase did not induce cell death as efficiently as did SAP-1, although this mutant inhibited Akt and ILK activities more effectively than did SAP-1. Overexpression of SAP-1 had no substantial effect on Ras activity. These results suggest that SAP-1 induces apoptotic cell death by at least two distinct mechanisms: inhibition of cell survival signaling mediated by PI 3-kinase, Akt, and ILK and activation of a caspase-dependent proapoptotic pathway.

The antagonistic actions of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)1 and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) determine the tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and thereby control these cellular events in a highly elaborate manner (2Matozaki T.

Although certain PTPs such as SHP-2 and CD45 positively regulate PTK-mediated signaling events, most members of this class of proteins counteract signaling initiated by ligand-activated PTKs (5Ostman A. Bohmer F.D. Trends. Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For example, both PTP-1B and leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) attenuate insulin-elicited cellular responses by mediating the dephosphorylation of the activated insulin receptor. In addition, SHP-1, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing PTP, negatively regulates signaling events initiated by colony-stimulating factor 1 and stem cell factor by inactivating their cognate receptors (5Ostman A. Bohmer F.D. Trends. Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Stomach cancer-associated PTP-1 (SAP-1) was originally identified as a transmembrane-type (receptor-like) PTP that contains a single catalytic domain in its cytoplasmic region and eight fibronectin type III-like domains in its extracellular region (6Matozaki T.

The amount of SAP-1 mRNA in breast cancer cells increases during their differentiation in response to anticancer agents (8Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the abundance of SAP-1 correlates with the differentiation status of human colorectal cancer (7Seo Y. Matozaki T. Tsuda M. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the pathological significance of these observations remains unclear, they suggest that the biological function of SAP-1 may be closely related to carcinogenesis. With the use of a “substrate-trapping” approach, we previously showed that p130cas, a major focal adhesion (FA)-associated component of the integrin signaling pathway, is a likely physiological substrate of SAP-1 (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Forced expression of recombinant SAP-1 results in the dephosphorylation of several additional FA-associated proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Dok-1 as well as in impairment of reorganization of the actin-based cytoskeleton (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this PTP also inhibits cell proliferation, an effect probably mediated by the attenuation of growth factor-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases that is supported by integrin-mediated cell adhesion (9Noguchi T.

Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of SAP-1 is increased in response to cell-cell contact, indicating a role for this PTP in density-dependent growth arrest (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H.

Together with its reduced expression in advanced cancer (7Seo Y. Matozaki T. Tsuda M. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar), these observations have suggested that SAP-1 functions as a potential tumor suppressor by generating signals that lead either to cell growth arrest and differentiation or to suppression of metastasis. The precise molecular mechanism by which SAP-1 inhibits cell proliferation, however, remains unclear. To investigate further the biological role of SAP-1, we have now examined the effects of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of this PTP in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Our results show that overexpression of SAP-1 induces the apoptotic death of these cells in a manner dependent on cellular caspase activities. It also results in the inactivation of both Akt (protein kinase B) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK), both of which function downstream of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase in a signaling pathway that promotes cell survival (10Dudek H.

Furthermore, SAP-1-induced cell death was partially blocked by the expression of constitutively active forms of PI 3-kinase or Akt, indicating that this effect of SAP-1 is attributable, at least in part, to inhibition of Akt and ILK.

Cell viability was determined on the basis of trypan blue exclusion. For each assay, a total of 500 cells were randomly examined for staining positivity. Apoptosis was determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) procedure, which detects internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, with the use of anin situ apoptosis detection kit (Apop Tag; Intergen). In some experiments, infected cells were cultured in the presence of 100 μm z-VAD-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD; MBL) before analysis. Cells (confluent monolayer in one 100-mm dish) were lysed on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 5 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate.

The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of WG buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses with various antibodies were performed with the use of the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) as described (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H.

Cells (confluent monolayer in one 60-mm dish) were lysed in 500 μl of buffer A (50 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 5 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 3 h at 4 °C with polyclonal antibodies to ILK that had been coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (15 μl of beads; Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with WG buffer and another three times with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and were then suspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and 5 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide gel, which was then subjected to autoradiography. Cells (confluent monolayer in one 100-mm dish) were lysed in 600 μl of a solution containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Cell lysates were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with a GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain of human c-Raf-1 (20 μg of protein/15 μl of packed beads). The bound proteins were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide gel and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with a mAb specific for Ras. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed for 20 min with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated for 2 h with TBS-T (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mAb 65.1.9 to ILK (1 μg/ml) together with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mAb PY20 to phosphotyrosine (0.5 μg/ml). For ILK staining, the cells were washed twice with PBS and further incubated for 30 min at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated sheep antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin. After an additional three washes with PBS, the cells were examined with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (model MRC-1024; Bio-Rad), and built-up images were constructed. All data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. SAP-1 was previously shown to inhibit cell proliferation by negatively regulating integrin-mediated signaling (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine whether this effect depends solely on the inhibition of growth factor-elicited mitogenic signaling or whether SAP-1 also affects survival-promoting signals, we subjected NIH 3T3 cells to infection with adenoviruses encoding either wild-type SAP-1 (SAP-1WT) or a catalytically inactive mutant of this PTP (SAP-1C/S) and then examined the viability of the infected cells. Both recombinant proteins were detected as early as 6 h after infection and remained abundant for at least 4 days (Fig.1A; data not shown). Expression of SAP-1WT, but not that of the mutant protein or of β-galactosidase, resulted in a marked, time-dependent increase in the frequency of cell death under normal culture conditions (in the presence of 10% serum), as determined by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1B). A substantial proportion of cells expressing SAP-1WT detached from the culture dish, exhibiting cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and nuclear condensation (data not shown), all of which are characteristics of apoptosis. Furthermore, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected in these cells by TUNEL analysis (Fig.1C). Similar effects of SAP-1WT on cell viability were observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and human pancreatic cancer-derived Panc-1 cells (data not shown). SAP-1-induced cell death was prevented by incubation of cells in the presence of the broad range caspase inhibitor z-VAD, although this compound had no substantial effect on the viability of cells infected with a control virus (Fig.1D). These results suggest that SAP-1, when overexpressed, induces apoptotic cell death in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity and that this effect absolutely requires cellular caspase activities. Quantitative shift of the equilibrium between proapoptotic and survival signals determines whether cells survive or commit to apoptosis. The serine-threonine kinase Akt functions downstream of PI 3-kinase and prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis by mediating survival signals elicited by various growth factors (10Dudek H.

To elucidate the mechanism by which SAP-1 induces apoptosis, we first examined the effect of SAP-1 overexpression on Akt activity. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for phosphorylated (activated) Akt revealed that expression of SAP-1WT resulted in a marked decrease in the extent of Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 as early as 12 h after infection, a time at which apoptosis was not yet apparent (Fig.2A; data not shown). Similar analysis revealed that expression of SAP-1WT also inhibited phosphorylation of GSK-3α and GSK-3β, both of which are cellular substrates of Akt (Fig. 2A). In contrast, expression of SAP-1C/S or of β-galactosidase had no marked effect on the phosphorylation levels of Akt, GSK-3α, or GSK-3β. These results indicate that SAP-1 overexpression inactivates Akt prior to inducing evident apoptosis. Ras is also thought to suppress apoptosis by activating downstream effector molecules including Raf and PI 3-kinase (24Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Expression of either SAP-1WT or SAP-1C/S, however, had no substantial effect on Ras activity, as revealed by a “pull-down” assay with a GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf-1 (Fig.2B), suggesting that Ras inactivation does not contribute to SAP-1-induced apoptosis. These results also suggest that the inhibitory effect of SAP-1 on Akt activity is not simply a consequence of the reduced viability of cells infected with AxCASAP-1WT. The serine-threonine kinase ILK serves as a structural protein that links the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane (25Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and mediates survival-promoting signaling activated by the interaction of integrins with the extracellular matrix. Like Akt, ILK is activated in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (14Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 15Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G.

Given that SAP-1 negatively regulates integrin signaling, we examined whether SAP-1 affects ILK activity. Expression of SAP-1WT, but not that of SAP-1C/S or β-galactosidase, resulted in a marked decrease in ILK activity, as revealed by an immunocomplex kinase assay (Fig.3); this effect was again observed prior to the initiation of apoptosis (data not shown). Ectopic expression of SAP-1WT, but not that of SAP-1C/S, in Swiss 3T3 cells was previously shown to disrupt actin stress fibers and FAs (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore subjected these cells to infection with AxCASAP-1WT or AxCASAP-1C/S followed by immunofluorescence staining to determine the subcellular localization of ILK. In either noninfected cells (data not shown) or cells expressing SAP-1C/S (Fig.4, B and D), a substantial proportion of ILK colocalized with phosphotyrosine-positive patches at the leading edge of cells, reflecting its association with FAs. In contrast, in cells expressing SAP-1WT, ILK no longer localized to FAs but rather exhibited a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, A and C). These results suggest that SAP-1 not only inhibits the activity of ILK but also prevents it from localizing to FAs. Our results suggested that inhibition of survival signaling mediated by PI 3-kinase, Akt, or ILK might underlie the induction of apoptosis by SAP-1. It was, however, also possible that apoptosis resulted from a nonspecific toxic effect of overexpressed SAP-1. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined whether coexpression of constitutively active forms of PI 3-kinase or Akt was able to reverse the observed effects of SAP-1. Co-infection with adenoviruses encoding myristoylated (activated) forms of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig.5A) or of Akt (Fig.5B) prevented the inactivation of Akt or of ILK by SAP-1WT. Coexpression of either of the myristoylated recombinant proteins partially inhibited the induction of apoptosis by SAP-1WT, as revealed both by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 5) and TUNEL analysis (data not shown). The induction of apoptosis by SAP-1 thus appeared to be achieved, at least in part, through inhibition of cell survival signaling mediated by Akt or ILK. However, our observation that full restoration of the enzymatic activities of Akt and ILK was not sufficient to block cell death completely suggests that another mechanism also contributes to SAP-1-induced apoptosis. We next examined whether inhibition of cell survival signaling per se induces apoptotic cell death under our experimental conditions. We subjected NIH 3T3 cells to infection with an adenovirus encoding a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase. As expected, infection with this adenovirus resulted in a marked reduction in both Akt and ILK activities; the extent of these effects was even greater than that of those induced by expression of SAP-1WT (Fig. 6A). Expression of the dominant negative mutant also resulted in substantial cell death (Fig. 6B), suggesting that inhibition of Akt and ILK activities alone promotes apoptosis in these cells. However, the extent of cell death induced by this mutant of PI 3-kinase was less than that induced by SAP-1WT (Fig. 6B). These results thus support the notion that SAP-1 induces apoptotic cell death not only by inhibiting cell survival signaling but also by generating proapoptotic signals. FAK, a nontransmembrane PTK, appeared a likely target of SAP-1 action during the induction of apoptosis, given that FAK binds to and activates PI 3-kinase and thereby promotes cell survival (28Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar) and is inactivated by SAP-1-mediated dephosphorylation (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We thus examined the effect of overexpression of SAP-1 on the phosphorylation of FAK. The extent of overall tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK did not differ substantially among noninfected cells and cells expressing SAP-1WT, SAP-1C/S, or β-galactosidase (Fig.7A,upper panel). The phosphorylation level of FAK on Tyr397, a residue that serves as a binding site for PI 3-kinase (29Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), was also similar among these cells, as revealed both by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for phosphorylated FAK and by an in vitro binding assay with a GST fusion protein containing the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of the p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of SAP-1 on survival signaling in NIH 3T3 cells might not result from the uncoupling of PI 3-kinase from FAK. We also assessed the relationship between two other SAP-1 targets we have previously identified (p130cas and Dok-1) with the apoptotic phenotype described above. Expression of SAP-1WT had no marked effect on the phosphorylation of p130cas (Fig.7A, middle panel); in contrast, expression of this PTP substantially reduced the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 (Fig. 7A, lower panel). We have examined the effects of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SAP-1 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in order to gain further insight into the molecular mechanism by which this transmembrane-type PTP inhibits cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of SAP-1 induced apoptotic cell death in a manner dependent on the catalytic activity of this protein. This effect was preceded by marked inhibition of the activities of two survival-promoting protein kinases, Akt and ILK. Furthermore, restoration of the activities of these kinases by coexpression of constitutively active forms of PI 3-kinase or Akt resulted in substantial attenuation of SAP-1-induced cell death. SAP-1 thus appears to induce apoptosis, at least in part, by inhibiting survival-promoting signaling mediated by PI 3-kinase, Akt, and ILK (Fig.8). Together with our previous demonstration of the negative role of SAP-1 in growth factor signaling, our present data suggest that this PTP inhibits cell proliferation not only by attenuating growth factor-initiated mitogenic signaling but also by reducing cell viability. Akt and ILK are key downstream components of the PI 3-kinase-mediated survival signaling pathway that is initiated by both growth factors and integrin-mediated cell adhesion (10Dudek H. Datta S.R.

These kinases suppress apoptosis by inducing the phosphorylation of multiple cellular targets including the Bcl-2 family protein BAD, caspase-9, and GSK-3 (12Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 13Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Dedhar S. Williams B.

The initiation and execution of apoptosis are controlled by both positive (proapoptotic) and negative (antiapoptotic) regulators and are determined by the balance between these opposing forces. Consistent with this notion, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase induced cell death in the present study, presumably by reducing the activities of Akt and ILK. Blockade of the PI 3-kinase-mediated survival pathway has been shown to sensitize various cancer and non-cancer cells to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drugs (30O'Gorman D.M. McKenna S.L. McGahon A.J. Knox K.A. Cotter T.G. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl.

Down-regulation of this pathway also induces growth inhibition in human colon carcinoma cells (34Tan C. Costello P. Sanghera J. Dominguez D. Baulida J. de Herreros A.G. Dedhar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and enhances enterocyte-like differentiation of colorectal cancer cells (35Wang Q. Wang X. Hernandez A. Kim S. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1381-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Together, these observations indicate that inactivation of Akt and ILK is important for the induction of apoptosis by SAP-1. ILK induces the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 and thereby stimulates the enzymatic activity of Akt either directly (36Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) or indirectly (37Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards P.A. Hiles J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SAP-1 might thus reduce Akt activity through inhibition of ILK. Our results also indicate, however, that the suppression of SAP-1-induced cell death by full restoration of Akt and ILK activities is only partial. Furthermore, whereas expression of the dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase exhibited a greater inhibitory effect on the activities of these enzymes than did overexpression of SAP-1, it did not induce cell death as efficiently as did SAP-1. In contrast, inhibition of cellular caspases completely blocked SAP-1-induced cell death. These observations suggest that inactivation of Akt and ILK is not sufficient for the optimal apoptosis-inducing effect of SAP-1, which requires additional caspase-dependent mechanisms. SAP-1-induced apoptosis resembles anoikis, a type of apoptosis triggered by inadequate or inappropriate cellular interaction with the extracellular matrix (38Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar, 39Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 40Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), in that it is accompanied by both loss of integrin-mediated survival signaling and disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Several signaling molecules have been implicated in anoikis, including the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bim (43Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) and Bmf (44Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'Reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C. Strasser A. Science. 2001; 293: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) as well as the death receptor adapter protein FADD (45Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 46Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Given that these proteins activate a subset of caspases, they are potential mediators of the proapoptotic pathway activated by SAP-1 (Fig. 8). The precise mechanism by which SAP-1 inhibits survival-promoting signaling remains unclear. We previously identified several FA-associated components of the integrin signaling pathway (p130cas, FAK, Dok-1, etc.) as substrates of SAP-1 in 293 human embryonic kidney cells and Panc-1 cells (9Noguchi T. Masahiro T. Takeda H. Takada T. Inagaki K. Yamao T. Fukunaga K. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15216-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Of these, FAK appeared relevant for apoptotic effects of SAP-1, since this PTK, when phosphorylated, can promote cell survival by activating PI 3-kinase (28Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Expression of SAP-1, however, failed to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and its subsequent association with PI 3-kinase, indicating that FAK might not be responsible. Recent reports have proposed FAK-independent pathways that mediate integrin activation of Akt via PI 3-kinase (47Faraldo M.M. Deugnier M.A. Thiery J.P. Glukhova M.A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that such redundant pathways may contribute significantly to survival signaling and are targeted by SAP-1 in NIH 3T3 cells, although we cannot exclude the possibility that SAP-1 affects FAK function by altering its subcellular localization. SAP-1 hardly mediated the dephosphorylation of p130cas but markedly mediated that of Dok-1, suggesting that preferential substrates of SAP-1 may vary with cell types. This latter effect, however, may be indirect, since tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1 is maintained in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (48van Dijk T.B. van Den Akker E. Amelsvoort M.P. Mano H. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,49Liang X. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Shivakrupa Clarkson B. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13732-13738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that the abundance of SAP-1 is inversely related to the aggressiveness of human colorectal cancer (7Seo Y. Matozaki T. Tsuda M. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), breast cancer (8Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar), and hepatocellular carcinoma, 2T. Noguchi, unpublished data. suggesting that this PTP functions as an inducible tumor suppressor. Hyperresponsiveness to growth-promoting signals, metastasis, and tissue invasion and resistance to apoptosis are among the hallmarks of most types of advanced cancer (50Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). SAP-1 has been implicated as a negative regulator of the acquisition of the first two of these properties, given that forced expression of this PTP inhibits the growth and migration of several cancer cell lines.2 Our present results now suggest that down-regulation of this PTP might also render cancer cells resistant to apoptosis, resulting in tumor expansion. In conclusion, our data suggest that SAP-1 inhibits cell proliferation by suppressing growth factor-elicited mitogenic signaling as well as by inducing apoptotic cell death. This latter effect appears to be achieved by at least two distinct mechanisms: inhibition of cell survival signaling mediated by PI 3-kinase, Akt, and ILK and activation of a caspase-dependent proapoptotic pathway. SAP-1 might thus serve as a barrier to the development of malignancies. We thank M. Matsumoto and Y. Hino for technical assistance and helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W1965091886,"CRHSP-28 is a member of the tumor protein D52 protein family that was recently shown to regulate Ca2+-stimulated secretory activity in streptolysin-O-permeabilized acinar cells (Thomas, D. H., Taft, W. B., Kaspar, K. M., and Groblewski, G. E. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 28866–28872). In the present study, the Ca2+-sensitive phospholipid-binding protein annexin VI was purified from rat pancreas as a CRHSP-28-binding protein. The interaction between CRHSP-28 and annexin VI was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and gel-overlay assays and was shown to require low micromolar levels of free Ca2+, indicating these molecules likely interact under physiological conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed a dual localization of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI, which appeared in a punctate pattern in the supranuclear and apical cytoplasm of acini. Stimulation of cells for 5 min with the secretagogue cholecystokinin enhanced the colocalization of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI within regions of acini immediately below the apical plasma membrane. Tissue fractionation revealed that CRHSP-28 is a peripheral membrane protein that is highly enriched in smooth microsomal fractions of pancreas. Further, the content of CRHSP-28 in microsomes was significantly reduced in pancreatic tissue obtained from rats that had been infused with a secretory dose of cholecystokinin for 40 min, demonstrating that secretagogue stimulation transiently alters the association of CRHSP-28 with membranes in cells. Collectively, the Ca2+-dependent binding of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI, together with their colocalization in the apical cytoplasm, is consistent with a role for these molecules in acinar cell membrane trafficking events that are essential for digestive enzyme secretion.

In screening for proteins that interact with CRHSP-28 in pancreas, we recently identified 35- and 70-kDa binding proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with CRHSP-28 from acinar lysates and bound with recombinant CRHSP-28 in a gel-overlay assay (5Thomas D.H.

The 70-kDa protein co-purified with zymogen granule membranes, consistent with a secretory role for CRHSP-28 in acinar cells. Further, subcellular fractionation of the binding proteins was markedly altered when lysates were prepared in the presence of Ca2+, resulting in a redistribution of both molecules from a cytosolic to a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction. The present study describes the purification of the 70-kDa CRHSP-28-binding protein as annexin VI and further demonstrates a colocalization of these molecules in the apical cytoplasm of acinar cells.

Goat anti-human annexin VI (sc1930) and corresponding antigen, rabbit anti-human Rab4 (sc312), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Alexafluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was from Molecular Probes. The characterization of affinity-purified anti-CRHSP-28 polyclonal antibodies was detailed previously (9Groblewski G.E. Yoshida M. Yao H. Williams J.A. Ernst S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G219-G226PubMed Google Scholar). Pancreatic acinar cells were isolated from adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as previously described (18Burnham D.B. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10523-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wishart M.J. Groblewski G.E. Göke B.J. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G676-G686PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in an acinar buffer consisting of (in mm) 10 HEPES, 137 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 1.28 CaCl2, 0.6 Na2HPO4, 5.5 d-glucose, 2l-glutamine, and an essential amino acid solution. The buffer was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, gassed with 100% O2, and adjusted to pH 7.4. Pancreatic lobules were prepared by microdissection of a rat pancreas that had been injected with phosphate-buffered saline containing (in mm) 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 4.3 Na2HPO4, 1.4 KH2PO4, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Isolated lobules were incubated in the above acinar buffer at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Following indicated treatments, lobules were gently pelleted and fixed in 4% formaldehyde prepared from paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence microcopy was conducted on 6-μm-thick cryostat sections as described (9Groblewski G.E. Yoshida M. Yao H. Williams J.A. Ernst S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G219-G226PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin VI immunoreactivity with antibody sc1390 was characterized using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:200). Antigen competition studies were conducted by preincubating annexin VI antibody with a 10-fold molar excess of peptide antigen for 2 h at room temperature, prior to an overnight incubation with the tissue. For dual immunofluorescence localization of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI, CRHSP-28 immunoreactivity was detected using Alexafluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000). Tissue was analyzed using a Bio-Rad model 1024 confocal microscope with a mixed krypton/argon gas laser. For dual immunofluorescence measurements, fluorophores were individually excited at the appropriate wavelength to ensure no overlapping excitation occurred between channels. Captured images were overlaid using Bio-Rad software and then converted to TIF files for processing using Photoshop software. Acini prepared from two pancreases were sonicated at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing (in mm) 50 Tris base (pH 7.4), 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 benzamidine, and protease inhibitor mixture. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, a detergent-insoluble fraction (P1) was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Detergent-insoluble proteins were sonicated again in the same buffer without CaCl2 and containing 5 mm EGTA. Proteins released by EGTA treatment were obtained in the soluble fraction (S2) following a second centrifugation, and the 70-kDa CRHSP-28-binding protein was analyzed by gel-overlay assay as previously described (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). S2 fractions enriched in the binding protein were stockpiled from multiple experiments and separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described (19Wishart M.J. Groblewski G.E. Göke B.J. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G676-G686PubMed Google Scholar). The Coomassie Blue-stained CRHSP-28-binding protein was excised from multiple gels and digested with trypsin. Tryptic fragments were separated by HPLC and submitted for microsequence analysis as described (4Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid sequencing was conducted by the Michigan State University Microsequence facility. Rats were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane, and jugular veins were cannulated for infusion of hormone. A secretory dose of cholecystokinin (CCK) (300 pmol/kg/h) was infused in 0.9% saline at a rate of 1 ml/h for 40 min prior to removal of the pancreas. Tissue fractionation was conducted essentially as described (20Hofbauer B. Saluja A.K. Lerch M.M. Bhagat L. Bhatia M. Lee H.S. Frossard J.L. Adler G. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G352-G362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two rat pancreases were minced in five volumes of a buffer containing (in mm) 10 MOPS, pH 6.8, 250 sucrose, 0.1 MgCl2, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 benzamidine. Tissue was homogenized by three strokes of a motor-driven homogenizer (5,000 rpm) using a Teflon pestle with 0.5–1-mm clearance. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 150 × g for 10 min and then further centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 15 min to produce a white pellet enriched in zymogen granules overlaid by a brown pellet enriched in mitochondria. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged 12,000 × gfor 13 min to obtain a lysosome-enriched pellet and then centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate microsomal and cytosolic fractions. Smooth and rough microsomal fractions were prepared as previously described (21Kleene R. Zdzieblo J. Wege K. Kern H.-F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2539-2548PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a sucrose gradient composed of 1.3, 0.86, 0.5, and 0.25 msucrose was prepared in homogenization buffer. Crude microsomes were layered between the 0.5 and 0.25 m sucrose layers and then centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 1 h. Membrane fractions isolated from the 1.3/0.86 and 0.86/0.5 m sucrose interface represented the rough and smooth microsomal fractions, respectively. Immunoprecipitations were conducted as detailed previously (22Groblewski G.E. Wang Y. Ernst S.A. Kent C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1437-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine the Ca2+ sensitivity of CRHSP-28/annexin VI binding, gel-overlay assays were conducted as described (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EGTA, and enough CaCl2 to create the desired final concentration of free Ca2+. The quantity of Ca2+ added to the buffer was calculated based on dissociation constants using a computer program as described (23Kitagawa M. Williams J.A. De Lisle R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G157-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acinar lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with recombinant CRHSP-28 (4 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Binding proteins were detected using affinity-purified CRHSP-28 antiserum (1 μg/ml). Protein binding was quantified by densitometric analysis using a model DNA35 scanner interfaced with the Protein and DNA Imageware System (PDI, Huntington Station, NY). Using a gel-overlay technique to screen for proteins that interact with CRHSP-28, we recently identified two binding proteins of 35 and 70 kDa (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both proteins partitioned into a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of lysates prepared in the presence of Ca2+. The Ca2+dependence of this redistribution was exploited to purify the 70-kDa binding protein from pancreatic acinar cells (Fig.1 A). Lysates were prepared in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1 mmCa2+, and a detergent-insoluble fraction (P1) highly enriched in binding proteins was obtained by centrifugation. The 70-kDa protein was subsequently released from the insoluble material by chelating Ca2+ using EGTA. Proteins in the EGTA released fraction (S2) were combined from multiple preparations and then separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis as a final purification step (Fig. 1 B). Of the two CRHSP-28-binding proteins, only the 70-kDa molecule was readily detected by Coomassie staining, and was present as a closely spaced doublet with a pI of ∼5.5–6.0. Tryptic fragments of the 70-kDa binding protein were separated by HPLC (Fig.1 C). Microsequence analysis of fraction 21 from the HPLC trace yielded high quality sequence of a 14-amino acid peptide with 100% homology to amino acids 472–485 of rat annexin VI, a Ca2+-sensitive phospholipid and cytoskeletal binding protein (24Hawkins T.E. Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As the molecular mass, pI and Ca2+-mediated redistribution of the 70-kDa binding protein in subcellular fractions were essentially identical to that reported for annexin VI in other cell types, specific antibodies were used to verify its identity in acinar cells. A polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal 16 amino acids of rabbit annexin VI specifically reacted with the purified 70-kDa binding protein on two-dimensional gels (Fig. 1 B). The annexin VI immunoreactive protein migrated as a closely-spaced doublet following SDS-PAGE and was identical in size to signals obtained from an annexin VI-enriched membrane fraction from lung, as well as purified bovine annexin VI protein (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained using a separate polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal 19 amino acids of human annexin VI (Fig.2 C). The annexin VI immunoreactive protein underwent a pronounced redistribution from cytosolic to detergent-insoluble fractions of lysates prepared in the presence of 1 mmCa2+. These results are identical to our recent report showing a Ca2+-sensitive translocation of the 70-kDa CRHSP-28-binding protein from cytosolic to particulate fractions of an acinar lysate (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The CRHSP-28/annexin VI interaction was additionally confirmed by demonstrating that recombinant CRHSP-28 strongly bound to purified bovine annexin VI in the gel-overlay assay (Fig.2 B). Collectively, these data indicate that the previously identified 70-kDa CRHSP-28-binding protein is indeed annexin VI. The interaction between CRHSP-28 and annexin VI was further demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitating the proteins from an acinar cell lysate (Fig. 3). Interestingly, no CRHSP-28/annexin VI binding was detected when lysates were prepared in the absence of Ca2+. However, inclusion of Ca2+ in the lysis buffer promoted a strong association between the two proteins, which readily coimmunoprecipitated together. Conducting immunoprecipitations in the presence of Ca2+resulted in ∼50% of the annexin VI protein translocating to the detergent-insoluble fraction, which was then removed by centrifugation prior to immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 2 C). This sedimentation of annexin VI made it difficult to quantify the Ca2+ sensitivity of CRHSP-28/annexin VI binding by coimmunoprecipitation, as variable amounts of annexin VI moved to the detergent-insoluble fraction in the presence of Ca2+. As an alternative, the Ca2+ sensitivity of CRHSP-28/annexin VI binding was measured in vitro using the gel-overlay assay (Fig. 4). In initial experiments, gel overlays were conducted in the presence of milk protein, which contains ample amounts of Ca2+. Removal of Ca2+ from the buffer using EGTA resulted in a complete loss of CRHSP-28 binding (data not shown). As a substitute, bovine serum albumin was included in the buffer and CRHSP-28 binding was measured while clamping the free Ca2+ concentration at various levels. Consistent with the Ca2+-sensitive coimmunoprecipitation, CRHSP-28 binding to annexin VI occurred over a micromolar range of free ionized Ca2+. CRHSP-28 binding reached a plateau at 10–100 μm Ca2+ with an EC50 of ∼2.5 μm Ca2+. Binding increased slightly (< 20%) at 1 mm Ca2+; however, no further interaction was detected at Ca2+ concentrations as high as 10 mm (data not shown).Figure 4Ca2+ sensitivity of CRHSP-28 binding to annexin VI. Equal amounts of an acinar cell lysate (40 μg) were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed by gel-overlay assay with recombinant CRHSP-28 protein (4 μg/ml). The assay buffer contained 5 mm EGTA and enough CaCl2 to achieve the indicated concentrations of free Ca2+. CRHSP-28 binding to annexin VI was quantified by densitometry. Data are the mean and standard error of three or four determinations for each point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CRHSP-28 is a hydrophilic protein that partitions into both soluble and membrane fractions following cell lysis (9Groblewski G.E.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000; 29: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To characterize the association of CRHSP-28 with membranes, a crude microsomal fraction of a pancreatic homogenate was treated under alkaline conditions with Na2CO3, then re-isolated by centrifugation to separate peripheral and integral membrane proteins (Fig. 5). As a positive control, the small G-protein Rab4, which anchors to phospholipids via a geranylgeranyl moiety (25Valentijn J.A. Gien L.T. Valentijn K.M. Jamieson J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was analyzed by immunoblotting and found to remain largely associated with the membrane fraction following alkaline treatment. In contrast, CRHSP-28 was completely recovered in the soluble fraction following alkaline treatment, indicating that it is not an integral membrane protein but instead is peripherally associated with these structures. Subcellular fractionation of rat pancreas demonstrated that CRHSP-28 was largely localized to a microsomal fraction (Fig.6). As previously reported (9Groblewski G.E. Yoshida M. Yao H. Williams J.A. Ernst S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G219-G226PubMed Google Scholar), no CRHSP-28 signal was detected in purified zymogen granules. Further, little or no CRHSP-28 was present in fractions enriched in mitochondria or lysosomes. In contrast, annexin VI was present at similar levels in all subcellular fractions tested including zymogen granules, mitochondria, and lysosomes. Interestingly, treatment of animals with a secretory dose of CCK for 40 min prior to tissue fractionation significantly increased the amount of CRHSP-28 recovered in the cytosolic fraction and, correspondingly, decreased the amount of the protein recovered in the microsomal fraction. Hormone treatment had no effect on annexin VI fractionation. Further fractionation of crude microsomes by sucrose gradient centrifugation demonstrated that both CRHSP-28 and annexin VI were predominantly associated with the smooth microsomal fraction composed mainly of Golgi, plasma membrane, and endosomes. Immunofluorescence localization of annexin VI was conducted on 0.5-μm-thick optical sections of pancreatic lobules and demonstrated that the protein was present in a punctate pattern throughout the basal and apical cytoplasm (Fig.7). Annexin VI staining was evident in the juxtanuclear regions of cells but was largely absent from nuclei. This same pattern of annexin VI immunofluorescence was detected using both anti-human and anti-rabbit annexin VI polyclonal antibodies. No signal was observed in sections when primary antibody was omitted from the incubations (data not shown). Further, preabsorption of the annexin VI antibody with a 10-fold molar excess of antigen completely abolished annexin VI staining, demonstrating the specificity of this localization (Fig. 7 C). The subcellular distribution of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI was examined using dual immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.8). As previously reported (9Groblewski G.E. Yoshida M. Yao H. Williams J.A. Ernst S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G219-G226PubMed Google Scholar), CRHSP-28 was highly localized to the apical cytoplasm of acini extending from the supranuclear region to the apical plasma membrane (Fig.8 A). Low levels of CRHSP-28 staining were present in basal regions of cells. As indicated above (Fig. 7), annexin VI immunofluorescence was detected in a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm, including apical regions of acini just below the acinar lumen (Fig. 8 B, arrows). Overlay of the CRHSP-28 and annexin VI images demonstrated a pronounced overlapping of the proteins throughout the supranuclear and apical cytoplasm (Fig.8 C). Little or no overlap of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI occurred in the basal cytoplasm where annexin VI staining was evident. Incubation of lobules for 5 min with CCK promoted the accumulation of both CRHSP-28 annexin VI staining to regions immediately below the apical membrane. Although quantitative immunofluorescence was not conducted, this effect was seen in multiple experiments and was also evident upon ionomycin stimulation of lobules. The co-localization of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI in control and secretagogue-stimulated acini supports the biochemical data demonstrating a Ca2+-sensitive interaction between these proteins and is consistent with an important role for these molecules in acinar cell membrane trafficking. Annexin VI is a member of an extended family of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins reported to function in diverse cellular processes related to signaling, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal dynamics (24Hawkins T.E. Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Donnelly S.R. Moss S.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Annexin proteins are characterized by the presence of at least four conserved tandem repeats of 70 amino acids that mediate their interaction with negatively charged phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Annexin VI is unique in that it contains eight such repeats arranged in a two-lobed configuration that is separated by a linker region (27Avila-Sakar A.J. Kretsinger R.H. Creutz C.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the linker region supports both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the two lobes and, as such, is thought to impart the many dynamic properties of the annexin VI protein (27Avila-Sakar A.J. Kretsinger R.H. Creutz C.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Annexin VI has been implicated as an important regulatory component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (15Kamal A. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Cell. 1992; 70: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) used an in vitro system to demonstrate that annexin VI is required for the Ca2+- and ATP-dependent budding of clathrin-coated pits from membranes. Subsequent studies in intact fibroblasts indicated that annexin VI functions by directing the remodeling of membrane-bound spectrin during vesicle budding (15Kamal A. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition to modulating endocytosis at the plasma membrane, annexin VI was shown to be present in a late endocytic compartment of epithelial cells (30Jackle S. Beisiegel U. Rinninger F.

Interestingly, in smooth muscle, annexin VI plays a dynamic role in regulating reversible interactions between actin-cytoskeletal components and the caveolar fraction of the sarcolemma during muscle contraction (35Babiychuk E.B. Draeger A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 36Babiychuk E.B. Palstra R.-J.T.S. Schaller J. Kampfer U. Draeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35191-35195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that annexin VI plays a generalized role in Ca2+-dependent cellular processes involving transient interactions between membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. The binding of CRHSP-28 with annexin VI required low micromolar concentrations of free Ca2+ in vitro, indicating the likelihood that these molecules interact under physiological conditions (1Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Go V.L.W. Dimango E.P. Gardner J.D. Lebenthal E. Reber H.A. Scheele G.A. The Pancreas. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1993: 167-189Google Scholar, 2Williams J.A. Groblewski G.E. Ohnishi H.

A specific interaction between CRHSP-28 and annexin VI was supported by dual immunofluorescence microscopy colocalizing these proteins within the apical cytoplasm of acinar cells. Furthermore, the apparent recruitment of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI to the cell apex upon secretagogue stimulation also supports a Ca2+-regulated interaction. The Ca2+ dependence of CRHSP-28/annexin VI binding is remarkably similar to the Ca2+-dependent interaction of annexin VI with negatively charged phospholipids and suggests that these molecules interact by a similar molecular mechanism. CRHSP-28 contains three clusters of negatively charged acidic residues (amino acids 16–20, 34–39, and 48–50) present within the amino half of the protein (4Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These concentrated regions of negative charge may potentially support Ca2+-dependent interactions of CRHSP-28 with either of the phospholipid binding domains of annexin VI. Our previous study (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrating a role for CRHSP-28 in acinar cell secretion strongly suggests that CRHSP-28 be associated with zymogen granules. Although CRHSP-28 was highly localized around zymogen granules in the apical cytoplasm, the protein was not detected when immunoblotting purified fractions of these organelles. Conversely, annexin VI was clearly detected in purified zymogen granules (Fig. 6) and zymogen granule membranes (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) prepared in the absence of added Ca2+. A Ca2+-independent association of annexin VI with membranes has previously been described in a number of tissues including liver and mammary epithelial cells (22Groblewski G.E. Wang Y. Ernst S.A. Kent C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1437-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Turpin E. Russo-Marie F. Dubois T. de Paillerets C. Alfsen A. Bomsel M.

Therefore, it is possible that CRHSP-28 is recruited to zymogen granules via an interaction with annexin VI during periods of elevated cellular Ca2+. Indeed, numerous studies have documented that the highest levels of free Ca2+ achieved following secretagogue stimulation occur immediately below the apical membrane and are believed to be necessary to trigger the exocytosis of zymogen granules (1Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Go V.L.W. Dimango E.P. Gardner J.D. Lebenthal E. Reber H.A. Scheele G.A. The Pancreas. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1993: 167-189Google Scholar, 2Williams J.A. Groblewski G.E. Ohnishi H.

Zymogen granules have been shown to be enriched in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-containing microdomains, and, further, these structures are essential for granule maturation and apical secretion in acini (37Schmidt K. Schrader M. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14315-14323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle, annexin VI has been shown to regulate reversible interactions of the actin cytoskeleton with cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains (35Babiychuk E.B.

Thus, similar to its role in smooth muscle contraction, annexin VI may regulate interactions between zymogen granules and actin-cytoskeletal components of the subapical web in acini. The actin-rich subapical web in acinar cells has been shown to play an integral role in regulating both the exocytosis of zymogen granules and the subsequent retrieval of granule membranes from the apical plasmalemma (38Valentijn K.M. Gumkowski F.D. Jamieson J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar, 39Valentijn K. Valentijn J.A. Jamieson J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

CRHSP-28 and annexin VI were diffusely localized in the apical cytoplasm of acini under both basal and CCK-stimulated conditions. The diffuse nature of the immunofluorescence staining precluded a precise localization of the proteins to specific membrane compartments. Because significant cytosolic pools of both CRHSP-28 and annexin VI exist, these data may reflect a dynamic and reversible association of these molecules with membranes. Cell fractionation studies indicated CRHSP-28 was equally present in both soluble and particulate fractions of acinar lysates. Further, CRHSP-28 was peripherally associated with membranes, as NaCO3 treatment efficiently released the protein from pancreatic microsomes. We recently showed that the leakage of CRHSP-28 from streptolysin-O-permeabilized acini was significantly enhanced over 15 min under conditions of elevated cellular Ca2+, suggesting that cell stimulation promoted a translocation of CRHSP-28 within the cytoplasm (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have determined that phosphorylated CRHSP-28 is primarily released from permeabilized acini following CCK stimulation, whereas the nonphosphorylated protein is associated exclusively with membrane fractions. 2D. D. H. Thomas and G. E. Groblewski, unpublished observation. These findings are consistent with the current study showing that the recovery of CRHSP-28 in cytosolic fractions of pancreas was significantly enhanced following a 40-min infusion of CCK in vivo. Collectively, these findings support a dynamic association of CRHSP-28 with membranes that is significantly altered by secretagogue stimulation. The question remains as to the Ca2+-independent association of CRHSP-28 and annexin VI with endosome-enriched microsomal fractions of pancreas. One possibility is that CRHSP-28 binds to annexin VI during periods of elevated Ca2+ to support the movement of zymogen granules across the actin-rich subapical web. CRHSP-28 and annexin VI would then enter the plasma membrane during zymogen granule fusion and be retrieved from the apical membrane during endocytosis. The finding that the association of CRHSP-28 with endosome-enriched microsomes was detected in the absence of added Ca2+further suggests CRHSP-28 entered a stable complex with additional membrane-bound proteins. Supporting this, we recently demonstrated by covalent cross-linking experiments that CRHSP-28 is part of a large molecular mass complex (>300 kDa) in acini that partitions into membrane fractions following cell lysis (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The large mass of this complex is consistent with an association of CRHSP-28 with a multiprotein complex. Further, in accordance with the CCK-enhanced cytosolic localization of CRHSP-28 in vivo and the Ca2+-enhanced release of the protein from permeabilized cells (5Thomas D.H. Taft W.B. Kaspar K.M. Groblewski G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), CRHSP-28 may be dissociated from this complex via its Ca2+-mediated phosphorylation. CRHSP-28 phosphorylation occurs on at least two serine residues and is a transient event, reaching maximal levels within 2 min and fully dephosphorylating over 60 min in the continued presence of secretagogues (4Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The transient phosphorylation of CRHSP-28 is clearly consistent with the movement of the protein into the cytoplasm, where it may be dephosphorylated by constitutively active serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Once dephosphorylated, CRHSP-28 would be available to support subsequent zymogen granule trafficking events. Interestingly, it was recently reported that CRHSP-28 specifically interacts with a member of the MAL protein family by yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vitro pull-down assays (12Wilson S.H. Bailey A.M. Nourse C.R. Mattei M.G. Byrne J.A. Genomics. 2001; 76: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MAL proteins are known to regulate apical targeting of vesicles in renal epithelial cells and, similar to annexin VI, are targeted to cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich microdomains on secretory granules (13Cheong K.H.

Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, MAL proteins have been shown to cycle from the apical plasma membrane back to the Golgi compartment on endocytic vesicles (41Puertolloano R. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3435-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although MAL proteins are essential for apical membrane targeting in polarized epithelia, the precise molecular function of these proteins has not been described. Clearly, further experimentation directly examining the role of CRHSP-28 and its associated proteins in zymogen granule trafficking and membrane retrieval is necessary to understand how this molecule modulates acinar cell function. We extend a special thanks to Dr. Stephen Ernst for helpful suggestions on performing immunofluorescence microscopy on pancreatic tissue and Dr. Joseph Leykam and staff at the Michigan State University Microsequence Facility for help in sequencing the annexin VI protein."

The PLC inhibitor, 3-nitrocoumarin (3-NC), selectively inhibited PLC-γ in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells without affecting the activity of PLC-β. In contrast, inhibitors of PLC-β, hexadecylphosphocholine and U73122, had no effect on the activity of PLC-γ. Inhibition of PLC-γ by 3-NC was associated with an increase in tight junction permeability across Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers, as evidenced by 3-NC-induced decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and increase in mannitol flux over a concentration range that was inhibitory to PLC-γ. An analog of 3-NC, 7-hydroxy-3-NC (7-OH-3-NC), which was inactive as an inhibitor of PLC-γ, also had no effect on tight junction permeability. Treatment with 3-NC caused punctate disruption in the cortical actin filaments. The PLC-γ inhibitor, 3-NC, but not the inactive analog, 7-OH-3-NC, caused hyperphosphorylation of the tight junction proteins, occludin, ZO-1, and ZO-2. The serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (50–200 nm), significantly attenuated 3-NC-induced hyperphosphorylation of ZO-2. This corresponded with attenuation by staurosporine of 3-NC-induced increase in tight junction permeability, suggesting a relationship between ZO-2 phosphorylation and tight junction permeability."

This study also reveals that, like many other nucleotide binding proteins, coordination of DMB is accompanied by a disorder-order transition in a surface loop. The structure of apo-CobT is also reported. Cobalamin is the largest and most complex cofactor found in biological systems (Fig. 1). It contains a cobalt ion at the center of a corrin ring that contributes four nitrogen atoms to the coordination sphere of the cobalt ion. Like other macrocyclic tetrapyrroles, the corrin ring has a conjugated double bond system that gives its unique red color. Unlike other macrocyclic tetrapyrroles, the coordination sphere is completed by an upper and lower ligand to the central metal atom cobalt. The biologically active form of the cofactor contains 5′-deoxyadenosyl or a methyl group, while the vitamin form contains a cyano group as the upper ligand. These cobamides are called adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, and cyanocobalamin, respectively. The upper ligand is attached to the cobalt ion by the unusual and labile metal-carbon covalent bond. The lower ligand of the cobamide synthesized by Salmonella enterica under aerobic growth conditions is 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, but under anaerobic growth conditions this bacterium synthesizes pseudo-B12 or Co(α)adenylyl cobamide (1Keck B. Munder M. Renz P. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 171: 66-68Google Scholar, 2Keck B. Renz P. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 76-77Google Scholar). A wide variation of the lower ligand among cobamide-producing procaryotes has been reported (3Rondon M.R. Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 347-384Google Scholar). This variability is of interest because cobalamin is utilized by a wide range of higher organisms regardless of the nature of the lower ligand.The biosynthesis of cobalamin has attracted much interest because of its complexity, but also because it arose early in the evolution of life where it was synthesized only by Archaea and some bacteria. To date, 24 genes have been identified as involved in the biosynthesis of this cofactor (4Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Google Scholar). Of these, four enzymes, CobU, CobT, CobC, and CobS, in S. enterica are involved in the synthesis of the lower ligand and the assembly of the nucleotide loop (Fig.2) (5Maggio-Hall L.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11798-11803Google Scholar). This process starts with guanylylation of the 1-amino-2-propanol-phosphate side chain of adenosylcobinamide phosphate by CobU. CobU is a bifunctional enzyme and has adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide phosphate guanylyltransferase activities (6O'Toole, G. A., Biochemistry and Genetics of Cobalamin Nucleotide Loop Assembly in Salmonella typhimurium.Ph.D. thesis, 1994, University of Wisconsin, Madison.Google Scholar, 7O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23560-23569Google Scholar). Thereafter, the GMP moiety of the activated adenosylcobinamide-GDP is displaced by α-ribazole in the reaction catalyzed by CobS, cobalamin synthase, to form the final product, adenosylcobalamin (8O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3317-3326Google Scholar, 9Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Rubenfield M. Kieffer-Higgins S. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3303-3316Google Scholar). α-Ribazole is synthesized through the sequential action of CobT and CobC (Fig. 2), where CobT is a phosphoribosyltransferase (10Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Google Scholar) and CobC is a phosphatase (11O'Toole G.A. Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26503-26511Google Scholar). CobT has a molecular weight of 39,000 (10Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol.

This latter enzyme is unusual in that it utilizes nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN) as the phosphoribosyl group donor rather than the more abundant NMN where the K m values for NaMN and NMN are 0.68 and 30 mm, respectively (10Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Google Scholar). CobT is also interesting because it synthesizes α-nucleotides via a phosphoribosyl transferase reaction utilizing NaMN as the phosphoribosyl donor in contrast to the much larger family of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate-dependent transferases that synthesize β-nucleotides (12Musik W.D.

Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16125-16135Google Scholar). These studies revealed that CobT is a molecular dimer, and each subunit is composed of a large and a small domain (Fig.3). The large domain exhibits a Rossmann fold, which is characterized by a six-stranded parallel β-sheet and found in dinucleotide binding proteins. The active site is located at the C-terminal end of the β-sheets that form the core of the Rossmann fold. The active site is built from the loops that emerge from the Rossmann fold together with components of the small domain, where the DMB binding pocket is formed by the hydrophobic residues provided by both subunits of the dimer. Interestingly, the orientation of the nucleotide across the β-sheet is opposite to that normally observed in other dinucleotide binding proteins (15Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16125-16135Google Scholar).Figure 3Ribbon representation of the CobT dimer complexed with NaMN and DMPDA.

The large domains are depicted inblue and pink; the small domains aremagenta and green.

The figure was prepared from coordinates with RCSB accession number 14LF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As noted earlier, cobamide contains a wide range of aromatic bases as the lower ligand to the cobalt, which varies according to the biosynthetic organism (16Perlman D. Barrett J.M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1958; 4: 9-15Google Scholar). The diversity of lower ligands appears to be due to a lack of specificity in the phosphoribosyl transferase because CobT from S. enterica has been shown to utilize benzimidazole, imidazole, histidine, DMPDA, and guanine in biochemical assays (10Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Google Scholar). Structural studies of CobT complexed with the alternative lower ligand bases such as adenine, 5-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxybenzimidazole, p-cresol, and phenol revealed that CobT can accommodate all of the commonly observed aromatic bases that constitute the lower ligand (17Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37612-37620Google Scholar). Furthermore, except for the phenolic bases, the phosphorylribosyl transfer reaction occurs readily within the crystalline lattice to yield a product with the correct stereochemistry, as observed in the natural transfer reactions where the stereospecificity is determined by Ser-80 and Gln-88, located at the periphery of the hydrophobic pocket (17Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37612-37620Google Scholar).The studies of CobT thus far have identified factors that contribute to its lack of specificity for aromatic bases but have left unanswered questions surrounding the enzyme mechanism. Importantly, an explanation has been lacking for the preference of CobT for NaMN over the more abundant NMN. This has arisen because it has been difficult to observe the substrate NaMN in the active site because of its hydrolysis by water in the absence of an aromatic base. To overcome this problem, as reported here, crystals of apo-CobT have been grown into which a series of non-reactive aromatic bases could be diffused. Thereafter, addition of NaMN yielded stable enzyme-substrate complexes whose structures could be determined. With this approach, the crystal structures of CobT in complex with intact NaMN and DMPDA, 4-methylcatechol, indole, 3,4-dimethylaniline, 2,5-dimethylaniline, 3,4-dimethylphenol (3,4-DMP), and 2-amino-p-cresol have been determined to at least 2.1 Å resolution. Together with previous studies these structures provide views of the entire reaction pathway for this enzyme.CONCLUSIONSThis study completes the structural characterization of the key steps in the nicotinate mononucleotide:5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase reaction catalyzed by CobT. This was made possible through utilization of a substrate analog of the aromatic base to trap the hydrolytically unstable NaMN in the active site. Clearly the analogs serve to exclude water from the active site adjacent to C1′ of the ribose, even though no ordered water molecules are observed within the binding pockets of either the analog complexes or apo structure. This suggests that the water molecules responsible for hydrolysis of NaMN are transitory in nature. The hydrolysis of the substrate NaMN in the absence of the other aromatic substrate suggests that CobT must bind DMB first to avoid the wasteful hydrolysis of the nucleotide, where this seems to be achieved by the big difference ofK m values between two substrates.The structure of apo-CobT showed that disorder/order transition occurs in the C-terminal loop when DMB binds to CobT. This C-terminal loop provides several hydrophobic residues that are involved in substrate specificity. Conformational flexibility in this part of the molecule is likely necessary to allow the substrates to enter the active site.One of the purposes for undertaking this study was to determine the reason for the specificity of CobT for NaMN over the more abundant NMN, where there is a 44-fold lower K m for the former substrate over the latter. As shown here, there is little difference in the position of the nicotinate group in the putative substrate complex and the products complex. Furthermore, there are few interactions between the carboxylate group and the protein, so it is difficult to identify a specific reason for the lower affinity for NMN. This question must await further study. Cobalamin is the largest and most complex cofactor found in biological systems (Fig. 1). It contains a cobalt ion at the center of a corrin ring that contributes four nitrogen atoms to the coordination sphere of the cobalt ion. Like other macrocyclic tetrapyrroles, the corrin ring has a conjugated double bond system that gives its unique red color. Unlike other macrocyclic tetrapyrroles, the coordination sphere is completed by an upper and lower ligand to the central metal atom cobalt. The biologically active form of the cofactor contains 5′-deoxyadenosyl or a methyl group, while the vitamin form contains a cyano group as the upper ligand. These cobamides are called adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, and cyanocobalamin, respectively. The upper ligand is attached to the cobalt ion by the unusual and labile metal-carbon covalent bond. The lower ligand of the cobamide synthesized by Salmonella enterica under aerobic growth conditions is 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, but under anaerobic growth conditions this bacterium synthesizes pseudo-B12 or Co(α)adenylyl cobamide (1Keck B. Munder M. Renz P. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 171: 66-68Google Scholar, 2Keck B. Renz P. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 76-77Google Scholar). A wide variation of the lower ligand among cobamide-producing procaryotes has been reported (3Rondon M.R. Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16125-16135Google Scholar). These studies revealed that CobT is a molecular dimer, and each subunit is composed of a large and a small domain (Fig.3). The large domain exhibits a Rossmann fold, which is characterized by a six-stranded parallel β-sheet and found in dinucleotide binding proteins. The active site is located at the C-terminal end of the β-sheets that form the core of the Rossmann fold. The active site is built from the loops that emerge from the Rossmann fold together with components of the small domain, where the DMB binding pocket is formed by the hydrophobic residues provided by both subunits of the dimer. Interestingly, the orientation of the nucleotide across the β-sheet is opposite to that normally observed in other dinucleotide binding proteins (15Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16125-16135Google Scholar). As noted earlier, cobamide contains a wide range of aromatic bases as the lower ligand to the cobalt, which varies according to the biosynthetic organism (16Perlman D. Barrett J.M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1958; 4: 9-15Google Scholar). The diversity of lower ligands appears to be due to a lack of specificity in the phosphoribosyl transferase because CobT from S. enterica has been shown to utilize benzimidazole, imidazole, histidine, DMPDA, and guanine in biochemical assays (10Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Google Scholar). Structural studies of CobT complexed with the alternative lower ligand bases such as adenine, 5-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxybenzimidazole, p-cresol, and phenol revealed that CobT can accommodate all of the commonly observed aromatic bases that constitute the lower ligand (17Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37612-37620Google Scholar). Furthermore, except for the phenolic bases, the phosphorylribosyl transfer reaction occurs readily within the crystalline lattice to yield a product with the correct stereochemistry, as observed in the natural transfer reactions where the stereospecificity is determined by Ser-80 and Gln-88, located at the periphery of the hydrophobic pocket (17Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37612-37620Google Scholar). The studies of CobT thus far have identified factors that contribute to its lack of specificity for aromatic bases but have left unanswered questions surrounding the enzyme mechanism. Importantly, an explanation has been lacking for the preference of CobT for NaMN over the more abundant NMN. This has arisen because it has been difficult to observe the substrate NaMN in the active site because of its hydrolysis by water in the absence of an aromatic base. To overcome this problem, as reported here, crystals of apo-CobT have been grown into which a series of non-reactive aromatic bases could be diffused. Thereafter, addition of NaMN yielded stable enzyme-substrate complexes whose structures could be determined. With this approach, the crystal structures of CobT in complex with intact NaMN and DMPDA, 4-methylcatechol, indole, 3,4-dimethylaniline, 2,5-dimethylaniline, 3,4-dimethylphenol (3,4-DMP), and 2-amino-p-cresol have been determined to at least 2.1 Å resolution. Together with previous studies these structures provide views of the entire reaction pathway for this enzyme. CONCLUSIONSThis study completes the structural characterization of the key steps in the nicotinate mononucleotide:5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase reaction catalyzed by CobT. This was made possible through utilization of a substrate analog of the aromatic base to trap the hydrolytically unstable NaMN in the active site. Clearly the analogs serve to exclude water from the active site adjacent to C1′ of the ribose, even though no ordered water molecules are observed within the binding pockets of either the analog complexes or apo structure. This suggests that the water molecules responsible for hydrolysis of NaMN are transitory in nature. The hydrolysis of the substrate NaMN in the absence of the other aromatic substrate suggests that CobT must bind DMB first to avoid the wasteful hydrolysis of the nucleotide, where this seems to be achieved by the big difference ofK m values between two substrates.The structure of apo-CobT showed that disorder/order transition occurs in the C-terminal loop when DMB binds to CobT. This C-terminal loop provides several hydrophobic residues that are involved in substrate specificity. Conformational flexibility in this part of the molecule is likely necessary to allow the substrates to enter the active site.One of the purposes for undertaking this study was to determine the reason for the specificity of CobT for NaMN over the more abundant NMN, where there is a 44-fold lower K m for the former substrate over the latter. As shown here, there is little difference in the position of the nicotinate group in the putative substrate complex and the products complex. Furthermore, there are few interactions between the carboxylate group and the protein, so it is difficult to identify a specific reason for the lower affinity for NMN. This question must await further study. This study completes the structural characterization of the key steps in the nicotinate mononucleotide:5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase reaction catalyzed by CobT. This was made possible through utilization of a substrate analog of the aromatic base to trap the hydrolytically unstable NaMN in the active site.

We recently established two pancreatic β-cell MIN6 cell lines that are glucose-responsive (MIN6-m9) and glucose-unresponsive (MIN6-m14). In the present study we have determined the cause of the glucose unresponsiveness in MIN6-m14. Initially, elevated [Ca2+] i was observed in MIN6-m14, but normalization of the [Ca2+] i by nifedipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, markedly improved the intracellular Ca2+ response to glucose and the glucose-induced insulin secretion. The expression of subunits of ATP-sensitive K+channels and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels were increased at both mRNA and protein levels in MIN6-m14 treated with nifedipine. As a consequence, the functional expression of these channels at the cell surface, both of which are decreased in MIN6-m14 without nifedipine treatment, were increased significantly. Contrariwise, Bay K8644, a Ca2+ channel agonist, caused severe impairment of glucose-induced insulin secretion in glucose-responsive MIN6-m9 due to decreased expression of the channel subunits.

In pancreatic β-cells, a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ) is the trigger for insulin secretion. As the extracellular glucose concentration increases, intracellular ATP is increased and the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are closed, depolarizing the plasma membrane and opening the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs),1 which allows Ca2+ influx. The rise in [Ca2+] i in the β-cells triggers exocytosis of the insulin granules (9Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When the blood glucose level falls, [Ca2+] i returns to basal level. In this context, persistent hyperglycemia might well cause sustained elevated [Ca2+] i and abnormalities in glucose-induced insulin secretion. It has been reported that human pancreatic islets cultured with high glucose show elevated basal [Ca2+] i together with loss of the glucose-induced rise in [Ca2+] i and glucose-induced insulin secretion (10Bjorklund A. Lansner A. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

However, the molecular basis of the effect of chronic elevation of [Ca2+] i on insulin secretion has not been examined in detail, primarily because an appropriate in vitro model has not been available.We recently established two pancreatic β-cell lines with contrary features, glucose-responsive (MIN6-m9) and glucose-unresponsive (MIN6-m14), and have shown these cell lines to be useful in β-cell studies (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MIN6-m9 exhibit glucose metabolism and insulin secretion similar to normal pancreatic β-cells, while MIN6-m14 exhibit abnormalities in glucose metabolism, KATP channel activity, VDCC activity, and glucose-induced insulin secretion (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study we have determined the factors responsible for the glucose-unresponsiveness in MIN6-m14. [Ca2+] i in MIN6-m14 is significantly higher than in MIN6-m9. When the [Ca2+] i level was normalized by nifedipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, the glucose-induced insulin secretion was increased dramatically in MIN6-m14 with a concomitant improvement of KATP channel and VDCC activities. Accordingly, chronically elevated [Ca2+] i is the major factor contributing to the defect in glucose responsiveness of MIN6-m14, and normalization of [Ca2+] i restores the glucose-responsive state of the cells. Because abnormalities of [Ca2+] i in pancreatic β-cells are associated with chronic exposure to high glucose in both normal and diabetic animals (8Levy J.

We previously demonstrated decreased activities of KATP channels and VDCCs in glucose-unresponsive MIN6-m14 (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KATP channels and VDCCs serve a crucial role in coupling glucose metabolism to exocytosis of the insulin granules in pancreatic β-cells (18Seino S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 337-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Here we show that MIN6-m14 exhibit elevated [Ca2+] i compared with glucose-responsive MIN6-m9, and that normalization of [Ca2+] i by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine restores the activities of both KATP channels and VDCCs to repair glucose-induced insulin secretion in MIN6-m14. It should be noted that normalization of [Ca2+] i also was achieved by the KATP channel opener diazoxide with effects similar to those of nifedipine. Moreover, the Ca2+channel agonist Bay K8644 exerted effects contrary to the channel blocker in glucose-responsive MIN6-m9. These findings confirm that chronically elevated [Ca2+] i is the major cause of the glucose unresponsiveness in MIN6-m14.The activities of KATP channels and VDCCs can be regulated by various factors, including gene expression, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and trafficking to the plasma membrane (21–36). Our data show that normalization of [Ca2+] i increases the expression of both KATP channels and VDCCs. In particular, Kir6.2, the pore-forming subunit of the KATP channels of pancreatic β-cells (23Beguin P. Nagashima K. Nishimura M. Gonoi T. Seino S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4722-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the α1-subunit of the VDCCs, also the pore-forming subunit of the channel (24Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Birnbaumer L. Tsien R.W. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 533-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), were strongly up-regulated at both the mRNA (Fig. 5) and protein levels (Fig. 6). Contrariwise, Bay K8644, a Ca2+ channel agonist, decreased the expression of the Kir6.2 subunit of KATP channels and the α1-subunit of VDCCs (Fig. 7 F). Little is known of the regulation of these channel expressions, but it has been reported that high glucose leads to marked decreases in both Kir6.2 and SUR1 expression in isolated rat pancreatic islets as well as in the INS-1 β-cell line (25Moritz W. Leech C.A. Ferrer J. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A decrease in Kir6.2 expression also has been noted in pancreatic islets of Zucker diabetic fatty rats (26Tokuyama Y. Fan Z. Furuta H. Makielski J.C. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Yano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mRNA expression of the α- and β-subunits of VDCCs are down-regulated in high glucose-infused rats, but diazoxide restores expression (27Iwashima Y. Pugh W. Depaoli A.M. Takeda J. Seino S. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Iwashima Y. Abiko A. Ushikubi F. Hata A. Kaku K. Sano H. Eto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). mRNA levels of the α1-subunit of VDCCs also are reduced in pancreatic β-cells of Zucker diabetic fatty rats (29Tokuyama Y. Sturis J. DePaoli A.M. Takeda J. Stoffel M. Tang J. Sun X. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because persistent hyperglycemia causes sustained elevation of [Ca2+] i in the β-cells (8Levy J. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Bjorklund A. Lansner A. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), these observations may well be the result of alteration in [Ca2+] i . Considering these findings together, [Ca2+] i most likely regulates the expression of KATP channels and VDCCs at the transcriptional level. It recently has been shown that intracellular membrane trafficking of ion channel subunits is important in the functional expression of these channels at the cell surface (30Zerangue N. Schwappach B.

Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S175-S191Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of intracellular Ca2+ on membrane trafficking of the channels, we measured the protein levels of the channel subunits in different subcellular fractions. However, the relative abundance of the KATP channel subunits and the VDCC subunits in plasma membrane fraction and internal membrane fraction was similar in MIN6-m14 before and after nifedipine treatment, indicating that membrane trafficking of these channel subunits is not affected by [Ca2+] i .MIN6-m14 exhibit abnormalities not only in glucose responsiveness but also in glucose sensitivity. As in normal pancreatic islets, half-maximal insulin secretion occurs at 15 mm glucose in MIN6-m9, while the value is below 1 mm in MIN6-m14 cells (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although glucose responsiveness (intracellular Ca2+response to glucose and amount of secreted insulin) was dramatically improved by normalization of [Ca2+] i , glucose sensitivity remained unchanged (Figs. 2 A and 7 A). GK is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis in β-cells and is thought to be a glucose sensor for glucose-induced insulin secretion (38Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 39Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) because it has a K m value higher than the physiological concentration of glucose. However, MIN6-m14 predominantly expresses HK-I, a low K m isoform of the glucose-phosphorylating enzyme, and > 90% of the activity occurs at 0.5 mm of glucose (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which might well lead to abnormal glucose sensitivity. Normalization of [Ca2+] i did not alter the expression of two isoforms of the enzyme (Fig. 5) or their activities (Fig.3 A), which might account for the unchanged glucose sensitivity of MIN6-m14 before and after normalization of [Ca2+] i by nifedipine. Taken together with the findings on LDH activity and ATP production in MIN6-m14 cells, glucose metabolism apparently is not influenced by changes in [Ca2+] i and is regulated independently of KATP channel and VDCC activities.In conclusion, chronically elevated [Ca2+] i induces glucose unresponsiveness in MIN6-m14 by decreasing the expression of both KATP channels and VDCCs at the protein level. Normalization of [Ca2+] i by nifedipine or diazoxide induces a glucose-responsive state from a glucose-unresponsive state by restoring the functional expressions of these channels. Since abrogation of intracellular Ca2+homeostasis in pancreatic β-cells has been shown to be associated with impaired insulin secretion (8Levy J.

In pancreatic β-cells, a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ) is the trigger for insulin secretion. As the extracellular glucose concentration increases, intracellular ATP is increased and the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are closed, depolarizing the plasma membrane and opening the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs),1 which allows Ca2+ influx. The rise in [Ca2+] i in the β-cells triggers exocytosis of the insulin granules (9Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When the blood glucose level falls, [Ca2+] i returns to basal level. In this context, persistent hyperglycemia might well cause sustained elevated [Ca2+] i and abnormalities in glucose-induced insulin secretion. It has been reported that human pancreatic islets cultured with high glucose show elevated basal [Ca2+] i together with loss of the glucose-induced rise in [Ca2+] i and glucose-induced insulin secretion (10Bjorklund A. Lansner A. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Normal pancreatic β-cells exposed to high glucose exhibit an abnormal response of intracellular Ca2+ and impaired insulin secretion (11Okamoto Y. Ishida H. Taminato T. Tsuji K. Kurose T. Tsuura Y.

However, the molecular basis of the effect of chronic elevation of [Ca2+] i on insulin secretion has not been examined in detail, primarily because an appropriate in vitro model has not been available. We recently established two pancreatic β-cell lines with contrary features, glucose-responsive (MIN6-m9) and glucose-unresponsive (MIN6-m14), and have shown these cell lines to be useful in β-cell studies (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MIN6-m9 exhibit glucose metabolism and insulin secretion similar to normal pancreatic β-cells, while MIN6-m14 exhibit abnormalities in glucose metabolism, KATP channel activity, VDCC activity, and glucose-induced insulin secretion (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have determined the factors responsible for the glucose-unresponsiveness in MIN6-m14. [Ca2+] i in MIN6-m14 is significantly higher than in MIN6-m9. When the [Ca2+] i level was normalized by nifedipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, the glucose-induced insulin secretion was increased dramatically in MIN6-m14 with a concomitant improvement of KATP channel and VDCC activities. Accordingly, chronically elevated [Ca2+] i is the major factor contributing to the defect in glucose responsiveness of MIN6-m14, and normalization of [Ca2+] i restores the glucose-responsive state of the cells. Because abnormalities of [Ca2+] i in pancreatic β-cells are associated with chronic exposure to high glucose in both normal and diabetic animals (8Levy J.

DISCUSSIONWe used two clonal pancreatic β-cell lines, MIN6-m9 and MIN6-m14, in the present study as models of glucose-responsive and glucose-unresponsive β-cells, respectively. We previously demonstrated decreased activities of KATP channels and VDCCs in glucose-unresponsive MIN6-m14 (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KATP channels and VDCCs serve a crucial role in coupling glucose metabolism to exocytosis of the insulin granules in pancreatic β-cells (18Seino S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 337-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Here we show that MIN6-m14 exhibit elevated [Ca2+] i compared with glucose-responsive MIN6-m9, and that normalization of [Ca2+] i by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine restores the activities of both KATP channels and VDCCs to repair glucose-induced insulin secretion in MIN6-m14. It should be noted that normalization of [Ca2+] i also was achieved by the KATP channel opener diazoxide with effects similar to those of nifedipine. Moreover, the Ca2+channel agonist Bay K8644 exerted effects contrary to the channel blocker in glucose-responsive MIN6-m9. These findings confirm that chronically elevated [Ca2+] i is the major cause of the glucose unresponsiveness in MIN6-m14.The activities of KATP channels and VDCCs can be regulated by various factors, including gene expression, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and trafficking to the plasma membrane (21–36). Our data show that normalization of [Ca2+] i increases the expression of both KATP channels and VDCCs. In particular, Kir6.2, the pore-forming subunit of the KATP channels of pancreatic β-cells (23Beguin P. Nagashima K. Nishimura M. Gonoi T. Seino S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4722-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the α1-subunit of the VDCCs, also the pore-forming subunit of the channel (24Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Birnbaumer L. Tsien R.W. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 533-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), were strongly up-regulated at both the mRNA (Fig. 5) and protein levels (Fig. 6). Contrariwise, Bay K8644, a Ca2+ channel agonist, decreased the expression of the Kir6.2 subunit of KATP channels and the α1-subunit of VDCCs (Fig. 7 F). Little is known of the regulation of these channel expressions, but it has been reported that high glucose leads to marked decreases in both Kir6.2 and SUR1 expression in isolated rat pancreatic islets as well as in the INS-1 β-cell line (25Moritz W. Leech C.A. Ferrer J. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A decrease in Kir6.2 expression also has been noted in pancreatic islets of Zucker diabetic fatty rats (26Tokuyama Y. Fan Z. Furuta H. Makielski J.C. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Yano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mRNA expression of the α- and β-subunits of VDCCs are down-regulated in high glucose-infused rats, but diazoxide restores expression (27Iwashima Y. Pugh W. Depaoli A.M. Takeda J. Seino S. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Iwashima Y. Abiko A. Ushikubi F. Hata A. Kaku K. Sano H. Eto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). mRNA levels of the α1-subunit of VDCCs also are reduced in pancreatic β-cells of Zucker diabetic fatty rats (29Tokuyama Y. Sturis J. DePaoli A.M. Takeda J. Stoffel M. Tang J. Sun X. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because persistent hyperglycemia causes sustained elevation of [Ca2+] i in the β-cells (8Levy J. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Bjorklund A. Lansner A. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), these observations may well be the result of alteration in [Ca2+] i . Considering these findings together, [Ca2+] i most likely regulates the expression of KATP channels and VDCCs at the transcriptional level. It recently has been shown that intracellular membrane trafficking of ion channel subunits is important in the functional expression of these channels at the cell surface (30Zerangue N. Schwappach B.

Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S175-S191Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of intracellular Ca2+ on membrane trafficking of the channels, we measured the protein levels of the channel subunits in different subcellular fractions. However, the relative abundance of the KATP channel subunits and the VDCC subunits in plasma membrane fraction and internal membrane fraction was similar in MIN6-m14 before and after nifedipine treatment, indicating that membrane trafficking of these channel subunits is not affected by [Ca2+] i .MIN6-m14 exhibit abnormalities not only in glucose responsiveness but also in glucose sensitivity. As in normal pancreatic islets, half-maximal insulin secretion occurs at 15 mm glucose in MIN6-m9, while the value is below 1 mm in MIN6-m14 cells (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although glucose responsiveness (intracellular Ca2+response to glucose and amount of secreted insulin) was dramatically improved by normalization of [Ca2+] i , glucose sensitivity remained unchanged (Figs. 2 A and 7 A). GK is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis in β-cells and is thought to be a glucose sensor for glucose-induced insulin secretion (38Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 39Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) because it has a K m value higher than the physiological concentration of glucose. However, MIN6-m14 predominantly expresses HK-I, a low K m isoform of the glucose-phosphorylating enzyme, and > 90% of the activity occurs at 0.5 mm of glucose (15Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which might well lead to abnormal glucose sensitivity. Normalization of [Ca2+] i did not alter the expression of two isoforms of the enzyme (Fig. 5) or their activities (Fig.3 A), which might account for the unchanged glucose sensitivity of MIN6-m14 before and after normalization of [Ca2+] i by nifedipine. Taken together with the findings on LDH activity and ATP production in MIN6-m14 cells, glucose metabolism apparently is not influenced by changes in [Ca2+] i and is regulated independently of KATP channel and VDCC activities.In conclusion, chronically elevated [Ca2+] i induces glucose unresponsiveness in MIN6-m14 by decreasing the expression of both KATP channels and VDCCs at the protein level. Normalization of [Ca2+] i by nifedipine or diazoxide induces a glucose-responsive state from a glucose-unresponsive state by restoring the functional expressions of these channels.

The β-chemokine receptor C-C chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) provides a mechanism for the selective recruitment of eosinophils into tissue and thus has recently become an attractive biological target for therapeutic intervention. In order to develop in vivo models of inflammatory diseases, it is essential to identify and characterize the homologues of human eotaxin (C-C chemokine ligand 11) and CCR3 from other species, such as non-human primates. Accordingly, we cloned the macaque eotaxin and CCR3 genes and revealed that they were 91 and 92% identical at the amino acid level to their human homologues, respectively. Macaque CCR3 expressed in the murine pre-B L1-2 cell line bound macaque eotaxin with high affinity (Kd = 0.1 nm) and exhibited a robust eotaxin-induced Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis. Characterization of β-chemokines on native macaque CCR3 on eosinophils was performed by means of eotaxin-induced shape change in whole blood using a novel signaling assay known as gated autofluorescence forward scatter. Additionally, mAbs were raised against macaque CCR3 using two different immunogens: a 30-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from the predicted NH2 terminus of macaque CCR3 and intact macaque CCR3-transfected cells. These anti-macaque CCR3 monoclonal antibodies exhibited potent antagonist activity in receptor binding and functional assays. The characterization of the macaque eotaxin/CCR3 axis and development of antagonistic anti-macaque CCR3 monoclonal antibodies will facilitate the development of CCR3 small molecule antagonists with the hope of ameliorating chronic inflammatory diseases in humans.

In the pathophysiology of the disease, a chronic inflammatory condition persists in the airways of most patients, which involves a complex interplay between blood leukocytes, airway epithelial cells, and bronchial smooth muscle cells. One of the most striking aspects of asthma is the selective accumulation and activation of distinct subtypes of leukocytes into the airways, particularly eosinophils, and it is these cells that are postulated to play a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease (1Gleich G.J. Adolphson C.R. Leiferman K.M. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed.

Inflammatory mediators, such as chemoattractants, generated at the involved sites, promote the migration of eosinophils from the vasculature into the tissue. Unlike eicosanoids and complement cleavage fragments, which display activities on a wide variety of cells, candidate molecules for the selective recruitment of eosinophils into the airways are a class of proteins called chemotactic cytokines or chemokines. Chemokines are a growing superfamily of >50 small molecular mass proteins (∼8–10 kDa) and are characterized by their actions on distinct subtypes of leukocytes (3Mackay C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 4Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar). These proteins can be classified into two major subfamilies based on the arrangement of the first two conserved cysteines in the protein. In the α or C-X-C family, these two cysteines are separated by any amino acid, whereas in the β or C-C family, these two cysteines are adjacent to one another. Some members of this latter family have been discovered to possess strong eosinophil migratory and activating properties. Chemokines exert their effects by binding to members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily of receptors, which contain seven transmembrane domains. The discovery of a potent eosinophil-specific β-chemokine, eotaxin, isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)1fluid from ovalbumin-challenged guinea pigs (5Jose P.J. Griffiths-Johnson D.A.

Although its expression was first thought to be limited to eosinophils, CCR3 is now known to be more widely expressed on cells involved in allergic inflammation, such as basophils (9Uguccioni M.

Chemokines that are selective for CCR3 include eotaxin, eotaxin-2, and eotaxin-3, whereas the potent eosinophil-activating β-chemokines RANTES, MCP-3, and MCP-4 bind to other chemokine receptors in addition to CCR3 (13Lilly C.M.

The relatively high expression of CCR3 on eosinophils, along with expression of specific CCR3-activating β-chemokines in the involved tissue affords a potent mechanism for the selective recruitment, activation, and retention of this cell type into tissue sites during allergic inflammation. It has been shown with a blocking monoclonal antibody directed against human CCR3 that the actions of multiple β-chemokines on eosinophils are mediated through CCR3 (27Heath H. Qin S. Rao P., Wu, L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Ponath P.D. Mackay C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), indicating that CCR3 is the major β-chemokine receptor expressed on these cells. For these reasons, CCR3 has recently emerged as a significant anti-inflammatory pharmacological target, and CCR3 antagonists are currently being developed for the treatment of asthma and other allergic disorders (28Conroy D.M. Williams T.J. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,29Barnes P.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).

To gain a better understanding of the role of CCR3 and its ligands in this important animal model of asthma, we have cloned and functionally expressed the macaque CCR3 in the murine pre-B L1-2 cell line. We have also cloned the macaque eotaxin and employed chemically synthesized protein to functionally characterize the macaque CCR3. Moreover, we have generated murine monoclonal antibodies directed against the macaque CCR3 using two different immunizing antigens and have demonstrated that these mAbs are potent functional antagonists of this receptor through a series of receptor binding and signaling assays in vitro. Genomic DNA was isolated from venous blood of cynomolgus 2All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with applicable local and federal animal welfare regulations. and rhesus macaques (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta, respectively; Merck Research Laboratories, in-house colony) using the QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Also, cynomolgus macaque DNA was purchased from Therion (Troy, NY), and rhesus macaque DNA was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Southern blot hybridization was performed using standard procedures (41Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1982: 382-389Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA (20 μg) was digested with a set of restriction enzymes for 7 h, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and then separation on a 0.7% agarose/Tris acetate-EDTA gel. The gel was then saturated in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m NaOH (to denature the DNA) for 45 min followed by neutralization in 1.5m NaCl and 1 m Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) for 45 min. DNA was transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (AmershamBiosciences) using 20× SSC as transfer buffer. Prehybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, followed by hybridization for 16 h in the identical solution containing 2 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled 1.1-kb human CCR3 DNA fragment (Ready-to-Go DNA labeling kit; AmershamBiosciences) comprising the open reading frame (7Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.A. Malkowitz L. Sirotina A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min; twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min; once at 55 °C for 15 min; and once at 65 °C for 15 min. The membrane was then exposed onto Eastman Kodak Co. X-OMAT film and developed. PCR was performed using cynomolgus and rhesus macaque genomic DNA as template with primers designed from the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the human CCR3 gene. The 5′-primer contained the sequence −23 to −3 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon and a HindIII site (5′-GGC-TTA-AGC-TTC-TAT-CAC-AGG-GAG-AAG-TG-3′). The 3′-primer contained the sequence 11–29 bp downstream of the TAG termination codon and aNotI site (5′-CTT-CAT-CTC-CTT-GCG-GCC-GCT-CCT-CTT-TAG-GCA-ATT-TTC-3′). PCR was performed for 30 cycles: 94 °C for 60 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 2 min in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 9600 DNA thermal cycler. The resultant PCR products from the cynomolgus and rhesus DNA were subcloned into expression vector pBJ-Neo (7Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.A. Malkowitz L. Sirotina A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and pcDEF3 (42Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (a generous gift from Dr. J. Langer, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey), respectively. Poly(A)+mRNA was isolated by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography from rhesus macaque small intestine and used to generate first strand cDNA using a tagged oligo(dT) primer (3′-RACE kit; Invitrogen). The cDNA was then used as template for PCR performed with the following two primers: 5′-primer (5′-AAC-CAC-CAC-CTC-TCA-CGC-C-3′) and 3′-primer (5′-CAG-GCT-CTG-GTT-TGG-TTT-CAA-3′). PCR was performed for 30 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The resultant PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). A consensus sequence for rhesus macaque eotaxin was identified by DNA sequencing of six independent clones. The rhesus macaque eotaxin protein was chemically synthesized (Gryphon Sciences, South San Francisco, CA) based on the predicted amino acid sequence. The murine pre-B L1-2 cell line was a generous gift from Dr. I. Weissman (Stanford University). Transfection of the L1-2 and AML14.3D10 cell lines were carried out as described (7Daugherty B.L.

Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were washed in Hanks’ balanced saline solution, mixed with 20 μg of pcDEF3-rhesus CCR3 or pcDEF3-human CCR3 (for L1-2 transfection), and pBJ/Neo-cynomolgus CCR3 (for AML14.3D10 transfection) in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette, electroporated at 250 V and 960 microfarads, and then cultured in complete medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum). After 48 h, the cells were placed in medium containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 and plated onto 96-well plates at 18,000 cells/well. Clones were transferred into six-well plates, and positive clones were selected by their ability to bind125I-human eotaxin (Amersham Biosciences). 125I-Human eotaxin (2000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and125I-macaque eotaxin (2000 Ci/mmol) was custom-radioiodinated at Amersham Biosciences. L1-2/macaque CCR3 cells (30,000 cells/assay for 125I-macaque eotaxin and 200,000 cells/assay for 125I-human eotaxin) were mixed with 30 pm (∼20,000 cpm) iodinated chemokine and varying concentrations of β-chemokines (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) in a binding buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min essentially as described (7Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.A. Malkowitz L. Sirotina A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Radioactivity retained on polyethyleneimine-treated Whatman GFC membranes after washing in binding buffer (using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences harvester) containing 0.5m NaCl was counted in a TopCount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Binding results were analyzed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) and LIGAND (43Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Changes in intracellular calcium level were measured on a fluorescence imaging plate reader (FLIPR; excitation 488-nm argon laser line/emission 530-nm bandpass interference filter; Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions with modifications. L1-2/macaque CCR3 or L1-2/human CCR3 cells were washed in wash buffer (Hanks’ balanced saline solution containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and labeled with fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in labeling buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. Labeling buffer was prepared as follows. 50 μg of fluo-3 was dissolved in 44 μl of 10% pluronic F-127 in Me2SO and then added to 11 ml of wash buffer. Following labeling with fluo-3, cells were washed twice in wash buffer. About 1.5 × 105 cells in 135 μl of wash buffer were added to each well of a 96-well plate (black, clear bottom; Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and then centrifuged for 5 min (no brake). The plate was placed on FLIPR, 67.5-μl ligands (one-half of the cell volume) at various concentrations were added, and fluorescence changes were recorded. For blocking experiments, mAbs were preincubated with cells for 20 min before 3 nm macaque eotaxin was added. Results were calculated using KaleidaGraph. L1-2/macaque CCR3 cells were labeled with 5 μm calcein (Molecular Probes), washed, and resuspended in chemotaxis buffer (RPMI 1640 plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin) at 5 × 106 cells/ml. To the bottom chamber of a 96-well Neuroprobe ChemoTx plate (5-μm pore size; NeuroProbe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), increasing concentrations of chemokine were added in a volume of 29 μl of chemotaxis buffer. To the top chamber, 30 μl of cells (1.5 × 105 total cells) were added, and chemotaxis was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 1 h. Unmigrated cells were removed from membrane with a Kimwipe. The plate was then analyzed in a CytoFluor II fluorometer (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm; PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). For blocking experiments, 5 nm macaque eotaxin was added to the bottom chamber. To the top chamber, 15 μl of cells (1.5 × 105 total) was mixed together with 15 μl of mAb at various concentrations. GAFS assays were performed as described (44Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P.D. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 3T. Hansel, personal communication. with modifications for whole blood. Briefly, 90 μl of fresh rhesus macaque blood was mixed with varying concentrations of chemokines (in 10 μl) in 1.2-ml polypropylene tubes, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then transferred onto ice. To preserve the shape change, the cells were fixed in 250 μl of ice-cold optimized fixative solution containing 2.5% Cytofix (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), 22.5% H2O, and 75% FACSflow (BD Biosciences) and left on ice for 2 min. The mixture was then transferred into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (155 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3) in a Falcon tube (catalog no. 2052) and left on ice for another 20 min to achieve uniform red cell lysis. For blocking experiments, aliquots of blood were preincubated with mAbs in a total volume of 90 μl for 20 min at room temperature before 10 μl of macaque eotaxin (7.5 nm final concentration) was added. The samples were run on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data from 30,000 cells from each sample were collected. Eosinophils were gated out based on their high autofluorescence, and mean forward scatter was calculated by Consort 40/VAX software (Becton Dickinson, Immunocytometry Systems). Typically, more than 4,500 eosinophils in each sample were analyzed. The mean forward scatter of the eosinophils in each sample was determined, and a dose-response curve for each chemokine or mAb was generated accordingly. Two immunizing antigens were used to generate monoclonal antibodies against the macaque CCR3. The first approach used viable whole L1-2 cells stably expressing the full-length macaque CCR3 sequence as immunogen, essentially as described (27Heath H. Qin S. Rao P., Wu, L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Ponath P.D. Mackay C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) with some modifications. About 1.5 × 107 L1-2/rhesus macaque CCR3 cells were injected into C57b/6 mice. Intraperitoneal injections were performed four times at 2-week intervals (Cell Essentials, Boston, MA). Postimmune mouse sera were tested by flow cytometry and inhibition of125I-human eotaxin binding on AML14.3D10-cynomolgus macaque CCR3 transfectants versus untransfected AML14.3D10 cells. The most potent serum blocked 125I-human eotaxin binding by 50% at 1:1000 serum dilution and blocked this binding completely at 1:125 dilution (data not shown). The mice whose sera were most potent in flow cytometry and inhibition of 125I-human eotaxin binding were chosen for fusion. The final injection of whole L1-2/rhesus macaque CCR3 cells was performed intravenously. Three days postinjection, mouse splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells. Approximately 1600 hybridoma clones were obtained from two fusions (Cell Essentials). To eliminate any clones that reacted to native L1-2 cell surface antigens, screening of hybridoma supernatants was performed by flow cytometry on AML14.3D10/cynomolgus macaque CCR3 cells. In the second approach, a peptide (30-mer) was synthesized (Gryphon Sciences), corresponding to the predicted NH2terminus of the macaque CCR3 amino acid sequence (TTS-LDT-VET-FGP-TSY-DDD-MGL-LCE-KAD-VGA-norleucinal-amide). The peptide was conjugated to thyroglobulin and injected into BALB/c mice at 3-week intervals. Mouse sera were tested by flow cytometry on L1-2/macaque CCR3 cells versus L1-2 untransfected cells and inhibition of 125I-human eotaxin binding to L1-2/macaque CCR3 cells. Postimmune sera possessed similar potency as those using whole L1-2/macaque CCR3 cells as immunogen. As above, the mouse that produced the most potent serum was used for fusion. A total of about 600 hybridoma clones were obtained by this method from a single fusion. Positive hybridoma clones were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (see below) and tested by flow cytometry on L1-2/macaque CCR3 cells. Positive clones identified from both approaches tested positive on L1-2/macaque CCR3 and negative on the parental L1-2 cell line by flow cytometry. Hybridoma clones producing anti-macaque CCR3 mAbs were subcloned to ensure purity and then injected into mice for ascites production. The IgG fraction from the ascites fluid was purified by protein A chromatography and dialyzed against PBS. Antibody concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The isotype of the anti-macaque CCR3 mAbs was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. About 5 × 105 cells (L1.2/rhesus macaque CCR3, AML14.3D10/cynomolgus macaque CCR3, or partially purified rhesus eosinophils or PBMCs) were washed in staining buffer (PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum); subsequently, normal goat IgG (10 μg/ml final concentration, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Hybridoma supernatant (50 μl), purified anti-macaque CCR3 mAbs, mouse IgG (ICN) (negative control), or mouse anti-human CD11b (BD Biosciences; clone ICRF44), all at 3 μg/ml, was then added to the cells incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed, and then fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (5 μg/ml; ICN) was added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For the rhesus macaque PBMCs, R-phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human CD3 mAb (clone SP34; BD Biosciences) was incubated as above. The cells were washed and resuspended at 106/ml in staining buffer containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer or FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Bovine serum albumin-conjugated macaque CCR3 NH2-terminal peptide (4 μg/ml in PBS) was loaded onto 96-well plates (100 μl/well) and incubated at 4 °C for 18 h. The plates were then washed three times with PBS. Blocking solution (3% fish gel in PBS, 300 μl/well) was added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The plates were then washed, and hybridoma supernatant was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The supernatant was removed, and the plates were washed in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Horseradish peroxidase enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 30 min. The plates were washed again in PBS containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. ABTS-100 substrate solution was then added and incubated for 30 min for color development. Clones that gave a signal/noise ratio of greater than 3 were picked for further analysis. Rhesu"
https://openalex.org/W2059842925,"Thrombopoietin (TPO), the primary regulator of platelet production, is composed of an amino-terminal 152 amino acids, sufficient for activity, and a carboxyl-terminal region rich in carbohydrates (183 residues) that enhances secretion of the molecule. Full-length TPO is secreted at levels 10–20-fold greater than truncated TPO. By introducing into mammalian cells a novel cDNA encoding the TPO secretory leader linked to its carboxyl-terminal domain (TPO glycan domain (TGD)), we tested whether TGD could function in trans to enhance secretion of TPO. The artificial TGD was secreted, inactive in proliferation assays, and did not inhibit TPO activity. However, when co-transfected with a cDNA encoding truncated TPO, TGD enhanced secretion 4-fold, measured by specific bioassay and immunoassay. TGD also enhanced secretion of granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor and stem cell factor but did not affect the production of erythropoietin, interleukin-3, growth hormone, or of full-length TPO. To localize TGD function, we added an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal to TGD and, separately, deleted the secretory leader. Deletion of the secretory leader attenuated the secretory function of TGD, whereas addition of the ER retention signal did not alter its function. To investigate the physiologic role of TGD in folding and proteasomal protection, we tested full-length and truncated TPO in assays of protein refolding, and we examined protein stability in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. We found that truncated TGD re-folds readily and that proteasome-mediated degradation contributes to the poor secretion of truncated TPO. We conclude that TGD enhances secretion of TPO and can additionally function as an inter-molecular chaperone, in part because of its ability to prevent degradation of the hormone. The cellular location of TGD action is likely to be within the ER or earlier in the secretory pathway.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). TPO acts at both early (2Zeigler F.C. de-Sauvage F. Widmer H.R. Keller G.A. Donahue C. Schreiber R.D. Malloy B. Hass P. Eaton D. Matthews W. Blood. 1994; 84: 4045-4052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and late stages of megakaryopoiesis (3Debili N. Wendling F. Katz A. Guichard J. Breton Gorius J. Hunt P.

The hormone also acts in synergy with erythropoietin (EPO) to stimulate erythropoiesis (6Kaushansky K.K. Broudy V.C. Grossman A. Humes J. Lin N. Ren H.P. Bailey M.C. Papayannopoulou T. Forstrom J.W. Sprugel K.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1683-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have revealed TPO to be both necessary and sufficient for full MK1 maturation (6Kaushansky K.K. Broudy V.C. Grossman A. Humes J. Lin N. Ren H.P. Bailey M.C. Papayannopoulou T. Forstrom J.W. Sprugel K.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1683-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As a therapeutic agent TPO has been shown to speed platelet recovery following myelosuppressive therapy in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (7Vadhan-Raj S. Verschraegen C.F. Bueso-Ramos C. Broxmeyer H.E. Kudelka A.P. Freedman R.S. Edwards C.L. Gershenson D. Jones D. Ashby M. Kavanagh J.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 2000; 132: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,8Basser R.L.

In addition, the biological effects of TPO are not limited to the MK lineage; the growth of erythroid (burst forming unit-erythrocyte) and myeloid (colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophage) colony-forming cells is also expanded by TPO in vitro, and its use in normal and myelosuppressed mice and non-human primates leads to enhanced recovery of multiple hematopoietic lineages (9Kaushansky K.

Tsumura H. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 94: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, TPO affects the survival and proliferation of primitive hematopoietic stem cells in vitro (11Sitnicka E. Lin N. Priestly G.V. Broudy V.C. Wolf N.S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1996; 87: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kobayashi M. Laver J.H. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Ogawa M. Blood. 1996; 88: 429-436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (13Solar G.P. Kerr W.G. Zeigler F.C. Hess D. Donahue C. de Sauvage F.J. Eaton D.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 4-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this manner, clinical benefit may be derived from the administration of TPO to enhance peripheral blood stem cell collection (14Somlo G. Sniecinski I. ter Veer A. Longmate J. Knutson G. Vuk- Pavlovic S. Bhatia R. Chow W. Leong L. Morgan R. Margolin K. Raschko J. Shibata S. Tetef M. Yen Y. Forman S. Jones D. Ashby M. Fyfe G. Hellmann S. Doroshow J.H. Blood. 1999; 93: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and theex vivo expansion of primitive hematopoietic cells (15Piacibello W. Sanavio F. Garetto L. Severino A. Bergandi D. Ferrario J. Fagioli F. Berger M. Aglietta M. Blood. 1997; 89: 2644-2653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TPO may thus offer patients with primary and acquired hematological disorders a significant therapeutic benefit. Thrombopoietin is a 335-amino acid polypeptide produced in multiple organs, first cloned as a ligand for the orphan hematopoietic cytokine receptor proto-oncogene c-mpl. Like EPO, GH, and other members of the hematopoietic cytokine family, the amino-terminal region of TPO is predicted to fold into a left-handed four-helix bundle protein. The amino acids of this domain of TPO (residues 1–152) share greater homology with EPO than does any other pair of hematopoietic cytokines (22% identity, and an additional 24% sequence similarity (16Lok S. Kaushansky K. Holly R.D. Kuijper J.L. Lofton-Day C.E. Oort P.J. Grant F.J. Heipel M.D. Burkhead S.K. Kramer J.M. et al.Nature. 1994; 369: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar)). Our laboratory and others (17Bartley T.D. Bogenberger J. Hunt P., Li, Y.S., Lu, H.S. Martin F. Chang M.S. Samal B. Nichol J.L. Swift S. et al.Cell. 1994; 77: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 18Hunt P., Li, Y.S. Nichol J.L. Hokom M.M. Bogenberger J.M. Swift S.E. Skrine J.D.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the amino-terminal (or cytokine-like) domain of TPO is adequate for receptor binding, signaling, and supporting cellular proliferation. In addition to the four-helical bundle domain, and unlike all other known members of the hematopoietic cytokine family, the TPO gene encodes a carboxyl-terminal polypeptide extension (residues 153–335), a serine- and a proline-rich domain remarkable for abundant carbohydrate modification, and a lack of homology to other known proteins. Glycosylation of this carboxyl-terminal (or glycan) domain has been experimentally determined (residues 153–246) and predicted (residues 246–332) in human TPO (20Hoffman R.C. Andersen H. Walker K. Krakover J.D. Patel S. Stamm M.R. Osborn S.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14849-14861Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The glycosylation of TPO accounts for approximately one-half of its observed 70-kDa molecular mass. Not surprisingly, the inter-species (mouse-human) homology of TPO is greatest in the amino-terminal receptor-binding domain (93%); however, the carboxyl-terminal domain retains 74% homology, suggesting that it also serves an important physiologic function. In previous work our laboratory and others (19Linden H.M. Kaushansky K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Muto T. Feese M.D. Shimada Y. Kudou Y.

Int. 1999; 47: 729-733PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the TPO glycan domain (TGD) functions to enhance secretion; in our hands deletion of the TGD reduced TPO secretion ∼20-fold. Interestingly, several bacterial proteases display a two-domain structure, a protease domain, and a proregion essential for secretion, shown to facilitate the folding of the parent compound prior to extracellular proteolytic cleavage (reviewed in Refs. 23Eder J. Fersht A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and 24Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several of these proregions have been studied and shown to function both in cis (covalently linked to their corresponding enzyme) and in trans (when co-expressed from a different gene). Co-transfection of cDNAs encoding a normal proregion with a cDNA encoding a protein either lacking a proregion or with a mutated proregion can rescue the protein from aggregation or destruction and hence facilitate protein secretion (25Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Fabre E. Tharaud C. Gaillardin C. J. Biol.

However, in some instances, the proregion is unable to rescue the parent protein to enhance secretion in trans (31Valverde V. Delmas P. Kaghad M. Loison G. Jara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15821-15826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Phillips M.A. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6771-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or has only a modest effect (33Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The function of mammalian proregions and their ability to function with an extended range of target proteins among protein families have been less well defined. Here we report that the TGD functions in trans to substantially enhance secretion of the truncated protein and of some, but not all, other cytokines. The specific role(s) of proregions as well as their subcellular site of action is diverse. Notably, in another member of the hematopoietic cytokine family, the prolactin proregion is essential for secretion; mutation of the proregion results in accumulation of aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum (34Haynes R.L. Zheng T. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17126-17133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The proregion of human neutrophil defensin is essential for secretion; the proregion of this protein is anionic (35Valore E.V. Ganz T. Blood. 1992; 79: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Liu L. Ganz T. Blood. 1995; 85: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Barker R.L. Gleich G.J. Pease L.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), can neutralize the activity of the protein prior to cleavage, and contains a region that is essential for proper subcellular sorting to granule-like vacuoles in cells. Similarly, the proregion of von Willebrand factor (vWF) promotes inter-dimer disulfide bond formation, multimer formation, and targets vWF to storage granules in several in vitro studies (36Journet A.M. Saffaripour S. Wagner D.D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Journet A.M. Saffaripour S. Cramer E.M. Tenza D. Wagner D.D. Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 60: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar). These conclusions were confirmed by the finding that a naturally occurring mutation in the proregion of vWF resulted in impaired multimerization and secretion. In the studies reported here, we show that the activity of TGD appears to take place within the endoplasmic reticulum or earlier in the secretory pathway. The cDNA-encoding murine TPO (described previously in Ref. 16Lok S. Kaushansky K. Holly R.D. Kuijper J.L. Lofton-Day C.E. Oort P.J. Grant F.J. Heipel M.D. Burkhead S.K. Kramer J.M. et al.Nature. 1994; 369: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR-based mutagenesis. To facilitate iodination and purification, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to add a poly(Tyr) and poly(His) terminus and to mutate an Arg-Arg (Arg-153↓Arg-154) potential cleavage site to Gln-Gln. Oligonucleotides were designed to generate two forms of murine TPO, full-length (TPO 1–335) and a truncated form (TPO 1–152), with a poly(Tyr) and poly(His) carboxyl terminus using a strategy we have described previously (38Matous J.V. Langley K. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1996; 88: 437-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secretory efficiency (as measured by ELISA) and function (as measured by MTT assay, see below) of TPO 1–335 did not differ from that of wild type mTPO, confirming that mutation of the Arg-Arg site and addition of the poly(Tyr) and poly(His) tail were functionally silent. Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to generate a deletion mutein of TPO in which the entire receptor binding domain (residues 4–174) was removed, termed the TPO glycan domain (TGD); we then modified this construct further by using site-directed mutagenesis to construct TGD variants with a Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu endoplasmic retention signal at the carboxyl terminus (TGD-KDEL) and one lacking the secretory leader (TGD-SL). Fig.1 illustrates the cDNA constructs utilized in this study. Each mTPO construct was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pDX (39Kaushansky K. O'Hara P.J. Hart C.E. Forstrom J.W. Hagen F.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4861-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cytokine or TGD cDNA expression vectors were co-transfected using LipofectAMINE® (Invitrogen), Lipofectin® (Invitrogen), or calcium phosphate into the rodent fibroblast cell lines BHK with a second plasmid encoding RSV-CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) to control for transfection efficiency, used at one-tenth the concentration of the cytokine expression vector (40Shoemaker S.G. Hromas R. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9650-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal calf serum and penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone. In co-transfection experiments with TGD constructs, equal amounts of cytokine cDNA were transfected with TGD cDNA (e.g. 1 μg each for a 2-ml plate). At 24–72 h post-transfection, supernatants were collected and cells counted and lysed. Supernatants were assayed for TPO (see below) and lysates for CAT activity (see below). For all transient transfection experiments, at least two different plasmid preps were utilized. To develop stable transfected cell lines, the TGD encoding cDNA was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding dihydrofolate resistance, at one-tenth the concentration of the cytokine-containing plasmids. Cells were selected and grown in 1 μm methotrexate-containing media, and the supernatant was assayed for TGD secretion and RNA by RT-PCR to confirm the stable expression of TGD. In some experiments cDNA expression vectors were used to produce metabolically labeled proteins. Six hours following transient transfection, cultures were trypsinized and split into two plates to allow metabolic labeling of half the transfected cells, and the remaining cells were left unlabeled in standard culture medium. Eighteen hours following transfection adherent cells were washed, and the supernatant was replaced with Met- and Cys-deficient media (Invitrogen) for 1 h. The media were again replaced with Met- and Cys-deficient media containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and 50 μCi/ml 35S-labeled Met and Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated overnight. Supernatants were then collected and clarified, and cells were trypsinized, counted, and lysed for CAT assays. The parallel non-labeled culture supernatant was evaluated for mTPO by ELISA (see below). For experiments using reticulocyte lysates (TNT® SP6 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega), standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer were followed (using RedivueTM35S from Amersham Biosciences for metabolic labeling). The constructs shown in Fig. 1 were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) downstream of the Sp6 promoter. Reticulocyte lysate transcripts were electrophoretically size-fractionated on a gradient gel (NOVEXTM, 4–20% acrylamide), which was then dried, exposed to film overnight, and then to a PhosphorImaging screen for 2 h. Two anti-peptide antibodies were generously provided by T. Kato at Kirin Pharmaceuticals; each anti-peptide antibody was directed against a region of the receptor-binding domain of rat TPO. RT1 reacts with a 20-residue region of the putative first helix (9PRLLNKLLRDSYLLHSRLSQ28) and RT2 is directed against a 21-residue segment of the putative AB loop (46FSLGEWKTQTEOSKAQDILGA66). Murine and rat sequences are highly conserved in this region differing at only 2 and 1 residues, respectively (anti-peptide antibodies directed against similar regions of human TPO have been described previously (41Tahara T. Kuwaki T. Matsumoto A. Morita H. Watarai H. Inagaki Y. Ohashi H. Ogami K. Kato T. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled tissue culture supernatants was performed using standard protocols. Briefly, 1 ml of metabolically labeled tissue culture supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for ½ h; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin were added to diminish proteolysis (as described previously (42Drachman J.G. Griffin J.D. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4979-4982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)), and 1% Tween 20 was used to diminish nonspecific binding. Each supernatant was then incubated overnight with 10 μg/ml of the anti-TPO peptide antibody at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads were added to precipitate the antibody-TPO complex, and the beads were washed with RIPA buffers as described previously (19Linden H.M. Kaushansky K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and then denatured and eluted from staphylococcus A beads by boiling in a loading buffer with 2% β-mercaptoethanol. The immunoprecipitated TPO forms were size-fractionated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gels, soaked in AmplifyTMenhancer (Amersham Biosciences), dried down, and exposed to PhosphorImaging screens overnight. Baf/3 cells transfected with the mouse Mpl receptor were used to assay for TPO activity (16Lok S. Kaushansky K. Holly R.D. Kuijper J.L. Lofton-Day C.E. Oort P.J. Grant F.J. Heipel M.D. Burkhead S.K. Kramer J.M. et al.Nature. 1994; 369: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Cells were grown and maintained in IL-3, washed, plated at a concentration of 10,000 cells per well in 100 μl of media in 96-well plates, and incubated for 36 h with serial dilutions of tissue culture supernatants. Wild type mTPO supernatant of known concentration was used to generate a standard curve and determine maximal proliferation of Baf/Mpl cells for each assay. 3[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, (MTT Sigma) was then added and was followed 5 h later by a lysis buffer. Optical density was measured by using an ELISA plate reader (EL-340 Biotek Instruments) to measure the absorbance at 570–630 nm in order to assess the intracellular conversion of tetrazolium to formazan. Sample activity was determined by comparison to the standard at half-maximal proliferation. The cell line used for these experiments was more sensitive to IL-3 than to TPO; however, as measurement of response to TPO was our desired effect, we have based our results on percentage of mTPO-induced maximal activity. Similarly, MO7e cells, which constitutively express c-Kit and GM-CSF (and a low level of Mpl) receptors and proliferate in response to SCF and GM-CSF, were used to assay for these cytokines. To test SCF activity selectively, Baf/murine Kit receptor cells were also utilized in MTT assays. Baf/EPO receptor cells were used to measure EPO activity, and Baf/3 cells were used to measure IL-3 activity in similar assays. In a similar fashion, megakaryocyte assays were used to quantify SDF-1, as described previously (43Wang Q. Miyakawa Y. Fox N. Kaushansky K. Blood. 2000; 96: 2093-2099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in Baf/Mpl cells was utilized to read out evidence of complete refolding of denatured TPO, in a similar fashion to the assay employed by Baker et al. (44Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) to demonstrate refolding of α-lytic protease. Full-length TPO was generously provided by Dr. Don Foster (Zymogenetics Inc., Seattle, WA), and truncated hormone (containing the amino-terminal 162 residues) was generously provided by Dr. Takashi Kato (Kirin Pharmaceuticals, Takasaki, Japan). Equipotent solutions of truncated and full-length hormone were verified by equal activity in MTT assays using Baf/Mpl cells, as described above. Each protein was then denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) at room temperature overnight and heated to 65 °C for 10 min to fully denature the protein (as described previously (45Hamburger J.B. Chen E. Narhi L.O., Wu, G.M. Brems D.N. Proteins. 1998; 32: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)) A roughly 0.8 m solution of the protein was then diluted into cold phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% bovine serum albumin at room temperature to effectively dilute the protein concentration and GdnHCl 200-fold. The protein was then allowed to refold over a time course of 0–30 min, and aliquots of the refolded protein were then immediately added to starved Baf/Mpl cells, resulting in a final concentration of 0.015 mm GdnHCl. 1 × 106starved Baf/Mpl cells in serum-free media were incubated with diluted protein samples for 2 min in a total volume of 10 ml at 37 °C and then immediately poured into 40 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; the cells were pelleted and lysed in freshly prepared lysis buffer (46Miyakawa Y. Oda A. Druker B.J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Handa M. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 23-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and frozen at 0 °C. Whole cell lysates were size-fractionated by electrophoresis through 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, and probed for phosphorylated (activated) MAPK (Cell Signaling antibody number 9101L), and MAPK protein (Cell Signaling antibody number 9109), as we have described previously (47Rojnuckarin P. Miyakawa Y. Fox N.E. Deou J. Daum G. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41014-41022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Repeated optimization assays demonstrated that a minimum of 2 min at 37 °C was necessary for visualization of MAPK phosphorylation and that the addition of trace quantities of GdnHCl to native protein and starved cells did not impair MAPK activation. The proteasome inhibitor ALLN was used to determine whether intracellular protein degradation might account for the reduced secretion of truncated forms of TPO. COS cells were tested for tolerance to ALLN (Calbiochem 108909 Calpain Inhibitor dissolved in Me2SO), and a time course of TPO expression following transient transfection was examined to determine the optimal timing of metabolic labeling and proteasome inhibition. COS cells were transiently transfected as described above, with truncated and full-length TPO in parallel; serum-free, liposome-, and TPO plasmid-containing media were washed off the cells, and they were allowed to recover at 37 °C overnight in media with 2% fetal calf serum. The following day the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and Cys- and Met-deficient media were added with radiolabeled35S as described above. Following a 4-h incubation with labeled culture medium, ALLN or diluent (Me2SO) was then added to the culture to achieve a final concentration of 50 mm, and cells were incubated additionally at 37 °C for 12 h. Supernatants were collected, and cells were harvested and lysed as described above. Similarly, supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP), size fractionation, and PhosphorImaging quantitation as described above. Standard protocols were used to assay CAT activity (40Shoemaker S.G. Hromas R. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9650-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48 ) and thereby correct for transfection efficiency. Cellular lysates were diluted in 0.25 m Tris and incubated with acetyl-CoA and [14C]chloramphenicol. Following ethyl acetate extraction, thin layer chromatography was performed to allow quantitation of chloramphenicol acetylation. If transfection efficiency varied by more than 4-fold between samples, we did not include the results from corresponding supernatants in our analysis. Supernatants were tested in paired samples using a commercial ELISA for mTPO (MTP00, QuantikineTM M from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); in this immunoassay the lower limit is 62.5 pg/ml. The antibodis for this ELISA were also purchased separately and their TPO-binding epitopes were mapped, using purified truncated forms of mTPO, to identify which region(s) of TPO they detect. Both the monoclonal catch antibody and the polyclonal detection antibody detected mTPO by IP and standard Western blot techniques. The monoclonal antibody detected full-length TPO and a truncated TPO form 50 kDa in length but failed to detect shorter forms of TPO, where the polyclonal antibody detected 18-, 20-, 30-, 50-, and 70-kDa forms of TPO, folded and denatured, suggesting that at least part of the epitope of the monoclonal antibody maps to a segment"
https://openalex.org/W2316109340,"We have investigated the mechanism by which expression of the v-myc oncogene interferes with the competence of primary quail myoblasts to undergo terminal differentiation. Previous studies have established that quail myoblasts transformed by myc oncogenes are severely impaired in the accumulation of mRNAs encoding the myogenic transcription factors Myf-5, MyoD and Myogenin. However, the mechanism responsible for such a repression remains largely unknown. Here we present evidence that v-Myc selectively interferes with quail myoD expression at the transcriptional level. Cis-regulatory elements involved in the auto-activation of qmyoD are specifically targeted in this unique example of transrepression by v-Myc, without the apparent participation of Myc-specific E-boxes or InR sequences. Transiently expressed v-Myc efficiently interfered with MyoD-dependent transactivation of the qmyoD regulatory elements, while the myogenin promoter was unaffected. Finally, we show that forced expression of MyoD in v-myc-transformed quail myoblasts restored myogenin expression and promoted extensive terminal differentiation. These data suggest that transcriptional repression of qmyoD is a major and rate-limiting step in the molecular pathway by which v-Myc severely inhibits terminal differentiation in myogenic cells."
