https://openalex.org/W2280923709,"TGF-β signaling can be pro-tumorigenic or tumor suppressive. We investigated this duality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which, with other gastrointestinal cancers, exhibits frequent inactivation of the TGF-β mediator Smad4. We show that TGF-β induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generally considered a pro-tumorigenic event. However, in TGF-β-sensitive PDA cells, EMT becomes lethal by converting TGF-β-induced Sox4 from an enforcer of tumorigenesis into a promoter of apoptosis. This is the result of an EMT-linked remodeling of the cellular transcription factor landscape, including the repression of the gastrointestinal lineage-master regulator Klf5. Klf5 cooperates with Sox4 in oncogenesis and prevents Sox4-induced apoptosis. Smad4 is required for EMT but dispensable for Sox4 induction by TGF-β. TGF-β-induced Sox4 is thus geared to bolster progenitor identity, whereas simultaneous Smad4-dependent EMT strips Sox4 of an essential partner in oncogenesis. Our work demonstrates that TGF-β tumor suppression functions through an EMT-mediated disruption of a lineage-specific transcriptional network."

Analysis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) from 6-month-postpartum mothers in two Malawian birth cohorts revealed that sialylated HMOs are significantly less abundant in those with severely stunted infants. To explore this association, we colonized young germ-free mice with a consortium of bacterial strains cultured from the fecal microbiota of a 6-month-old stunted Malawian infant and fed recipient animals a prototypic Malawian diet with or without purified sialylated bovine milk oligosaccharides (S-BMO). S-BMO produced a microbiota-dependent augmentation of lean body mass gain, changed bone morphology, and altered liver, muscle, and brain metabolism in ways indicative of a greater ability to utilize nutrients for anabolism. These effects were also documented in gnotobiotic piglets using the same consortium and Malawian diet. These preclinical models indicate a causal, microbiota-dependent relationship between S-BMO and growth promotion."
https://openalex.org/W2276418388,"The regenerative capacity of the injured CNS in adult mammals is severely limited, yet axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) regrow, albeit to a limited extent, after injury. We reasoned that coordinate regulation of gene expression in injured neurons involving multiple pathways was central to PNS regenerative capacity. To provide a framework for revealing pathways involved in PNS axon regrowth after injury, we applied a comprehensive systems biology approach, starting with gene expression profiling of dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) combined with multi-level bioinformatic analyses and experimental validation of network predictions. We used this rubric to identify a drug that accelerates DRG neurite outgrowth in vitro and optic nerve outgrowth in vivo by inducing elements of the identified network. The work provides a functional genomics foundation for understanding neural repair and proof of the power of such approaches in tackling complex problems in nervous system biology."
https://openalex.org/W2278347664,"Cross-modality interaction in sensory perception is advantageous for animals' survival. How cortical sensory processing is cross-modally modulated and what are the underlying neural circuits remain poorly understood. In mouse primary visual cortex (V1), we discovered that orientation selectivity of layer (L)2/3, but not L4, excitatory neurons was sharpened in the presence of sound or optogenetic activation of projections from primary auditory cortex (A1) to V1. The effect was manifested by decreased average visual responses yet increased responses at the preferred orientation. It was more pronounced at lower visual contrast and was diminished by suppressing L1 activity. L1 neurons were strongly innervated by A1-V1 axons and excited by sound, while visual responses of L2/L3 vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons were suppressed by sound, both preferentially at the cell's preferred orientation. These results suggest that the cross-modality modulation is achieved primarily through L1 neuron- and L2/L3 VIP-cell-mediated inhibitory and disinhibitory circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2285926604,"The mechanisms underlying the effects of cannabinoids on cognitive processes are not understood. Here we show that cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) control hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory through the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels that underlie the h-current (Ih), a key regulator of dendritic excitability. The CB1R-HCN pathway, involving c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs), nitric oxide synthase, and intracellular cGMP, exerts a tonic enhancement of Ih selectively in pyramidal cells located in the superficial portion of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer, whereas it is absent from deep-layer cells. Activation of the CB1R-HCN pathway impairs dendritic integration of excitatory inputs, long-term potentiation (LTP), and spatial memory formation. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of Ih or genetic deletion of HCN1 abolishes CB1R-induced deficits in LTP and memory. These results demonstrate that the CB1R-Ih pathway in the hippocampus is obligatory for the action of cannabinoids on LTP and spatial memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2284197633,"During development, sensory axons compete for limiting neurotrophic support, and local neurotrophin insufficiency triggers caspase-dependent axon degeneration. The signaling driving axon degeneration upon local deprivation is proposed to reside within axons. Our results instead support a model in which, despite the apoptotic machinery being present in axons, the cell body is an active participant in gating axonal caspase activation and axon degeneration. Loss of trophic support in axons initiates retrograde activation of a somatic pro-apoptotic pathway, which, in turn, is required for distal axon degeneration via an anterograde pro-degenerative factor. At a molecular level, the cell body is the convergence point of two signaling pathways whose integrated action drives upregulation of pro-apoptotic Puma, which, unexpectedly, is confined to the cell body. Puma then overcomes inhibition by pro-survival Bcl-xL and Bcl-w and initiates the anterograde pro-degenerative program, highlighting the role of the cell body as an arbiter of large-scale axon removal."

Cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are a core feature of the disease (Barch and Ceaser, 2012Barch D.M. Ceaser A. Cognition in schizophrenia: core psychological and neural mechanisms.Trends Cogn.

Gogos J.A. Cognition in mouse models of schizophrenia susceptibility genes.Schizophr. Bull. 2010; 36: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To this end, we have studied the neural basis of cognitive deficits in Df(16)A+/− mice, which model a microdeletion on chromosome 22q11.2 that accounts for up to 1%–2% of sporadic schizophrenia cases (Karayiorgou et al., 1995Karayiorgou M.

Human carriers of the 22q11.2 microdeletion show a range of cognitive deficits, including working memory impairments (Karayiorgou et al., 2010Karayiorgou M. Simon T.J.

Df(16)A+/− mice show impairments in spatial working memory, among other schizophrenia-related phenotypes (Stark et al., 2008Stark K.L. Xu B. Bagchi A. Lai W.S. Liu H. Hsu R. Wan X. Pavlidis P. Mills A.A. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Altered brain microRNA biogenesis contributes to phenotypic deficits in a 22q11-deletion mouse model.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These impairments in working memory correlate with deficits in functional connectivity between the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mutant animals (Sigurdsson et al., 2010Sigurdsson T. Stark K.L. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Impaired hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia.Nature. 2010; 464: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), consistent with the literature suggesting these two structures cooperate during spatial working memory (Jones and Wilson, 2005Jones M.W. Wilson M.A. Theta rhythms coordinate hippocampal-prefrontal interactions in a spatial memory task.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e402Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, Lee and Kesner, 2003Lee I. Kesner R.P. Time-dependent relationship between the dorsal hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex in spatial memory.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1517-1523PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct inhibition of HPC-mPFC inputs in wild-type (WT) mice causes similar impairments in working memory performance, as well as deficits in the encoding of spatial information within the prefrontal cortex (Spellman et al., 2015Spellman T. Rigotti M. Ahmari S.E. Fusi S. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Hippocampal-prefrontal input supports spatial encoding in working memory.Nature. 2015; 522: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest a role for the HPC-mPFC circuit in the spatial working memory deficits associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletion. Attempts to define the molecular and cellular bases of the cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletion have focused on the effects of single-gene mutations within the 22q11.2 microdeletion region (Bender et al., 2005Bender H.U.

Derepression of a neuronal inhibitor due to miRNA dysregulation in a schizophrenia-related microdeletion.Cell. 2013; 152: 262-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that mice haploinsufficient for one of these genes, Zdhhc8+/−, recapitulate several key aspects of the full microdeletion, including deficits in spatial working memory and functional connectivity (Mukai et al., 2015Mukai J. Tamura M. Fénelon K. Rosen A.M. Spellman T.J. Kang R. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gordon J.A. Gogos J.A. Molecular substrates of altered axonal growth and brain connectivity in a mouse model of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2015; 86: 680-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Zdhhc8 haploinsufficiency results in impairments in neurite outgrowth in vitro and axon branching in vivo (Mukai et al., 2015Mukai J. Tamura M. Fénelon K. Rosen A.M. Spellman T.J. Kang R. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gordon J.A. Gogos J.A. Molecular substrates of altered axonal growth and brain connectivity in a mouse model of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2015; 86: 680-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Axon branching deficits are seen in both cortico-cortical and hippocampo-cortical pathways, are present in mice carrying the full microdeletion, and are accompanied by deficits in synaptic efficacy (Mukai et al., 2015Mukai J. Tamura M. Fénelon K. Rosen A.M. Spellman T.J. Kang R. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gordon J.A. Gogos J.A. Molecular substrates of altered axonal growth and brain connectivity in a mouse model of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2015; 86: 680-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The Zdhhc8 gene product is a palmitoylation enzyme, and haploinsufficiency results in the mislocalization of several proteins required for normal axonal development. One downstream result of this mislocalization is a reduction in phosphorylated Akt at the axon tip. Phosphorylated Akt normally inhibits Gsk3β, suggesting that increased activity of Gsk3β might contribute to the axonal phenotypes seen in the mutant mice. Indeed, developmental inhibition of Gsk3 restored normal patterns of neurite outgrowth and axonal branching in Zdhhc8+/− mice (Mukai et al., 2015Mukai J. Tamura M. Fénelon K. Rosen A.M. Spellman T.J. Kang R. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gordon J.A. Gogos J.A. Molecular substrates of altered axonal growth and brain connectivity in a mouse model of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2015; 86: 680-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These studies raise two important questions. First, are the axonal, physiological, and behavioral phenotypes causally related? If so, developmental antagonism of Gsk3 should rescue HPC-mPFC synchrony and working memory performance in Df(16)A+/− mice. Second, what is the impact of the microdeletion, and its rescue by Gsk3 antagonism, on task-related activity in the mPFC? Our previous results (Spellman et al., 2015Spellman T. Rigotti M. Ahmari S.E. Fusi S. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Hippocampal-prefrontal input supports spatial encoding in working memory.Nature. 2015; 522: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) would suggest that, because of reduced efficacy of HPC-mPFC input, mPFC neurons in Df(16)A+/− should have reduced spatial representations. In that case, could these altered representations be restored by Gsk3 antagonism? Here we demonstrate that developmental antagonism of Gsk3 indeed rescues impaired neural synchrony, working memory performance, and mPFC spatial representations in Df(16)A+/− mice, consistent with the notion that spatial working memory deficits in these mice are caused by disruptions in the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit as a consequence of disrupted axonal development. Our findings provide crucial evidence that these working memory-related phenotypes are pharmacologically reversible, and they suggest a possible pathway toward novel therapies for cognitive deficits in 22q11.2 microdeletion carriers and at least a subset of patients with schizophrenia. To investigate the effect of developmental inhibition of Gsk3β on behavioral and neurophysiological deficits in Df(16)A+/− mice, mutants and WT littermates were injected with SB-216763 (SB), a potent and selective inhibitor of Gsk3 (Kramer et al., 2012Kramer T. Schmidt B. Lo Monte F. Small-molecule inhibitors of GSK-3: structural insights and their application to Alzheimer’s disease models.Int. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2012; 2012: 381029PubMed Google Scholar), or vehicle every other day from postnatal day (P)7 to P28. At 3–5 months of age, mice were implanted with microelectrodes targeting mPFC, ventral HPC (vHPC), and dorsal HPC (dHPC) (Figure S1). Local field potential (LFP) and multiple single-unit recordings were obtained from these areas at baseline, as well as during acquisition and performance of a delayed non-match-to-place (DNMTP) T maze test of spatial working memory (Figure 1A). Similar to our previous findings (Sigurdsson et al., 2010Sigurdsson T. Stark K.L. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Impaired hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia.Nature. 2010; 464: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, Stark et al., 2008Stark K.L. Xu B. Bagchi A.

Genet. 2008; 40: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), Df(16)A+/− mice took significantly longer to reach criterion performance of the task, defined as more than 70% correct for 3 consecutive days (Figure 1B). This behavioral deficit was reversed by developmental inhibition of Gsk3, such that days to criterion did not significantly differ between WT and SB-treated Df(16)A+/− mice. SB had no effect on acquisition in WT mice. We have reported previously that Df(16)A+/− mice have impaired oscillatory synchrony between the dHPC and mPFC across multiple frequency ranges (Sigurdsson et al., 2010Sigurdsson T. Stark K.L. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Impaired hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia.Nature. 2010; 464: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). More recently, we have revealed that mPFC-vHPC connectivity is also closely related to the acquisition and encoding of spatial working memory (Mukai et al., 2015Mukai J. Tamura M. Fénelon K. Rosen A.M. Spellman T.J. Kang R. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gordon J.A. Gogos J.A.

Here we extend these observations to vehicle-treated Df(16)A+/− mice, which have substantially reduced vHPC-mPFC synchrony at baseline, during habituation to the T maze (Figure 2). This decreased coherence was evident in both theta- and gamma-frequency ranges, whether measured by coherence of mPFC and vHPC LFPs (Figures 2A and 2B) or phase-locking of mPFC single units to vHPC LFP oscillations performed using pairwise phase consistency (PPC) (Figures 2C–2F) and mean resultant length (Figure S2D). Developmental inhibition of Gsk3 significantly rescued theta-frequency coherence and phase-locking in Df(16)A+/− mice, without affecting synchrony in WTs (Figures 2B and 2D). SB-treated Df(16)A+/− mice also showed trends toward higher gamma-range coherence (p = 0.10; Figure 2B) and phase-locking of mPFC units to vHPC gamma (p = 0.06; Figure 2F) than untreated Df(16)A+/− mice. Similar to our previous finding (Sigurdsson et al., 2010Sigurdsson T. Stark K.L. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Impaired hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia.Nature. 2010; 464: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), Df(16)A+/− mice showed impaired synchrony between dHPC and mPFC (Figures S2A–S2C), although statistical significance was achieved only for phase-locking of mPFC units to dHPC theta oscillations (Figures S2C and S2E). SB treatment did not significantly reverse impaired dHPC-mPFC synchrony regardless of frequency, though trend-level effects were observed (Figures S2B and S2C). LFP power at baseline did not differ by genotype or treatment regardless of frequency or region (Figures S3A–S3F). Neurons within the mPFC typically have task-related firing patterns (Baeg et al., 2003Baeg E.H. Kim Y.B. Huh K. Mook-Jung I. Kim H.T. Jung M.W.

Firing characteristics of deep layer neurons in prefrontal cortex in rats performing spatial working memory tasks.Cereb. Cortex. 1998; 8: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the DNMTP task used here, mPFC neurons represent the spatial location of the goal (Spellman et al., 2015Spellman T. Rigotti M. Ahmari S.E. Fusi S. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A.

We speculated that this goal representation might be disrupted in Df(16)A+/− mice, and that this disruption might be reversed by developmental Gsk3 antagonism. Consistent with prior findings, a subset of mPFC single units fired preferentially on one of the two goal arms during the choice (retrieval) phase of the T maze task (Figures 3A and 3B ). A repeated-measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) based on binned spike rates was used to determine whether each unit’s firing rate varied by goal arm, as a function of time within the sample of phase. In WT mice, the percentage of mPFC units showing statistically significant goal-selective firing increased as the animal entered the goal arm, peaking at 21% ± 2% near the goal location (Figure 3C). Fewer units in Df(16)A+/− mice showed this goal selectivity, peaking at 12% ± 2% (Figure 3C). Developmental inhibition of Gsk3 restored goal selectivity in the mutant animals, without affecting the representation in WT (peaking at 22% ± 3% and 26% ± 3%, respectively; Figure 3C). Overall firing rates did not differ by group (Figure 3D), indicating that developmental inhibition of Gsk3 rescued spatial representations in mPFC neurons of Df(16)A+/− mice without affecting their overall level of excitation. Similar tendencies were seen in the sample (encoding) phase, though group differences were not significant (Figure S4A). In WT mice, 50% ± 4.5% of goal-selective units in the sample phase showed significant goal-selective firing in the choice phase (Figure S4C). This percentage in Df(16)A+/− mice reduced to 26% ± 3.1%. SB treatment significantly restored the similarity of goal-selective firing between task phases without affecting WT mice (Figure S4C). Goal-selective units during the sample phase tended to preferentially fire in the same arm during the choice phase (90% of units; Figure S4D). This preference was decreased to 74% in Df(16)A+/− mice and restored to 89% by SB treatment. The high reliability of arm preference across task phases argues for spatial as opposed to reward-related activity, since the preferred arm could be either rewarded or not rewarded in the choice phase. We also used an undirected approach to examine whether population-level spatial representations in the mPFC were affected by the microdeletion and/or subsequent developmental inhibition of Gsk3. A maximum margin linear classifier (Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M. Barak O. Warden M.R. Wang X.J. Daw N.D. Miller E.K. Fusi S.

Binned population firing rate vectors were aligned separately to multiple trial events (Figure 4A). The classifier was trained on firing rate data from half of the trials, and model accuracy was tested on data from the rest of the trials (see Experimental Procedures). Figure 4B depicts decoding accuracy of the choice goal location using data from 42 mPFC units recorded from a single WT mouse. Choice goal identity was decoded at accuracies above chance from when the animal entered the T intersection in the maze to when the animal left the goal arm, peaking at the goal location. Model accuracy was computed for each individual animal and then averaged across animals by group (Figure 4). In WT mice, model accuracy was highest as animals approached the goal. Df(16)A+/− mice showed significantly lower model accuracy, demonstrating that the population spatial representation in mPFC neurons was disrupted (Figure 4D). Population decoding in the mutants was completely restored by developmental inhibition of Gsk3, which had no effect in WT mice (Figure 4D). A similar tendency was obtained from sample goal decoding, although this did not reach statistical significance (Figure S4B). We next set out to determine whether the effects of the Df(16)A+/− mutation and its rescue by Gsk3 antagonism on neural synchrony on the one hand, and spatial encoding on the other, were linked. We examined the relationship between spatial information and neural synchrony on an individual neuron-by-neuron basis. We used mutual information (MI; see Experimental Procedures) to quantify spatial information in each neuron as a function of time in the maze, relative to the same landmarks used to create the linear classifier model described above. MI measures how much each of the neuron’s spikes reduces the uncertainty about the goal location (left versus right) and is measured in bits (Onken et al., 2014Onken A. Karunasekara P.P.C.R. Kayser C. Panzeri S. Understanding neural population coding: information theoretic insights from the auditory system.Adv. Neurosci. (Hindawi). 2014; 2014: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar, Shannon, 1948Shannon C.E. A mathematical theory of communication.Bell System Tech. J. 1948; 27: 379-423Crossref Scopus (26806) Google Scholar). Like the accuracy of the population-based model, MI peaked at the choice goal location for most mPFC units (Figure 5A). Averaged across neurons, MI at the goal location was lower in Df(16)A+/− mice than in WTs, and it was rescued by developmental Gsk3 antagonism (Figure 5B). Encoding of spatial information about the goal relies on gamma-frequency synchrony between the vHPC and mPFC during the sample phase (Spellman et al., 2015Spellman T. Rigotti M. Ahmari S.E. Fusi S. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Hippocampal-prefrontal input supports spatial encoding in working memory.Nature. 2015; 522: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether MI about the goal during the choice phase varied as a function of phase-locking of the mPFC unit spiking to gamma-frequency oscillations in the vHPC during the sample phase. In WT mice, the strength of a given neuron’s phase-locking to vHPC gamma during the sample phase predicted the amount of information that neuron carried about goal location in the choice phase, both within individual animals (Figure 5C) and across the sample (by multiple linear regression, Figure 5E, or by comparing MI in the weakest and strongest phase-locked units, Figure 5F). In other words, neurons that phase-lock best to gamma in the vHPC during encoding possess more information about the goal location during retrieval. This relationship was not present in Df(16)A+/− mice: the mean correlation coefficient in the mutants did not differ from zero (Figure 5D), the multiple linear regression was not significant (Figure 5E), and MI in weakly and strongly phase-locked cells did not significantly differ (Figure 5F). SB treatment partially restored the relationship between MI and phase-locking, particularly by increasing the amount of spatial information in strongly phase-locked units (Figures 5C–5F). LFP power did not differ by genotype or treatment regardless of frequency, region, or task phase (Figures S3G–S3L). Phase-locking of mPFC spikes to vHPC theta oscillations did not show any correlation with MI in any groups (Figure S5). The cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia remain an unmet treatment need. Here we demonstrate that spatial working memory deficits seen in Df(16)A+/− mice, a mouse model of the schizophrenia-associated 22q11.2 microdeletion, can be rescued through developmental antagonism of Gsk3. We recapitulate, refine, and extend our earlier findings demonstrating deficits in hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in these mice, showing that these deficits are accompanied by impaired spatial representations in the mPFC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that developmental treatment with a Gsk3 antagonist, previously shown to rescue neurite outgrowth deficits in Zdhhc8+/− mice, also rescues the physiological and behavioral impairments. These results have several important implications. First, they underscore the close relat"

The aims of this study were to assess SDs in a group of university students in Lebanon and to examine the relationship between SDs and anxiety.An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at Saint-Joseph University, Lebanon, during the academic year 2013-2014. Four questionnaires were face-to-face administered to 462 students after obtaining their written consent: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7).The prevalence of clinically significant insomnia was 10.6% (95% CI: 7.8-13.4%), more frequent in first year students. ISI mean score was 10.06 (SD = 3.76). 37.1% of the participants were poor sleepers. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and poor sleep were significantly more frequent among participants with clinical insomnia (p = 0.031 and 0.001 respectively). Clinically significant anxiety was more frequent in students suffering from clinical insomnia (p = 0.006) and in poor sleepers (p = 0.003). 50.8% of the participants with clinically significant anxiety presented EDS versus 30.9% of those with no clinically significant anxiety (p<0.0001).The magnitude of SDs in this sample of Lebanese university students demonstrate the importance of examining sleep health in this population. Moreover, the link between SD and anxiety reminds us of the importance of treating anxiety as soon as detected and not simply targeting the reduction of sleep problems."
https://openalex.org/W2285839209,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play pivotal roles in cancer initiation and progression. Monocytes, the precursors of TAMs, normally undergo spontaneous apoptosis within 2 days, but can subsist in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment for continuous survival and generation of sufficient TAMs. The mechanisms underlying tumor-driving monocyte survival remain obscure. Here we report that cancer cell-derived exosomes were crucial mediators for monocyte survival in the inflammatory niche. Analysis of the survival-promoting molecules in monocytes revealed that cancer cell-derived exosomes activated Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, resulting in the prevention of caspase cleavage. Phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), were abundantly expressed in cancer cell-derived exosomes. Knock-out of EGFR or/and HER-2, or alternatively, inhibitors against their phosphorylation significantly disturbed the exosome-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway, inhibition of caspase cleavage, and increase in survival rate in monocytes. Moreover, the deprived survival-stimulating activity of exosomes due to null expression of EGFR and HER-2 could be restored by activation of another RTK, insulin receptor. Overall, our study uncovered a mechanism of tumor-associated monocyte survival and demonstrated that cancer cell-derived exosomes can stimulate the MAPK pathway in monocytes through transport of functional RTKs, leading to inactivation of apoptosis-related caspases. This work provides insights into the long sought question on monocyte survival prior to formation of plentiful TAMs in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2285452918,"The Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and Northeast Atlantic (NEA) mackerel (Scomber scombrus) are extremely abundant pelagic planktivores that feed in the Norwegian Sea (NS) during spring and summer. This study investigated the feeding ecology and diet composition of these commercially important fish stocks on the basis of biological data, including an extensive set of stomach samples in combination with hydrographical data, zooplankton samples and acoustic abundance data from 12 stock monitoring surveys carried out in 2005-2010. Mackerel were absent during the spring, but had generally high feeding overlap with herring in the summer, with a diet mainly based on calanoid copepods, especially Calanus finmarchicus, as well as a similar diet width. Stomach fullness in herring diminished from spring to summer and feeding incidence was lower than that of mackerel in summer. However, stomach fullness did not differ between the two species, indicating that herring maintain an equally efficient pattern of feeding as mackerel in summer, but on a diet that is less dominated by copepods and is more reliant on larger prey. Blue whiting tended to have a low dietary overlap with mackerel and herring, with larger prey such as euphausiids and amphipods dominating, and stomach fullness and feeding incidence increasing with length. For all the species, feeding incidence increased with decreasing temperature, and for mackerel so did stomach fullness, indicating that feeding activity is highest in areas associated with colder water masses. Significant annual effects on diet composition and feeding-related variables suggested that the three species are able to adapt to different food and environmental conditions. These annual effects are likely to have an important impact on the predation pressure on different plankton groups and the carrying capacity of individual systems, and emphasise the importance of regular monitoring of pelagic fish diets."

From these results, we conclude that the 2D dynamics of these cells is preserved in 1D, suggesting a common computation during both types of navigation behavior. Over the course of navigation in real environments, animals traverse open fields and run along paths defined by natural trails and boundaries such as underground burrow systems, streams, and rock faces. If grid cells demarcate spatial coordinates in 2D open fields, as seems possible, it is important to learn whether they perform a similar function during navigation along stereotyped 1D paths. Arena experiments in the lab mimic open field exploration, while 1D track experiments approximate runs along predefined paths. In arenas, individual grid cells of the mammalian entorhinal cortex exhibit spatially periodic tuning, in the form of increased firing at every vertex of a virtual triangular lattice overlaid on the floor of the enclosure (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T.

The offset in phase between cell pairs, also known as the relative phase, remains stable across time and environmental conditions (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M. Hafting T. Treves A. Moser M.B. Moser E.I.

On linear 1D tracks, the spatial tuning curves of grid cells consist of multiple firing fields with non-periodic spacing and a large range of field heights (Figures 1D and 1E). The average spacing between fields is typically several times larger than in the same cell’s 2D response, and the spatial tuning of different cells is not related by simple shifts (Figure 1F). At present, there is little understanding of the detailed structure of these 1D responses. In particular, it is unclear whether there is a relationship between the characteristic properties of 2D grid cell recordings—their hexagonal patterning, their similar tuning up to rigid shifts within a module—and the observed 1D responses. One wonders whether the cells continue to perform a similar underlying computation when the animals navigate in environments of dimension different than two (F.M. Kempf et al., 2012, Front. Comput.

Here we seek to address this question by elucidating whether, and to what extent, the 1D responses of grid cells reflect the underlying structure of their population responses in 2D. In this paper, we consider the hypothesis that grid cell responses on 1D linear tracks are generated by slicing linearly through an underlying 2D triangular lattice (Domnisoru et al., 2013Domnisoru C. Kinkhabwala A.A. Tank D.W. Membrane potential dynamics of grid cells.Nature. 2013; 495: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar; F.M. Kempf et al., 2012, Front. Comput. Neurosci., abstract). We begin by considering what this slice hypothesis predicts for the Fourier transform and power spectrum of an ideal 1D spatial response. We present analytical methods and numerical refinements for extracting the best slice and grid parameters from the Fourier transform of a general 1D spatial tuning curve. We then apply these methods to their 1D responses of grid cells with stable 1D and 2D fields and show that the resulting slices yield excellent fits to their 1D spatial responses. We further show that the 1D responses of comodular cell pairs (defined as simultaneously recorded cells deemed to be from the same module [Stensola et al., 2012Stensola H. Stensola T. Solstad T. Frøland K. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. The entorhinal grid map is discretized.Nature. 2012; 492: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar], based on the similarity of their 2D responses) have similar power spectra despite the apparent dissimilarity in their spatial tuning and are therefore well fit by parallel slices through a triangular lattice. We next predict the 2D phase offsets between comodular cells based on their 1D responses and show that these closely match the recorded 2D phase offsets. Finally, while the 1D response can gradually reshape over the course of an experiment, this remapping can be interpreted as a drift in the slice parameters and slice drift appears to occur in tandem across cells from the same putative network, preserving cell-cell relationships. We conclude that the data strongly support the hypothesis that 1D responses can be generated by slicing through a regular underlying 2D triangular lattice. Finally, because the group relationships of comodular cells recorded on 1D tracks remained the same as the group relationships measured in 2D, we conclude that the network remains in the same dynamical regime during navigation in 1D and 2D environments. We find that the 1D tuning curves of simultaneously recorded grid cells (Domnisoru et al., 2013Domnisoru C. Kinkhabwala A.A. Tank D.W. Membrane potential dynamics of grid cells.Nature. 2013; 495: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) exhibit a shared “fingerprint” that hints of an underlying periodic structure. To see this, first consider the 2D responses of these cells, in which this fingerprint—the power spectral density (PSD) of the spatial response—is easy to understand and interpret (Figure 1G). The periodic 2D response of a grid cell generates six discrete peaks forming a hexagon around the origin in the PSD (these peaks form part of a triangular lattice in spatial frequency space that is “dual” to the spatial triangular lattice, see Figure S1). Spatial phase information is lost in the PSD, thus co-modular cells, which exhibit the same spatial tuning parameters up to phase (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M. Hafting T. Treves A. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Hippocampal remapping and grid realignment in entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2007; 446: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, Yoon et al., 2013Yoon K. Buice M.A. Barry C. Hayman R. Burgess N. Fiete I.R. Specific evidence of low-dimensional continuous attractor dynamics in grid cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), exhibit the same spectra (Figure 1G). Intriguingly, the PSDs of the 1D spatial responses of co-modular grid cells (determined to be co-modular on the basis of their 2D responses) also closely resemble each other (Figure 1H). We next explore this phenomenon and its possible implications for how 1D grid cell responses are generated. The PSD of a generic linear slice through an idealized 2D triangular lattice has exactly three dominant peaks of equal height (Figures 2A–2C). As the angle of the slice varies, the locations of these three peaks shift (Figures 2A–2C). These peak locations are independent of the origin (or spatial phase) of the linear slice for generic slices, thus parallel 1D lattice slices have nearly identical PSDs (Figures 2D–2F). Non-generic slices are those parallel to one of the primary lattice vectors (Figure 2B) or at the half-lattice angle of 30°; in these cases the PSD is predicted to exhibit only one or two major peaks, respectively (Figure 2C). Even in generic slices for which one would expect to see three PSD peaks, if the sampled slice segment is short (only 1–3 times the underlying period), finite length effects broaden the PSD peaks, potentially causing one or more of them to merge. In summary, linear slices through a 2D lattice should exhibit three or fewer major peaks in their PSDs, with most of the mass of the PSD residing in those peaks. We will quantify the fraction of the mass of a PSD that is concentrated in three or fewer peaks by a three peakiness score (p3) (Experimental Procedures). Our frequency-space characterization provides a concise description of the particular heights, spacing, and ordering of firing fields in a lattice slice in terms of the constrained peak structure of the corresponding PSD. To illustrate the specific nature of these constraints, we compare lattice slices to two sets of statistically matched random controls: given a 1D response, we generate corresponding gap-randomized controls by randomly shuffling the order of the firing fields then assigning the fields new positions chosen randomly from a uniform distribution (Figure S2 and Experimental Procedures). We generate gap-shuffled controls by simply shuffling the gaps between fields (Figure S2 and Experimental Procedures). Examples of these two random controls and their PSDs can be seen in Figure 2B (reddish-gray and bluish-gray, respectively), with PSDs in Figure 2C. The tuning curves for both random controls can look very similar to slices, but generically their PSDs differ: they have variable numbers of PSD peaks and usually more than three (Figures 2C and S2; three-peakiness score p3 = 0.63 for the gap-randomized and p3 = 0.69 for the gap-shuffled controls, compared to p3 = 1 for ideal lattice slices, Experimental Procedures). We will return to these controls to statistically test our conclusions throughout this work. It is useful to note that the 1D PSD of a 1D slice through a 2D lattice is equivalent to a 1D projection of the 2D PSD of the 2D lattice onto a “slice line” taken at the same angle starting at the origin in frequency space (Figures 2G–2H and Experimental Procedures). This equivalence allows us to predict the PSD of a 1D slice at any angle by simply projecting the three closest-to-the-origin spectral peaks from the 2D PSD onto a line running through the origin at the desired angle (Figures 2G and 2H). Conversely, given the locations of two major PSD peaks from the 1D response, we can solve analytically for the angle of the slice (Figure S1 and Experimental Procedures). The slice angle obtained in this way is exact if the 1D slice extends to infinity. Using similar techniques (Figure S1 and Experimental Procedures), we can infer the scale factor of a cell, which is the ratio of the inferred 2D lattice period underlying the 1D response to the recorded period in 2D enclosures. From the Fourier transform of the 1D response, we can furthermore deduce the starting point or 2D spatial phase of the slice (Figure 2D; Experimental Procedures). By taking the difference of the inferred 2D spatial phases for a pair of cells, we can predict their 2D relative phase. We can alternatively, and more directly, estimate the 2D relative phase for a cell pair through the Fourier transform of the cross-correlation of their 1D spatial responses (Experimental Procedures). These four parameters, slice angle (θ), scale factor (α), and 2D phase (ϕ→), fully describe a linear slice that starts at the given phase within a unit cell in the canonical 2D grid and continues out to infinity at the given angle (like the schematic slices in Figure 2D). Once the scale factor has been determined, the length of the slice through the 2D grid is fully determined by the scale factor and the length of the track run by the animal. Finite size effects induce uncertainty in the inferred slice parameters (Figures S3C–S3G), as does noise in the neural response (Figures S3H–S3L). In the presence of such uncertainty, supplementing the analytical estimates with numerical optimization can result in improved parameter estimates (Figures S3M–S3R and Experimental Procedures). In summary, the mathematical duality between the spatial response domain and the Fourier spectral domain for slices through regular lattices allows us to determine, up to estimation uncertainty, whether the 1D spatial responses are consistent with an underlying 2D lattice and, if so, to infer the parameters of the slice relative to the lattice. A second signature of lattice slices, complementary to the 1D PSD, is the distribution of the gaps between 1D firing fields. A linear slice through a 2D lattice cuts across several bumps, with a distinct sequence of gaps (spacing between bumps) depending on its angle (Figures 3A and 3B ). The smallest gap occurs when the slice hits adjacent bumps in the 2D lattice; a larger gap occurs when the slice misses a 2D bump and hits the next-nearest bump, and so on. Thus, the set of possible gaps is restricted to the set of distances between a reference bump and all other bumps in the 2D lattice that can be reached by a straight line that does not cross any other bumps. (The bumps have some width, thus the slice can hit a bump “off-center.” Therefore, the actual measured distance between two bumps in a 1D slice will typically be slightly but systematically smaller than the analytically described gaps.) By contrast, the gaps in gap-randomized controls (Figure 3C) can be of arbitrary size; thus, the distribution of gaps is unimodal and smooth (Figure 3D, bottom), rather than multimodal with a few discrete peaks as predicted for slices (Figure 3D, top). (The gap-shuffled controls preserve the full gap distribution of the original data by construction.) Up to an overall scale factor to account for the lattice period, the gaps in lattice slices are entirely specified by the geometry of the 2D lattice. Thus, the ratios between gaps will exhibit relationships characteristic of an underlying triangular lattice: 1/7 ≈ 0.38; 1/3 ≈ 0.58; 3/7 ≈ 0.65; and so on (Figure 3E), and will be the same across modules with different spatial tuning periods and orientations, and different slice angles, so long as the underlying grid geometry is the same. The distribution of gaps collected by pooling across 100 slices of an idealized triangular lattice with varying angle and starting position (phase) is shown in Figure 3E (bottom; the lattice period is a = 20 cm). The gaps (Figure 3D, top) from the two slices of Figures 3A and 3B are simply samples from this gap distribution (Figure 3E), and a particular slice may sample only a subset of possible gaps from the lattice. To take an extreme example, a slice along one of the primary lattice vectors samples only the nearest-neighbor bump distances in the 2D lattice, thus the gap distribution consists of a single peak (Figure S4). It is possible to extract gaps on a trial-by-trial basis from neural recordings and then pool the gap samples across trials. Even if the 1D firing field locations drift from trial to trial (Figure S4), the gaps in every trial will be drawn from the same small set governed by the 2D lattice geometry, assuming that all trials are linear (but possibly changing) slices through that lattice. Moreover, because gap ratios are independent of slice angle, grid period, and scale factor, it should be possible to pool gap ratios across modules. By contrast, PSDs depend on slice angle and cannot be similarly pooled. On the other hand, the gap analysis focuses on adjacent bumps, while the PSD contains information about relationships between all bumps, not just adjacent ones. Thus, gap analysis and PSDs provide complementary measures of a slice. We applied the methods described above to the 1D virtual track responses of 25 neurons identified as well-isolated grid cells with stable 1D spatial responses from the experimental dataset (see Experimental Procedures). Examples of the 1D response are shown in Figure 4A (three cells from different experiments), with 30-trial firing rate averages in Figure 4B (black curves). The PSDs of the spatial tuning curves in Figure 4B (Figure 4C, black) exhibit three or fewer major peaks, with most of the PSD mass concentrated in these few peaks (p3 = 0.95, 0.99, and 0.66, respectively), as expected for lattice slices. Our Fourier-based slice analysis method (Experimental Procedures) returned slice parameters (inset values, Figure 4B) that produced the best fit (in the sense of Pearson’s correlation coefficient) to the measured 1D spatial tuning curve. For each neuron, the slice angle was confined (without loss of generality) to the interval [0°, 30°], the phase could fall anywhere within a predefined unit cell of the lattice, and the scale factor could take values between 1 and 8 (Experimental Procedures). The 1D tuning curves predicted by the slice hypothesis (Figure 4B, green) provide excellent matches to the recorded 1D spatial tuning curves (average correlation value of 0.92 and average p value of 0.04 for these three cells). The best-slice PSDs, shown superimposed on the data PSDs (Figure 4C, green), are also very close to the data PSDs. The gap histogram obtained from pooling gaps between adjacent bursts across individual trials (Figure 4D; see Experimental Procedures) displays a small set of distinct peaks. Moreover, most gaps and gap ratios (inset numerical values, Figure 4D) are within 5% of the values predicted for a regular triangular lattice (Figure 3E). By contrast, for the gap-randomized controls, each gap ratio will be independently drawn from a smooth, broad unimodal distribution (Figure 3D, bottom). We augment our virtual track recordings with data obtained by Brun and colleagues on a long linear 1D track (Brun et al., 2008Brun V.H. Solstad T. Kjelstrup K.B. Fyhn M. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.B. Progressive increase in grid scale from dorsal to ventral medial entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 1200-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar; http://www.ntnu.edu/kavli/research/grid-cell-data). The track is punctuated by discrete visuospatial landmarks like doorways, and the spatial response statistics of a majority of cells change visibly roughly halfway into the track and persist to the track’s end. For this reason, we analyze responses on the first half of the linear track (Figure 4E). Applying the same analysis as in Figures 4B–4D to two cells from Brun et al., 2008Brun V.H. Solstad T. Kjelstrup K.B. Fyhn M. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.B. Progressive increase in grid scale from dorsal to ventral medial entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 1200-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar yields striking agreement between their track responses and the linear slice hypothesis (Figure 4F, green; average slice correlation value of 0.89, and average p value of 5 × 10−4 for the cell pair; the p values, computed from the correlation coefficient and the number of above-threshold firing fields, are even more significant than for our virtual track data because of the greater track length and consequently larger number of fields). As we have seen, the 1D responses of some grid cells are extremely well fit by the slice hypothesis: the average fit correlation coefficients of the cells in Figure 4A are high (〈ρ〉 = 0.92), the PSD mass is largely concentrated in three or fewer peaks (〈p3〉 = 0.87), and the gap distribution has peaks close to the predicted values for slices of triangular lattices. To what extent is it generally true that the 1D responses of grid cells in our dataset can be well described by slices? To answer this question, we focus closely on dataset-wide statistical analyses of cells recorded on the virtual track, because there we possess 2D recordings, from which we can extract ground-truth information on whether the cells are grid cells, on their 2D periods, and their co-modularity. We generate the best-fit slice for each cell in the dataset (e.g., Figure 5A, top row, green; fit in black), together with large samples of corresponding gap-randomized and gap-shuffled controls (one sample of each shown in Figure 5A, middle row, reddish-gray and bluish-gray, respectively) and their best-fit slices (green). We can now compare metrics of the cell against the metrics of its two random controls (Figure 5A, bottom row). Typically, the correlation coefficients between the data and a slice are well to the right of those for the two matched control distributions; the same is true for the three-peakiness scores (Figure 5A, bottom row). We standardize the correlation score and PSD three-peakiness score of each cell (by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD of the distributions of these scores from matched controls, illustrated in Figure 5A, bottom row), so that the standardized scores reflect how many SDs away the data lies from the control distributions. Standardization allows us to collapse together results across all grid cells in the dataset. The resulting quality-of-fit distributions for the dataset are significantly to the right of both matched controls (Figure 5B; testing to see whether the data are drawn from a distribution with zero mean, as in the control distributions, yields p = 3 × 10−4; t = 4.28; df = 24 and 2 × 10−4; t = 4.49; df = 24, respectively, on a one-sample t test), as are the three-peakiness scores (Figure 5C; p = 1 × 10−3; t = 3.65; df = 24 and 8 × 10−4; t = 3.85; df = 24 respectively; one-sample t test). (The mean fit quality for non-standardized data is 0.786 and that for the controls is 0.729 [gap-randomized] and 0.730 [gap-shuffled]. The raw fit-quality distribution is also significantly to the right of both matched controls: p = 0.0039 for non-normalized fit quality of real data versus gap-randomized controls and p = 0.0046 versus gap-shuffled controls; one-sample t test.) Note that the controls are extremely conservative (not overly random), in that they preserve many higher-order statistics of the data; this is particularly true for the gap-shuffled controls on non-generic slice angles where the distribution of gaps is very narrow and thus the random controls closely resemble the original slice (see Figure S2); nevertheless, the slice hypothesis fits the data significantly better than it does the controls. Finally, the combined histogram of gaps, normalized by the inferred period (scale factor times 2D grid period) for each cell and pooled across all cells in the dataset, yields a distribution with a small set of distinct peaks (Figure 5D). The peaks in the gap distribution lie very close to the predicted values for an underlying regular triangular lattice (see Figure 3E). The slight, systematic leftward shift in all the peaks relative to the prediction can be attributed to the fact that each firing field has a finite width, and so the measured spacing from field to field will be reduced by an amount proportional to the field width. Lacking access to 2D data for cells recorded on 1D real tracks (Brun et al., 2008Brun V.H. Solstad T. Kjelstrup K.B. Fyhn M. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.B. Progressive increase in grid scale from dorsal to ventral medial entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 1200-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we instead identified putative grid cells from their 1D responses alone using a modified version of criteria used in Domnisoru et al., 2013Domnisoru C. Kinkhabwala A.A. Tank D.W. Membrane potential dynamics of grid cells.Nature. 2013; 495: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar (Experimental Procedures). An analysis of all passing cells (40 out of 97 cells, or 41%) yields excellent agreement with the preceding results: the 1D responses of putative grid cells are well fit by the slice hypothesis (average fit-quality of 0.72, close to that for virtual track data, Figure 6) and are better fit than are the statistically matched controls (Figures S5A–S5C); their gap distribution is consistent with slicing through a regular triangular lattice (Figure S5D); and slice parameters tend to cluster into groups, indicating the presence of comodular cells (Figure S5E). We next examine relationships in the 1D slice parameters of comodular cells. If the 1D responses of different cells from a module were generated by the coherent displacement (driven by animal motion) of an underlying 2D population pattern, we would expect their 1D tuning to correspond to parallel slices of the 2D population pattern with the same scale factor. As a consequence, their PSDs should also look similar (prediction in Figures 2D–2F). Indeed, the scale factors, slice angles, and PSDs of comodular cells can be very similar, as we can see for an example cell pair on the linear virtual track and another pair on a long linear track (Figures 6A–6D). However, the best-fit slice parameters obtained individually for each cell in the dataset are not always very similar for comodular cells (Figure 6E, left). One reason for this discrepancy is the existence of an effective degeneracy in the solution for the best-fit slice of each cell, which arises because of data limitations. Because of response variability and the finite length of the track, there are sometimes two or three discrete good slice solutions for a cell (see Experimental Procedures). These solutions are not near each other in parameter space because the relationship between fit quality and slice parameters is non-convex—they tend to take the form of well-separated, similarly deep local optima in the solution landscape and correspond to a large step in slice angle and scale factor. Thus, there is an inherent uncertainty in estimating the best slice parameters, and cell responses actually generated from parallel slic"

https://openalex.org/W2277685993,"Solid malignancies contain subsets of multipotent cells that grow as spheres and efficiently propagate tumors in xenograft models, reflecting a stem-like, self-renewing and tumor-propagating phenotype. These cancer ‘stem cells (SCs)’ have been shown to maintain tumor growth, contribute to resistance and drive tumor recurrence. Cancer cell stemness is dynamically influenced by epigenetic mechanisms and differentially regulated coding and noncoding RNAs. How these mechanisms specifically contribute to the generation and/or maintenance of cancer SCs remains unclear. This study identifies a novel epigenetically regulated circuit that integrates microRNA, chromatin remodeling and the reprogramming transcription factor Sox2 to regulate glioblastoma (GBM)-propagating SCs. We show that miR-296-5p expression is repressed in a DNA methylation-dependent manner under conditions that promote GBM cell stemness and that miR-296-5p inhibits GBM cell stemness and their capacity to self-renew as spheres and propagate glioma xenografts in vivo. We show that the chromatin remodeling protein HMGA1 functions as a downstream effector of these biological responses to miR-296-5p and regulates Sox2 expression, a master driver of cell stemness, by modifying chromatin architecture at the Sox2 promoter. These results show for the first time that miR-296-5p inhibits transcriptional mechanisms that support GBM SCs and identify a miR-296-5p:HMGA1:Sox2 axis as a novel regulator of GBM SCs and candidate pathway for targeting therapies directed at depleting tumors of their tumor-propagating stem cell subsets."
https://openalex.org/W2285343477,"Clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), defined as hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) ≥10 mmHg, causes major complications. HVPG is not always available, so a non-invasive tool to diagnose CSPH would be useful. VWF-Ag can be used to diagnose. Using the VITRO score (the VWF-Ag/platelet ratio) instead of VWF-Ag itself improves the diagnostic accuracy of detecting cirrhosis/ fibrosis in HCV patients.This study tested the diagnostic accuracy of VITRO score detecting CSPH compared to HVPG measurement.All patients underwent HVPG testing and were categorised as CSPH or no CSPH. The following patient data were determined: CPS, D'Amico stage, VITRO score, APRI and transient elastography (TE).The analysis included 236 patients; 170 (72%) were male, and the median age was 57.9 (35.2-76.3; 95% CI). Disease aetiology included ALD (39.4%), HCV (23.4%), NASH (12.3%), other (8.1%) and unknown (11.9%). The CPS showed 140 patients (59.3%) with CPS A; 56 (23.7%) with CPS B; and 18 (7.6%) with CPS C. 136 patients (57.6%) had compensated and 100 (42.4%) had decompensated cirrhosis; 83.9% had HVPG ≥10 mmHg. The VWF-Ag and the VITRO score increased significantly with worsening HVPG categories (P<0.0001). ROC analysis was performed for the detection of CSPH and showed AUC values of 0.92 for TE, 0.86 for VITRO score, 0.79 for VWF-Ag, 0.68 for ELF and 0.62 for APRI.The VITRO score is an easy way to diagnose CSPH independently of CPS in routine clinical work and may improve the management of patients with cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W2279579838,"Digenean trematodes are common and abundant in aquatic habitats and their free-living larvae, the cercariae, have recently been recognized as important components of ecosystems in terms of comprising a significant proportion of biomass and in having a potentially strong influence on food web dynamics. One strategy to enhance their transmission success is to produce high numbers of cercariae which are available during the activity peak of the next host. In laboratory experiments with 13 Lymnaea stagnalis snails infected with Trichobilharzia szidati the average daily emergence rate per snail was determined as 2,621 cercariae, with a maximum of 29,560. During a snail's lifetime this summed up to a mass equivalent of or even exceeding the snail's own body mass. Extrapolated for the eutrophic pond where the snails were collected, annual T. szidati biomass may reach 4.65 tons, a value equivalent to a large Asian elephant. Emission peaks were observed after the onset of illumination, indicating emission synchronizing with the high morning activities of the definitive hosts, ducks. However, high cercarial emission is possible throughout the day under favorable lightning conditions. Therefore, although bird schistosomes, such as T. szidati constitute only a fraction of the diverse trematode communities in the studied aquatic ecosystem, their cercariae can still pose a considerable risk for humans of getting cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch) due to the high number of cercariae emitted from infected snails."

https://openalex.org/W2274981669,"The role of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in cancer has been extensively studied in the context of DNA repair, leading to clinical trials of PARP1 inhibitors in cancers defective in homologous recombination. However, the DNA repair-independent roles of PARP1 in carcinogenesis and metastasis, particularly in lung cancer metastasis, remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we report that PARP1 promotes lung adenocarcinoma relapse to the brain and bones by regulating several steps of the metastatic process in a DNA repair-independent manner. We find that PARP1 expression is associated with overall and distant metastasis-free survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Consistent with this, genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 significantly attenuated the metastatic potential of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Further investigation revealed that PARP1 potentiates lung adenocarcinoma metastasis by promoting invasion, anoikis resistance, extravasation and self-renewal of lung adenocarcinoma cells and also by modifying the brain microenvironment. Finally, we identified S100A4 and CLDN7 as novel transcriptional targets and clinically relevant effectors of PARP1. Collectively, our study not only revealed previously unknown functions of PARP1 in lung adenocarcinoma metastasis but also delineated the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-metastatic function of PARP1. Furthermore, these findings provide a foundation for the potential use of PARP1 inhibitors as a new treatment option for lung adenocarcinoma patients with elevated PARP1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2280325592,"Ovarian tissue collected by biopsy procedures allows the performance of many studies with clinical applications in the field of female fertility preservation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of reproductive phase (anestrous vs. diestrous) and ovarian structures (antral follicles and corpus luteum) on the quality, class distribution, number, and density of preantral follicles, and stromal cell density. Ovarian fragments were harvested by biopsy pick-up procedures from mares and submitted to histological analysis. The mean preantral follicle and ovarian stromal cell densities were greater in the diestrous phase and a positive correlation of stromal cell density with the number and density of preantral follicles was observed. The mean area (mm2) of ovarian structures increased in the diestrous phase and had positive correlations with number of preantral follicles, follicle density, and stromal cell density. Biopsy fragments collected from ovaries containing an active corpus luteum had a higher follicle density, stromal cell density, and proportion of normal preantral follicles. In conclusion, our results showed: (1) the diestrous phase influenced positively the preantral follicle quality, class distribution, and follicle and stromal cell densities; (2) the area of ovarian structures was positively correlated with the follicle and stromal cell densities; and (3) the presence of an active corpus luteum had a positive effect on the quality of preantral follicles, and follicle and stromal densities. Therefore, herein we demonstrate that the presence of key ovarian structures favors the harvest of ovarian fragments containing an appropriate number of healthy preantral follicles."
https://openalex.org/W2282949853,"Important in regulating the uptake, storage, and metabolism of retinoids, cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1) is essential for trafficking vitamin A through the cytoplasm. However, the molecular details of ligand uptake and targeted release by CRBP1 remain unclear. Here we report the first structure of CRBP1 in a ligand-free form as well as ultra-high resolution structures of this protein bound to either all-trans-retinol or retinylamine, the latter a therapeutic retinoid that prevents light-induced retinal degeneration. Superpositioning of human apo- and holo-CRBP1 revealed major differences within segments surrounding the entrance to the retinoid-binding site. These included α-helix II and hairpin turns between β-strands βC-βD and βE-βF as well as several side chains, such as Phe-57, Tyr-60, and Ile-77, that change their orientations to accommodate the ligand. Additionally, we mapped hydrogen bond networks inside the retinoid-binding cavity and demonstrated their significance for the ligand affinity. Analyses of the crystallographic B-factors indicated several regions with higher backbone mobility in the apoprotein that became more rigid upon retinoid binding. This conformational flexibility of human apo-CRBP1 facilitates interaction with the ligands, whereas the more rigid holoprotein structure protects the labile retinoid moiety during vitamin A transport. These findings suggest a mechanism of induced fit upon ligand binding by mammalian cellular retinol-binding proteins."

Previous smaller studies indicated a relationship between delivery mode and newborn inflammation potentially constituting a mediating factor. We aimed to determine the influence of delivery mode and duration of labor on cord blood concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).In the Ulm SPATZ Health Study, 934 singleton newborns and their mothers were recruited during their hospital stay in the University Medical Center Ulm, Southern Germany, from 04/2012-05/2013. Inflammatory biomarkers were measured by ELISAs (n = 836). Delivery mode was analyzed categorically (elective cesarean (reference), active labor delivery: emergency cesarean, assisted vaginal, and spontaneous vaginal); duration of labor continuously. Following log-transformation, linear regression was used to estimate geometric means ratios (GMR) adjusted for potential confounders for the effects of delivery mode and duration of labor on each biomarker separately. Independent replication was sought in the similarly conducted Ulm Birth Cohort Study recruited from 11/2000-11/2001.Individually, active labor delivery modes as well as increasing duration of labor were associated with higher leptin and hs-CRP concentrations. After mutual adjustment, the associations with delivery modes were attenuated but those for duration of labor remained statistically significant (GMR (95%CI) 1.10 (1.00; 1.21) and 1.15 (1.04; 1.27) for leptin and hs-CRP per hour of labor, respectively). No significant adjusted associations were observed between delivery modes and adiponectin concentrations. These findings were replicated in an independent birth cohort study.Cord blood leptin and hs-CRP concentrations were associated with duration of labor rather than delivery mode. Further research is warranted to investigate these associations with additional cytokines involved in inflammatory response to delineate the inflammatory profile. Subsequently, research on determinants of these associations and their role in development of chronic disease is needed."

Although there is evidence on the analgesic and in vitro inhibition of inflammatory signaling pathways, and paw edema by PA, its anti-inflammatory effect deserves further investigation. Thus, the objective of present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of PA in carrageenan-induced peritoneal and paw inflammation in mice. Firstly, we assessed the effect of PA in carrageenan-induced leukocyte recruitment in the peritoneal cavity and paw edema and myeloperoxidase activity. Next, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of PA. The effect of PA on carrageenan-induced oxidative stress in the paw skin and peritoneal cavity was assessed. We also tested the effect of PA on nitric oxide, superoxide anion, and inflammatory cytokine production in the peritoneal cavity. PA inhibited carrageenan-induced recruitment of total leukocytes and neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity in a dose-dependent manner. PA also inhibited carrageenan-induced paw edema and myeloperoxidase activity in the paw skin. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of PA depended on maintaining paw skin antioxidant activity as observed by the levels of reduced glutathione, ability to scavenge the ABTS cation and reduce iron as well as by the inhibition of superoxide anion and nitric oxide production in the peritoneal cavity. Furthermore, PA inhibited carrageenan-induced peritoneal production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. PA presents prominent anti-inflammatory effect in carrageenan-induced inflammation by reducing oxidative stress, nitric oxide, and cytokine production. Therefore, it seems to be a promising anti-inflammatory molecule that merits further investigation."

Pear is one of the most important deciduous fruit trees in the world, but the mechanisms of drought tolerance in this plant are still unclear. To better understand the molecular basis regarding drought stress response, RNA-seq was performed on samples collected before and after dehydration in Pyrus betulaefolia. In total, 19,532 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. These genes were annotated into 144 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 18 clusters of orthologous groups (COG) involved in 129 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) defined pathways. These DEGs comprised 49 (26 up-regulated, 23 down-regulated), 248 (166 up-regulated, 82 down-regulated), 3483 (1295 up-regulated, 2188 down-regulated), 1455 (1065 up-regulated, 390 down-regulated) genes from the 1 h, 3 h and 6 h dehydration-treated samples and a 24 h recovery samples, respectively. RNA-seq was validated by analyzing the expresson patterns of randomly selected 16 DEGs by quantitative real-time PCR. Photosynthesis, signal transduction, innate immune response, protein phosphorylation, response to water, response to biotic stimulus, and plant hormone signal transduction were the most significantly enriched GO categories amongst the DEGs. A total of 637 transcription factors were shown to be dehydration responsive. In addition, a number of genes involved in the metabolism and signaling of hormones were significantly affected by the dehydration stress. This dataset provides valuable information regarding the Pyrus betulaefolia transcriptome changes in response to dehydration and may promote identification and functional analysis of potential genes that could be used for improving drought tolerance via genetic engineering of non-model, but economically-important, perennial species."
https://openalex.org/W2288090348,"Deregulation of microRNAs (miRs) contributes to progression and metastasis of prostate and other cancers. miR-23b and -27b, encoded in the same miR cluster (miR-23b/-27b), are downregulated in human metastatic prostate cancer compared with primary tumors and benign tissue. Expression of miR-23b/-27b decreases prostate cancer cell migration, invasion and results in anoikis resistance. Conversely, antagomiR-mediated miR-23b and -27b silencing produces the opposite result in a more indolent prostate cancer cell line. However, neither miR-23b/-27b expression or inhibition impacts prostate cancer cell proliferation suggesting that miR-23b/-27b selectively suppresses metastasis. To examine the effects of miR-23b/-27b on prostate cancer metastasis in vivo, orthotopic prostate xenografts were established using aggressive prostate cancer cells transduced with miR-23b/-27b or non-targeting control miRNA. Although primary tumor formation was similar between miR-23b/-27b-transduced cells and controls, miR-23b/-27b expression in prostate cancer cells decreased seminal vesicle invasion and distant metastases. Gene-expression profiling identified the endocytic adaptor, Huntingtin-interacting protein 1-related (HIP1R) as being downregulated by miR-23b/-27b. Increased HIP1R expression in prostate cancer cells inversely phenocopied the effects of miR-23b/-27b overexpression on migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. HIP1R rescued miR-23b/-27b-mediated repression of migration in prostate cancer cells. HIP1R mRNA levels were decreased in seminal vesicle tissue from mice bearing miR-23b/-27b-transduced prostate cancer cell xenografts compared with scrambled controls, suggesting HIP1R is a key functional target of miR-23b/-27b. In addition, depletion of HIP1R led to a more rounded, less mesenchymal-like cell morphology, consistent with decreased metastatic properties. Together, these data demonstrate that the miR-23b/-27b cluster functions as a metastasis-suppressor by decreasing HIP1R levels in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2286558145,"Sirt6 is a histone deacetylase with NAD+-dependent activity. Sirt6 has been shown as a tumor suppressor partially via inhibiting the expression of c-Myc target genes and ribosome biogenesis. However, how to regulate Sirt6 activity is largely unknown. In this study, we identify that Sirt6 can be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier. Sirt6 SUMOylation deficiency specifically decreases its deacetylation of H3K56 but not H3K9 in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that SUMOylation deficiency decreases Sirt6 binding with c-Myc, decreasing Sirt6 occupancy on the locus of c-Myc target genes. Therefore, Sirt6 SUMOylation deficiency reduces its deacetylation of H3k56 and its repression of c-Myc target genes. Moreover, Sirt6 SUMOylation deficiency reduces its suppression of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Thus, these results reveal that SUMOylation has an important role in regulation of Sirt6 deacetylation on H3K56, as well as its tumor suppressive activity."
https://openalex.org/W2278895997,"Recent studies provide evidence that premature maternal decidual senescence resulting from heightened mTORC1 signaling is a cause of preterm birth (PTB). We show here that mice devoid of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) with elevated levels ofN-arachidonyl ethanolamide (anandamide), a major endocannabinoid lipid mediator, were more susceptible to PTB upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Anandamide is degraded by FAAH and primarily works by activating two G-protein-coupled receptors CB1 and CB2, encoded by Cnr1 and Cnr2, respectively. We found thatFaah(-/-)decidual cells progressively underwent premature senescence as marked by increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining and γH2AX-positive decidual cells. Interestingly, increased endocannabinoid signaling activated MAPK p38, but not p42/44 or mTORC1 signaling, inFaah(-/-)deciduae, and inhibition of p38 halted premature decidual senescence. We further showed that treatment of a long-acting anandamide in wild-type mice at midgestation triggered premature decidual senescence utilizing CB1, since administration of a CB1 antagonist greatly reduced the rate of PTB inFaah(-/-)females exposed to LPS. These results provide evidence that endocannabinoid signaling is critical in regulating decidual senescence and parturition timing. This study identifies a previously unidentified pathway in decidual senescence, which is independent of mTORC1 signaling."

New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2284497347,"Multiple prior studies demonstrated that patients with early Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and positive estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) slopes experience increased risk of death. We sought to characterize patients with positive eGFR slopes, examine the renal function trajectory that follows the time period where positive slope is observed, and examine the association between different trajectories and risk of death.We built a cohort of 204,132 United States veterans with early CKD stage 3; eGFR slopes were defined based on Bayesian mixed-effects models using outpatient eGFR measurements between October 1999 and September 2004; to build renal function trajectories, patients were followed longitudinally thereafter (from October 2004) until September 2013. There were 41,410 (20.29%) patients with positive eGFR slope and they exhibited increased risk of death compared to patients with stable eGFR slope (HR = 1.33, CI:1.31-1.35). There was an inverse graded association between severity of albuminuria and the odds of positive eGFR slope (OR = 0.94, CI:0.90-0.98, and OR = 0.76, CI:0.69-0.84 for microalbuminuria and albuminuria; respectively). Following the time period where positive eGFR slope is observed, we characterized 4 trajectory phenotypes: high eGFR intercept and positive trajectory (HIPT) (12.42%), intermediate intercept and mild negative trajectory (IIMNT) (60.04%), low intercept and fast negative trajectory (LIFNT)(23.33%), and high intercept and fast negative trajectory (HIFNT) (4.20%). Compared to IIMNT (reference group), HIPT is associated with younger age, dementia, HIV, chronic lung disease, peripheral artery disease, weight loss, and inversely associated with albuminuria; LIFNT and HIFNT were associated with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and albuminuria. The risk of death at 9 years was lowest in IIMNT (HR = 1.12, CI:1.09-1.14), highest in HIPT (HR = 1.71, CI:1.63-1.79), and intermediate in LIFNT (HR = 1.36, CI:1.32-1.40) and HIFNT (HR = 1.56, CI:1.45-1.68).Our results demonstrate that patients with positive eGFR slopes, when followed over longer period of time, follow 4 distinct trajectory phenotypes that have distinct demographic and clinical correlates and are differentially associated with risk of death."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and other mycobacteria is their characteristic cell envelope (1Daffé M. Zuber B. Remau H. Fronzes R. Bacterial Membranes: Structural and Molecular Biology. Caister Academic Press, Norfolk, UK2014: 179-192Google Scholar), which has a much higher lipid content than the envelopes of other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (2Daffé M. The cell envelope of tubercle bacilli.Tuberculosis. 2015; 95: S155-S158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The considerable diversity of lipids present contributes to the unique nature and structural complexity of the mycobacterial cell envelope but also underlies key features of mycobacterial physiology. These lipids also play an important role in virulence, pathogenicity, and resistance to antibiotics (3Daffé M. Draper P. The envelope layers of mycobacteria with reference to their pathogenicity.Adv. Microb Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the control of inflammation and immune mechanisms (4Neyrolles O. Guilhot C. Recent advances in deciphering the contribution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipids to pathogenesis.Tuberculosis. 2011; 91: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mycolic acids, 2-alkyl, 3-hydroxy long-chain fatty acids, are major specific components of the mycobacterial cell envelope (5Marrakchi H. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. Mycolic acids: structures, biosynthesis, and beyond.Chem. Biol. 2014; 21: 67-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). They may be linked to arabinogalactan or form esters of trehalose or glycerol in the so-called “mycomembrane,” which plays a crucial role in establishing the architecture and impermeability of the cell envelope. Mycolic acids are essential for the viability of mycobacteria, and their biosynthetic pathway is a proven target for anti-mycobacterial drugs that continues to attract considerable attention from the community working on TB (5Marrakchi H. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. Mycolic acids: structures, biosynthesis, and beyond.Chem. Biol. 2014; 21: 67-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The mycolic acid biosynthesis is complex. Briefly, two fatty acid synthases are involved in the biosynthesis of long fatty acids, yielding the α-alkyl (C24–C26) branch on the one hand and, after further modifications, the so-called meromycolic chain (C42–C62), on the other hand. These fatty acids are activated before condensation can take place, finally leading, after reduction, to the characteristic mycolic motif. Several essential enzymes are involved in this penultimate step of mycolic acid biosynthesis. They include Pks13, a polyketide synthase that has been identified as the condensing enzyme (6Portevin D. De Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C.

The corresponding FadD (fatty acid degradation) proteins in M. tuberculosis are of two types, 12 fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) and 22 fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs) (11Trivedi O.A. Arora P. Sridharan V. Tickoo R. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. Enzymic activation and transfer of fatty acids as acyl-adenylates in mycobacteria.Nature. 2004; 428: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). FAALs and FACLs are involved in fatty acid activation and use ATP to produce common acyl adenylate intermediates. However, FACLs catalyze a second reaction in which acyl chains are transferred to coenzyme A (CoA), whereas FAALs transfer the activated acyl chains onto the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains of their cognate polyketide synthase. The FAAL activity of FadD32 and the FadD32-assisted transfer of fatty acids to the N-terminal ACP domain of Pks13, defining its fatty acyl-ACP synthetase (FAAS) activity, have been demonstrated biochemically (12Gavalda S.

The M. marinum fadD32 gene was cloned according to published procedures, by PCR amplification from MYCM53 total DNA with the following primers: MmfadD32, 5′ CTCGCATATGATGGCGTACCACAACCCGTTC; MmfadD32, 3′ AGCTCATATGCTTGTTGGCTTGCGCGTCCTC. We transformed competent Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) One Shot (Invitrogen) with pET15b-fadD32 constructs for the production of full-length FadD32 proteins. Expression was induced with auto-inducible medium, as described by Studier (19Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were first grown overnight in Luria Broth medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C and then diluted in auto-induction medium. Cells cultured for 72 h at 20 °C were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 15 min) at 4 °C, washed in 50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol (v/v), 30 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.75 mg/ml lysozyme, and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Sigma) and frozen at −80 °C. The frozen bacterial pellets were thawed at room temperature, disrupted by sonication (four intermittent pulses of 30 s) on a VibraCell (Fisher Bioblock Scientific, Illkirch, France), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Native proteins were purified at 4 °C. The clarified lysates were loaded onto a HisTrap HP (1 ml) affinity column (GE Healthcare). Recombinant FadD32 proteins were eluted in 150 mm imidazole in 50 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Whenever appropriate, the 20-residue-long His tags of the affinity-purified FadD32 were removed by thrombin cleavage (Novagen), as follows. The protein solution was diluted 5-fold to decrease the imidazole concentration to 30 mm, concentrated on a Vivaspin 20 column (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) to obtain an optical density of 1.0, and then subjected to cleavage by incubation with 0.28 units/ml thrombin for 3 h at room temperature. The cleaved proteins were then reloaded onto the HisTrap HP affinity column to eliminate the uncleaved fractions. The protein-containing flow-through fractions were concentrated to an optical density of 3.0 and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HighLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The purified proteins were checked by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining and were then concentrated to the desired concentrations. Samples used for kinetic experiments were stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. Samples used for biophysical studies were stored at −80 °C without glycerol. Crystallization was attempted only with freshly prepared proteins. FadD32 enzyme activity was measured as described previously (17Galandrin S. Guillet V. Rane R.S. Léger M. Eynard N. Das K.

Screen. 2013; 18: 576-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pyrophosphate (PPi) released during the reaction was hydrolyzed in a pyrophosphatase-coupled reaction, and the resulting inorganic phosphate (Pi) was quantified with the colorimetric PiColorLockTM gold assay kit (Innova Biosciences, Cambridge, UK), by reading the absorbance at 630 nm (A630) resulting from the formation of the phosphomolybdate complex. Reactions were conducted at room temperature, in 30 μl of assay mix containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.001% Brij®35, 1 mm DTT, 2 milliunits/ml pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 1–2 mm ATP, and 20–200 μm fatty acid (as indicated). Reactions were initiated by adding 15 μl of FadD32 diluted in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, to 15 μl of 2× assay mix. The reaction was stopped after 40–60 min by adding 30 μl of cold reaction buffer and 15 μl of malachite green reagent. The A630 was read after 5 min of incubation at room temperature in a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany). A reaction without enzyme (for specific activity experiments), or without substrate (for Km and Vmax determinations), was used as a blank in each experiment. The concentration of Pi was determined from a calibration curve plotted with known concentrations of Pi from 10 to 80 μm in each experiment, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. For specific activity experiments (Table 1), the enzyme was first subjected to serial dilution in HEPES pH 7.5 (with protein concentrations of 12.5 to 800 nm for MtFadD32, MmFadD32, and CgFadD32 and from 2.5 to 160 nm for MsFadD32) and added to the reaction mixture containing 20 μm lauric acid (C12) as substrate and 2 mm ATP. We determined the apparent kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax, and kcat), by measuring the initial velocity (Vi, in μm formed PPi per min) as a function of the substrate concentration studied and at fixed concentrations of substrate with an incubation time of 40–60 min. The kinetic parameters for ATP were determined by measuring the initial velocity at a fixed concentration of lauric acid (200 μm) and various concentrations of ATP (0.0625 to 4 mm); the enzyme concentrations used were 0.4 μm for MtFadD32 and MmFadD32, 0.04 μm for MsFadD32, and 2 μm for CgFadD32. Kinetic parameters for fatty acids (lauric acid or myristic acid) were determined at a fixed concentration of ATP (4 mm), with various concentrations of fatty acid (3.1–200 μm); the enzyme concentrations used were 0.4 μm for MtFadD32 and MmFadD32 and 0.04 μm for MsFadD32. The saturation curves were fitted by non-linear regression analysis with a Graphpad Prism 4.02 equation: Vi = Vmax × [S]/(Km + [S]), where Vi is the initial velocity; Vmax is the maximal velocity; [S] is the substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant. The catalytic constant (kcat) reflects the maximum rate of product formation and was calculated by dividing Vmax by the total enzyme concentration [ET]: kcat = Vmax/[ET].TABLE 1Specific activity and kinetic parameters of FadD32 orthologsProteinMtFadD32MmFadD32MsFadD32CgFadD32Identity (%)100927439Specific activity (nmol·min−1·mg−1)5.37 ± 0.163.85 ± 0.1239.91 ± 0.730.46 ± 0.03Kinetic parametersATPKm (μm)248 ± 27902 ± 114112 ± 12Vmax (μm·min−1)0.14 ± 0.010.29 ± 0.010.17 ± 0.01kcat (min−1)0.35 ± 0.010.72 ± 0.034.33 ± 0.01kcat/Km (min−1·μm−1)0.0014 ± 0.00030.0008 ± 0.00030.0387 ± 0.0063Lauric acid (C12)Km (μm)72.09 ± 5.75103.2 ± 13.9425.9 ± 1.6aData are from Ref. 17.Vmax (μm.min−1)0.82 ± 0.030.60 ± 0.390.45 ± 0.01kcat (min−1)2.04 ± 0.071.51 ± 0.0911.29 ± 0.22kcat/Km (min−1·μm−1)0.028 ± 0.0120.015 ± 0.0070.438 ± 0.139Myristic acid (C14)Km (μm)4.77 ± 0.655.76 ± 0.565.2 ± 0.5aData are from Ref. 17.Vmax (μm.min−1)0.39 ± 0.010.27 ± 0.010.17 ± 0.01kcat (min−1)0.98 ± 0.030.69 ± 0.014.18 ± 0.09kcat/Km (min−1·μm−1)0.206 ± 0.0420.119 ± 0.0250.800 ± 0.184a Data are from Ref. 17Galandrin S.

The reactions were started by adding the enzyme (0.4 μm for MtFadD32 and MmFadD32 and 0.04 μm for MsFadD32). They were performed for 60 min at room temperature, in quadruplicate. The results are expressed as the percent inhibition. Curve fitting and IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) calculations were performed with the dose-response curve as the model equation: Y = bottom + (top − bottom)/(1 + 10∧((logIC50 − X) × Hill slope) (GraphPad Prism 4.02 Software, San Diego), where top and bottom are plateaus in the units of the y axis (maximal and minimal inhibition, respectively), and Hill slope describes the steepness of the family of curves (a Hill slope of a constant value of +1.0 was applied). DSF was used to characterize the thermal stability of the enzyme in various buffer and pH conditions and in the presence of AMPC12. A mixture of enzyme (4 μm), SYPRO® Orange (5×) (Invitrogen), the appropriate buffer at a concentration of 100 mm, and 500 mm NaCl was subjected to a temperature gradient from 25 to 80 °C, with increments of 0.3 °C. All measurements were performed in triplicate, in 96-well plates (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). Thermal transitions were monitored with a real time PCR CFX96 System (Bio-Rad). The melting points (Tm) were identified by the inflection points of the curves in relative fluorescence units = f(T). For DSF experiments in the presence of AMPC12, the final concentration of alkyl adenylate was 20 μm. For MST measurements, FadD32 orthologs at a concentration of 20 μm were labeled with the RED fluorescent dye NT-647. Labeling and the removal of free dye were performed within 45 min. We then titrated 200 nm NT-647-labeled FadD32 protein against various amounts of AMPC12 or AMPC20 (9 nm to 270 μm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 10% DMSO. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then loaded into hydrophilic glass capillaries for MST analysis with Monolith NT.115 (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Germany). We monitored the thermophoretic movement of labeled FadD32. Dissociation constants (KD) and associated errors were calculated with NanoTemper software. FadD32 protein samples were buffered in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. We loaded 20 μl of protein sample at a final concentration of 40 μm (2.8 mg/ml) onto a Shodex KW402.5–4F column (Wyatt Technology, France) equilibrated with a filter-sterilized (passed through a filter with 0.1-μm pores) buffer consisting of 150 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0, in an Agilent 1260 Infinity LC chromatographic system (Agilent Technology). Separation was performed at 15 °C, with a flow rate of 0.35 ml·min−1. Data were collected on a DAWN HELEOS 8+ (8-angle) and Optilab T-rEX refractive index detector (Wyatt Technology, Toulouse France). Results were analyzed with ASTRA 6.0.2.9 software (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Purified untagged MmFadD32 and MsFadD32 proteins were concentrated in 50 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, to 72 μm (5.4 mg/ml) and 153 μm (11 mg/ml), respectively. AMPC12 and AMPC20 solubilized in DMSO were mixed with proteins at a molar ratio of 3:1, with final concentrations in DMSO of 3 and 8%, respectively. MmFadD32-AMPC12 crystals were obtained by mixing equal volumes of the protein/inhibitor solution and a reservoir solution composed of 28% PEG 6000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7. In these conditions, triangular crystals, typically measuring 100 × 100 × 40 μm, were obtained in seeding experiments with a single spontaneously crystallized drop. These crystals displayed diffraction to a resolution of 2.5 Å with a synchrotron radiation beam. They belonged to space group P212121, with two molecules per asymmetric unit and 55% solvent. Crystals of MsFadD32 with either AMPC12 or AMPC20 were grown by mixing equal volumes of protein/inhibitor solutions and reservoir solution composed of PEG 1000, in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2 to 8.7. These crystals were ∼100 × 100 × 30 μm in size and displayed diffraction to a maximum resolution of 3.3 Å with synchrotron beams. They belonged to space group P4, with eight molecules per asymmetric unit and 50% solvent. All crystals were cryoprotected by soaking for 2 min in reservoir solution supplemented with 10% glycerol (w/v), frozen under a cryogenic nitrogen stream, and stored in liquid nitrogen before data collection at 100 K. Data for MmFadD32-AMPC12 were obtained with ESRF beamline ID14-1, to a resolution of 2.5 Å. Data sets corresponding to MsFadD32 with AMPC12 and AMPC20 were obtained with ESRF beamline ID23-2, at 3.5 Å resolution. X-ray images were processed with Mosflm (20Leslie A.G. Powell H.R. Read R.J. Sussman J.L. Evolving Methods for Macromolecular Crystallography. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2007: 41-51Google Scholar), and diffraction intensities were scaled with SCALA (21Evans P.

The Q factor for this model was 0.637, and final refinement with Balbes gave Rwork and Rfree values of 0.415 and 0.452, respectively.

Glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG), a novel regulator of the Arp2/3 complex, has been shown to regulate directional migration of neutrophils and T-lymphocytes. In this study, we explored the important role of GMFG in monocyte chemotaxis, adhesion, and β1-integrin turnover. We found that knockdown of GMFG in monocytes resulted in impaired chemotactic migration toward formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α) as well as decreased α5β1-integrin-mediated chemoattractant-stimulated adhesion. These GMFG knockdown impaired effects could be reversed by cotransfection of GFP-tagged full-length GMFG. GMFG knockdown cells reduced the cell surface and total protein levels of α5β1-integrin and increased its degradation. Importantly, we demonstrate that GMFG mediates the ubiquitination of β1-integrin through knockdown or overexpression of GMFG. Moreover, GMFG knockdown retarded the efficient recycling of β1-integrin back to the plasma membrane following normal endocytosis of α5β1-integrin, suggesting that the involvement of GMFG in maintaining α5β1-integrin stability may occur in part by preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation and promoting β1-integrin recycling. Furthermore, we observed that GMFG interacted with syntaxin 4 (STX4) and syntaxin-binding protein 4 (STXBP4); however, only knockdown of STXBP4, but not STX4, reduced monocyte migration and decreased β1-integrin cell surface expression. Knockdown of STXBP4 also substantially inhibited β1-integrin recycling in human monocytes. These results indicate that the effects of GMFG on monocyte migration and adhesion probably occur through preventing ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation of α5β1-integrin and facilitating effective β1-integrin recycling back to the plasma membrane.

The migration of monocytes from the circulation toward the surrounding extravascular space is a crucial event in physiological and pathological immune and inflammatory responses. The extravasation of monocytes is a highly orchestrated multistep adhesion cascade that is mediated by dynamic regulation of adhesion molecules expressed on both monocytes and endothelial cells, including integrins (1.Ley K. Laudanna C. Cybulsky M.I. Nourshargh S. Getting to the site of inflammation: the leukocyte adhesion cascade updated.Nat. Rev.

Res. 2010; 86: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric transmembrane proteins consisting of an α- and β-subunit that bind extracellular matrix components to provide sites of adhesion and signals for the dynamic rearrangement of cytoskeletal elements in various stages of cell migration (3.Herter J. Zarbock A. Integrin regulation during leukocyte recruitment.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 4451-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4.Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Adhesion molecule cascades direct lymphocyte recirculation and leukocyte migration during inflammation.Immunol. Res. 2000; 22: 299-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Monocytes, like other leukocytes, express distinct integrins, but those most relevant to monocyte migration belong to the β1- and β2-integrin subfamilies. Although the important role of β1/β2-integrins in regulating monocyte transmigration across the endothelium to sites of inflammation has been relatively well studied (5.Chuluyan H.E. Schall T.J.

Accumulating evidence indicates that integrin endocytic trafficking plays an important regulatory role in cell migration and disease progression by affecting integrin function and cell surface distribution as well as the turnover of extracellular matrix molecules (8.Margadant C.

The trafficking of newly synthesized or recycled integrin molecules to the plasma membrane requires the tight regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, actin-modulating proteins, and vesicular trafficking machineries that selectively sort cargo proteins via various adaptor proteins (11.De Franceschi N. Hamidi H. Alanko J. Sahgal P. Ivaska J. Integrin traffic: the update.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The final step for integrin trafficking to the cell surface is mediated by the fusion of integrin-containing transport vesicles with the plasma membrane, a process that is poorly understood at the molecular level (12.Day P. Riggs K.A. Hasan N. Corbin D. Humphrey D. Hu C. Syntaxins 3 and 4 mediate vesicular trafficking of α5β1 and α3β1 integrins and cancer cell migration.Int. J.

A growing number of studies have demonstrated that the interaction of SNARE proteins on vesicles (v-SNAREs) and on target membranes (t-SNAREs) drives intracellular vesicle fusion (13.Rothman J.E.

Several SNARE proteins have been implicated in integrin trafficking. For example, the interaction of t-SNARE protein STX6 (syntaxin 6) with the v-SNARE VAMP3 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 3) appears to play a role in cell migration by mediating recycling of heterodimers containing β1-integrin in endothelial cells and HeLa cells (17.Riggs K.A.

In macrophages, the plasma membrane t-SNARE proteins STX4 and SNAP23 (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein 23) interact with VAMP3 to mediate endocytic recycling of α5β1-integrin (19.Veale K.J.

In addition, STX4 and STXBP4 (syntaxin-binding protein 4) are specifically critical in the vesicular transport of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and cardiomyocytes (20.Kawaguchi T.

The Arp2/3 complex plays a fundamental role in both cell migration and intracellular trafficking by mediating membrane remodeling through the endocytic internalization and recycling, degradation, and exocytic transport of membrane components (30.Pollard T.D.

Despite these advances, it remains unclear whether GMFG mediates monocyte migration through modulation of intracellular trafficking of β1-integrin. glia maturation factor-γ formyl-Met-Leu-Phe fibronectin Hanks' balanced salt solution. Here, we show that GMFG is important for maintaining the stability of β1-integrin protein and the efficient recycling of β1-integrin in monocytes and is required for efficient monocyte chemotaxis, probably through association with STXBP4. These results further support the important role of GMFG in monocyte migration. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats of healthy adult donors by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation according to a protocol approved by the institutional review board of NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, and consistent with federal regulations. Monocytes were purified using a negative selection human monocyte enrichment kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monocytes (2 × 106/ml) were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich). The human monocytic cell line THP-1 and HEK-293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 or DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Monocytes (1 × 106 cells) or THP-1 cells (2 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected with a GMFG siRNA, STX4 siRNA, STXBP4 siRNA, control negative siRNA, GFP vector, and/or GMFG-GFP vector using the Nucleofector Kit V and Nucleofector I Program U-01 (Lonza), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The GMFG siRNA (Silencer Select siRNA s18302), STXBP4 siRNA (Silencer Select siRNA s48386), STX4 siRNA (Silencer Select siRNA s13595), and control negative siRNA (Neg-siRNA-2) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. GFP vector and GMFG-GFP plasmid (human cDNA clone, ORF with C-terminal GFP tag) were obtained from ORIGENE. Functional experiments with siRNA-transfected cells were performed 48 h after transfection, when GMFG, STX4, or STXBP4 expression levels were reduced 75% in relevant siRNA-transfected cells compared with control negative siRNA-transfected cells. For GMFG rescue experiments, cells were first transiently transfected with a control negative siRNA or GMFG siRNA for 48 h, followed by cotransfection of GFP vector or GMFG-GFP expression plasmid and continuously cultured in complete growth medium for 24 h prior to use. Primary human monocytes (5 × 104 cells) or THP-1 cells (5 × 104 cells) in 0.5% BSA-RPMI medium were placed in the upper chamber of a Transwell culture insert (5-μm pore size; Corning Inc.) coated with or without 10 μg/ml fibronectin (FN) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) (1–100 nm; Sigma-Aldrich) or SDF-1α (stromal cell-derived factor 1α) (1–100 ng/ml; R&D Systems) was added to the lower well, and the cells were allowed to migrate for 3 h at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Migrated cells in the lower wells were quantified by placing 10-μl aliquots of the medium from the lower wells on a hemacytometer and counting four fields in duplicate. The EZ-TAXIScan chamber (Effector Cell Institute, Tokyo, Japan) was assembled as described by the manufacturer. Coverslips and chips used in the chamber were coated with 1 μg/ml FN or 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h, and then monocytes or THP-1 cells were added to the chamber and allowed to migrate. Cell migration toward fMLP (100 nm) or SDF-1α (100 ng/ml) was recorded every 15 s for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified environmental chamber. Cell migration analysis was conducted using MATLAB software as described previously (32.Liu L. Das S. Losert W. Parent C.A. mTORC2 regulates neutrophil chemotaxis in a cAMP- and RhoA-dependent fashion.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 845-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cell tracks were subsequently used to compute chemotactic index (directionality) and mean migration speed for each tracked cell at each time point in each experiment. Each image shows a representative section of the final frame in the experiment plus the locations of all cells identified and tracked in the section in all frames. Ninety-six-well flat bottom plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 10 μg/ml FN for 1 h. Wells were washed and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Monocytes or THP-1 cells (50 μl; 1 × 106 cells/ml) were seeded onto precoated plates and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then stimulated with fMLP (100 nm) or SDF-1α (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min, and unattached cells were subsequently removed by gentle washing with washing buffer (0.1% BSA/PBS) twice. Attached cells were then fixed and stained with crystal violet. The bound crystal violet was dissolved with 1% SDS and analyzed at 590 nm. Values were calculated as -fold increase over levels in unstimulated cells treated with control negative siRNA. For endogenous coimmunoprecipitation analysis, human THP-1 cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) and immunoprecipitated overnight with monoclonal GMFG antibody (LifeSpan BioSciences), monoclonal STXBP4 antibody (Thermo Scientific), or monoclonal STX4 antibody (BD Biosciences) and then subjected to Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation analysis using transient transfection, HEK-293T cells were transiently cotransfected with FLAG-tagged GMFG and GFP-tagged STXBP4, with FLAG-tagged GMFG and Myc-tagged STX4 (ORIGENE), or with expression vectors for all three proteins together (Myc-tagged STX4, GFP-tagged STXBP4, and FLAG-tagged GMFG). Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-FLAG, anti-GFP, or anti-Myc antibodies (ORIGENE). Dynabeads protein G (Life Technologies) was added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated complexes-beads were washed three times in the washing buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 2× sample buffer (46.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 1.67% SDS, 1.55% dithiothreitol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue). Proteins were then subjected to Western blotting. Primary monocytes or THP-1 cells lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Thermo Scientific), or immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies to GMFG (Abgent), β1-integrin (MAB2000) (Millipore), fMLP receptor and CXCR4 (Bioss), β-actin, ubiquitin (P4D1), or α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); α5-integrin, STXBP4, biotin, or STX6 (Cell Signaling Technology); or STX3, STX4, VAMP2, VAMP3, or VAMP4 (Proteintech Group). Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting system (GE Healthcare) was used for detection. For the detection of monocyte cell surface proteins, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then blocked in 10% FBS in PBS for 15 min. The cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml control mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) or monoclonal antibodies to total β1-integrin (both the active and inactive forms, MEM101A) (Novus Biologicals) or α5-integrin (clone NKI-SAM1) (BioLegend) or polyclonal antibodies to fMLP receptor or CXCR4 (Bioss) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen), diluted 1:500, for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were analyzed by EPICS ELITE ESP flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter), and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The internalization assay was performed as described previously (33.Cera M.R. Fabbri M. Molendini C. Corada M. Orsenigo F. Rehberg M. Reichel C.A. Krombach F. Pardi R. Dejana E. JAM-A promotes neutrophil chemotaxis by controlling integrin internalization and recycling.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Human monocytes were transfected with control negative siRNA or GMFG siRNA for 48 h. The cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with anti-β1-integrin antibody (MAB2000; Millipore) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in HBSS plus 0.5% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with ice-cold HBSS, labeled cells were incubated in prewarmed 10% FBS-RPMI medium for the indicated times at 37 °C to allow for integrin internalization. Samples were placed on ice, washed, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The amount of integrin remaining on the cell surface was determined by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence intensity of each time point was expressed as a percentage of the value present on the cell surface at time 0 in control negative siRNA-transfected monocytes. To measure recycling, labeled integrins were allowed to internalize at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by stripping of surface integrins with acid buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, glycinate buffer, pH 2.5). Cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS and then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times to induce the internal integrins to recycle to the cell surface. Cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. Recycling of β1-integrin was calculated from the signal intensity remaining in the cells at each time point relative to the control (at time 0) cells that had not been brought back to 37 °C after the first surface acid washing. For the analysis of integrin internalization by immunofluorescence, siRNA-transfected cells were seeded in 0.5% BSA-RPMI medium on FN-coated (10 μg/ml) 8-well chambers and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then processed for labeling with β1-integrin antibody and β1-integrin internalization, as indicated above, with further washing by acid buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, glycinate buffer, pH 2.5) to remove the β1-integrin antibody from the cell surface. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 and ice-cold methanol, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody at 4 °C for 30 min to visualize internalized integrin. Cells were stained with DAPI (blue) to detect nuclear DNA. For the analysis of β1-integrin recycling, after the acid wash (150 mm sodium chloride, glycinate buffer, pH 2.5), cells were reincubated at 37 °C for the indicated times to induce the internalized integrin to recycle to the cell surface. Cells were then fixed, followed by permeabilization (to visualize internalized integrins) or without permeabilization, and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody as described above. The amount of internalized integrin that had recycled back to the cell surface was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Human monocytes were transfected with control negative siRNA, GMFG siRNA, or STXBP4 siRNA for 48 h. The cells (5 × 107) were washed with ice-cold HBSS twice, and surface proteins were biotinylated on ice using 0.5 mg/ml EZ-LinkTM sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h. The free biotin was quenched with two washes of 50 mm glycine in HBSS. The cells were incubated in 10% FBS-RPMI medium for 30 min at 37 °C to allow internalization. Samples were then returned to ice and washed with ice-cold HBSS three times, and the surface biotin was reduced by incubating the cells with reducing solution (50 mm reducing glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 75 mm NaOH) for two treatments of 15 min each at 4 °C. Free glutathione was then quenched using 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in HBSS. The cells were then washed with ice-cold HBSS and returned to 37 °C in 10% FBS-RPMI medium for the indicated times to induce internalized integrins to recycle back to the cell surface. The cells were then subjected to a second round of surface reduction with reducing solution to remove the biotin from recycled integrins, followed by a second quenching with iodoacetamide. Cells were then washed and lysed in 300 μl of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Biotinylated cell surface β1-integrin remaining inside the cells was immunoprecipitated from lysates using anti-β1-integrin antibody (MAB2000) (Millipore) and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-biotin antibody or streptavidin-HRP. The plasma membrane fraction of human monocytes or THP-1 cells was isolated using the Mem-PER Plus Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Monocytes were incubated with cycloheximide (100 μm) for the indicated time period in the presence or absence of the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin (500 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) or chloroquine (10 μm; Sigma-Aldrich) or the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (10 μm; Calbiochem). After treatment, cells were subjected to Western blotting analysis using an anti-β1-integrin or α5-integrin antibody. Statistical significance for all experiments was determined by Student's paired t test analyses. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To test our hypothesis that GMFG mediates monocyte migration as well as the mechanisms underlying this process, we first set out to evaluate the effect of GMFG knockdown on the chemotactic ability of human monocytes in response to two well known chemoattractants, fMLP and SDF-1α, using Transwell migration assays. The successful knockdown of GMFG protein expression in human monocytes or THP-1 cells was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1A) (75% reduction in GMFG protein expression in GMFG siRNA-transfected cells). Consistent with previous studies in other types of cells (25.Aerbajinai W. Liu L. Chin K. Zhu J. Parent C.A. Rodgers G.P. Glia maturation factor-γ mediates neutrophil chemotaxis.J. Leukoc.

Glia maturation factor γ regulates the migration and adherence of human T lymphocytes.BMC Immunol. 2012; 13: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we observed that GMFG siRNA-transfected primary human monocytes or THP-1 cells displayed significantly reduced chemotactic migration toward the chemoattractants fMLP (1–100 nm) or SDF-1α (1–100 ng/ml) at all concentrations tested, when compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1, B and C).

Moreover, event-related potential (ERP) findings suggest an earlier onset for neural processing of facial shape compared to reflectance. In the current study, we aimed to explore specifically the roles of facial shape and color in a familiarity decision task using pre-experimentally familiar (famous) and unfamiliar faces that were caricatured either in shape-only, color-only, or both (full; shape + color) by 15%, 30%, or 45%. We recorded accuracies, mean reaction times, and face-sensitive ERPs. Performance data revealed that shape caricaturing facilitated identity processing for unfamiliar faces only. In the ERP data, such effects of shape caricaturing emerged earlier than those of color caricaturing. Unsurprisingly, ERP effects were accentuated for larger levels of caricaturing. Overall, our findings corroborate the importance of shape for identity processing of unfamiliar faces and demonstrate an earlier onset of neural processing for facial shape compared to color."
https://openalex.org/W2279003811,"Background Internal jugular vein (IJV) narrowing has been implicated in central nervous system pathologies, however normal physiological age- and gender-related IJV variance in healthy individuals (HIs) has not been adequately assessed. Objectives We assessed the relationship between IJV cross-sectional area (CSA) and aging. Materials and Methods This study involved 193 HIs (63 males and 130 females) who received 2-dimensional magnetic resonance venography at 3T. The minimum CSA of the IJVs at cervical levels C2/C3, C4, C5/C6, and C7/T1 was obtained using a semi-automated contouring-thresholding technique. Subjects were grouped by decade. Pearson and partial correlation (controlled for cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, heart disease, smoking and body mass index) and analysis of variance analyses were used, with paired t-tests comparing side differences. Results Mean right IJV CSA ranges were: in males, 41.6 mm2 (C2/C3) to 82.0 mm2 (C7/T1); in females, 38.0 mm2 (C2/C3) to 62.3 mm2 (C7/T1), while the equivalent left side ranges were: in males, 28.0 mm2 (C2/C3) to 52.2 mm2 (C7/T1); in females, 27.2 mm2 (C2/C3) to 47.8 mm2 (C7/T1). The CSA of the right IJVs was significantly larger (p<0.001) than the left at all cervical levels. Controlling for cardiovascular risk factors, the correlation between age and IJV CSA was more robust in males than in the females for all cervical levels. Conclusions In HIs age, gender, hand side and cervical location all affect IJV CSA. These findings suggest that any definition of IJV stenosis needs to account for these factors."
https://openalex.org/W2274600255,"India is endemic to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and recurrent outbreaks occur mainly in rice growing areas. Pigs are considered to be the amplifying host for JEV and infection in gestating pigs results in reproductive failure. Most studies conducted on JEV infection in Indian pigs have been serological surveys and very little is known about JEV genotypes circulating in pigs. So the potential risk posed by pigs in JEV transmission and the genetic relationship between viruses circulating in pigs, mosquitoes and humans is poorly understood.This study was conducted in pigs with a history of reproductive failure characterized by stillborn piglets with neuropathological lesions. Japanese encephalitis (JE) suspected brain specimens inoculated intracerebrally into mice and Vero cells resulted in successful isolation of JEV/SW/IVRI/395A/2014. Clinicopathological observations in infected mice, demonstration of JEV antigen in brain, and analysis of the envelope protein identified the swine isolate as being neurovirulent. Phylogenetic analysis based on prM and E gene sequences showed that it belonged to genotype III. This swine isolate was closely related to JEV associated with the 2005 outbreak in India and JaoArS982 from Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of JEV strains collected between 1956 and 2014 in India categorized the GIII viruses into different clades blurring their spatial distribution, which has been discernible in the previous century.Isolation of JEV from stillborn piglets and its close genetic relationship with viruses detected at least three decades ago in humans and mosquitoes in Japan suggests that the virus may have been circulating among Indian pigs for several decades. The close similarity between the present swine isolate and those detected in humans affected in the 2005 outbreak in Uttar Pradesh, India, suggests the need for more intensive surveillance of pigs and implementation of suitable strategies to control JE in India."
https://openalex.org/W2277956154,"Dysfunction of renal primary cilia leads to polycystic kidney disease. We previously showed that the exocyst, a protein trafficking complex, is essential for ciliogenesis and regulated by multiple Rho and Rab family GTPases, such as Cdc42. Cdc42 deficiency resulted in a disruption of renal ciliogenesis and a polycystic kidney disease phenotype in zebrafish and mice. Here we investigate the role of Dynamin binding protein (also known as Tuba), a Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, in ciliogenesis and nephrogenesis using Tuba knockdown Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and tuba knockdown in zebrafish. Tuba depletion resulted in an absence of cilia, with impaired apical polarization and inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor-induced tubulogenesis in Tuba knockdown Madin-Darby canine kidney cell cysts cultured in a collagen gel. In zebrafish, tuba was expressed in multiple ciliated organs, and, accordingly, tuba start and splice site morphants showed various ciliary mutant phenotypes in these organs. Co-injection of tuba and cdc42 morpholinos at low doses, which alone had no effect, resulted in genetic synergy and led to abnormal kidney development with highly disorganized pronephric duct cilia. Morpholinos targeting two other guanine nucleotide exchange factors not known to be in the Cdc42/ciliogenesis pathway and a scrambled control morpholino showed no phenotypic effect. Given the molecular nature of Cdc42 and Tuba, our data strongly suggest that tuba and cdc42 act in the same ciliogenesis pathway. Our study demonstrates that Tuba deficiency causes an abnormal renal ciliary and morphogenetic phenotype. Tuba most likely plays a critical role in ciliogenesis and nephrogenesis by regulating Cdc42 activity. Dysfunction of renal primary cilia leads to polycystic kidney disease.

https://openalex.org/W2286437897,"A fast, non-invasive and observer-independent method to analyze the homogeneity and maturity of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is warranted to assess the suitability of hPSC-RPE cells for implantation or in vitro use. The aim of this work was to develop and validate methods to create ensembles of state-of-the-art texture descriptors and to provide a robust classification tool to separate three different maturation stages of RPE cells by using phase contrast microscopy images. The same methods were also validated on a wide variety of biological image classification problems, such as histological or virus image classification.For image classification we used different texture descriptors, descriptor ensembles and preprocessing techniques. Also, three new methods were tested. The first approach was an ensemble of preprocessing methods, to create an additional set of images. The second was the region-based approach, where saliency detection and wavelet decomposition divide each image in two different regions, from which features were extracted through different descriptors. The third method was an ensemble of Binarized Statistical Image Features, based on different sizes and thresholds. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained for each descriptor histogram and the set of SVMs combined by sum rule. The accuracy of the computer vision tool was verified in classifying the hPSC-RPE cell maturation level.The RPE dataset contains 1862 subwindows from 195 phase contrast images. The final descriptor ensemble outperformed the most recent stand-alone texture descriptors, obtaining, for the RPE dataset, an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 86.49% with the 10-fold cross validation and 91.98% with the leave-one-image-out protocol. The generality of the three proposed approaches was ascertained with 10 more biological image datasets, obtaining an average AUC greater than 97%.Here we showed that the developed ensembles of texture descriptors are able to classify the RPE cell maturation stage. Moreover, we proved that preprocessing and region-based decomposition improves many descriptors' accuracy in biological dataset classification. Finally, we built the first public dataset of stem cell-derived RPE cells, which is publicly available to the scientific community for classification studies. The proposed tool is available at https://www.dei.unipd.it/node/2357 and the RPE dataset at http://www.biomeditech.fi/data/RPE_dataset/.

https://openalex.org/W2287355004,"The therapeutic use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) causes unwanted hematological side effects, although the underlying mechanisms of these effects are poorly understood. This study tests the hypothesis that rosiglitazone impairs the maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which ultimately leads to hematological abnormalities.Mice were fed a rosiglitazone-supplemented diet or a normal diet for 6 weeks. To induce hematopoietic stress, all mice were injected once with 250 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) intraperitoneally. Next, hematopoietic recovery, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) subsets, and myeloid differentiation after 5-Fu treatment were evaluated. The adipogenesis induced by rosiglitazone was assessed by histopathology and oil red O staining. The effect of adipocytes on HSPCs was studied with an in vitro co-culture system.Rosiglitazone significantly enhanced bone marrow adipogenesis and delayed hematopoietic recovery after 5-Fu treatment. Moreover, rosiglitazone inhibited proliferation of a granulocyte/monocyte progenitor (GMP) cell population and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) colonies, although the proliferation and mobilization of Lin-c-kit+Sca-1+ cells (LSK) was maintained following hematopoietic stress. These effects could be partially reversed by the selective PPARγ antagonist BADGE. Finally, we demonstrated in a co-culture system that differentiated adipocytes actively suppressed the myeloid differentiation of HSPCs.Taken together, our results demonstrate that rosiglitazone inhibits myeloid differentiation of HSPCs after stress partially by inducing bone marrow adipogenesis. Targeting the bone marrow microenvironment might be one mechanism by which rosiglitazone impairs stress-induced hematopoiesis."

The different roles of PB1-F2 may be linked to its structural polymorphism and to its propensity to assemble into oligomers and amyloid fibers in the vicinity of the membrane of IAV-infected cells. Here, we monitored the impact of PB1-F2 on the biochemical composition and protein structures of human epithelial pulmonary cells (A549) and monocytic cells (U937) upon IAV infection using synchrotron Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and deep UV (DUV) microscopies at the single-cell level. Cells were infected with a wild-type IAV and its PB1-F2 knock-out mutant for analyses at different times post-infection. IR spectra were recorded in each condition and processed to evaluate the change in the component band of the spectra corresponding to the amide I (secondary structure) and the CH stretching region (membrane). The IR spectra analysis revealed that expression of PB1-F2 in U937 cells, but not in A549 cells, results in the presence of a specific β-aggregate signature. Furthermore, the lipid membrane composition of U937 cells expressing PB1-F2 was also altered in a cell type-dependent manner. Using DUV microscopy and taking advantage of the high content of tryptophan residues in the sequence of PB1-F2 (5/90 aa), we showed that the increase of the autofluorescent signal recorded in monocytic cells could be correlated with the IR detection of β-aggregates.

Interestingly, other reports referred to the propensity of PB1-F2 to oligomerize and to be implicated in the extracellular activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (30.McAuley J.L. Tate M.D. MacKenzie-Kludas C.J. Pinar A. Zeng W. Stutz A. Latz E. Brown L.E. Mansell A. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by IAV virulence protein PB1-F2 contributes to severe pathophysiology and disease.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003392Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which is known to be triggered by protein amyloid aggregates (31.Gustot A. Gallea J.I. Sarroukh R. Celej M.S. Ruysschaert J.M. Raussens V. Amyloid fibrils are the molecular trigger of inflammation in Parkinson's disease.Biochem. J. 2015; 471: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the presence of amyloid fibers in different types of IAV target cells during infection remained to be validated by new techniques. In the present study, we evidenced the presence of PB1-F2 β-aggregates in IAV-infected cells using synchrotron radiation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy is a non-invasive technique for monitoring biochemical changes in situ at the single cell level (32.Jamin N. Dumas P. Moncuit J. Fridman W.H. Teillaud J.L. Carr G.L. Williams G.P. Highly resolved chemical imaging of living cells by using synchrotron infrared microspectrometry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2010; 20: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). IR microspectroscopy of cells in culture is a rapidly growing area of research allowing to spectrally distinguish cells in different physiological states, e.g. uninfected and infected (34.Hastings G. Krug P. Wang R. Guo J. Lamichhane H.P. Tang T. Hsu Y.S. Ward J. Katz D. Hilliard J.

Miller L. Naumann D. FTIR-microspectroscopy of prion-infected nervous tissue.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here, FTIR microspectroscopy appeared as a valuable method to study the formation of PB1-F2 fibers and their impact on infected cells due to its ability to detect simultaneously a variety of changes in molecular structure and composition. Moreover, FTIR spectroscopy is a sensitive tool to study protein secondary structure and protein folding, unfolding, and misfolding (36.Barth A. Infrared spectroscopy of proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1073-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar, 37.Barth A. Zscherp C. What vibrations tell us about proteins.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 369-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). FTIR approaches were developed on amyloid fibril structure (38.Hiramatsu H. Kitagawa T. FT-IR approaches on amyloid fibril structure.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1753: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) revealing structural differences between native β-sheet proteins and amyloid fibrils (39.Zandomeneghi G. Krebs M.R. McCammon M.G. Fändrich M. FTIR reveals structural differences between native beta-sheet proteins and amyloid fibrils.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 3314-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). FTIR microscopy coupled to a synchrotron source (sFTIR) allows achieving spatial resolution close to the diffraction limit. Thanks to the high signal to noise ratio and spatial resolution offered by synchrotron radiation FTIR, we optimized the signal detection of PB1-F2 fibers in infected cells without the necessity of immunostaining or purification procedures. Synchrotron deep ultraviolet (sDUV) fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool for studying biological samples and allows localizing aromatic residues such as Trp without any external probe or staining at high spatial resolution (40.Jamme F. Villette S. Giuliani A. Rouam V. Wien F. Lagarde B. Réfrégiers M. Synchrotron UV fluorescence microscopy uncovers new probes in cells and tissues.Microsc.

Cell. 2013; 105: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). So, taking advantage of the high frequency of tryptophan (Trp) in PB1-F2, we used sDUV microscopy (below 350 nm (43.Giuliani A.

DISCO: a low-energy multipurpose beamline at Synchrotron SOLEIL.J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2009; 16: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) to detect the presence of PB1-F2 aggregates. In this paper, we used objective and unsupervised methods of multivariable statistics applied to sFTIR spectroscopy and sDUV microscopy at the single cell level to detect PB1-F2 β-aggregated structures in IAV-infected cells. Multivariate statistical analyses in the amide I region of the spectra (corresponding to protein secondary structures) showed a clear and specific IR signature for the β-aggregated structure in a cell-type and time-dependent manner in IAV-infected monocytic cells. We confirmed using sDUV microscopy an increase of the autofluorescent signal in IAV-infected monocytic cells expressing PB1-F2. Moreover, we observed significant differences in the CH region of the spectra (corresponding to membrane) between infected cells expressing or not PB1-F2. Finally, the impact of PB1-F2 on membrane appeared to be cell type-dependent, because loss of membrane fluidity occurred in monocytic cells, whereas perturbation of the CH2/CH3 ratios was observed in epithelial cells. HeLa and 293T cells in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Lonza) and the human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells and the Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Lonza), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Perbio), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, were grown as monolayer. The human monocytic (U937) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Perbio), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. All cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For infection assays, all cells were seeded on zinc-selenide (ZnSe) 4-mm diameter IR transparent windows or on 25-mm diameter suprasyl coverslips inserted into 6-well plates for synchrotron FTIR and DUV microscopy, respectively. Cells were allowed to attach overnight before infection. Cells were washed with fetal calf serum-free medium and incubated with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 1 h at 37 °C. Following this, the infection mixture (fetal calf serum-free medium with excess virus) was replaced by new growth medium and the cells were maintained for 8 or 24 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Then, ZnSe windows and suprasyl coverslips were collected and infected cells were fixed in 4% formalin for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS and once with pure water to eliminate the remaining salts before analysis. Finally, the samples were left to dry in a desiccator at room temperature prior to observation. Mock cells, or “intact cells” received the same treatment as infected cells with the exception of the addition of virus in the infection mixture. Influenza A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) wild-type (WT) and the PB1-F2 knock-out (F2) viruses used in this study were produced using the 12-plasmid reverse genetic system as previously described (25.Chevalier C. Al Bazzal A. Vidic J. Février V. Bourdieu C. Bouguyon E. Le Goffic R. Vautherot J.F. Bernard J. Moudjou M. Noinville S. Chich J.F. Da Costa B. Rezaei H. Delmas B.

Chem. 2010; 285: 13233-13243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with 12 plasmids following the FuGENE protocol (Roche): eight plasmids encoding the viral RNA segments of IAV and four encoding the three subunits of the viral polymerase and the nucleoprotein. The rescued WT and F2 viruses were amplified on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and titrated by plaque assays. Generation of F2 virus was achieved using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) at nucleotides coding for the initiation codons of PB1-F2 substituting ATG to ACG (resulting in silent mutations in the PB1 open reading frame). All introduced mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Synchrotron FTIR microscopy was performed at the SOLEIL synchrotron (Gif-sur-Yvette, France) using the SMIS beamline ( Synchrotron SOLEIL). All spectra were recorded in transmission mode on a Nicolet Continuum XL microscope (Thermo Scientific). The microscope comprises a motorized sample stage and a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT-A) detector (50 μm element size). The microscope operates in confocal mode using a ×32 infinity corrected Schwarzschild objective (NA = 0.65) and a matching ×32 condenser. All IR spectra were recorded using a dual mask aperture of 10 × 10 μm2. Individual spectra were saved in log (1/R) format at 4 cm−1 spectral resolution, with 128 co-added scans encompassing the mid-IR region from 4000 to 800 cm−1. All IR spectra were pre-processed and submitted to multivariate data analysis (The Unscrambler, CAMO Process AS). Second derivatives of the spectral data were assessed (9-point Savitzky-Golay filter) to enhance the spectral resolution of the absorption bands. The second derivative IR spectra were unit vector normalized and analyzed by applying principal component analysis (PCA). The computation of principal components was based on the non-linear iterative projections by alternating least-squares (NIPALS) algorithm. Although the score plots allowed a comparison of IR spectra, the corresponding loading plots revealed the main characteristic absorption bands. The full field synchrotron DUV imaging system is constructed around a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 (Carl Zeiss) inverted microscope constructed with quartz-only optics. The white beam of DISCO beamline at Synchrotron SOLEIL (43.Giuliani A. Jamme F. Rouam V. Wien F. Giorgetta J.L. Lagarde B. Chubar O. Bac S. Yao I. Rey S. Herbeaux C. Marlats J.L. Zerbib D. Polack F.

A sharp dichroic mirror transmitting only above 300 nm (Omega Optical) reflected the incident light before focalization onto the sample through a Zeiss Ultrafluor ×40 (N.A. 0.6, glycerine immersion) (40.Jamme F.

Emission was recorded with a Pixis 1024-BUV (Princeton Instruments) camera after passing through a series of bandpass filters (Semrock). Fluorescence images where typically recorded in few seconds exposure. Power measured on the sample was close to μW/cm2. The whole system is controlled via μManager (44.Edelstein A. Amodaj N. Hoover K. Vale R. Stuurman N. Computer control of microscopes using microManager.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2010; (Chapter 14, Unit 14.20)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). To determine whetherthe expression of PB1-F2 drives the formation of amyloid aggregated structures in different IAV susceptible cell types, we infected monocytic cells (U937) and lung epithelial cells (A549) and tried to reveal the presence of such structures using sFTIR and sDUV microspectroscopy (Fig. 1). HeLa cells, which are infectable by IAV but do not allow efficient virus replication, were also integrated in the study (45.Takizawa T. Matsukawa S. Higuchi Y. Nakamura S. Nakanishi Y. Fukuda R. Induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) by influenza virus infection in tissue culture cells.J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2347-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with virus engineered by reverse genetic, influenza A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) WT, and its PB1-F2 knock-out (F2) counterpart, fixed at two times post-infection (8 and 24 h) and subjected to comparative analysis. For the relevance of the study, it was crucial to include a virus knocked-out for PB1-F2 expression to distinguish between the observations linked to the infectious context with those specific of PB1-F2 expression. In addition, we had previously confirmed that the deletion of PB1-F2 does not introduce any difference in the growth property of IAV (23.Le Goffic R. Bouguyon E. Chevalier C. Vidic J. Da Costa B.

We present a two phases study, with validation and performance monitoring, of a single experiment methodology based on multiplex PCR and high throughput sequencing that allows detection of all variants, including large rearrangements, affecting the coding regions plus three deep intronic loci.A total of 340 samples, including 257 patients and 83 previously characterized control samples, were sequenced in 17 MiSeq runs and analyzed with two bioinformatic pipelines in routine diagnostic conditions. We obtained 100% coverage for all the target regions in every tested sample.We correctly identified all the 87 known variants in the control samples and successfully confirmed the 62 variants identified among the patients without observing false positive results. Large rearrangements were identified in 18/18 control samples. Only 17 patient samples showed false positive signals (6.6%), 12 of which showed a borderline result for a single amplicon. We also demonstrated the ability of the assay to detect allele specific dropout of amplicons when a sequence variation occurs at a primer binding site thus limiting the risk for false negative results.We described here the first NGS workflow for CFTR routine analysis that demonstrated equivalent diagnostic performances compared to Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. This study illustrates the advantages of NGS in term of scalability, workload reduction and cost-effectiveness in combination with an improvement of the overall data quality due to the simultaneous detection of SNVs and large rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2408807407,"HIV-1 exhibits a characteristically high genetic diversity, with the M group, responsible for the pandemic, being classified into nine subtypes, 72 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and numerous unique recombinant forms (URFs). Here we characterize the near full-length genome sequence of an HIV-1 BG intersubtype recombinant virus (X3208) collected in Galicia (Northwest Spain) which exhibits a mosaic structure coincident with that of a previously characterized BG recombinant virus (9601_01), collected in Germany and epidemiologically linked to Portugal, and different from currently defined CRFs. Similar recombination patterns were found in partial genome sequences from three other BG recombinant viruses, one newly derived, from a virus collected in Spain, and two retrieved from databases, collected in France and Portugal, respectively. Breakpoint coincidence and clustering in phylogenetic trees of these epidemiologically-unlinked viruses allow to define a new HIV-1 CRF (CRF73_BG). CRF73_BG shares one breakpoint in the envelope with CRF14_BG, which circulates in Portugal and Spain, and groups with it in a subtype B envelope fragment, but the greatest part of its genome does not appear to derive from CRF14_BG, although both CRFs share as parental strain the subtype G variant circulating in the Iberian Peninsula. Phylogenetic clustering of partial pol and env segments from viruses collected in Portugal and Spain with X3208 and 9691_01 indicates that CRF73_BG is circulating in both countries, with proportions of around 2-3% Portuguese database HIV-1 isolates clustering with CRF73_BG. The fact that an HIV-1 recombinant virus characterized ten years ago as a URF has been shown to represent a CRF suggests that the number of HIV-1 CRFs may be much greater than currently known."
https://openalex.org/W2274326007,"RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins of the R7 subfamily (RGS6, -7, -9, and -11) are highly expressed in neurons where they regulate many physiological processes. R7 RGS proteins contain several distinct domains and form obligatory dimers with the atypical Gβ subunit, Gβ5 They also interact with other proteins such as R7-binding protein, R9-anchoring protein, and the orphan receptors GPR158 and GPR179. These interactions facilitate plasma membrane targeting and stability of R7 proteins and modulate their activity. Here, we investigated RGS7 complexes using in situ chemical cross-linking. We found that in mouse brain and transfected cells cross-linking causes formation of distinct RGS7 complexes. One of the products had the apparent molecular mass of ∼150 kDa on SDS-PAGE and did not contain Gβ5 Mass spectrometry analysis showed no other proteins to be present within the 150-kDa complex in the amount close to stoichiometric with RGS7. This finding suggested that RGS7 could form a homo-oligomer. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged RGS7 constructs, with or without chemical cross-linking, demonstrated RGS7 self-association. RGS7-RGS7 interaction required the DEP domain but not the RGS and DHEX domains or the Gβ5 subunit. Using transfected cells and knock-out mice, we demonstrated that R7-binding protein had a strong inhibitory effect on homo-oligomerization of RGS7. In contrast, our data indicated that GPR158 could bind to the RGS7 homo-oligomer without causing its dissociation. Co-expression of constitutively active Gαo prevented the RGS7-RGS7 interaction. These results reveal the existence of RGS protein homo-oligomers and show regulation of their assembly by R7 RGS-binding partners."
https://openalex.org/W2276256851,"Introduction Health insurance schemes, like Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), should provide financial protection against catastrophic health costs by reducing out of pocket expenditure (OOPE) for hospitalizations. We estimated and compared the proportion and extent of OOPE among below poverty line (BPL) families beneficiaries and not beneficiaries by RSBY during hospitalizations in district Solan, H.P., India, 2013. Methods We conducted a cross sectional survey among hospitalized BPL families in the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries groups. We compared proportion incurring OOPE and its extent during hospitalization, pre/post-hospitalization periods in different domains. Results Overall, proportion of non-beneficiaries who incurred OOPE was higher than the beneficiaries but it was not statistically significant (87.2% vs. 80.9%). The median overall OOPE was $39 (Rs 2567) in the non-beneficiaries group as compared to $ 11 (Rs 713) in the beneficiaries group (p<0.01). Median expenditure on in house and out house drugs and consumables was $ 23 (Rs 1500) in the non beneficiaries group as compared to nil in the beneficiaries group (p<0.01). Non-beneficiary status was significantly associated [OR: 2.4 (1.3–4.3)] with OOPE above median independently and also after adjusting for various covariates. Conclusion RSBY has decreased the extent of OOPE among the beneficiaries; however OOPE was incurred mainly due to purchase of drugs from outside the health facility. The treatment seeking behaviour in beneficiaries group has improved among comparatively older group with chronic conditions. RSBY has enabled beneficiaries to get more facilities such as drugs, consumables and diagnostics from the health facility."
https://openalex.org/W2288055018,"Shredded card (SC) was assessed for use as a sorbent of potentially toxic elements (PTE) carried from contaminated soil in various leachates (oxalic acid, formic acid, CaCl2, water). We further assessed SC for retention of PTE, using acidified water (pH 3.4). Vertical columns and a peristaltic pump were used to leach PTE from soils (O and A/B horizons) before passing through SC. Sorption onto SC was studied by comparing leachates, and by monitoring total PTE contents on SC before and after leaching. SC buffers against acidic soil conditions that promote metals solubility; considerable increases in solution pH (+4.49) were observed. Greatest differences in solution PTE content after leaching with/without SC occurred for Pb. In oxalic acid, As, Cd, Pb showed a high level of sorption (25, 15, and 58x more of the respective PTE in leachates without SC). In formic acid, Pb sorption was highly efficient (219x more Pb in leachate without SC). In water, only Pb showed high sorption (191x more Pb in leachate without SC). In desorption experiments, release of PTE from SC varied according to the source of PTE (organic/mineral soil), and type of solvent used. Arsenic was the PTE most readily leached in desorption experiments. Low As sorption from water was followed by fast release (70% As released from SC). A high rate of Cd sorption from organic acid solutions was followed by strong retention (~12% Cd desorption). SC also retained Pb after sorption from water, with subsequent losses of ≤8.5% of total bound Pb. The proposed use of this material is for the filtration of PTE from extract solution following soil washing.

We aim to evaluate prognostic concordance among eight gene expression signatures, on a large dataset of ER positive HER2 negative breast cancers.We analysed the performance of eight gene expression signatures on six different datasets of ER+ HER2- breast cancers. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival function. We assessed discrimination and concordance between the 8 signatures on survival and recurrence rates The Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) was used to to stratify the risk of recurrence/death.The discrimination ability of the whole signatures, showed fair discrimination performances, with AUC ranging from 0.64 (95%CI 0.55-0.73 for the 76-genes signatures, to 0.72 (95%CI 0.64-0.8) for the Molecular Prognosis Index T17. Low concordance was found in predicting events in the intermediate and high-risk group, as defined by the NPI. Low risk group was the only subgroup with a good signatures concordance.Genomic signatures may be a good option to predict prognosis as most of them perform well at the population level. They exhibit, however, a high degree of discordance in the intermediate and high-risk groups. The major benefit that we could expect from gene expression signatures is the standardization of proliferation assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2277618071,"P21 Activated Kinase 1 (Pak1), an oncogenic serine/threonine kinase, is known to have a significant role in the regulation of cytoskeleton and cellular morphology. Runx3 was initially known for its role in tumor suppressor function, but recent studies have reported the oncogenic role of Runx3 in various cancers. However, the mechanism that controls the paradoxical functions of Runx3 still remains unclear. In this study, we show that Runx3 is a physiologically interacting substrate of Pak1. We identified the site of phosphorylation in Runx3 as Threonine 209 by mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, and further confirmed the same with a site-specific antibody. Results from our functional studies showed that Threonine 209 phosphorylation in Runx3 alters its subcellular localization by protein mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequently converses its biological functions. This was further supported by in vivo tumor xenograft studies in nude mouse models which clearly demonstrated that PANC-28 cells transfected with the Runx3-T209E clone showed high tumorigenic potential as compared with other clones. Our results from clinical samples also suggest that Threonine 209 phosphorylation by Pak1 could be a potential therapeutic target and of great clinical relevance with implications for Runx3 inactivation in cancer cells where Runx3 is known to be oncogenic. The findings presented in this study provide evidence of Runx3-Threonine 209 phosphorylation as a molecular switch in dictating the tissue-specific dualistic functions of Runx3 for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2283136006,"The activation induced cytosine deaminase (AID) mediates diversification of B cell immunoglobulin genes by the three distinct yet related processes of somatic hypermutation (SHM), class switch recombination (CSR), and gene conversion (GCV). SHM occurs in germinal center B cells, and the transcription factor Bcl6 is a key regulator of the germinal center B cell gene expression program, including expression of AID. To test the hypothesis that Bcl6 function is important for the process of SHM, we compared WT chicken DT40 B cells, which constitutively perform SHM/GCV, to their Bcl6-deficient counterparts. We found that Bcl6-deficient DT40 cells were unable to perform SHM and GCV despite enforced high level expression of AID and substantial levels of AID in the nucleus of the cells. To gain mechanistic insight into the GCV/SHM dependency on Bcl6, transcriptional features of a highly expressed SHM target gene were analyzed in Bcl6-sufficient and -deficient DT40 cells. No defect was observed in the accumulation of single stranded DNA in the target gene as a result of Bcl6 deficiency. In contrast, association of Spt5, an RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and AID binding factor, was strongly reduced at the target gene body relative to the transcription start site in Bcl6-deficient cells as compared to WT cells. However, partial reconstitution of Bcl6 function substantially reconstituted Spt5 association with the target gene body but did not restore detectable SHM. Our observations suggest that in the absence of Bcl6, Spt5 fails to associate efficiently with Pol II at SHM targets, perhaps precluding robust AID action on the SHM target DNA. Our data also suggest, however, that Spt5 binding is not sufficient for SHM of a target gene even in DT40 cells with strong expression of AID."
https://openalex.org/W2287635528,"Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 uses dedicated cofactors for one-carbon unit conversion. Based on the sequence identities of enzymes and activity determinations, a methanofuran analog was proposed to be involved in formaldehyde oxidation in Alphaproteobacteria. Here, we report the structure of the cofactor, which we termed methylofuran. Using an in vitro enzyme assay and LC-MS, methylofuran was identified in cell extracts and further purified. From the exact mass and MS-MS fragmentation pattern, the structure of the cofactor was determined to consist of a polyglutamic acid side chain linked to a core structure similar to the one present in archaeal methanofuran variants. NMR analyses showed that the core structure contains a furan ring. However, instead of the tyramine moiety that is present in methanofuran cofactors, a tyrosine residue is present in methylofuran, which was further confirmed by MS through the incorporation of a 13C-labeled precursor. Methylofuran was present as a mixture of different species with varying numbers of glutamic acid residues in the side chain ranging from 12 to 24. Notably, the glutamic acid residues were not solely γ-linked, as is the case for all known methanofurans, but were identified by NMR as a mixture of α- and γ-linked amino acids.

The importance of “archaeal” cofactors for one-carbon unit conversion was later extended to aerobic bacteria with the discovery of “methanogenic” enzymes in the methylotrophic model bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. This bacterium harbors enzymes with sequence identity to those from methanogens, and the enzymes were active with the cofactors MFR and H4MPT purified from M. thermautotrophicus (7.Chistoserdova L.

Identification of structurally diverse methanofuran coenzymes in Methanococcales that are both N-formylated and N-acetylated.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6199-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These MFR variants all have a common core structure consisting of an APMF-moiety (4-[[4-(2-aminoethyl)phenoxy]-methyl]-2-furanmethanamine) linked to at least two γ-glutamic acid residues (Fig. 2A, example of MFR-a). The APMF core structure consists of a furan derivative attached to a tyramine residue. The different MFR variants show remarkable chemical variability, as different moieties, such as the hexanetetracarboxylic acid group in MFR-a or additional glutamic acid residues (MFR-b, MFR-d, MFR-e), can be attached to the side chain of the AMPF-γ-Glu2 structure. Modifications are also possible in the center of the polyglutamic acid side chain, as in the case of MFR-e, where an unusual spacer has been identified (22.Allen K.D. White R.H. Identification of structurally diverse methanofuran coenzymes in Methanococcales that are both N-formylated and N-acetylated.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6199-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In MFR-d and MFR-e, the number of glutamic acid residues is variable, ranging from 7 to12 and from 5 to 8, respectively (22.Allen K.D. White R.H.

The essential role of enzymes that depend on the putative MFR analog in M. extorquens AM1 and other methylotrophs prompted us to identify the cofactor. We structurally characterize the cofactor from the model bacterium using high resolution MS and NMR and propose the name “methylofuran” to take into account that it shows features not found in known MFR variants from methanogens so far. Formyl-MFR-a was purified from Methanothermobacter marburgensis as described (27.Shima S. Thauer R.K. Tetrahydromethanopterin-specific enzymes from Methanopyrus kandleri.Methods enzymol. 2001; 331: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and was a gift from R.K. Thauer (MPI Marburg, Germany). Custom-synthesized polyglutamic acid peptides of the sequences E10Y and (γE)20Y (crude purity) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Ulm, Germany). The (γE)20Y peptide contained γ-linkages between the glutamic acids, whereas the E10Y peptide was α-linked. 1-13C-Labeled l-tyrosine and U-13C9,15N-labeled l-tyrosine (purity 99%) were both ordered from ReseaChem (Burgdorf, Switzerland). M. extorquens AM1 was grown in minimal medium containing 123 mm (0.5% v/v) methanol as the carbon source, mineral salts (30.3 mm NH4Cl, 1.9 mm MgSO4, 21 mm (NH4)2SO4), buffer (13.8 mm K2HPO4, 6.9 mm NaH2PO4), trace elements (37.6 μm ZnSO4, 30.3 μm CoCl2, 12.2 μm MnCl2, 38.8 μm H3BO3, 4.0 μm Na2MoO4, 2.9 μm CuSO4, 191.9 μm CaCl2), and iron (322.4 μm Na2EDTA, 86.3 μm FeSO4). The pH was kept constant at 7.0 through the addition of 2 m ammonia, the temperature was set to 28 °C, and the aeration and stirring rate were set to 2 liters/min and 1500 rpm, respectively. For the initial identification of methylofuran, a first batch of M. extorquens AM1 cell material, referred to as batch A, was produced by growing the cells in a 300 liters fermenter. The final yield was 1.2 kg cww. A second batch of biomass, referred to as batch B, was prepared in a 3.6 liters bioreactor (Infors) filled with 1.4 liters of minimal medium as fed-batch culture. The methanol feed was controlled using a control sequence that added 6 ml of methanol to the medium as soon as the available methanol was used up by the cells, as detected by the rise in the dissolved oxygen level. After the culture had reached an A600 of 50–70, ∼1.3 liters of the culture was harvested by centrifugation, leaving the rest of the culture as inoculum for the next batch. The next culture was then immediately started through the addition of 1 liter of fresh medium. This procedure was repeated 14 times, yielding in total ∼340 g cdw (assuming 300 μg/ml cdw per A600 unit). Cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C until further processing. Cell material from batch A was split into 300 g cww portions. Every portion was suspended in 250 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7 and processed independently. Cells were lysed through the addition of 69 ml of 5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide solution and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7 and centrifuged again. The supernatants from both steps were combined. To remove proteins, the cell extract was incubated at 75 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the soluble fraction was ready for purification. Cell material from batch B was divided into six portions of ∼50 g cdw each. Each portion was resuspended in 2.5 ml of water and 3 ml of methanol per g cdw and processed independently. The resuspended cell material was lysed and extracted by boiling the cells in closed bottles in a water bath at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling on ice, the suspension was centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was re-extracted twice at 100 °C using the same amounts of water and methanol as before. The extracts were combined and concentrated to about half their volume in a rotary evaporator, thereby removing most of the methanol. After freeze-drying the extracts, the dried powder was dissolved in 50 ml of 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and the pH was adjusted to 8.4. After ultracentrifugation at 47,000 g for 1 h, the extracts were used for purification. For the purification of the cell extracts from batch A, an enzymatic assay was used for the identification of the fractions containing methylofuran. This assay has been previously described as an alternative assay for the determination of formyltransferase activity (14.Pomper B.K. Vorholt J.A. Characterization of the formyltransferase from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4769-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, it involves the enzymes Fhc and methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase (Mch). Methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase catalyzes the formation of formyl-H4MPT from methenyl-H4MPT, whereas Fhc catalyzes the transfer of the formyl group from formyl-H4MPT to methylofuran (Fig. 1). The generation of formyl-MFR was indirectly observed through the spontaneous reduction of cytochrome c by released H4MPT, as monitored by the increase in absorbance at 550 nm. The reaction was started by the addition of fractions containing methylofuran. Cell extracts from batch A were first purified on a Source 15Q column (16 × 100 mm, Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 10 mm acetic acid at pH 5. Elution was performed using the following gradient: 30 ml of 0 m NaCl, 10 ml of 0–0.2 M NaCl, 60 ml of 0.2 m NaCl, 150 ml of 0.2–1 m NaCl. Methylofuran was identified in the fraction eluting at 0.4 m NaCl. A second step of purification was performed using a hydroxyapatite column (16 × 100 mm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7. The following gradient was applied: 55 ml of 10–35 mm potassium phosphate, 5 ml of 35–100 mm potassium phosphate, 50 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate. Methylofuran eluted at 28 mm potassium phosphate. The sample was further purified using a 6-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences). A pH gradient with 10 mm acetic acid solution between pH 5 and 3 was applied, but methylofuran could not be eluted under these conditions. A linear gradient of 20 ml of 0–0.4 m NaCl in 10 mm acetic acid at pH 5 was, therefore, used for elution. For further purification by HPLC, desalting was required. The sample was, therefore, loaded on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and separated from salts using 30 ml of water. HPLC purification was performed on a Discovery HS F5 column (4.6 × 150 mm, Supelco) using 10 mm acetic acid, pH 3.2, as solvent A and acetonitrile for solvent B. Elution was performed at 0.7 ml/min with the following gradient: 3.5 ml of 0% B, 10.5 ml of 0–10% B, 3.5 ml of 10% B, 10.5 ml of 10–30% B. The retention time for methylofuran was 32 min. For further purification, anion exchange on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) was performed using a linear gradient of 20 ml of 0–0.8 m NaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7. Methylofuran eluted at 0.6 m NaCl. Finally, an extraction using tetrahydrofuran (THF) was performed. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 7 ml of THF and centrifuged. Methylofuran could be detected in the solid phase and was redissolved in water. For NMR measurements, the sample was again desalted using the Superdex Peptide column as described above and freeze-dried. Cell extracts from batch B were purified according to a simplified protocol involving only anion-exchange chromatography. In one run 10 ml of the cell extract (corresponding to ∼10 g cdw) of one portion were loaded on a 15-ml Mono Q column (GE Healthcare). Elution was performed using a linear gradient from 1% to 100% of 2 m ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.4 within 144 ml. The flow rate was set to 4 ml/min, and 14-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing methylofuran were identified using LC-MS at ∼1.2 m ammonium bicarbonate. They were pooled and concentrated to half their volume using a rotary evaporator, thereby also removing most of the ammonium bicarbonate. Because methylofuran eluted within a rather broad peak of other compounds and the loading capacity of the column was likely exceeded, the purified sample was run a second time through the same column. For this second purification, 2.5 ml of the sample was loaded per run, and 7-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing methylofuran were pooled and freeze-dried for NMR measurements. For the LC-MS analysis, only small amounts of methylofuran were required, and M. extorquens AM1 was cultivated in baffled flasks for this purpose. M. extorquens AM1 cells were grown in minimal medium containing mineral salts (30.3 mm NH4Cl, 0.81 mm MgSO4), buffer (13.8 mm K2HPO4, 6.9 mm NaH2PO4), trace elements (15.7 μm ZnSO4, 12.6 μm CoCl2, 5.09 MnCl2, 16.2 μm H3BO3, 1.7 μm Na2MoO4, 1.2 μm CuSO4, 20.4 μm CaCl2), iron (40.3 μm Na2EDTA, 10.8 μm FeSO4), and 123 mm (0.5% v/v) methanol as a carbon source. For growth on succinate, the buffer was replaced by 9.13 mm K2HPO4 and 11.54 mm NaH2PO4, and 30.83 mm succinate was used as a carbon source. A preculture (20 ml), inoculated from glycerol stock, was used for the inoculation of a main culture (100–200 ml) to an A600 of ∼0.05. All cultures were grown at 28 °C while shaking at 180 min−1. After the culture reached an A600 of ∼2–3, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Extraction of methylofuran was performed twice, similarly to as described above, through the addition of 1 ml of water and 1.2 ml of methanol to the cell pellet and the boiling of the suspension at 100 °C for 5 min. The extract was concentrated in a vacuum concentrator to ∼1.4 ml and filtered through a 10-kDa centrifugal filter unit (Amicon Ultra-4, Merck Millipore). The filtered extract was then purified using a 2-ml Mono Q column (GE Healthcare). A 24-ml linear gradient from 1 to 100% of 2 m ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.2 was applied for elution. The flow rate was set to 1 ml/min, and 1 ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing methylofuran were identified by LC-MS. The dried samples prepared from batch A and batch B were dissolved in 500 μl of D2O for NMR experiments performed at 298 K. For the sample from batch A, NMR spectra were recorded with an Avance DMX500 spectrometer (Bruker Biospin) operating at 500.13 MHz. A one-dimensional spectrum was acquired with 20,486 scans into 16k data points across a spectral width of 7000.2 Hz with a relaxation delay of 1.17 s, and solvent suppression was achieved using a double echo Watergate scheme (i.e. W5) (28.Liu M.

Reson. 1990; 88: 177-185Google Scholar) and TOCSY (30.Bax A. Davis D.G. MLEV-17-based two-dimensional homonuclear magnetization transfer spectroscopy.J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) spectra were acquired with 128 scans into 2000 and 512 data points (in direct and indirect dimensions, respectively) across a spectral width of 5482 Hz using a relaxation delay of 1 s. The TOCSY mixing time was set to 70 ms using a MLEV-17 scheme. Concerning the sample from batch B, NMR spectra were recorded with an Avance III HD spectrometer (Bruker Biospin) operating at 600.13 MHz and equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. A one-dimensional spectrum was acquired with 256 scans into 28,000 data points across a spectral width of 7211.5 Hz with a relaxation delay of 1 s. 1H,1H COSY-DQF and NOESY spectra were acquired into 8000 and 512 data points (in direct and indirect dimensions, respectively) across a spectral width of 7500 Hz with a relaxation delay of 1 s. The NOESY mixing time was set to 800 ms. COSY-DQF and NOESY spectra were recorded with 32 and 64 scans, respectively. The NMR data were processed using Topspin 3.2 software (Bruker Biospin). Chemical shifts were referenced with respect to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS). LC-MS measurements of samples from batch B were performed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) coupled to a nano-2D Ultra LC system (Eksigent Technologies Inc.). For chromatographic separation, ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC using a C18 column (Dr. Maisch, Reprosil-Gold 120 C18 3 μm, 0.1 × 105 mm) was applied, as described previously (31.Kiefer P. Delmotte N. Vorholt J.A. Nanoscale ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC-MS for sensitive metabolome analysis.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Solvent A was 1.7 mm tributylamine reagent in 1.5 mm acetic acid, pH-adjusted to pH 9.0 with ammonia, and solvent B was methanol. LC separation was performed at a flow rate of 400 nl min−1, applying the following gradient of B: 0 min, 3%; 30 min, 90%; 35 min, 90%; 36 min, 3%; 45 min, 3%. Before analysis, samples were diluted 1:10 with solvent A, and 1 μl was injected. Samples were measured in negative FTMS mode at a unit resolution of 60,000 (at 400 m/z), applying nano-electrospray ionization with a spray voltage of −1.9 kV. Further source settings were a capillary temperature of 150 °C, capillary voltage of −10 V, and tube lens voltage of −100 V. The analysis of MS level two (MS-MS) was carried out on a Q Exactive Plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), applying an identical LC separation. For ionization, the spray voltage was set to −2.5 kV, and a capillary temperature of 250 °C was used. Fragmentation occurred in parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode with an isolation window of 2 Da, a collision energy of 30 eV, and a resolution of 35,000. LC-MS data analysis was performed using Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the emzed framework (32.Kiefer P. Schmitt U. Vorholt J.A. Emzed: An open source framework in python for rapid and interactive development of LC/MS data analysis workflows.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: 963-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The distribution of the number of glutamic acid residues of methylofuran was calculated by filtering the LC-MS data to generate mass traces with 7 ppm tolerance for all methylofuran species with 12–24 glutamic acid residues and considering charge states with 2 ≤ z ≤ 9 and natural isotopologues with up to four [13C]carbon atoms. The mass traces were integrated (trapezoid integration) over the elution time-window and normalized to produce the distribution. The analysis was implemented using emzed (32.Kiefer P. Schmitt U. Vorholt J.A. Emzed: An open source framework in python for rapid and interactive development of LC/MS data analysis workflows.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: 963-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the incorporation of labeled tyrosine, M. extorquens AM1 cells were grown in flasks containing methanol minimal medium, as described above. For 1-13C labeling, the preculture was grown in unlabeled medium and used for the inoculation of the main culture supplemented with 0.5 mm labeled tyrosine. For U-13C9,15N labeling, the preculture and the main culture were both grown in medium containing 0.5 mm labeled tyrosine. After the 1-13C and U-13C9,15N cultures had reached an A600 of 2.3 and 3.8, respectively, they were harvested by centrifugation, extracted, and purified as described above. The fractions containing methylofuran were measured by LC-MS for the analysis of the labeling pattern.

We, therefore, used an enzymatic assay we developed earlier (14.Pomper B.K. Vorholt J.A. Characterization of the formyltransferase from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.Eur. J.

Purified active fractions were measured by 1H NMR for structural chara"
https://openalex.org/W2276764175,"Novel group quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models on the thermodynamic properties of PBXTHs were presented, by the multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis method. Four thermodynamic properties were studied: the entropy (Sθ), the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔfHθ), the standard Gibbs energy of formation (ΔfGθ), and the relative standard Gibbs energy of formation (ΔRGθ). The results by the formula indicate that the calculated and predicted data in this study are in good agreement with those in literature and the deviation is within the experimental errors. To validate the estimation reliability for internal samples and the predictive ability for other samples, leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation (CV) and external validation were performed, and the results show that the models are satisfactory."
https://openalex.org/W2275409559,"High activity levels of a transgene can be very useful, making a transgene easier to evaluate for safety and efficacy. High activity levels can also increase the economic benefit of the production of high value proteins in transgenic plants. The goal of this research is to determine if recurrent selection for activity of a transgene will result in higher activity, and if selection for activity of a transgene controlled by a native promoter will also increase protein levels of the native gene with the same promoter. To accomplish this goal we used transgenic maize containing a construct encoding green fluorescent protein controlled by the promoter for the maize endosperm-specific 27 kDa gamma zein seed storage protein. We carried out recurrent selection for fluorescence intensity in two breeding populations. After three generations of selection, both selected populations were significantly more fluorescent and had significantly higher levels of 27 kDa gamma zein than the unselected control populations. These higher levels of the 27 kDa gamma zein occurred independently of the presence of the transgene. The results show that recurrent selection can be used to increase activity of a transgene and that selection for a transgene controlled by a native promoter can increase protein levels of the native gene with the same promoter via proxy selection. Moreover, the increase in native gene protein level is maintained in the absence of the transgene, demonstrating that proxy selection can be used to produce non-transgenic plants with desired changes in gene expression."
