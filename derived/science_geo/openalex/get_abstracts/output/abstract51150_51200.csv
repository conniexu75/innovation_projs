https://openalex.org/W1586779650,"Abstract The synthesis, uptake, and efflux of some putative neurotransmitters by cultured rat glial tumor cells were studied. Three glial cell clones were capable of pyridoxal-dependent synthesis of γ-aminobutyrate both in cell-free homogenates and in intact cells in monolayers. Substantial catabolism of γ-aminobutyrate was not found. Synthesis of taurine and isethionic acid, but not β-alanine, by one of the glioma lines was also shown. Glioma lines were found to take up glutamate and exhibited Na+-dependent uptake of γ-aminobutyrate. The uptake of γ-aminobutyrate consisted of a slow saturable component (Kt ∼ 13 to 30 µm) and a rapid nonsaturable component. Both of these were antagonized by some structural analogs of γ-aminobutyrate as well as by taurine, β-alanine, bicuculline, and low temperature. Similar kinetic parameters were found for three different glioma lines. Fibroblast-like cells obtained from rat brain cell cultures had only the nonsaturable component of γ-aminobutyrate uptake. Taurine uptake also consisted of two Na+-dependent and temperature-dependent components: a rapid saturable component (Kt ∼ 10 to 17 µm) and a nonsaturable component which varied in magnitude between cell lines. These uptakes were antagonized by β-alanine but not by γ-aminobutyrate. The glioma lines also excreted the concentrated γ-aminobutyrate into the extracellular milieu, but could maintain cell to medium concentration ratios of g80-fold. In taurine efflux experiments, cell to medium concentration ratios in excess of 1500-fold could be maintained by one of the gliomas. The data are consistent with a possible role of central nervous system glial cells in the modulation of neuronal excitability via control of the levels of neuroactive substances in the extracellular milieu of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1583616681,"Abstract A novel method employing the direct reduction of cytochrome oxidase in the presence of antimycin A has provided the means to reveal the presence of cytochrome P450 in chick kidney mitochondria as characterized by the carbon monoxide difference spectrum. This mitochondrial pigment has been found to have properties distinctly different from that of the kidney microsomal cytochrome P450. The mitochondrial content of cytochrome P450 has been found to be about 0.20 nmole per mg of protein. Reconstitution studies with the solubilized cytochrome have indicated that this carbon monoxide-binding hemoprotein is involved in the activity of the renal 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-1α-hydroxylase. The reconstitution required an added flavoprotein and iron-sulfur protein, as well as NADPH and the solubilized hemoprotein. Kinetic experiments on the competitive inhibition of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-1α-hydroxylase activity of intact mitochondria by metyrapone and aminoglutethimide have shown that the inhibition constants, Ki, for the drugs are 1.6 x 10-4 m and 1.1 x 10-3 m, respectively. The spectral dissociation constants, Ks, for metyrapone and aminoglutethimide as determined from difference spectra are 1.4 x 10-4 m and 4.5 x 10-4 m, respectively. The microsomal spectral dissociation constant for metyrapone is 3.3 x 10-5 m. The similarity between the mitochondrial Ki and Ks values for metyrapone clearly indicates that the extent of the observed mitochondrial 1α-hydroxylase inhibition is a function of the amount of metyrapone bound to cytochrome P450. The kinetic data and the reconstitution studies have substantiated the role of the kidney mitochondrial cytochrome P450 as a terminal oxidase in the 1α hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol."
https://openalex.org/W2058187770,"Vasopressin and related peptides (10(-9) to 10(-6) molar) induced bursting pacemaker potential activity and altered the current-voltage relations of the membrane in a specific molluscan neurosecretory cell. These effects long outlasted the period of application of the peptides. Sensitivity of the cell to these peptides was primarily localized on the axon hillock region. The observed effects do not resemble conductance changes evoked by conventional neurotransmitters, but rather suggest a membrane regulatory role for these peptides, and thus may be indicative of a new form of information transfer in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1586161739,"Abstract A cell-free hydroxylating system which acts on long chain fatty acids has been isolated from Bacillus megaterium. When palmitic acid is used as a substrate, the major product is 14-hydroxypalmitate (about 50% of the total) while 15-hydroxypalmitate (30%) and 13-hydroxypalmitate (20%) are also produced. No 16-hydroxypalmitate is formed in this system. The effect of substrate chain length on hydroxylation activity was tested with various saturated fatty acids. The relative activity of the hydroxylase with the substrates tested was as follows: C15 (1.00), C16 (0.89), C14 (0.72), C17 (0.34), C18 (0.17), and C12 (0.08). When the distributions of isomeric hydroxy acids formed from C18 and C14 were determined, it was found that the major product from C18 was the (ω - 2) derivative with the (ω - 1) and (ω - 3) components being present in about the same ratio as for palmitate. Myristic acid, however, gave approximately equal amounts of the three isomers, with the (ω - 1) derivative being slightly favored. In neither case was the ω-hydroxy acid detected among the products. Several monounsaturated fatty acids were also tested and were found to be more active as substrates than their saturated analogs of the same chain length. The hydroxylation system is soluble and, in crude form, appears to be quite stable and active. All of the hydroxylase activity remains in the supernatant when a cell-free preparation from B. megaterium is centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 2 hours. Free palmitic acid is a much better substrate than the CoA derivative. Both NADPH and O2 are required for hydroxylase activity but no other non-protein cofactor seems to be involved. The hydroxylation activity is stable to dialysis but decreases to about 20 to 25% of the original level when the 100,000 x g supernatant is passed through Sephadex G-25, presumably due to the loss of a small protein component. The activity can be restored completely by the addition of bacterial ferredoxin to the gel-filtered preparation, but the preparation is no longer stable to freezing and thawing or further chromatographic procedures. The endogenous component for which ferredoxin substitutes is not removed by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation of the 100,000 x g supernatant protein followed by Sephadex G-200 chromatography, and a 10- to 11-fold purification of the hydroxylase was achieved in this manner. However, the hydroxylating activity of this preparation was not stimulated by added ferredoxin and further chromatographic procedures designed to remove the endogenous ferredoxin-like component always resulted in irreversible loss of activity."

https://openalex.org/W1494928814,"Abstract Partially purified cytochromes P-450 and P-448 were obtained from hepatic microsomes of rats treated with either phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene, using the ionic detergent sodium cholate and the nonionic detergent emulgen 911. The preparations contained 9 to 11 nmoles of cytochrome P-450 or P-448 per mg of protein and were free of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome b5. The total phospholipid content of the partially purified cytochrome P-450, per mg of protein, was reduced by more than 98% relative to microsomes. A partially purified NADPH-cytochrome c reductase preparation, essentially free of cytochrome b5 and phospholipid, is also described. Reconstitution of the cytochrome P-450 and reductase fractions with phospholipid resulted in restoration of enzymatic activity for the oxidative metabolism of a variety of substrates. Since the ratio of cytochrome P-450 to cytochrome b5 in this reconstituted system was greater than 200 to 1, it is suggested that cytochrome b5 is not an obligatory component of the mixed function oxidase system."

https://openalex.org/W1506019303,"Abstract The EPR-detectable (≥4.2 K) electron acceptors of the DPNH-ubiquinone reductase segment of the electron transfer system of beef heart mitochondria were studied in preparations of varying complexity. Four distinct iron-sulfur centers associated with this segment of the electron transfer system were identified. They occur in approximately equal concentrations, and this concentration approximates that of the bound flavin of DPNH dehydrogenase. Quantitative reductive titrations with DPNH and dithionite showed that the order of the oxidation-reduction potentials of the ironsulfur centers is: Center 3 ≥ 2 >> 4 g 1, indicating that there are two centers of high and two of low potential. Complex I accepts approximately 20 electron neq per mg of protein from DPNH. In rapid reaction studies using the freeze-quench method the rates of reduction of the iron-sulfur centers by DPNH could not be resolved. With acetylpyridine DPNH, however, the rates of appearance of the signals were in this sequence: Center 2 g 3 + 4 g 1."

Either NADH or NADPH could serve as a source of reducing equivalents. These results provide direct evidence for the involvement of cytochrome b5 in plasmalogen biosynthesis from the corresponding 1-O-alkyl ether and suggest a pathway analogous to the fatty acid desaturase system."

https://openalex.org/W1543803837,"Abstract The mitochondrial fraction of rat liver homogenate catalyzed the conversion of cholesterol into 5-cholestene-3β,25-diol and 5-cholestene-3β,26-diol in the presence of an NADPH-generating system and oxygen. 5-Cholestene-3β,26-diol was the predominant product. 26-Hydroxylation of cholesterol was much more efficient with the NADPH-generating system than with NADPH alone, and it was shown that the isocitrate in the generating system was responsible for most of the stimulation. Addition of Mg2+ increased both the NADPH- and the isocitrate-dependent 26-hydroxylation, and at high concentrations of Mg2+ the 26-hydroxylation in the presence of NADPH was about the same as in the presence of isocitrate. Addition of Ca2+ increased NADPH-dependent but not isocitrate-dependent 26-hydroxylation. NADH and NADH-generating systems could not replace NADPH or the NADPH-generating system. However, NADH together with Mg2+ and ATP stimulated the reaction efficiently, probably due to energy-dependent intramitochondrial transhydrogenation. Citrate and isocitrate were found to stimulate mitochondrial 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol more efficiently than other citric acid cycle intermediates regardless of whether Mg2+ was present or absent. Mitochondrial 26-hydroxylation was inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Rotenone, potassium cyanide, and dinitrophenol had little or no effect on isocitrate-dependent 26-hydroxylation. Hg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ in 0.1 mm concentration inhibited the reaction strongly. Experiments with sonically disrupted mitochondria supported the contention that the mitochondrial 26-hydroxylase was mainly bound to the inner membranes. Experiments with 18O2 and 2H2O showed that in 25- as well as 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol the oxygen incorporated is derived from molecular oxygen."

The enzyme has a similar specific activity in these organisms, as it has in Escherichia coli, Tetrahymena pyriformis, and rat liver. About five-sixths of the activity of T. foetus is in the nonsedimentable portion of the cytoplasm. The rest is connected with a subcellular organelle, the hydrogenosome, and exhibits structure-bound latency which can be abolished by freezing and thawing or with the detergent Triton X-100. The enzymes from both locations differ in their electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels. They are similar in their molecular weight (38,000) and in their sensitivity to heat or organic solvents. Neither of them is inhibited by cyanide."

https://openalex.org/W1503911776,"Abstract Addition of high levels of sodium molybdate (10-2 m, final concentration) to acid-treated purified bovine milk xanthine oxidase prior to incubation with an extract of the nitrate-induced nitrate reductase Neurospora crassa mutant nit-1 resulted in a significant enhancement of the subsequent in vitro assembly of wild type N. crassa NADPH-nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.2). Added molybdate had no effect on the wild type enzyme itself. The enhancement is highly specific for molybdenum, is independent of added phosphate, and also occurs with cell-free preparations of uninduced wild type and with other known acid-treated molybdenum enzymes including chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase, rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase, bovine sulfite oxidase, and the nitrogenases of Azotobacter and Clostridium. Preincubation at 23° of acid-treated xanthine oxidase preparations resulted in a considerable loss of ability to form nitrate reductase and in a more striking enhancement by subsequently added molybdate. Prior addition of molybdate during the above 23° preincubation prevented in part the loss of the ability of the enzyme to form nitrate reductase, suggesting that the enhancement by molybdate is a restoration effect rather than a stimulatory one. Inclusion of molybdate in the buffer used for homogenization of the uninduced wild type also gave a significant increase in the subsequent in vitro assembly of the enzyme. Various forms and derivatives of molybdenum enhanced to varying degrees the ability of acid-treated xanthine oxidase to form nitrate reductase. Aqueous solutions of several complexes of Mo(V) with cysteine or glutathione under anaerobic conditions failed to substitute for the presumed molybdenum cofactor in the in vitro assembly of nitrate reductase. Sucrose density gradient profiles of NADPH-nitrate reductase formed in vitro by incubation of induced nit-1 extract with a 99Mo-labeled fraction of uninduced wild type (grown on 99MoO4=-containing medium) coincided with that of radioactivity. The addition of 99MoO4= to a cell-free preparation of unlabeled uninduced wild type or to acid-treated xanthine oxidase prior to its incubation with an extract of induced nit-1 gave similar results. Reciprocal experiments using an unlabeled fraction of uninduced wild type and an extract of nit-1 grown and induced in the presence of 99MoO4= showed no incorporation of radioactivity in the in vitro assembled enzyme. Nor was there in vitro exchange or incorporation of 99Mo into the already formed wild type enzyme. Comparable experiments with 55Fe showed that nit-1 and not uninduced wild type or xanthine oxidase is the source of iron in the in vitro assembly of Neurospora NADPH-nitrate reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1578496857,"Abstract The multiple inhibition technique is used to show that substrate inhibition by α-ketoglutarate results from combination with central complexes and inhibition of catalysis or product release, and not from dead-end combination with E-TPN. Oxalylglycine (an analogue of α-ketoglutarate) is a good dead-end inhibitor competitive versus both α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate and noncompetitive versus TPN. These patterns, and the results of multiple inhibition studies with oxalylglycine and TPNH, show conclusively that the mechanism of TPN-isocitrate dehydrogenase must be random."

https://openalex.org/W1517477477,"Abstract Hybrid cells prepared from hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) and mouse L cells were studied to gain more information concerning glucocorticoid-induced functions. The hybrid cells contain phenotypic and chromosomal markers of both parents but fail to show HTC type responses. We now show them to respond to glucocorticoids in a manner characteristic of the L cell parent. HTC, L, and hybrid cells all contain high affinity saturable cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors. Studies of these cytoplasmic receptors in the hybrid suggest that receptors from both parents are present and capable of binding steroid inducers. In vitro studies reveal saturable high affinity binding of hybrid receptors from cytosol to homologous nuclei. Mixing experiments with various parental and hybrid cytosols and nuclei suggest that hybrid cells contain both parental cytoplasmic receptors and two classes of nuclear binding sites which can distinguish between the glucocorticoid receptors of the two parental cells. Results obtained in new hybrids derived from HTC cells and steroid-resistant L cells suggest that failure to express HTC type responses to glucocorticoids is not a result of the dominance of steroid-provoked inhibitory effects derived from the L cell parent. In this cross between a receptor (-) L cell parent and a receptor (+) HTC cell parent the hybrid, which was receptor (+), did not show glucocorticoid response."
https://openalex.org/W1583342136,"The pattern of inheritance of tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.3a), dopamine-β-hydroxylase (1.14.2.1), and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1), three enzymes in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway, has been studied in two sublines of the Balb/c inbred mouse strain, Balb/cJ and Balb/cN. All three enzymes are nearly 2-fold greater in adrenals of the Balb/cJ line. Examination of the F1, F2, and backcross progeny of the mating between these sublines reveals that single-gene loci control the steady state levels of each enzyme. The activity of all three enzymes is highly correlated in all of the hybrid generations studied. One explanation for these findings is that the loci are linked structural genes. An alternative hypothesis is that a single regulatory gene locus controls the phenotypic expression of the three enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1523914622,"Abstract CDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxy-d-glucose, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the 3,6-dideoxyhexoses in the Salmonellae and the five serotypes of Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis, is synthesized from CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose. The reaction requires two enzymes, E1 and E3, pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, and NAD(P)H. Spectroscopic studies have shown that a peak at 402 nm is formed when CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, E1, and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate are mixed together at 25°. If [methylene-3H]pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate is used in the incubation mixture, tritium is released into the solvent. Finally, utilizing gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopic techniques, it has been shown that when E1, CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate are incubated in 97% 18O-labeled water, an 18O exchange occurs at C3 and C4 of the sugar moiety of the CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose. These data indicate that E1 catalyzes the formation of a Schiff base between the 4-keto group of CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. A reversible dehydration then occurs, resulting in the expulsion of —OH from C3 and the establishment of a Schiff base-Δ-3,4-glucoseen intermediate, still enzyme-bound, which is ultimately reduced by E3 and NAD(P)H."
https://openalex.org/W1532197946,"Abstract Aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase is inducible by polycyclic hydrocarbons in an epithelial cell strain cloned from Buffalo rat liver. The hydroxylase is NADPH-dependent and carbon monoxide-sensitive. Hydroxylase induction requires both and protein synthesis, and these events can occur independently. The results suggest that the species the synthesis of which is required for induction is not ribosomal and is contained within the heterogeneous RNA fraction and that induction requires the synthesis of polyadenylic acid sequences. The hydroxylase is induced by concentrations of polycyclic hydrocarbons as low as 4 x 10-10 m. Fetal calf serum contains a substance(s) which increases hydroxylase activity. Polycyclic hydrocarbons can also induce the hydroxylase in the absence of serum added to the medium. This cell system may be useful for the study of the molecular biology of hydroxylase induction, for the bioassay of compounds for activity as hydroxylase inducers, and for the study of the role of the hydroxylase in chemical carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1519277290,"Abstract Tungsten or vanadium in a nutrient medium containing nitrate, but not ammonia, as the sole nitrogen source inhibited the formation of assimilatory NADPH-nitrate reductase (but not nitrate-inducible NADPH-cytochrome c reductase) and growth of wild type Neurospora crassa. Inhibition was prevented by high levels of molybdate in the nutrient medium but was not reversed by adding molybdate to subsequently prepared cell-free enzyme preparations. Neither tungsten nor vanadium was inhibitory when added to partially purified wild type Neurospora NADPH-nitrate reductase. Cell-free preparations of uninduced wild type grown in increasing concentrations of tungsten or vanadium showed progressive inhibition of ability to assemble nitrate reductase in vitro (with extracts of nitrate-induced Neurospora mutant nit-1) which was partially or entirely restored by subsequent addition of molybdate to the extracts of the tunsgten- or vanadium-grown uninduced wild type. Tungsten or vanadium added to acid-treated bovine milk xanthine oxidase or to extracts of uninduced wild type also inhibited in vitro enzyme assembly, with added molybdate partially preventing inhibition. The tungsten or vanadium analogue of nitrate reductase formed in vivo or by in vitro assembly is considerably more labile than its molybdenum counterpart as indicated by the complete loss of 185W or 48V from the enzyme as a result of trichloroacetic acid precipitation or heat treatment. Sucrose density gradient profiles of the Neurospora NADPH-nitrate reductase formed in vitro with 185W- or 48V-grown uninduced wild type or induced nit-1 showed, as in the case of 99Mo, that uninduced wild type and not nit-1 can be the source of tungsten or vanadium in the in vitro assembly of the enzyme. Exogenous 185W added to cell-free extracts of uninduced wild type or acid treated bovine milk xanthine oxidase prior to in vitro assembly of nitrate reductase using nit-1 failed to appear in the subsequently formed enzyme, whereas 48V experienced a small but consistent incorporation only with acid-treated xanthine oxidase. There was no in vitro exchange or incorporation of 185W or 48V into the already formed wild type enzyme. The data implicate tungsten and vanadium as competitive inhibitors of molybdenum in nitrate reductase structure and function."

Modification of the procedure published previously and additional purification steps led to a preparation of this enzyme from Escherichia coli that is homogeneous as judged by sedimentation pattern and gel filtration and is at least 95 % pure as judged by gel electrophoresis. Several properties of the enzyme were studied. The molecular weight was found to be 1.1 x 105, the Michaelis constant obtained for dihydrodipicolinic acid is 9.0 x 10-6, and the pH optimum for the reaction is 7.0 with either DPNH or TPNH. The enzyme was shown to be free of flavin by spectral and enzymatic assays. This finding was in accord with the finding that tritium, from TPNH labeled in position 4, was found exclusively in the product, not having exchanged with water during the course of the reaction. The enzyme is specific for the A form of TPNH. The reaction is essentially irreversible. Dipicolinic acid and isophthalic acid were shown to be inhibitors of the reaction and were competitive with the substrate. The results indicate that the substrate is in a ring form when binding to the active site of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1502316966,"Reports in the literature indicate that during the exponential phase of growth of Candida utilis NADH oxidation is insensitive to rotenone, that rotenone sensitivity is acquired during the transition to the late stationary phase and is again lost on catabolite repression. The acquisition and loss of rotenone sensitivity appears to be accompanied by similar changes in Site 1 phosphorylation but does not appear to be reflected in the rate of oxidation of NADH (by mitochondria) or of NAD-linked substrates (by mitochondria or whole cells). In the present paper evidence is presented that these fluctuations in sensitivity to inhibitors of NADH oxidation reflect the presence of different types of inner membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenases in different phases of growth. Thus inner membrane preparations from exponential phase cells contain an NADH dehydrogenase which reacts equally well with ferricyanide and juglone as electron acceptor, appears to be very labile, and lacks EPR signals corresponding to iron-sulfur Centers 1 and 2, whereas a new species, probably an iron-sulfur protein, with resonances at g|| = 2.01, and g⊥ = 1.92 in the reduced state, is present. This species is not significantly reduced by NADH. In corresponding preparations from late stationary phase cells NADH-ferricyanide activity is high, juglone reductase activity is low, and the enzyme is stable and exhibits the EPR signals of iron-sulfur Centers 1 and 2, whereas the EPR signals of iron-sulfur Centers 3 + 4 change very little on transition from exponential to stationary phase cells. There is also a decrease in cytochrome concentration. Most prominent among these is a b-type cytochrome (g = 2.54; 2.23; 1.87) which decreases 2- to 3-fold. The EPR detectable species with g|| = 2.01 and g⊥ = 1.92 in the reduced state is no longer detected. On catabolite repression of late stationary phase cells there is an 80 to 90% decline in NADH-ferricyanide activity, of iron-sulfur Centers 1 and 2, a 50 to 60% decrease of Centers 3 + 4, and an increase in a b cytochrome, but the specific activity in NADH-juglone reductase and NADH oxidase assays increases, the enzyme becomes once again labile, and the EPR detectable species with g|| = 2.01 and g⊥ = 1.92 appears on reduction with dithionite. All these changes are prevented by cycloheximide. The data suggest that sensitivity to piericidin A and coupling to energy conservation Site 1 are properties of the type of NADH dehydrogenase present in late stationary phase cells but not in exponential phase or of catabolite-repressed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1518575349,"Abstract Enzyme E3, one of the two enzymes required to promote the formation of CDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxyglucose from CDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, is thought to catalyze the NADPH requiring reduction in which the 3-deoxy group is actually formed from the intermediate discussed in the preceding paper. One mole of NAD(P)H was oxidized for every mole of sugar reduced when the reaction was carried out in an argon atmosphere. Experiments with both A- and B-[4-3H]NADPH have shown that there is no direct hydride transfer from NADPH to either the sugar being reduced or to pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, a participant in the reaction. On the other hand, using tritiated water 1 atom of hydrogen is incorporated into the CDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxyglucose formed. E3 alone also catalyzes the oxidation of NAD(P)H although there is no chromophoric group such as a flavin associated with the enzyme. However, added FMN or 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol greatly enhances the rate of NAD(P)H oxidation by E3."
https://openalex.org/W1542395354,"Abstract Electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) and NADH dehydrogenase, containing a novel orange flavin, have been highly purified from the strict anaerobe Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. Both enzymes couple the oxidation of NADH to the reduction of dyes but only ETF couples the oxidation of NADH to the reduction of butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (ETF activity). Disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea, immunological studies, and amino acid analyses have provided strong evidence that the apoproteins of ETF and NADH dehydrogenase are very similar or identical. The two enzyme preparations differ structurally in the proportions of their flavin chromophores, FAD and two novel modified flavins, 6-hydroxy-7,8-dimethyl-10-(ribityl-5'-ADP)-isoalloxazine and 7-methyl-8-hydroxy-10-(ribityl-5'-ADP)-isoalloxazine (8-OH-FAD). Preparations with ETF activity contain FAD as the predominant prosthetic group and low amounts of the two modified flavins. NADH dehydrogenase preparations contain all three flavins, about 50% FAD and 50% modified flavins; there is a high proportion of 8-OH-FAD which has an intense absorption band at 475 nm and imparts an orange color to the protein. Differences in catalytic activity, absorption spectrum, electrophoretic mobility, and isoelectric point of ETF and NADH dehydrogenase are most likely due to different proportions of the three flavins."

https://openalex.org/W1541377118,"Abstract Heme spin-labeled oxyferrohemoglobin was prepared by the recombination of mono-spin-labeled protoheme with human apohemoglobin and subsequent reduction with a ferredoxin reductase system. The spin-labeled oxyhemoglobin exhibited optical and oxygen-binding properties indistinguishable from those of native hemoglobin. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the spin label attached to the heme-moiety showed that the labels were moderately immobilized in the protein. Upon deoxygenation, the resonance amplitude was decreased to less than 50% of the original amplitude and there were small changes in the EPR line shape. Comparison between the optical and EPR measurements during the deoxygenation process clearly showed that the EPR changes are not proportional to the optical changes. This result is contrary to the model of oxygen binding to hemoglobin provided by the induced fit theory. Since the EPR change has no isosbestic point, it was concluded that the microscopic conformation in the vicinity of the heme can take more than two states during the oxygenation process. It was also shown that the EPR line shape of the heme spin-labeled oxyhemoglobin is different from that of the met form. This result suggests a conformational difference between these two hemoglobins in the dissolved state."

Similar titrations show two binding sites for TPNH on a 1:1 complex of enzyme with methotrexate, two sites for TPN+ on both enzyme and a 1:1 enzyme-methotrexate complex, and at least one DPNH binding site on the enzyme-methotrexate complex. Equilibrium ultrafiltration measurements confirm the presence of two TPN+ binding sites on both enzyme and 1:1 enzyme-methotrexate and demonstrate the presence of two DPNH binding sites on 1:1 enzyme-methotrexate. Titrations and comparison of 2:1 with 1:1 pyridine nucleotide-enzyme difference spectra reveal that most of the absorbance changes associated with binding occur upon binding at the higher affinity site. Dissociation constants for TPN+ and DPNH were calculated from these titrations: E·(TPN+)2, 80 ± 40 µm and 5 ± 3 µm; E·MTX·(TPN+)2, 1.7 ± 0.9 µm and 0.06 ± 0.03 µm; E·MTX·(DPNH)2, 100 ± 50 µm and 9 ± 5 µm. Absorbance changes at 280 and 290 nm suggest the involvement of at least 1 tryptophan residue in the binding of TPNH, and possibly TPN+, at the higher affinity site. Absorbance changes upon binding of DPNH, TPNH, and TPN+ to the enzyme-methotrexate complex indicate that all three cofactors are bound identically. The binding of pyridine nucleotides to the enzyme-methotrexate complex changes the absorption bands of methotrexate toward an even more acidic spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2026225117,"Cardiac arrhythmias produced by electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral cardiac sympathetic nerve in dogs were not blocked by the combined administration of propranolol and practolol in amounts that completely blocked cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. Blockade of cardiac alpha-adrenergic receptors, as well as cardiac cholinergic receptors, also had no influence on the arrhythmias. These results suggest that the adrenergic neuroeffector junction is fundamentally different from any hitherto described, differing perhaps in the neurotransmitter involved or in the nature of the receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1545854723,"Abstract Calcium-activated guinea pig liver transglutaminase catalyzes the hydrolysis and aminolysis of γ-glutamyl methyl and ethyl ester analogs of a specific amide substrate, benzyloxycarbonyl(Z)-l-glutaminylglycine. Kinetic comparisons of amine incorporation into the γ-n-methylamide, and the γ-methyl and ethyl esters of Z-l-glutamylglycine indicate that the same aycl-enzyme intermediate is formed from each of these substrates. The differences in catalytic efficiency toward these substrates are due to differences in rates of formation of this intermediate, and may be a consequence of different orientations of the leaving groups (—OR and —NHR) at the catalytic site of the enzyme. An aliphatic ester, methyl acetate, and its amide analog, N-methylacetamide, are about equally effective, although poor, substrates for transglutaminase. This, together with the fact that the acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed from the γ-methyl ester of Z-l-glutamylglycine and from its γ-N-methylamide at approximately the same rate, is strong evidence that C—O and C—N bonds are about equally susceptible to cleavage by transglutaminase. The ability of an alcohol to function as an acyl acceptor in a transglutaminase-catalyzed amide transfer reaction and the reversibility of the ester to amide conversion has been demonstrated with the use of a fluorescent-labeled alcohol derivative, N-(5 - dimethylaminonaphthalenesulfonyl) - 5 - amino - 1 - pentanol."
https://openalex.org/W134525563,"Abstract Chicken liver acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase is a polymeric filamentous structure of 4 to 10 million daltons and is composed of linearly aggregated protomers. The protomeric form can be dissociated with sodium dodecyl sulfate and resolved into polypeptide chains of three weight classes (117,000, 129,000, and 139,000 daltons) by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in urea-dodecyl sulfate at pH 7.2. The molar stoichiometry based upon relative staining intensity is approximately 2:1:1 for the 117,000-, 129,000-, and 139,000- dalton subunits, respectively, and is consistent with a tetrameric structure of the protomer. Covalently bound biotinyl prosthetic group is associated with only one of the 117,000 molecular weight subunits. The protomeric form of the carboxylase was cross-linked using the bifunctional reagent, dimethylsuberimidate. Analysis of the cross-linked mixture of polypeptide chains using a low resolution dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis system yielded a maximum of four protein bands all of which contain biotin. The molecular weights of these four cross-linked species correspond to those of a monomer (117,000), dimer (234,000), trimer (350,000), and tetramer (470,000). By varying the concentration of dimethylsuberimidate and time of reaction, the distribution of cross-linked polypeptides can be shifted either toward the monomeric or the tetrameric species. These results and the biotin content of the enzyme (1.0 mole per 488,000 g of protein) show the protomeric form to be a tetramer having a molecular weight of 470,000 to 500,000."

Partially purified UDP-galacturonate 4-epimerase from this organism has the following characteristics: Km for UDP-glucuronate, 37 µm; pH optimum, 8.5; equilibrium constant (in the direction of UDP-galacturonate formation), 2.6; approximate molecular weight, 54,000. DPN, TPN, and UDP-glucose are inhibitors competitive with substrate. UMP- and UDP-xylose are allosteric inhibitors with Hill constants of 1.6 and 2.1. These data suggest homotropic cooperativity in the binding of at least 2 inhibitor molecules to the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1533747991,"Abstract Acute uremia induced both soluble and mitochondrial tyrosine aminotransferase activity, EC 2.6.1.5, in rat liver. Such induction was demonstrated to be independent of glucocorticoid action. Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.1, although identical with mitochondrial tyrosine aminotransferase, was not elevated during acute uremia. Purified antibody specific against cytosol tyrosine aminotransferase cross-reacted significantly with the mitochondrial enzyme from uremic rats, suggesting that the elevation of activity was due to translocation of the induced cytosol enzyme form to the mitochondria. Considerable translocation was also caused by a combination of fasting together with some factor known to increase urea synthesis in the liver, such as high nitrogen loads or intraperitoneal injection of hydrocortisone. Intravenous injection of rats with Triton WR-1339 resulted in the separation of lysosomes from mitochondria during sucrose density gradient centrifugation. All of the tyrosine aminotransferase activity was associated with the mitochondria and not with the lysosomes. Treatment of intact mitochondria with the antisoluble tyrosine aminotransferase antibody resulted in inhibition of about 50% of the total inhibitable mitochondrial activity, suggesting that some of the translocated cytosol enzyme may not be exposed and thus may be unavailable for antibody cross-reaction. In vitro crossover experiments using induced cytosol tyrosine aminotransferase with normal mitochondria resulted in an elevation of the mitochondrial activity, whereas incubation of noninduced cytosol enzyme with mitochondria from induced rats did not. Consequently, the translocation phenomenon is a function of altered cytosol tyrosine aminotransferase rather than altered mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1545977684,"Abstract Evidence based upon measurements of (a) the rates of radioactive CO2 production from specifically labeled [14C]glucose, and (b) the intracellular concentrations of key intermediates of the hexose monophosphate shunt indicates that the rate of glucose oxidation by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is only 40% higher in an Escherichia coli mutant having 10-fold the normal amount of enzyme. These results not only provide evidence for regulation of the first step of the shunt but, more importantly, indicate the limits under which a regulatory mechanism must operate. A comparison of the kinetic constants of partially purified glucose-6-P dehydrogenase with the measured intracellular levels of metabolites indicates that glucose-6-P and NADP+ are saturating and that the rate of the enzyme in the mutant cannot be explained by substrate or coenzyme limitations. Furthermore, the concentration of NADPH in the mutant is not sufficient for the 90% inhibition required to reduce the activity of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase down to a level only 40% higher than that of the wild type strain. A limited survey of possible inhibitors was unsuccessful, and it is concluded that an unknown metabolite must be involved in regulation of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase or that the regulatory properties of the enzyme are altered upon removal from the cell and purification. A comparison of the in vivo and in vitro rates of gluconate-6-P dehydrogenase suggests that this enzyme is also not operating at its maximal velocity in the cell and is regulated. The activity of the third shunt enzyme likewise does not appear to be limited by the availability of substrate or coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1891149001,"Abstract The characteristics of the inhibition of the respiratory chain-linked NADH dehydrogenase of Candida utilis by piericidin A and the binding of this inhibitor have been studied in inner membrane preparations with the aid of [14C]piericidin A. As in beef heart preparations, the binding of piericidin by the particles is linear and extends considerably beyond the range of maximal inhibition of NADH oxidation, suggesting the existence of unspecific binding sites. Washing of the particles with bovine serum albumin, following inhibition with piericidin, or titrating with piericidin in the presence of bovine serum albumin, however, does not distinguish the specific binding sites involved in the inhibition from unspecific ones, as in the case of beef heart preparations, because bovine serum albumin dissociates the inhibitor from all sites and causes virtually complete release of the inhibition. The apparently lower affinity for piericidin binding of sites concerned with inhibition of NADH oxidation prevented accurate determination of their number per mole of NADH dehydrogenase. However, from the amount of piericidin required for maximal inhibition of NADH oxidase and from Hill plots, it is clear that more than one binding site is involved in complete inhibition and available evidence suggests that there may be two sites, as in animal tissues. Spectrophotometric studies of the oxidation-reduction cycle of NADH dehydrogenase in C. utilis gave results comparable to those reported for beef heart preparations. These showed, in accord with the effect of piericidin on the reaction of the enzyme with various electron acceptors, that this inhibitor blocks electron flux in Candida between iron-sulfur Center 2 of the enzyme (Site 1 of energy conservation) and the coenzyme Q pool, as in animal tissues."
