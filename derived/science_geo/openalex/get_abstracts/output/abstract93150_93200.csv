https://openalex.org/W2088330494,"A survey of electrophoretic variation in 20 enzymes from 109 clones of escherichia coli from natural populations yielded an estimate of mean genetic diversity approximately twice that reported in an earlier study and four to five times larger than estimates fro most eukaryotic species. Despite this extensive variability, the number of distinctive genotypes apparently is rather limited. Identical clones were obtained from unassociated hosts, and a clone that is electrophoretically indistinguishable from the laboratory strain Escherichia coli K-12 was isolated from a human infant. The results suggest that rates of genetic recombination in natural populations of Escherichia coli are low. These findings have implications for our understanding of the genetic structure of Escherichia coli populations and the factors determining the amount of neutral gene variability in this bacterial species."

https://openalex.org/W1485388309,"The biosynthesis of the HLA-A and -B antigens was studied in the B lymphoblastoid cell line BRI 8 and the Burkitt lymphoma line DAudi. The heavy chains of the HLA-A and -B antigens were inserted asymmetrically into the rough endoplasmic reticulum of BRI 8 cells as transmembrane polypeptides. During the first 5 min after synthesis, the majority of the heavy chains became associated with beta 2-microglobulin. At this stage, the heavy chains carried a high mannose (core) oligosaccharide. Subsequent processing of the oligosaccharide unit occurred during the next 20 to 25 min, resulting in the conversion of the oligosaccharide from the high mannose to the complex form. About 30 to 40 min after synthesis, the mature antigens were expressed at the cell surface. Glycosylation was not required for asymmetric insertion, intracellular transport, or surface expression of the HLA-A and -B antigens. However, studies with Daudi cells indicated that combination with beta 2-microglobulin was necessary for subsequent processing and intracellular transport of the heavy chains after their synthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1499162012,"Exposure of cultured lymphocytes of the IM-9 line to insulin results in a rapid, time-dependent reduction in the number of insulin receptors to a new steady state concentration. Both the rate of loss and the net loss of receptors were directly related to the ambient insulin concentration. The insulin-induced loss of receptors was mediated by binding of insulin to the receptor itself; insulins, which varied 200-fold in biopotency, produced receptor loss in direct proportion to the ability of each insulin to occupy the receptor. The residual insulin receptors were normal following insulin-mediated receptor loss by a variety of sensitive binding criteria. While insulin binding to its receptors was a necessary condition to induce receptor loss, it was not sufficient. Thus, reduction in the temperature of the preincubation from 37 degrees C to 20 degrees C (which enhanced the total amount of insulin bound to the receptor) abolished the loss of insulin receptors. Likewise, cycloheximide prevented the insulin-induced loss of receptors. Furthermore, turkey erythrocytes, which lack active macromolecular synthesis, had no change in the concentration of insulin receptors when exposed to insulin for similar periods. Interestingly, the turkey erythrocytes, when exposed to insulin or to proinsulin, showed a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the affinity of the insulin receptor over a restricted part of the insulin-binding isotherm, which was reversed over a period of several hours following removal of hormone. The insulin-mediated decrease in receptor number on IM-9 lymphocytes was reversible. Following removal of insulin from the growth medium, about one-half of the receptors were restored within 10 h and the full complement of insulin receptors was restored within 24 h. Cycloheximide prevented restoration of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2046869089,"Many eukaryotic genes contain intevening sequences, segments of DNA that interrupt the continuity of the gene. They are removed from RNA transcripts of the gene by a process known as splicing. The intervening sequence in a yeast tyrosine transfer RNA (tRNA Tyr) suppressor gene was deleted in order to test its role in the expression of the gene. The altered gene and its parent were introduced into yeast by transformation. Both genes exhibited suppressor function, showing that the intervening sequence is not absolutely essential for the expression of this gene."

The morphological features of this neurofilament, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining, and the partial characterization of the antibody are described. The detection of this hetero-specific autoantibody is the first evidence of an immune reaction in the spongiform encephalopathies."
https://openalex.org/W1984090080,"Abstract We have studied transcription of the rec A gene of E. coli as a probe for regulatory events involved in the coupled control of DNA repair, mutagenesis, cell division, and prophage induction (SOS funtions). RecA mRNA production is greatly stimulated by two agents that block normal chromosomal DNA replication, ultraviolet light and nalidixic acid. This specific RNA induction is blocked by rec A and dominant lex A mutations that confer ultraviolet sensitivity on the cell. A constitutive high level of RecA mRNA production results from mutations believed to inactive lex A or from the unique rec A mutation tif 1. These results suggest that the LexA protein is a negative regulator of the rec A gene at the level of RNA synthesis, whereas RecA is a positive (auto-regulatory) protein. The earliest (signal) events leading to rec A gene induction appear to involve different pathways for the two types of replication blocks studied. Mutations affecting the RecBC protein block induction of RecA mRNA by nalidixic acid, but not ultraviolet light. In contrast, a loss of RecF function markedly decreases induction by ultraviolet light, but not nalidixic acid. Thus the signal system for SOS repair seems to have alternative pathways to provide a general response to a variety of DNA-damaging agents."
https://openalex.org/W1488790344,"The sigma subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was released from a transcribing polymerase-poly[d(A-T)]-poly[d(A-T)]-RNA complex when the nascent RNA reached a length of either eight or nine nucleotides. The dissociated sigma was separated from other reaction components by gel filtration, and was assayed using an activity assay previously described (Hansen, U. M., and McClure, W. R. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5713-5717). The extent of RNA synthesis was limited by incorporation of 3‘-dATP into the RNA chains; a series of distributions of product lengths was achieved by varying the concentration of 3‘-dATP. A correlation of the number of moles of dissociated sigma versus the number of moles of RNA products of varying lengths allowed the determination of the point of release of the sigma subunit. Models to explain the cause of sigma release are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2094813509,"Abstract In vitro, termination of transcription at the attenuator site of the E. coli tryptophan ( rp ) operon occurs efficiently in the absence of additional factors. In contrast, an altered attenuator site created by the deletion trp Δ LC1419 (which removes four of the eight consecutive TA base pairs at the termination site, but still functions partially in vivo) does not cause termination in vitro under standard conditions, even with the addition of rho factor. By varying components and conditions of the transcription reactions, we have found conditions under which termination does occur at the altered site ( trp a1419 ), as well as conditions affecting termination on the wild-type template. —RNA polymerase can terminate at trp a1419 when the analog iodo-CTP (which forms stronger base pairs with G) replaces CTP. —A mutant polymerase (rpo203) that restores termination in strains carrying rho mutations can also terminate at trp a1419, at a position just past the deletion junction, suggesting that the point of termination may be specified by the remaining upstream leader sequence. —Analogs such as Br-UTP and allylamine-UTP, which form stronger base pairs with A, elevate readthrough levels at the wild-type attenuator site. —At low temperatures, readthrough on the wild-type template by wild-type RNA polymerase is enhanced, whereas the rpo203 enzyme still terminates efficiently. The results of these experiments suggest a model for termination of transcription in the absence of rho factor involving both RNA-RNA and RNA-DNA interactions. We propose that the response of RNA polymerase at a terminator site is governed by a balance between the formation or stability of a hairpin structure in the transcript and the strength of polymerase-stabilized base pairing between the distal nucleotides of the transcript and the DNA template. In more complex cases in vitro, or within the cell, formation or stabilization of these structures may also involve other regions of RNA and additional factors."
https://openalex.org/W1516369506,"The nonspecific DNA binding capacity of repressor protein has been assessed by boundary sedimentation of repressor and calf thymus DNA fragmented by shearing and by nitrocellulose ultrafiltration employing labeled lambdaplac DNA in the presence of inducer concentrations sufficient to insure dissociation of repressor from the operator region of the DNA. These methods gave values in good agreement with values previously reported in the literature. The association constants for the interaction of repressor with operator DNA fragments and lambdaplac DNA have been measured and found to differ by approximately 100-fold at low salt concentrations, but the difference decreases to 4-fold at salt concentrations near the physiological value. The equilibrium association constant for the repressor-operator DNA fragment is significantly less sensitive to salt concentration than the corresponding constant for lambdaplac DNA. Inducer decreases the salt concentration dependence of repressor-operator DNA fragment only slightly. Measurement of the association constants for the interaction of the trypsin-resistant core protein with operator DNA fragment and lambdaplac DNA indicate that the core protein binds to the two DNA's with the same affinity. This result contrasts with the differential affinity of intact repressor for these two DNA's. In addition, the core protein association constants for operator DNA fragment and lambdaplac DNA display minimal dependence on the salt concentration. These results suggest a role for nonionic interactions in the binding of core protein to operator DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1580589502,"The steric course of the methyl group transfer catalyzed by catechol O-methyltransferase was studied using S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) carrying a methyl group made chiral by labeling with 1H, 2H, and 3H in an asymmetrical arrangement. Incubation of the two diastereomers of this substrate with catechol O-methyl-transferase purified from rat liver and epinephrine or protocatechuic acid as acceptor gave the corresponding methylated catechols. These were degraded to convert the methoxy group in a series of stereochemically unambiguous reactions into the methyl group of acetate, which was then analyzed for its configuration. The results indicate that the transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to either acceptor occurs in an inversion mode. The catechol O-methyltransferase reaction thus involves a direct transfer of the methyl group from the sulfur of AdoMet to the oxygen of the catechol in an SN2 process, without a methylated enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1662801204,"Antisera were raised against native RNA polymerases A or B, as well as against each individual subunit of RNA polymerase A from the yeast Saccharmoyces cerevisiae. The affinity spectrum of antibodies was evaluated by reacting electrophoretically separated enzyme subunits, transferred to a membrane, with 125I-labeled immunoglobulins. Alternatively, the subunit . immunoglobulin complex was revealed by 125I-labeled Protein A. Antibodies directed against native RNA polymerase A recognized the majority of the polypeptides forming the enzyme. When challenged with RNA polymerases B or C, this antibody preparation demonstrated the presence of polypeptides common to the three enzymes. A small cross-reaction was also found at the level of the large subunits of Enzyme B as well as some additional polypeptides of Enzyme C. Similar experiments with antibodies directed against native RNA polymerase B confirmed the presence of common subunits and also showed that the large polypeptides of the three enzymes share a few immunological determinants. Common subunits are AC40, ABC27, ABC23, AC19, and ABC14.5. Immunologically related sites were conserved in the large subunits of RNA polymerase A from remote yeast species. Similarly, yeast and wheat germ RNA polymerase B share immunological determinants on the large subunit as well as on a small peptide. On the other hand, there was no significant cross-reaction between yeast and mammalian Enzyme B or Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. Antibodies raised against the different polypeptide components of RNA polymerase A reacted specifically with the corresponding subunits. Inhibition studies with these subunit-specific antibodies showed that the common subunits are not always similarly exposed to antibody attack within the three enzymes. The data are discussed in terms of the structural similarity, organization and evolution of eukaryotic RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W2041097973,"Yeast strains harboring indepjendent mutations within the SUP4 tyrosine tRNA gene have been selected by virtue of their inactivating effect upon the SUP4-o UAA suppressor. Three fourths of the mutations at SUP4 are point alterations; the rest resemble the deletions described by Rothstein (1979). A meiotic genetic fine structure map of the locus was made by crossing 69 of the mutants in all combinations and testing for the frequency of SUP4-o recombinants. The sequences of SUP4 genes cloned from 32 mutant strains were determined by the dideoxynucleotide terminator method, using as primer a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to a sequence adjoining the SUP4 3' terminus. The positions of the DNA sequence alterations showed good colinearity with the positions of the mutations on the genetic map. One of the 26 mutant sites found by DNA sequencing lies within the intervening sequence. At this site three repeat mutations were found, each changing AT leads to TA. Whereas mutations were generally rather uniformly distributed throughout the tRNATyr coding sequence, none occurred in the DNA sequences flanking the mature tRNATyr sequence or in a 12 nucleotide sequence including the 10 bp which constitute the 3' side of the intervening sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1543579457,"The characteristics of inducer binding to lactose repressor protein in the presence of a small (29 base pair) operator DNA fragment have been examined. The presence of operator DNA fragments decreases the affinity of the protein for inducer molecules. The maximum change observed is a 20-fold increase in the concentration of inducer necessary for half-saturation of the protein. The non-linearity of the Scatchard type plots and slopes of the Hill plots of the binding data indicate that inducer binding exhibits cooperative behavior in the presence of operator DNA fragments, while free repressor binds inducer in a noncooperative fashion. The experimental data for the binding of inducer to repressor both in the presence and absence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments were compared to curves predicted by several different models. Using the limits placed by the measured values for repressor-operator DNA-inducer interaction, it was possible to discriminate between the various models. The models which accurately predicted the inducer binding curves and conformed to the measured values for the other parameters were Monod-Wyman-Changeux and Koshland type models with the following features: 1) positive cooperativity in the binding of inducer to the repressor . operator DNA complex; 2) two sites for the binding of the operator DNA fragment to repressor protein; 3) effect of binding of each operator DNA fragment on all four subunits of the repressor. These models are consistent with all of the available data, and they indicate that the binding of the first two inducer molecules accounts for greater than or equal to 60% of the difference in affinities between free and induced repressor for operator DNA; in vivo this difference should be sufficient for induction to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1568700182,"Incubation of the pyrimidine [3'-3H]UDP with ribonucleotide reductase resulted in an isotope effect on the conversion to dUDP which varied as a function of pH and allosteric effectors (pH, kH/kT, effector): 6.6, 4.7, ATP; 7.6, 3.3, ATP; 7.6, 2.6, dATP; 7.6, 2.0, TTP; 8.4, 2.8, ATP. During this reaction 3H2O was also released. The lower the pH of the reaction, the larger the isotope effect, and the smaller the amount of 3H2O produced. At 50% conversion of UDP to dUDP and at pH 7.6, approximately 0.5% of total 3H present in solution was volatilized, while at pH 8.4, approximately 0.9% was volatilized. Similar experiments in which the purine [3'-3H]ADP was incubated with ribonucleotide reductase also resulted in an isotope effect on its conversion to dATP which varied as a function of pH (pH, kH/kT with dGTP as an effector); 6.6, 1.9; 7.6, 1.7; 8.6, 1.4. Furthermore, 3H2O was also released as a function of the extent of the reaction. At 50% turnover and pH 7.6, approximately 0.6% of 3H2O was volatilized, while at pH 8.6 approximately 1.25% was released. Two control experiments in which either the B1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase was inactivated with 2'-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-diphosphate or the B2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase was inactivated with 2'-azido-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-diphosphate and then the enzyme incubated with [3'-3H]ADP or [3'-3H]UDP indicated that in neither case was 3H released. Both B1 and B2 subunits are required for cleavage of the 3'-C--H bond. Incubation of [3'-3H]dADP or [3'-3H]dUDP with ribonucleotide reductase produced no measurable release of 3H. These data clearly indicate that conversion of a purine or pyrimidine diphosphate to a deoxynucleotide diphosphate by Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase requires cleavage of the 3'-C--H bond of the substrate. The fate of the 3'-H of the substrate was also determined. Incubation of [3'-2H]UDP with ribonucleotide reductase resulted in the production of [3'-2H]dUDP."
https://openalex.org/W1989342660,"Tumor cell membrane glycoproteins may be involved in the induction of tumor immunity or in the escape of tumors from immunologic defense mechanisms. Forty-four benign and malignant breast lesions were examined for the presence of a carbohydrate precursor antigen (T antigen) of the human blood group system MN. T antigen was demonstrated by means of an immunohistochemical technique to detect tissue binding of peanut agglutinin, a plant lectin, with affinity for T antigen. Malignant breast lesions showed a pattern of T antigen expression different from that of benign breast tissues. A possible role for T antigen in the modulation of the immune response to breast carcinoma is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2117867004,"We have reported the identification of a metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2) in the liver, 6-keto-PGE1, a substance having similar potency to PGI2 in its vascular and antiaggregative actions but differing in its greater stability. Either PGI2 or its inactive hydrolysis product, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, can be enzymically transformed via the 9-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase pathway to 6-keto-PGE1. In this study, we demonstrated 9-OH prostaglandin dehydrogenase activity in the cytoplasmic fraction of human platelets by measuring the release of 3H from positin 9 using [9-3H]PGI2 and [9-3H]6-keto-PGF1 alpha as substrates. The enzyme was further purified by DEAE-cellulose, followed by Sephadex G-200, and finally by isoelectric focusing. The enzyme was found to have a pH optimum of 8.5 to 9.0 and an isoelectric point of 5.0. The molecular weight was estimated to be 60,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Enzymic activity was time- and concentration-dependent and required NAD+ as a cofactor. The activity of the purified enzyme was further confirmed by using a more stable form of PGI2, the methyl ester. Incubation of [11-3H]PGI2 methyl ester with the purified enzyme resulted in formation of [11-3H]6-keto-PGE1 methyl ester, which also inhibited platelet aggregation. Thus, 9-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in platelets could be a major enzymic pathway for the transformation of PGI2, and perhaps 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, to 6-keto-PGE1. The possibility that the effects of prostacyclin on platelet aggregation are related to conversion to the biologically active metabolite, 6-keto-PGE1, should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1551972426,"Abstract We have evaluated the interrelationships between insulin binding, action, and degradation in primary cultures of isolated rat hepatocytes. In this cell system, over 99% of insulin degradation is cell-mediated. Whereas the Km value of insulin degradation in disrupted cells is approximately 10(-7) M, the Km value of insulin degradation in intact cells increases with increasing concentrations of insulin and parallels the Kd value of total insulin binding at all insulin concentrations. The dose-response relationship for insulin action differs from that of insulin degradation and specific insulin binding. However, when the portion of specific insulin binding which is degraded insulin is subtracted, the dose-response relationship for the remaining specific-intact insulin bound correlates with that of insulin action. These data indicate that the interpretation of relationships between insulin action, binding, and degradation depends on the biological system and the fraction of insulin binding utilized for analysis. In addition, our data derived in primary cultures of hepatocytes suggest that high affinity insulin binding sites may mediate insulin action, that insulin binding is rate-limiting for insulin degradation, and that all insulin binding sites, including nonspecific sites, may mediate insulin degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1597914021,"A cell-free protein synthesizing system from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been optimized for the translation of both homologous yeast mRNA and for a number of heterologous eukaryotic mRNAs. A significant increase in protein synthesis was observed when K(OAc) rather than KCl was used as the source of K+ in the in vitro translation system. This was due primarily to an inhibitory effect oif Cl-. The polyamine putrescine hydrochloride stimulated protein synthesis only at low Mg2+ concentrations. Protein synthesis directed by both yeast mRNA and several eukaryotic mRNAs examined in the system was sensitive to the mRNA 5'-cap analogue, 7-methylguanosine 5'-monophosphate. One-dimensional and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis of polypeptides synthesized in response to yeast polysomal RNA demonstrated faithful translation in vitro. Translational control and post-translational modifications appear to operate normally in vitro. RNA from several eukaryotic viruses (brome mosaic virus, turnip yellow mosaic virus, and tobacco mosaic virus) were found to be faithfully translated in vitro yielding discrete polypeptides. Reticulocyte polysomal RNA directed the synthesis of a single protein that co-migrated with rabbit globin. The prokaryotic RNAs of Q beta and MS2 were translated with a very low efficiency. The yeast cell-free system programmed with yeast polysomal RNA provides an excellent model for the study of translational control in a eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W1493134139,"125I-insulin dissociated from rat hepatocytes and liver plasma membranes with a time course suggestive of more than a single kinetic process. Dissociation curves were resolved into rapidly and slowly dissociating components. Increasing times of hormone-cell or hormone-membrane incubation prior to the initiation of dissociation increased the proportion of slowly dissociable 125I-insulin and decreased the proportion of rapidly dissociating hormone. The rates of loss of rapidly and slowly dissociating 125I-insulin, 1 to 2 x 10(-3) and 2 to 7 x 10(-5) s-1, respectively, were the same in cell and membrane incubates. The capacity of liver membranes and hepatocytes to bind 125I-insulin in a slowly dissociable state was saturable with respect to insulin concentration (approximately 10(-8) M). The observation of the same physical process in both cells and plasma membranes demonstrates a distinct role for receptors at the exterior surface of target cells in the retention of insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1603629357,"The maltose transport system of Escherichia coli contains at least five components, three of which, i.e. the products of lamB, malE, and malF genes, have so far been identified as constituents of the outer membrane, periplasmic space, and cytoplasmic membrane, respectively. We identified another component, a cytoplasmic membrane protein of an apparent molecular weight of 43,000, as the product of the malK gene on the basis of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of various mutants and suppressed strains and by the incorporation of extra tyrosine residue into this proten in malK amber mutants containing the suppressor Su3+ allele. The transport of maltose thus appears to require at least two proteins associated with the cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1574570946,"After in vitro incubation with radiolabeled amino acids, extracts of various chicken tissues were screened for newly synthesized proteins reactive with antibody to plasma apolipoprotein B (apo B). An immunologically related protein was found in kidney as well as liver and intestine. This kidney protein showed the same mobility upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as plasma apo B or pulse-labeled apo B made by liver or intestine. Partial proteolysis mapping with porcine elastase or V8 protease revealed nearly identical partial cleavage maps of pulse-labeled apo B from kidney, intestine, and liver. These data show that the kidney is a site of apo B synthesis and suggest that the kidney may be a significant source of plasma lipoproteins. Apo B synthesis was also detected in the distal small intestine and colon as well as in the proximal small intestine. The relative rate of apo B synthesis was 5% of total protein synthesis in the duodenum and decreased progressively to about 1% of protein synthesis in the colon. The synthesis of apo B in the distal small intestine and colon may indicate a similar capacity for dietary fat absorption via lipoprotein particles in all intestinal regions. The large intestine may be an additional source of plasma lipoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1495513932,"Subunit flux into porcine brain microtubules at steady state has been studied using both radioactive guanine nucleotide and a radioactive tubulin dimer, [3H]ethyltubulin, which is obtained by a reductive ethylation (Zeeberg, B., Cheek, J., and Caplow, M., (1980) Anal. Biochem. 104, 321--327). We have also determined the molecular rate constants for steady state dimer loss from and addition to the microtubule. This is the first study where the rate for flux of radioactive subunits at steady state has been correlated with the measured molecular rate constants. Also, we derive a theoretical analysis of the observed flux of subunits into a polymer at steady state in pulse and chase experiments; this is used to relate the flux and molecular rate constant to a steady state model. Analysis of our results shows that, at steady state, there is only a small difference in the number of assembly and disassembly events at a given microtubule end (as compared with the total number of events at both ends) in a unit of time; predominant opposite end assembly-disassembly (Margolis, R. L., and Wilson, L. (1978) Cell 13, 1--8) is, therefore, ruled out. The almost complete absence of opposite end assembly-disassembly in the steady state provides a means for very efficient regulation of the microtubule network in vivo, since a small modulation in the relative magnitudes of the molecular rate constants can increase the subunit flux dramatically."

https://openalex.org/W1524236325,"Yeast pyruvate kinase is irreversibly inactivated by 1.1 mM 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine at pH 8.6 with an initial rate constant of 0.019 min-1. A plot of kinact versus the 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine concentration yields a hyperbolic curve indicative of binding of the analog prior to reaction. Marked protection is afforded by phosphoenolpyruvate + fructose 1,6-diphosphate + Mg2+ or MgATP suggesting that reaction occurs within the active site. When assayed at less than saturating phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations, the inactivation caused by the reagent in the absence of added ligands appears slower, and reaction in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and Mg2+ produces an activation of the enzyme, the extent of which is dependent on the assay concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate. The rate constant for activation was observed to be 0.113 min-1. The activated enzyme exhibits both a lowered K0.5 and Hill coefficient compared to native pyruvate kinase. Subsequent addition of 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine to activated pyruvate kinase in the absence of added ligands leads to inactivation with the rate constant independent of the assay concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate. Covalent reaction of pyruvate kinase with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine thus occurs at two distinct sites. In the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and Mg2+, incorporation of tritiated 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine is linearly proportional to the extent of activation of the enzyme, with 4 mol of reagent bound/mol of tetrameric pyruvate kinase for maximally activated enzyme. In the absence of added ligands, approximately 4.5 mol of reagent are incorporated/mol of enzyme at 15 min of reaction, while 80% of the original activity remains. Subsequent incorporation is proportional to the extent of inactivation with 8 mol bound at 100% in activaton. In the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphospate, and Mg2+, 3 tyrosines and 1 lysine residue, and in the absence of ligands, 6 tyrosines and 2 lysine residues are modified, suggesting that both amino acids are within the two nucleotide sites."

https://openalex.org/W1549229867,"Abstract A protein isolated from sciatic nerves of adult chickens promotes the morphological maturation and of embryonic avian skeletal muscle cells in the absence of innervation and is required for normal myogenesis in vitro. This trophic protein, sciatin, has been purified by ion exchange column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Sciatin migrated as a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 84,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfategel electrophoresis. The native molecular weight of sciatin as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation was 86,400. Amino acid analysis revealed that sciatin is relatively deficient in tryptophan, histidine, glycine, and arginine, but enriched in cysteine, methionine, alanine, and lysine. Carbohydrate determination showed that sciatin in composed of 11% sugar by weight with no detectable N-acetylneuraminic acid residues. Sedimentation velocity centrifugation studies revealed an S20,w0 of 5.11 with a frictional coefficient of 1.31. Sciatin had no detectable protease or acetylcholinesterase activity. The results of the present study provide new biochemical information on a macromolecule with biological activities similar to those expressed by the maintenance group of growth factors which includes such proteins as nerve growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1665576483,"Binding of 125I-insulin to cells cultured from the skin of nondiabetic and diabetic (db/db) mice was 80 to 90% specific, time- and temperature-dependent, and maximal at pH 8.0. Porcine insulin and desalanine insulin competed equally for 125I-insulin binding, while proinsulin and desoctapeptide insulin were 35% and 20% as potent, respectively. 125I-Insulin dissociated from both types of fibroblasts with a T 1/2 of 7.5 min. Analysis of the dissociation data resolved two rate constants of 3.0 and 1.0 X 10(-4) s-1 for nondiabetic, and 2.0 and 0.8 X 10(-4) s-1 for diabetic fibroblasts. Binding of 125I-insulin to diabetic fibroblasts was 35 to 50% of that to nondiabetic fibroblasts during at least 17 passages. Scatchard analysis of the binding data resolved high (K1 = 2 X 10(10( M-1) and low affinity K2 = 2 X 10(9) M-1) sites. Nondiabetic fibroblasts possessed 7.7 X 10(4) sites/cell, while diabetic fibroblasts possessed 2.9 X 10(4)/cell. Incubation of nondiabetic fibroblasts with insulin resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in the binding of 125I-insulin. Binding activity returned to normal when insulin was removed and it was prevented by cycloheximide. In contrast, diabetic fibroblasts did not exhibit down-regulation of receptors. A half-maximal and maximum (85%) stimulation of 2 deoxy-D-glucose uptake was observed with 0.75 nM and 16.7 nM insulin in nondiabetic fibroblasts. In contrast, diabetic cultures required 3.5 nM insulin for half-maximal stimulation of 2 deoxy-D-glucose uptake, and maximum stimulation was 32% with 16.7 nM insulin. Similarly, diabetic fibroblasts required higher concentrations of insulin (20 nM) to stimulate ornithine decarboxylase activity to 42% of nondiabetic cells. These results indicate that in comparison with fibroblastic cultures from nondiabetic animals, those from diabetic animals expressed differences in insulin receptor numbers which are maintained in culture over many generations and are accompanied by diminished insulin responses."
https://openalex.org/W1498806721,The rates of binding of inducer molecules to the lactose repressor protein are significantly affected by the presence of bound operator DNA fragments. The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction. The exact point at which dissociation occurs at a complex function of the concentrations of operator and inducer and the relationship between the rates for sugar binding and for operator fragment dissociation which are comparable for some of the protein species.
https://openalex.org/W128133591,"A new approach for assessing of catalytic cooperativity may occur between subunits has been applied to succinyl-CoA synthetase. This is based on the extent of oxygen exchange between medium [18O]Pi and succinate per molecule of ATP cleaved during steady state succinyl-CoA synthesis. Suitable traps are used to remove succinyl-CoA and ADP as soon as they are released to the medium. With the Escherichia coli enzyme, which has an alpha 2 beta 2 structure, a pronounced increase in oxygen exchange per ATP cleaved occurs as ATP concentration is lowered. In contrast, when the CoA concentration is varied, the oxygen exchange per molecule of product formed remains constant. Also, with the pig heart enzyme, which is shown to retain its alpha beta structure during catalysis and thus has only one catalytic site, no modulation of oxygen exchange by ATP concentration is observed. These experimental findings show that the binding of an ATP either promotes the dissociation of bound succinyl-CoA or decreases its participation in exchange. Measurement of the distribution of [18O]Pi species found as exchange occurs shows that only one catalytic sequence is involved in exchange at various ATP concentrations. These observations along with other controls and results eliminate most other explanations of the ATP modulation of the exchange and suggest that binding of ATP at one catalytic site promotes catalytic site promotes catalytic events at an alternate catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W2249845331,"The tRNA-modifying enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine: tRNA (uridine-5)-methyltransferase, has been purified essentially to homogeneity from an Escherichia coli strain containing an elevated level of this enzyme. A rapid, efficient method has been developed for the purification, consisting of polyethyleneimine precipitation to remove nucleic acids, followed by phosphocellulose and Blue Sepharose affinity chromatography. The enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 42,000. It has a pH optimum of 8.4, a Km of 12.5 microM for S-adenyosyl-L-methionine, and a Km of 1.1 microM for wheat germ tRNAGly1. The ability of the enzyme to methylate a variety of tRNA substrates including prokaryotic, eukaryotic, mitochondrial, and chloroplastic tRNAs has been characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1544701879,"The transport of trace (a concentration much less than Km for transport) 2-deoxyglucose (deoxyglucose) and 3-O-methylglucose (methylglucose) into rat adipocytes was measured using 1- to 2-s pulses at 37 degrees C in the absence of glucose and in the presence of glucose with and without pre-exposure to glucose. Pre-exposure of insulin-stimulated adipocytes to 10 mM glucose for 30 min resulted in an acceleration of trace deoxyglucose transport above that seen in the absence of glucose. In contrast, when glucose was added together with deoxyglucose, an inhibition of transport was observed. There was no effect up to 5-min pre-exposure to 10 mM glucose, but acceleration appeared thereafter and reached a steady state by 30 min, i.e. a 3-fold higher transport rate than that seen when deoxyglucose and glucose were added together. Glucose (3.5 mM) appears to be a threshold concentration for this effect. A smaller effect was seen in the absence of insulin (1.5-fold) using 10 mM glucose and in the presence of insulin using 10 mM mannose (2.7-fold). No effect was seen using 10 mM galactose, fructose, pyruvate-lactate, deoxyglucose, and methylglucose. There was no effect of glucose pre-exposure on insulin-stimulated methylglucose transport. We propose that entry occurs across two independent barriers in series separated by an aqueous pore, that transport across the second barrier is more rate limiting for deoxyglucose than for methylglucose, and than metabolites of glucose decrease the resistance of the second barrier to deoxyglucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1550013254,"A DNA-binding protein was isolated from Escherichia coli using a procedure designed for selective enrichment of regulatory proteins. In this procedure, a multicopy bacterial plasmid carrying a purE operon was used to sequester and mobilize the putative regulatory protein for pur genes. Purification of the protein from a plasmid-enriched lysate was obtained by precipitation with polyethylene glycol, elution from the precipitate with high salt and fractionation by phosphocellulose, and AMP affinity chromatography. Analysis of DNA binding by nitrocellulose filter assays showed that binding of the protein required the presence of pur genes and was either ATP dependent for some genes (purE, purA) or GTP dependent for others (purF, purI). Plasmid DNA carrying the guaAB operon did not bind the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1479890676,"Open complexes of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase core enzyme with a poly[d(A-T)]-poly[d(A-T)]template have been characterized and compared with the previously characterized holoenzyme open complexes on the same template (Hansen, U. M., and McClure, W. R. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5713-5717). The open complexes were monitored by the abortive initiation synthesis of the dinucleotide pApU, which is catalyzed by both enzymes. The major differences between the two complexes were: 1) the Michaelis constant for UTP was 60 times higher for core enzyme than for holoenzyme, 2) the intrinsic binding constant of core enzyme to the DNA was 3 orders of magnitude less than that of holoenzyme, and 3) cooperative binding of 2 core units was required for activity. Thus, the presence of the sigma subunit significantly altered the nature and extent of open complex formation. The rate of formation of the open complexes, however, was rapid for both enzymes. Rifampicin is shown to have a slight stimulatory effect on the extent of open complex formation of the core enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1525924964,"Transient kinetic studies were carried out to elucidate the catalytic cycle of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase at ph 8.3, 10 degrees C, and to evaluate the rate constants for the individual steps. Using a rapid mixing cell, we were able to detect the burst phase of the reaction, which could not be obtained at alkaline ph values with conventional mixing devices. Analysis of the burst phase revealed that the equilibrium of the initial binding of the substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, to the enzyme is attained rapidly, and that the production of the alcohol, 4-methylumbelliferone, is fast. Analysis of the steady state phase of the reaction yielded a phosphate release rate constant which agrees very well with the kcat determined by initial rate studies. Dephosphorylation of the phosphoryl enzyme prepared at pH 5.7 was studied by the pH-jump technique, using a three-syringe stopped flow apparatus. The results showed that the dephosphorylation step is not rate-limiting in the catalytic cycle and that the presence of substrates or inhibitor has no effect on this step. The lack of effect of substrates on the rate of dephosphorylation and on the rate of phosphate dissociation indicates that the flip-flop mechanism, in which the product release is supposedly facilitated by the binding of a 2nd molecule of substrate, is not valid for alkaline phosphatase. Kinetic constants for various steps in the catalytic cycle of alkaline phosphatase at pH 8.3, 10 degrees C, are reported and a reaction scheme which is in harmony with previous observations from other laboratories is described."
https://openalex.org/W1526618009,"31P NMR measurements have been found to be a convenient means for simultaneously measuring the concentrations of several species in the equilibrium mixtures of the reactions catalyzed by arginine kinase and creatine kinase. MgATP + X in equilibrium MgADP + XP where X = arginine or creatine and XP = P-arginine or P-creatine. The free energy of phosphorylaton of various metabolites by adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) at pH 8.0 and 30 degrees C is more exergonic than the corresponding phosphorylations by ATP by about 2.5 kcal/mol, resulting in a displacement of the equilibrium toward the nucleoside diphosphates by a factor of approximately 60. Since this factor does not depend on the nature of the metabolite, the equilibrium constants of thionucleotide reactions may be used to determined the equilibrium constants of corresponding oxynucleotide reactions which lie too far toward ATP. The equilibrium constants of the oxynucleotide reactions catalyzed by pyruvate kinase and 3-P-glycerate kinase calculated by this method from the experimentally determined equilibrium constants of the corresponding thionucleotide reactions are 3.1 x 10(-4) and 2.9 x 10(-4), respectively, under the experimental conditions used. The equilibrium constants and degree of stereoselectivity of the arginine kinase reaction are altered when Ca2+ replaces Mg2+ as the activating metal ion."
https://openalex.org/W1552228137,"Two homologous strains of Escherichia coli, one of which completely lacked the cell envelope Braun's lipoprotein, were compared with respect to their peptidoglycan synthesis and assembly. Both strains were auxotrophic for diaminopimelic acid and their uptake of radiolabeled diaminopimelic acid was comparable. Analysis of subcellular fractions obtained after mechanical disruption of the cells in a French pressure cell and sedimentation of the cell envelopes showed the existence of a soluble, chromatographically immobile macromolecular peptidoglycan. This labeled peptidoglycan contained a reduced degree of peptide side chain cross-linkages (19 mol % of labeled residues as compared to that present in the insoluble cell sacculus, 27 mol %). In addition, approximately 20% of its peptide side chains terminated in pentapeptide structures versus 1 to 4% in the sacculus. Furthermore, the soluble peptidoglycan of the parent strain also contained covalently bound lipoprotein (4.6%). Extraction of the cell envelope fraction with detergents afforded an additional amount of soluble peptidoglycan. This material was quite similar, in its degree of cross-linkage and amount of covalently bound lipoprotein, to the peptidoglycan present in the detergent-insoluble sacculus. These results indicate that peptidoglycan strands which are, in part, covalently linked to lipoprotein are late stage synthesis intermediates which subsequently become covalently attached to the preexisting sacculus."
https://openalex.org/W1552297252,"Adenosine deaminase (adenosine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.4)-deficient patients recently were found to have abnormally high levels of dATP, a negative allosteric effector of ribonucleotide reductase (ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase, 2'-deoxyribonucleoside-diphosphate:oxidized thioredoxin 2'-oxidoreductase, EC 1.17.4.1). Therefore it was proposed that the immunodeficiency associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency is mediated through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and hence DNA replication. HeLa cells, treated with an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, erythro-9(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, and deoxyadenosine to mimic the adenosine deaminase-deficient state, were monitored to determine directly the effects on ribonucleotide reductase activity and levels. A low concentration of erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, which did not inhibit cell growth, nevertheless retarded the cells in G2 + M phase of the cell cycle and increased reductase activity. Reductase activity was also elevated in cells treated with a low level of deoxyadenosine which did not affect the cell cycle or cell growth. However, ribonucleotide reductase activity was reduced to one-half of the control value in cells treated with either enough deoxyadenosine to inhibit cell growth or with a combination of erythro-9(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine and deoxyadenosine, each at concentrations which individually do not inhibit cell growth. Removal of deoxynucleotides, particularly dATP, from these extracts increased ribonucleotide reductase activity to several-fold higher than control values. The reduced activity of ribonucleotide reductase in the simulated adenosine deaminase-deficient HeLa cells provides direct evidence for the thesis that adenosine deaminase deficiency disease is mediated through elevated levels of dATP which inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. In addition, the cell cycle patterns and ribonucleotide reductase levels suggest that the regulatory substance(s) that controls the level of ribonucleotide reductase is not operative until the late S or G2 phase of the cell cycle."

The beta major and beta minor genomic sequences selectively labaeled in the nonhomologous part of the large intervening sequence 2 were hybridized to the nuclear RNA of Friend cells. The nuclear RNA of Me2SO-treated cells contained both beta major and beta minor nuclear transcripts, whereas hemin-treated cells contained only the beta minor transcripts. The beta minor nuclear transcripts were more abundant in the Me2SO-treated cells than in hemin-treated cells. Nuclear transcripts with the size of partially processed beta major globin mRNA precursors were also detected in the Me2SO-treated cells."

https://openalex.org/W1653386228,"MRB is a major R222 plasmid-encoded outer membrane protein previously described by this laboratory which is immunologically identical with F plasmid traTp. We have detected an apparent precursor polypeptide of MRB in Escherichia coli minicells which reacts with specific anti-MRB serum. In the presence of proteolytic inhibitors, immunologically reactive precursor MRB polypeptides are found in whole cells and minicells containing R222 or F plasmids. When R222-containing minicells were incubated for short periods of time with [35S]methionine, the precursor was predominantly labeled but was shown to be converted into MRB during subsequent incubation in media containing nonradioactive methionine. This conversion was inhibited in the presence of the proteolytic inhibitor tosyllysylalanyl chloramethyl ketone. These studies show that at least one plasmid-encoded membrane protein is processed in its E. coli host in a way resembling that of host cell membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W106530913,"Estrogen and progesterone markedly stimulate transcription of ovalbumin and conalbumin (transferrin) genes in chick oviduct as measured by hybridization of labeled RNA synthesized in isolated nuclei to immobilized plasmid DNA containing these gene sequences. Using this direct assay for specific gene transcription, we explored the basis of previous reports indicating that steroid hormones also cause changes in oviduct chromatin structure that can be detected by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. We observed no effect of these hormones on the ability of E. coli RNA polymerase to transcribe specifically the conalbumin and ovalbumin genes 8 1/2 h after hormone administration when transcription of these genes by endogenous RNA polymerase was elevated 5- and 30-fold, respectively. Furthermore, we were unable to detect any significant effect of either of these hormones on the total number of E. coli RNA polymerase binding sites in oviduct nuclei or chromatin. In contrast, after several days of hormone administration, we detected an apparent preferential ovalbumin RNA synthesis by E. coli RNA polymerase and this effect could be transferred to unstimulated nuclei by a 0.35 M salt extract of active nuclei. However, further experiments revealed that this preferential ovalbumin RNA synthesis is an artifact produced by transcription from contaminating ovalbumin mRNA. We conclude that E. coli RNA polymerase does not recognize steroid hormone-induced changes in oviduct chromatin."
