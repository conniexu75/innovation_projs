https://openalex.org/W2085039090,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of colon and other cancers; emerging evidence indicates that oncogenic β-catenin regulates several biological processes essential for cancer initiation and progression. To decipher the role of β-catenin in transformation, we classified β-catenin activity in 85 cancer cell lines in which we performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens and found that β-catenin active cancers are dependent on a signaling pathway involving the transcriptional regulator YAP1. Specifically, we found that YAP1 and the transcription factor TBX5 form a complex with β-catenin. Phosphorylation of YAP1 by the tyrosine kinase YES1 leads to localization of this complex to the promoters of antiapoptotic genes, including BCL2L1 and BIRC5. A small-molecule inhibitor of YES1 impeded the proliferation of β-catenin-dependent cancers in both cell lines and animal models. These observations define a β-catenin-YAP1-TBX5 complex essential to the transformation and survival of β-catenin-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2168487117,"Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are a new class of engineered nucleases that are easier to design to cleave at desired sites in a genome than previous types of nucleases. We report here the use of TALENs to rapidly and efficiently generate mutant alleles of 15 genes in cultured somatic cells or human pluripotent stem cells, the latter for which we differentiated both the targeted lines and isogenic control lines into various metabolic cell types. We demonstrate cell-autonomous phenotypes directly linked to disease-dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypoglycemia, lipodystrophy, motor-neuron death, and hepatitis C infection. We found little evidence of TALEN off-target effects, but each clonal line nevertheless harbors a significant number of unique mutations. Given the speed and ease with which we were able to derive and characterize these cell lines, we anticipate TALEN-mediated genome editing of human cells becoming a mainstay for the investigation of human biology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2042635844,"Wnt growth factors are fundamental regulators of cell fate, but how the Wnt signal is translated into biological responses is incompletely understood. Here, we report that TAZ, a biologically potent transcriptional coactivator, serves as a downstream element of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade. This function of TAZ is independent from its well-established role as mediator of Hippo signaling. In the absence of Wnt activity, the components of the β-catenin destruction complex--APC, Axin, and GSK3--are also required to keep TAZ at low levels. TAZ degradation depends on phosphorylated β-catenin that bridges TAZ to its ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP. Upon Wnt signaling, escape of β-catenin from the destruction complex impairs TAZ degradation and leads to concomitant accumulation of β-catenin and TAZ. At the genome-wide level, a substantial portion of Wnt transcriptional responses is mediated by TAZ. TAZ activation is a general feature of Wnt signaling and is functionally relevant to mediate Wnt biological effects."

https://openalex.org/W2050189794,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders, but the role of phospholipids, particularly the nonbilayer-forming lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), in mitochondrial function is poorly understood. Elimination of mitochondrial PE (mtPE) synthesis via phosphatidylserine decarboxylase in mice profoundly alters mitochondrial morphology and is embryonic lethal (Steenbergen, R., Nanowski, T. S., Beigneux, A., Kulinski, A., Young, S. G., and Vance, J. E. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 40032-40040). We now report that moderate <30% depletion of mtPE alters mitochondrial morphology and function and impairs cell growth. Acute reduction of mtPE by RNAi silencing of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase and chronic reduction of mtPE in PSB-2 cells that have only 5% of normal phosphatidylserine synthesis decreased respiratory capacity, ATP production, and activities of electron transport chain complexes (C) I and CIV but not CV. Blue native-PAGE analysis revealed defects in the organization of CI and CIV into supercomplexes in PE-deficient mitochondria, correlated with reduced amounts of CI and CIV proteins. Thus, mtPE deficiency impairs formation and/or membrane integration of respiratory supercomplexes. Despite normal or increased levels of mitochondrial fusion proteins in mtPE-deficient cells, and no reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondria were extensively fragmented, and mitochondrial ultrastructure was grossly aberrant. In general, chronic reduction of mtPE caused more pronounced mitochondrial defects than did acute mtPE depletion. The functional and morphological changes in PSB-2 cells were largely reversed by normalization of mtPE content by supplementation with lyso-PE, a mtPE precursor. These studies demonstrate that even a modest reduction of mtPE in mammalian cells profoundly alters mitochondrial functions."
https://openalex.org/W2015804728,"To identify genetic susceptibility loci for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Chinese population, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2,514 chronic HBV carriers (1,161 HCC cases and 1,353 controls) followed by a 2-stage validation among 6 independent populations of chronic HBV carriers (4,319 cases and 4,966 controls). The joint analyses showed that HCC risk was significantly associated with two independent loci: rs7574865 at STAT4, P(meta) = 2.48 × 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) = 1.21; and rs9275319 at HLA-DQ, P(meta) = 2.72 × 10(-17), OR = 1.49. The risk allele G at rs7574865 was significantly associated with lower mRNA levels of STAT4 in both the HCC tissues and nontumor tissues of 155 individuals with HBV-related HCC (P(trend) = 0.0008 and 0.0002, respectively). We also found significantly lower mRNA expression of STAT4 in HCC tumor tissues compared with paired adjacent nontumor tissues (P = 2.33 × 10(-14))."

https://openalex.org/W2080665741,"Increasing antibiotic resistance makes the identification of new antibacterial principles an urgent task. The thioredoxin system including thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), thioredoxin (Trx), and NADPH plays critical roles in cellular DNA synthesis and defense against oxidative stress. Notably, TrxR is very different in structure and mechanism in mammals and bacteria. Ebselen [2-phenyl-1,2 benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one], a well-known antioxidant and a substrate for mammalian TrxR and Trx, is rapidly bacteriocidal for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by an unknown mechanism. We have discovered that ebselen is a competitive inhibitor of Escherichia coli TrxR with a Ki of 0.52 ± 0.13 μM, through reaction with the active site dithiol of the enzyme. Bacteria lacking glutathione (GSH) and glutaredoxin, in which TrxR and Trx are essential for DNA synthesis, were particularly sensitive to ebselen. In growth-inhibited E. coli strains, Trx1 and Trx2 were oxidized, demonstrating that electron transfer via thioredoxin was blocked. Ebselen and its sulfur analog ebsulfur were bactericidal for GSH-negative pathogens. Ebsulfur inhibited a clinically isolated Helicobacter pylori strain with a minimum inhibitory concentration value as low as 0.39 μg/ml. These results demonstrate that bacterial Trx and TrxR are viable antibacterial drug targets using benzisoselenazol and benzisothiazol derivates.—Lu, J., Vlamis-Gardikas, A., Kandasamy, K., Zhao, R., Gustafsson, T.

https://openalex.org/W2057131420,"Macrophages play a key role in host defense and in tissue repair after injury. Emerging evidence suggests that macrophage dysfunction in states of lipid excess can contribute to the development of insulin resistance and may underlie inflammatory complications of diabetes. Ceramides are sphingolipids that modulate a variety of cellular responses including cell death, autophagy, insulin signaling, and inflammation. In this study we investigated the intersection between TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling and saturated fatty acids with regard to ceramide generation. Primary macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not produce C16 ceramide, whereas palmitate exposure led to a modest increase in this sphingolipid. Strikingly, the combination of LPS and palmitate led to a synergistic increase in C16 ceramide. This response occurred via cross-talk at the level of de novo ceramide synthesis in the ER. The synergistic response required TLR4 signaling via MyD88 and TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon beta (TRIF), whereas palmitate-induced ceramide production occurred independent of these inflammatory molecules. This ceramide response augmented IL-1β and TNFα release, a process that may contribute to the enhanced inflammatory response in metabolic diseases characterized by dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W1998907151,"Cyclic dinucleotides, including cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), are known to be ubiquitous second messengers involved in bacterial signal transduction. However, no transcriptional regulator has been characterized as a c-di-AMP receptor/effector to date. In the present study, using a c-di-AMP/transcription factor binding screen, we identified Ms5346, a TetR family regulator in Mycobacterium smegmatis, as a c-di-AMP receptor in bacteria. Ms5346 could specifically bind c-di-AMP with K(d) of 2.3 ± 0.5 μM. Using EMSA and DNase I footprinting assays, c-di-AMP was found to stimulate the DNA binding activity of Ms5346 and to enhance its ability to protect its target DNA sequence. A conserved 14-bp palindromic motif was identified as the DNA-binding site for Ms5346. Further, Ms5346 was found to negatively regulate expression of three target genes including Ms5347 (encoding a major facilitator family transporter), Ms5348 (encoding a medium chain fatty acyl-CoA ligase), and Ms5696 (encoding a cold shock protein, CspA). Ms5346 is the first cyclic di-AMP receptor regulator to be identified in bacteria, and we have designated it as DarR. Our findings enhance our understanding of the function and regulatory mechanism of the second messenger c-di-AMP in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2005760671,"The androgen receptor (AR) has a vital role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer by promoting G1-S progression, possibly by functioning as a licensing factor for DNA replication. We here report that low dose 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an endogenous estrogen metabolite, induces mitotic arrest in prostate cancer cells involving activation of the E3 ligase CHIP (C-terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) and degradation of the AR. Depletion of the AR by small interfering RNA (siRNA) eliminates 2-ME-induced arrest and introducing AR into PC3-M cells confers 2-ME-induced mitotic arrest. Knockdown of CHIP or MDM2 (mouse homolog of double minute 2 protein) individually or in combination reduced AR degradation and abrogated M phase arrest induced by 2-ME. Our data link AR degradation via ubiquitination to mitotic arrest. Targeting the AR by activating E3 ligases such as CHIP represents a novel strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2150498923,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent a serious threat for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). How cytokines and environmental signals integrate the DNA damage response and contribute to HSC-intrinsic DNA repair processes remains unknown. Thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor, Mpl, are critical factors supporting HSC self-renewal and expansion. Here, we uncover an unknown function for TPO-Mpl in the regulation of DNA damage response. We show that DNA repair following γ-irradiation (γ-IR) or the action of topoisomerase-II inhibitors is defective in Mpl(-/-) and in wild-type mouse or human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells treated in the absence of TPO. TPO stimulates DNA repair in vitro and in vivo by increasing DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end-joining efficiency. This ensures HSC chromosomal integrity and limits their long-term injury in response to IR. This shows that niche factors can modulate the HSC DSB repair machinery and opens new avenues for administration of TPO agonists for minimizing radiotherapy-induced HSC injury and mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1972841107,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer. Despite response to chemotherapy, relapses are frequent and resistance to available treatments is often seen in the metastatic setting. Therefore, identification of new therapeutic targets is required. With this aim, we have profiled the activation status of 44 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their major signaling pathways in patient-derived TNBC tumors. Frequent co-activation of several RTKs as well as the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) routes was found. Pharmacologic targeting of the activated kinases indicated that agents that attack the mTOR route are more potent and efficient antitumoral treatments than agents targeting RTKs. mTOR signals through two multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. We used a genetic approach to explore the contribution of each of the two mTOR branches to the regulation of cell number of TNBC cells. RNA interference experiments indicated that mTORC1 predominated over mTORC2 in the control of TNBC cell proliferation. Moreover, RNA interference of mTOR had a superior antiproliferative action than separately acting on mTORC1 or mTORC2. To analyze the relevance of mTOR targeting in vivo, we used mice with TNBC. Treatment of these mice with BEZ235, a drug that targets mTOR, slowed tumor growth. Mechanistically, BEZ235 delayed cell cycle progression without affecting cell viability. Our results show that TNBCs are particularly sensitive to inhibition of the mTOR pathway, and indicate that mTOR targeting may be a more efficient anti-TNBC therapy than exclusively acting on the mTORC1 branch of the pathway. This is relevant as most mTOR inhibitors used in the clinic act on mTORC1. Collectively with the fact that BEZ235 synergized with drugs commonly used in the treatment of TNBC, our data support the clinical development of agents that act on mTOR as a therapy for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2011930674,"Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of striatal medium spiny neurons. Indications of oxidative stress are apparent in brain tissues from both HD patients and HD mouse models; however, the origin of this oxidant stress remains a mystery. Here, we used a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of HD (YAC128) to investigate the potential connections between dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial oxidative damage in HD cells. We found that YAC128 mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit a strikingly higher level of mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ loading and elevated superoxide generation compared with WT cells, indicating that both mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and superoxide generation are dysregulated in HD cells. The excessive mitochondrial oxidant stress is critically dependent on mitochondrial Ca2+ loading in HD cells, because blocking mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake abolished elevated superoxide generation. Similar results were obtained using neurons from HD model mice and fibroblast cells from HD patients. More importantly, mitochondrial Ca2+ loading in HD cells caused a 2-fold higher level of mitochondrial genomic DNA (mtDNA) damage due to the excessive oxidant generation.

Therefore, the mechanism by which HTTexp causes elevated oxidant stress in HD neurons remains elusive, and why striatal MSN are preferentially under oxidant stress is not known. Enhanced cytosolic Ca2+ signaling in striatal MSN has been linked to neuropathology in HD (18Zeron M.M. Hansson O. Chen N. Wellington C.L. Leavitt B.R. Brundin P. Hayden M.R. Raymond L.A.

Mitochondrion is not only a very efficient Ca2+ buffer system but also constitutes the major ROS generator in eukaryotic cells, including neurons. We aim to look at the potential connection between mitochondrial Ca2+ loading and ROS generation in HD cells/neurons. However, whether Ca2+ loading into mitochondria matrix stimulates or decreases ROS generation is a topic of great debate in the field. From a thermodynamic point of view, it has been noted that Ca2+ loading into mitochondria, which consumes mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), should result in a partial uncoupling and thus would reduce electron flow from complex II and decrease ROS generation (36Brand M.D. Esteves T.C. Physiological functions of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP2 and UCP3.Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). However, a fundamentally different model has been proposed that mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ loading-induced uncoupling leads to increased ROS generation by virtue of increased in electron flux (to restore and to maintain ΔΨm), and thus increased in the probability of electron slippage and superoxide formation (37Viola H.M. Arthur P.G. Hool L.C. Transient exposure to hydrogen peroxide causes an increase in mitochondria-derived superoxide as a result of sustained alteration in L-type Ca2+ channel function in the absence of apoptosis in ventricular myocytes.Circ.

Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C817-C833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). Both models were supported experimentally; however, the lack of specific ROS probes targeted to the mitochondria of living cells may be the main reason for this discrepancy. Nevertheless, Ca2+ signaling system may regulate components of ROS homeostasis and thus influence the redox balance in cells (38Brookes P.S. Yoon Y. Robotham J.L. Anders M.W. Sheu S.S.

Sheu S.S. Cross-talk signaling between mitochondrial Ca2+ and ROS.Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1197-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that excessive Ca2+ loading into mitochondria creates mitochondrial oxidant stress. To dissect the molecular events between disrupted cytosolic Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial oxidant stress, it is essential to visualize and quantify mitochondrial matrix ROS generation in situ and in real time. Recently, Wang et al. (40Wang W. Fang H. Groom L. Cheng A. Zhang W. Liu J. Wang X. Li K. Han P. Zheng M. Yin J. Wang W. Mattson M.P. Kao J.P. Lakatta E.G. Sheu S.S. Ouyang K. Chen J. Dirksen R.T.

Moreover, mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ dynamics were also visualized by a mitochondria matrix-targeted Ca2+ indicator, cameleon (42Palmer A.E. Giacomello M. Kortemme T. Hires S.A. Lev-Ram V. Baker D.

We found that both mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and superoxide generation are dysregulated in embryonic fibroblasts and striatal neurons from a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of HD. We then provided direct evidence to support a new causal link between dysregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling, elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress, and mtDNA damage accumulation in HD. Steady buildup of oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and proteins could eventually result in mitochondrial dysfunction and the defects of respiratory chain complexes found in postmortem studies of symptomatic HD patients (31Gu M.

In this study, we investigated the biochemical properties of the cerato-platanin protein EPL1 from T. atroviride. Our results showed that EPL1 readily self-assembles at air/water interfaces and forms protein layers that can be redissolved in water. These properties are reminiscent of hydrophobins, which are amphiphilic fungal proteins that accumulate at interfaces. Atomic force microscopy imaging showed that EPL1 assembles into irregular meshwork-like substructures. Furthermore, surface activity measurements with EPL1 revealed that, in contrast to hydrophobins, EPL1 increases the polarity of aqueous solutions and surfaces. In addition, EPL1 was found to bind to various forms of polymeric chitin.

Lett. 2004; 233: 341-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the biochemical properties of cerato-platanin proteins have not yet been studied in this respect. Hydrophobins are amphiphilic fungal proteins that self-assemble at hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces and invert the polarity of surfaces (17Limón M.C. Chacón M.R. Mejías R. Delgado-Jarana J. Rincón A.M. Codón A.C. Benítez T. Increased antifungal and chitinase specific activities of Trichoderma harzianum CECT 2413 by addition of a cellulose binding domain.Appl. Microbiol.

Microbiol. 2001; 55: 625-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). When fungal hyphae emerge from aqueous growth medium to form aerial hyphae and produce conidia, these growth structures are covered with a layer of hydrophobins that render them hydrophobic. This facilitates the dispersal of fungal conidia. However, hydropathy plots of cerato-platanin proteins show that they have fewer hydrophobic regions than hydrophobins, suggesting that these proteins have at least slightly different properties from “traditional” hydrophobins (14Seidl V. Marchetti M. Schandl R. Allmaier G. Kubicek C.P.

Recently, an NMR-based structural study of CP showed that this protein has structural features that are similar to Barwin-like endoglucanases and plant expansins, which are involved in plant cell wall extension (19de Oliveira A.L.

Furthermore, based on structural NMR data, an N-acetylglucosamine binding pocket was found in CP; this is interesting in view of the fact that chitin, which is composed of N-acetylglucosamine monomers, is a structural component of the fungal cell wall. cerato-platanin atomic force microscopy polyethylene polyvinyl chloride millinewtons. To advance our understanding of the biological functions of cerato-platanin proteins, in this study, we investigated the biochemical properties of the protein EPL1 from T. atroviride with respect to its self-assembly at interfaces, surface activity, and carbohydrate binding properties. Furthermore, gene expression profiles of the three cerato-platanin genes epl1, epl2, and epl3 were assessed in T. atroviride. Single and double knock-out strains of epl1 and epl2, the two genes that were found to be expressed under different growth conditions, were analyzed. T. atroviride P1 (ATCC 74058) was used in this study and was kept on potato dextrose agar plates. Stock cultures were stored at −80 °C. The protein EPL1 was purified from culture supernatants of T. atroviride P1 as described (14Seidl V. Marchetti M. Schandl R. Allmaier G. Kubicek C.P. Epl1, the major secreted protein of Hypocrea atroviridis on glucose, is a member of a strongly conserved protein family comprising plant defense response elicitors.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4346-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture supernatants were concentrated via ultrafiltration using a membrane with a 10-kDa cutoff and subsequently purified via cation-exchange chromatography. Purification steps were checked with SDS-PAGE (20Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY2001: 7.1-7.74Google Scholar). The protein was stored at 4 °C in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. This pH is close to that from T. atroviride cultivations from which EPL1 is purified, and the protein was found to be very stable under these conditions. The contact angle describes the ability of a liquid to spread on a surface. Two methods of the contact angle measurements, the sessile drop method (21Shang J. Flury M. Harsh J.B. Zollars R.L. Contact angles of aluminosilicate clays as affected by relative humidity and exchangeable cations.Colloids Surf. A Physicochem. Eng. Asp. 2010; 353: 1-9Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the pendant drop method (22Yang D. Xu Z. Liu C. Wang L. Experimental study on the surface characteristics of polymer melts.Colloids Surf. A Physicochem. Eng. Asp. 2010; 367: 174-180Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were applied using the contact angle device DSA 100 (KRÜSS, Hamburg, Germany). For analysis of the spreading behavior with the sessile drop method, 2-μl drops of the substance were set down on the plastic surfaces with a drop dosing system. Drop shapes were modeled with the software program DSA1 (KRÜSS) using a polynomial function. Plates with different polar behavior (PE with a disperse part of 36.31 mN/m and a polar part of 0.3 mN/m and PVC with a disperse part of 42.59 mN/m and a polar part of 1.69 mN/m) were used. The Owens-Wendt-Kaelble method (23Owens D.K. Wendt R.C. Estimation of the surface free energy of polymers.J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 1969; 13: 1741-1747Crossref Scopus (7289) Google Scholar) was applied to calculate the polarity values of the plates and to describe the characteristic properties of the protein. It should be noted that on the two commonly used surfaces, glass and Teflon, reliable contact angle measurements were not possible with EPL1 solutions. On glass plates, droplets of the protein solution showed strong dissemination, and therefore, the determination of contact angles was not possible. On Teflon surfaces, electrostatic charging was observed that led to low reproducibility of the contact angles. For determination of the surface tension energy of solutions, the pendant drop method was used. A drop hanging on the outlet needle of the contact angle device was created by using the drop dosing system. Before the drop detached from the needle, a picture was taken with the high focus camera integrated in the DSA 100 system. Based on the Laplace law, the surface tension energy of the liquids was calculated. The results from contact angle measurements were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance and the Tukey method using the software OriginPro 7.5G. For self-assembly experiments with EPL1 protein, solutions were pipetted on 22 × 60-mm coverslips and incubated in plastic Petri dishes sealed with Parafilm at 25 °C overnight. Droplets were imaged on an inverted TE300 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) by using differential interference contrast optics and imaged with a DXM1200F digital camera (Nikon). For field emission gun scanning electron microscopy imaging, samples were dried down, sputtered with 4 nm of gold/palladium (60:40) and imaged in an FEI Quanta 200F (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR) under high vacuum with secondary electrons. AFM images were recorded in tapping mode with a NanoScope V (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) using etched single crystal silicon probes (NCH from Nanoworld, Neuchatel, Switzerland) with a spring constant of 42 newtons/m. Images where taken with set points corresponding to a damping of ∼90% of the free amplitude. Samples were prepared by drying down a protein solution on a sheet of freshly cleaved mica, which was previously confirmed to be flat and clean with a root mean square roughness of under 2 Å, or incubation of the mica sheet with the protein solution for 5 min followed by extensive rinsing with distilled water and drying prior to imaging. Protein pulldown assays with insoluble carbon sources were performed using 10 mg of the following carbon sources: fungal cell walls and colloidal chitin (prepared as described in Ref. 24Seidl V. Huemer B. Seiboth B. Kubicek C.P. A complete survey of Trichoderma chitinases reveals three distinct subgroups of family 18 chitinases.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5923-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), chitin from crab shells (fine and crude; Sigma), Arbocel cellulose fibers (J. Rettenmaier and Söhne GmbH + Co. KG (JRS), Rosenberg, Germany), and chitin beads (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). 65 μg of protein were mixed with 10 mg of the different carbon sources in a total volume of 1 ml of 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. Samples were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with gentle agitation and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube, and the pellets were washed three times with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of this buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS and incubated for 10 min at 99 °C. After centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was transferred into a new tube. 250 μl of the supernatants were precipitated using the chloroform and methanol method (25Wessel D. Flügge U.I. A method for the quantitative recovery of protein in dilute solution in the presence of detergents and lipids.Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3169) Google Scholar). Unbound and bound protein fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and colloidal Coomassie staining (20Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY2001: 7.1-7.74Google Scholar). Shake flask cultivations were carried out with two different media, SM (26Seidl V. Seiboth B. Karaffa L. Kubicek C.P.

Media were inoculated with 1 × 106 conidia/ml and cultivated at 25 °C and 200 rpm. Chitin cultivations for gene expression analysis were performed in static liquid cultures as described (27Gruber S. Vaaje-Kolstad G. Matarese F. López-Mondéjar R. Kubicek C.P. Seidl-Seiboth V. Analysis of subgroup C of fungal chitinases containing chitin-binding and LysM modules in the mycoparasite Trichoderma atroviride.Glycobiology. 2011; 21: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mycelia were harvested at the time points indicated under “Results” and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For gene expression analysis from conidia at different maturation stages, conidia were scraped from sporulated potato dextrose agar plates with a spatula and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For RNA isolation, the samples were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (20Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY2001: 7.1-7.74Google Scholar). Cultivations with chitin as the carbon source and RNA isolation from these cultivations were carried out as described (27Gruber S. Vaaje-Kolstad G. Matarese F. López-Mondéjar R. Kubicek C.P. Seidl-Seiboth V. Analysis of subgroup C of fungal chitinases containing chitin-binding and LysM modules in the mycoparasite Trichoderma atroviride.Glycobiology. 2011; 21: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Isolated RNAs were treated with DNase I (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), and cDNAs were generated with the Revert Aid H-minus cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). RT-PCR (25 cycles) was performed using the gene-specific primers listed in supplemental Table 1. Accession numbers of the epl genes in the United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute T. atroviride genome database are as follows: epl1, 30292; epl2, 88590; and epl3, 48225. The gpdh gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, protein ID 297741) was used as the reference gene. Knock-out strains were generated with T. atroviride P1 (ATCC 74058) as the parental strain. For construction of the epl1 deletion vector, 960 bp of the 5′- and 1100 bp of the 3′-flanking regions of epl1 were amplified from genomic DNA of T. atroviride P1 using primers 1/2 for the 5′-region and 3/4 for the 3′-region. All primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. The plasmid pBSZamdS contains an amdS selection marker cassette (28Penttilä M. Nevalainen H. Rättö M. Salminen E. Knowles J. A versatile transformation system for the cellulolytic filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei.Gene. 1987; 61: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) flanked by a SalI and an Acc65I site. pBSZamdS was linearized with SalI, the PCR fragment of the epl1 5′-region was inserted by recombination using the In-Fusion Advantage PCR cloning kit with Cloning Enhancer (Eubio, Vienna, Austria) and transformed into Escherichia coli (One Shot TOP10 chemically competent cells, LifeTech, Vienna, Austria). The resulting plasmid was digested with Acc65I, and the 3′-fragment of epl1 was inserted by recombination and transformation into E. coli. For fungal transformations, the epl1 knock-out cassette was amplified with primers 1/4 with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science). Primers 5/6, yielding a PCR product with a size of 4.4 kb, were used to identify epl1 knock-out strains. For further verification of purified knock-out strains, primers 1/4 were used, yielding a 2.6-kb band for the wild-type locus. For generation of the epl2 deletion vector, the plasmid pRLMEX30 (29Mach R.L. Schindler M. Kubicek C.P. Transformation of Trichoderma reesei based on hygromycin B resistance using homologous expression signals.Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was used. The 5′-flanking region of epl2 (protein ID 88590 in the United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute T. atroviride genome database) was amplified with primers 7/8, and the 3′-flanking region was amplified with primers 9/10. The epl2 5′-flanking region was ligated into the vector after restriction digestion with HindIII and SalI. The resulting plasmid was digested with SpeI and dephosphorylated, and the 3′-flanking region was also digested with SpeI and inserted by ligation. For fungal transformations, the epl2 deletion cassette was amplified using the GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) and primer pair 7/10. Fungal transformants were verified by PCR with primers 11/12, yielding a 2.5-kb band for the epl2 knock-out locus. After single spore isolations, the absence of the epl2 gene was verified with primers 13/14, yielding a 1.5-kb band for the epl2 wild-type locus. Fungal transformation, protoplast generation, preparation of selection media, and purification of fungal transformants were performed as described (30Catalano V. Vergara M. Hauzenberger J.R.

Osmotic stress tolerance was analyzed in liquid medium and on agar plates containing 2% (w/v) malt extract and 10% (w/v) glycerol or 1 m NaCl. Growth on chitin was tested in static liquid cultivations with SM medium, 1% chitin, and 0.1% peptone (27Gruber S. Vaaje-Kolstad G. Matarese F. López-Mondéjar R. Kubicek C.P. Seidl-Seiboth V.

Biomass measurements from liquid cultivations and assessment of sporulation rates on agar plates were carried out as described (31López-Mondéjar R. Catalano V. Kubicek C.P. Seidl V.

https://openalex.org/W2090243158,"GBA1 and GBA2 are both β-glucosidases, which cleave glucosylceramide (GlcCer) to glucose and ceramide. GlcCer is a main precursor for higher order glycosphingolipids but might also serve as intracellular messenger. Mutations in the lysosomal GBA1 underlie Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease in humans. Knocking out the non-lysosomal GBA2 in mice results in accumulation of GlcCer outside the lysosomes in various tissues (e.g. testis and liver) and impairs sperm development and liver regeneration. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To reveal the physiological function of GBA2 and, thereby, of the non-lysosomal GlcCer pool, it is important to characterize the localization of GBA2 and its activity in different tissues. Thus, we generated GBA2-specific antibodies and developed an assay that discriminates between GBA1 and GBA2 without the use of detergent. We show that GBA2 is not, as previously thought, an integral membrane protein but rather a cytosolic protein that tightly associates with cellular membranes. The interaction with the membrane, in particular with phospholipids, is important for its activity. GBA2 is localized at the ER and Golgi, which puts GBA2 in a key position for a lysosome-independent route of GlcCer-dependent signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest that GBA2 might affect the phenotype of Gaucher disease, because GBA2 activity is reduced in Gba1 knock-out fibroblasts and fibroblasts from a Gaucher patient. Our results provide the basis to understand the mechanism for GBA2 function in vivo and might help to unravel the role of GBA2 during pathogenesis of Gaucher disease."
https://openalex.org/W2036124507,"The BRCA1 tumor suppressor protein heterodimerizes with its partner protein, BARD1, via the RING domain present in both proteins. The heterodimer contains an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and participates in multiple cellular functions such as cell cycle control, DNA repair and regulation of gene transcription, collectively aimed at maintaining genomic stability and tumor suppression. Yet, the precise role of BRCA1 E3 ligase in these cellular functions is poorly understood. We present data showing that BRCA1 ubiquitinates G2/M cell cycle proteins, cyclin B and Cdc25C, leading to their accelerated degradation via a mechanism that is independent of APC/C. BRCA1-dependent degradation of cyclin B and Cdc25C is reversed by proteasome inhibitors and is enhanced following DNA damage, which may represent a possible mechanism to prevent cyclin B and Cdc25C accumulation, a requirement for mitotic entry. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how BRCA1 E3 ligase activity regulates the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and, thus, contributes to maintenance of genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W1965648147,"Pituitary homeobox-2 (PITX2) plays a substantial role in the development of pituitary, heart, and brain. Although the role of PITX2 isoforms in embryonic development has been extensively studied, its possible involvement in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway has not been reported. Because the Wnt pathway is strongly involved in ovarian development and cancer, we focused on the possible association between PITX2 and Wnt pathway in ovarian carcinoma cells. Remarkably, we found that PITX2 interacts and regulates WNT2/5A/9A/6/2B genes of the canonical, noncanonical, or other pathways in the human ovarian cancer cell SKOV-3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter-reporter assays further indicated the significant association of PITX2 with WNT2 and WNT5A promoters. Detailed study further reveals that the PITX2 isoform specifically activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway either directly or through Wnt ligands. Thus, the activated Wnt pathway subsequently enhances cell proliferation. Moreover, we found the activation of Wnt pathway reduces the expression of different FZD receptors that limit further Wnt activation, demonstrating the existence of an auto-regulatory feedback loop. In contrast, PITX2 could not activate the noncanonical pathway as the Wnt5A-specific ROR2 receptor does not express in SKOV-3 cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that, despite being a target of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, PITX2 itself induces the same, thus leading to the activation of the cell cycle regulating genes as well as the proliferation of SKOV-3 cells. Collectively, we highlighted that the PITX2 and Wnt pathway exerts a positive feedback regulation, whereas frizzled receptors generate a negative feedback in this pathway. Our findings will help to understand the molecular mechanism of proliferation in ovarian cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976456142,"Differentiation of adipocytes from preadipocytes contributes to adipose tissue expansion in obesity. Impaired adipogenesis may underlie the development of metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Mechanistically, a well defined transcriptional network coordinates adipocyte differentiation. The family of paired-related homeobox transcription factors, which includes Prrx1a, Prrx1b, and Prrx2, is implicated with regulation of mesenchymal cell fate, including myogenesis and skeletogenesis; however, whether these proteins impact adipogenesis remains to be addressed. In this study, we identify Prrx1a and Prrx1b as negative regulators of adipogenesis. We show that Prrx1a and Prrx1b are down-regulated during adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Stable knockdown of Prrx1a/b enhances adipogenesis, with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α and FABP4 and increased secretion of the adipokines adiponectin and chemerin. Although stable low-level expression of Prrx1a, Prrx1b, or Prrx2 does not affect 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, transient overexpression of Prrx1a or Prrx1b inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ activity. Prrx1 knockdown decreases expression of Tgfb2 and Tgfb3, and inhibition of TGFβ signaling during adipogenesis mimics the effects of Prrx1 knockdown. These data support the hypothesis that endogenous Prrx1 restrains adipogenesis by regulating expression of TGFβ ligands and thereby activating TGFβ signaling. Finally, we find that expression of Prrx1a or Prrx1b in adipose tissue increases during obesity and strongly correlates with Tgfb3 expression in BL6 mice. These observations suggest that increased Prrx1 expression may promote TGFβ activity in adipose tissue and thereby contribute to aberrant adipocyte function during obesity."

In this study, we showed that OSW-1 effectively killed leukemia cells at subnanomolar concentrations through a unique mechanism by causing a time-dependent elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) prior to induction of apoptosis. A mechanistic study revealed that this compound inhibited the sodium-calcium exchanger 1 on the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) and a decrease in cytosolic Na(+). The elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) caused mitochondrial calcium overload and resulted in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, OSW-1 also caused a Ca(2+)-dependent cleavage of the survival factor GRP78. Inhibition of Ca(2+) entry into the mitochondria by the uniporter inhibitor RU360 or by cyclosporin A significantly prevented the OSW-1-induced cell death, indicating the important role of mitochondria in mediating the cytotoxic activity. The extremely potent activity of OSW-1 against leukemia cells and its unique mechanism of action suggest that this compound may be potentially useful in the treatment of leukemia."

As humans are highly visual animals, these differences should be reflected in the pattern of eye movements they make when interacting with the world. We examined fixation distributions of 52 women and men while viewing 80 natural images and found systematic differences in their spatial and temporal characteristics. The most striking of these was that women looked away and usually below many objects of interest, particularly when rating images in terms of their potency. We also found reliable differences correlated with the images' semantic content, the observers' personality, and how the images were semantically evaluated. Information theoretic techniques showed that many of these differences increased with viewing time. These effects were not small: the fixations to a single action or romance film image allow the classification of the sex of an observer with 64% accuracy. While men and women may live in the same environment, what they see in this environment is reliably different. Our findings have important implications for both past and future eye movement research while confirming the significant role individual differences play in visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W1982833361,"Primary cilia can act as either a negative or positive regulator of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Many cartilage tumors are characterized by abnormal activation of the Hh pathway. Here, we report that the presence of primary cilia occurs at a low frequency (12.4%) in neoplastic chondrocytes from malignant human chondrosarcomas, compared with chondrocytes from normal articular cartilage (67.7%). To determine the function of primary cilia in cartilaginous neoplasia, we studied benign cartilage tumors that are formed in mice by chondrocyte-specific overexpression of Gli2, a downstream transcriptional activator of the Hh pathway. Col2A1-Gli2 mice were crossed with Ift88+/− mice, which display a partial loss of ciliogenesis. Surprisingly, cartilage tumors developed in Ift88+/− mice that were phenotypically similar to those that arise in Col2A1-Gli2 mice. Further activation of the Hh pathway was observed in Col2A1-Gli2; Ift88+/− mice compared with either Col2A1-Gli2 or Ift88+/− mice, which was associated with an increased incidence of cartilage tumors. Chondrosarcomas were established in explant cultures, and treated with choral hydrate, which disrupts the functional primary cilia. Thus, treatment resulted in hyperactivity of the Hh signaling pathway, as well as cellular changes that could promote tumor growth. Primary cilia functions to inhibit Hh signaling in neoplastic chondrocytes. The activation of Hh signaling is sufficient to induce benign cartilage tumors without another oncogenic initiating event. Moreover, as primary cilia suppress Hh pathway activation in chondrosarcoma, cellular mechanisms inhibiting proper cilia function may be important in maintaining the neoplastic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2065930346,"Immunotherapy with monoclonal and polyclonal immunoglobulin is successfully applied to improve many clinical conditions, including infection, autoimmune diseases, or immunodeficiency. Most immunoglobulin products, recombinant or plasma-derived, are based on IgG antibodies, whereas to date, the use of IgA for therapeutic application has remained anecdotal. In particular, purification or production of large quantities of secretory IgA (SIgA) for potential mucosal application has not been achieved. In this work, we sought to investigate whether polymeric IgA (pIgA) recovered from human plasma is able to associate with secretory component (SC) to generate SIgA-like molecules. We found that ∼15% of plasma pIgA carried J chain and displayed selective SC binding capacity either in a mixture with monomeric IgA (mIgA) or after purification. The recombinant SC associated covalently in a 1:1 stoichiometry with pIgA and with similar efficacy as colostrum-derived SC. In comparison with pIgA, the association with SC delayed degradation of SIgA by intestinal proteases. Similar results were obtained with plasma-derived IgM. In vitro, plasma-derived IgA and SIgA neutralized Shigella flexneri used as a model pathogen, resulting in a delay of bacteria-induced damage targeted to polarized Caco-2 cell monolayers. The sum of these novel data demonstrates that association of plasma-derived IgA or IgM with recombinant/colostrum-derived SC is feasible and yields SIgA- and SIgM-like molecules with similar biochemical and functional characteristics as mucosa-derived immunoglobulins."
https://openalex.org/W1964599397,"The tumor-suppressor p53 provides a critical brake on tumor development. HDM2 (human double-minute 2), a p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the principal cellular antagonist of p53. Mounting evidence has suggested that ribosomal proteins (RPs) modulate HDM2-p53 as a novel pathway for regulating p53 signaling. However, the upstream regulators that mediate RP-HDM2-p53 circuits remain poorly understood. Here we identify human coilin-interacting nuclear ATPase protein (hCINAP) as an interacting partner of ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14). RPS14 stabilized and activated p53 by inhibiting HDM2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation. More importantly, RPS14 was specifically modified with NEDD8 and hCINAP inhibited RPS14 NEDDylation by recruiting NEDD8-specific protease 1. The decrease in RPS14 NEDDylation led to reduced stability and incorrect localization of RPS14, thereby attenuating the interaction between RPS14 and HDM2. Free HDM2 stimulated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hCINAP acts as a novel regulator of RPS14-HDM2-p53 by regulating the interaction between RPS14 and HDM2 through the control of RPS14 NEDDylation. These findings suggest that hCINAP is an important regulator of RP-HDM2-p53 pathway and a potential anticancer drug target."

We identified mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3) as a downstream target of ΔNp63α that is required for mediating these effects. We show that ΔNp63α regulates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) activity via MKP3 in both cancer and non-transformed cells. We further show that exogenous ΔNp63α inhibits cell invasion and is dependent on MKP3 upregulation for repression. Conversely, endogenous pan-p63 ablation results in increased cell migration and invasion, which can be reverted by reintroducing the ΔNp63α isoform alone, but not by other isoforms. Interestingly, these effects require Erk2, but not Erk1 expression, and can be rescued by enforced MKP3 expression. Moreover, MKP3 expression is reduced in invasive cancers, and reduced p63 expression increases metastatic frequency in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for ΔNp63α in preventing cancer metastasis by inhibition of Erk2 signaling via MKP3."
https://openalex.org/W2122376569,"Stimulation of the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase has a critical role in the development and migration of melanocytes, and oncogenic c-Kit mutants contribute to the progression of some melanomas. c-Kit signalling activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways and their relative contribution to the activities of oncogenic and ligand-dependent c-Kit remains uncertain. We show that PI3K is a major regulator of MAPK activation in response to c-Kit activity and the dominant effector of c-Kit-driven melanocyte proliferation and melanoma survival. Nevertheless, inhibition of the PI3K pathway in c-Kit mutant melanoma cells did not replicate the apoptotic efficacy of the c-Kit inhibitor, imatinib mesylate. Instead, the simultaneous suppression of the PI3K and MAPK pathways promoted a strong synergistic apoptotic effect. These data indicate that MAPK functions as a redundant survival signal that reinforces the PI3K cascade in c-Kit mutant melanoma. Thus, the concurrent inhibition of PI3K and MAPK signalling is required to suppress oncogenic c-Kit activity and may provide an effective therapeutic strategy in c-Kit mutant melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2079567622,"Valerian is an herbal preparation from the roots of Valeriana officinalis used as an anxiolytic and sedative and in the treatment of insomnia. The biological activities of valerian are attributed to valerenic acid and its putative biosynthetic precursor valerenadiene, sesquiterpenes, found in V. officinalis roots. These sesquiterpenes retain an isobutenyl side chain whose origin has been long recognized as enigmatic because a chemical rationalization for their biosynthesis has not been obvious. Using recently developed metabolomic and transcriptomic resources, we identified seven V. officinalis terpene synthase genes (VoTPSs), two that were functionally characterized as monoterpene synthases and three that preferred farnesyl diphosphate, the substrate for sesquiterpene synthases. The reaction products for two of the sesquiterpene synthases exhibiting root-specific expression were characterized by a combination of GC-MS and NMR in comparison to the terpenes accumulating in planta. VoTPS7 encodes for a synthase that biosynthesizes predominately germacrene C, whereas VoTPS1 catalyzes the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to valerena-1,10-diene. Using a yeast expression system, specific labeled [(13)C]acetate, and NMR, we investigated the catalytic mechanism for VoTPS1 and provide evidence for the involvement of a caryophyllenyl carbocation, a cyclobutyl intermediate, in the biosynthesis of valerena-1,10-diene. We suggest a similar mechanism for the biosynthesis of several other biologically related isobutenyl-containing sesquiterpenes."
https://openalex.org/W1983228276,"Regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that integrates heterotrimeric G protein and H-Ras signaling pathways. RGS14 possesses an RGS domain that binds active Gα(i/o)-GTP subunits to promote GTP hydrolysis and a G protein regulatory (GPR) motif that selectively binds inactive Gα(i1/3)-GDP subunits to form a stable heterodimer at cellular membranes. RGS14 also contains two tandem Ras/Rap binding domains (RBDs) that bind H-Ras. Here we show that RGS14 preferentially binds activated H-Ras-GTP in live cells to enhance H-Ras cellular actions and that this interaction is regulated by inactive Gα(i1)-GDP and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in live cells, we show that RGS14-Luciferase and active H-Ras(G/V)-Venus exhibit a robust BRET signal at the plasma membrane that is markedly enhanced in the presence of inactive Gα(i1)-GDP but not active Gα(i1)-GTP. Active H-Ras(G/V) interacts with a native RGS14·Gα(i1) complex in brain lysates, and co-expression of RGS14 and Gα(i1) in PC12 cells greatly enhances H-Ras(G/V) stimulatory effects on neurite outgrowth. Stimulation of the Gα(i)-linked α(2A)-adrenergic receptor induces a conformational change in the Gα(i1)·RGS14·H-Ras(G/V) complex that may allow subsequent regulation of the complex by other binding partners. Together, these findings indicate that inactive Gα(i1)-GDP enhances the affinity of RGS14 for H-Ras-GTP in live cells, resulting in a ternary signaling complex that is further regulated by GPCRs."

As part of the host's innate immune response, the release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by phagocytes represents a major obstacle to the establishment of infection. The ability of the human parasite Entamoeba histolytica to survive reactive oxygen and nitrogen species is central to its pathogenic potential and contributes to disease outcome. In order to define the transcriptional network associated with oxidative stress, we utilized the MEME and MAST programs to analyze the promoter regions of 57 amoebic genes that had increased expression specifically in response to H2O2 exposure. We functionally characterized an H2O2-regulatory motif (HRM) (1AAACCTCAATGAAGA15), which was enriched in these promoters and specifically bound amoebic nuclear protein(s).

Understanding how this response is coordinated at a transcriptional level provides important information regarding the ability of microorganisms to survive in hostile environments. In Escherichia coli and yeast, the transcription factors OxyR and YAP1, respectively, have been identified as the principal players in coordinating the transcriptional response to hydrogen peroxide (12Stephen D.W.

These transcription factors are directly impacted by elevated hydrogen peroxide levels and display altered DNA binding specificity (OxyR) (14Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G.

Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite, is an important human pathogen that must survive changing oxygen tensions and ROS in order to establish infection. Ninety percent of individuals infected with E. histolytica remain asymptomatic, whereas 10% develop a potentially lethal, invasive disease (18Stanley Jr., S.L. Amoebiasis.Lancet. 2003; 361: 1025-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The basis of this variable disease presentation is not fully understood but is probably due in part to the virulence potential of different parasite strains. Both virulent and non-virulent strains of E. histolytica have been identified (19Mattern C.F. Keister D.B. Caspar P.A. Experimental amebiasis. III. A rapid in vitro assay for virulence of Entamoeba histolytica.Am. J. Trop Med. Hyg. 1978; 27: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and comparative analyses of the proteome and transcriptome have identified multiple virulence determinants (20Davis P.H. Schulze J.

Potential implications for amebic pathogenesis.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One particularly striking difference is the increased expression in the virulent strain of the surface molecule peroxiredoxin, which degrades hydrogen peroxide (23Bruchhaus I. Richter S. Tannich E. Removal of hydrogen peroxide by the 29-kDa protein of Entamoeba histolytica.Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that virulent E. histolytica strains survive exposure to oxidative stress better than avirulent strains, in part due to the presence of peroxiredoxin (21Davis P.H. Zhang X. Guo J. Townsend R.R. Stanley Jr., S.L. Comparative proteomic analysis of two Entamoeba histolytica strains with different virulence phenotypes identifies peroxiredoxin as an important component of amoebic virulence.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the transcriptome level, microarray studies demonstrated that exposure to sublethal quantities of H2O2 or dipropylenetriamine-NONOate (a nitric oxide releaser) results in greater changes in transcript levels in a virulent than in a non-virulent amoebic strain (2Vicente J.B. Ehrenkaufer G.M. Saraiva L.M. Teixeira M. Singh U. Entamoeba histolytica modulates a complex repertoire of novel genes in response to oxidative and nitrosative stresses. Implications for amebic pathogenesis.Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The percentage of genes regulated by these compounds in the pathogenic strains is larger and the magnitude of changes observed in individual genes is higher than that observed in the non-pathogenic strains (2Vicente J.B. Ehrenkaufer G.M. Saraiva L.M. Teixeira M. Singh U. Entamoeba histolytica modulates a complex repertoire of novel genes in response to oxidative and nitrosative stresses. Implications for amebic pathogenesis.Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The majority of the known factors, including peroxiredoxin, that protect against ROS and RNS are more highly expressed in the virulent strains, but because they are already expressed at robust levels, they do not significantly alter their expression levels in response to stress. This suggests that the virulent strains of E. histolytica utilize transcriptional networks in response to ROS or RNS to regulate the expression of either novel protective factors or factors required in other aspects of increased virulence. Transcriptional regulation remains a poorly understood aspect of E. histolytica biology, and only a few transcription factors and their corresponding DNA binding motifs have been characterized (reviewed in Ref. 24Pearson R.J. Singh U. Approaches to characterizing Entamoeba histolytica transcriptional regulation.Cell Microbiol. 2010; 12: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Of those transcription factors that have been well characterized, most were originally selected due to sequence similarity to known factors, such as EhMyb10 or the EhTBP (25Meneses E. Cárdenas H. Zárate S. Brieba L.G. Orozco E. López-Camarillo C. Azuara-Liceaga E.

However, some unique transcription factors have been successfully identified in E. histolytica; the best characterized of these is URE3-BP, an EF-hand domain-containing protein that is regulated by changes in calcium levels (27Gilchrist C.A.

In this study, we identify a new E. histolytica transcription factor that plays a role in coordinately regulating gene expression in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure. We employed a bioinformatics approach to identify an H2O2-responsive motif (HRM) that was enriched within promoters of genes up-regulated following exposure to stress. Our functional studies demonstrated that this motif specifically binds to an amoebic nuclear protein(s), and mutation of this motif resulted in altered gene expression. We utilized a combined DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry approach to identify the HRM-binding protein (HRM-BP), EHI_108720. This protein specifically interacts with the HRM, and manipulation of HRM-BP expression levels altered basal expression and stress responsiveness of an H2O2-responsive promoter. These data represent the first steps in elucidating the transcriptional network responsible for coordinating changes in gene expression following H2O2 exposure in the important human pathogen E. histolytica. Microarray data using custom-generated arrays from Affymetrix identified 184 genes that are up-regulated in the E. histolytica strain HM-1:IMSS in response to a 1-h exposure to 1 mm H2O2 (2Vicente J.B.

The gene promoters used for this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. The E. histolytica genome was downloaded from Pathema along with the location of all predicted open reading frames (ORFs) (download date, January 8, 2009). This enabled the retrieval of −300 to −1 nucleotide regions relative to the predicted translation start site for each ORF. For each predicted promoter region, sequence was retrieved irrespective of the location of surrounding predicted ORFs. The MEME and MAST programs were used as described previously (29Hackney J.A.

In brief, the MEME and MAST programs were obtained from the University of California San Diego (33Bailey T.L. Elkan C.

Combining evidence using p-values. Application to sequence homology searches.Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). MEME was performed with the command line: -dna -mod zoops -minw 6 -maxw 10 -minsites 5 -nmotfs 20 or -minw 10 -maxw 14. This set of commands identifies 20 motifs that must have zero or one occurrence in each promoter and occur a minimum of five times within the total number of promoters. The motifs found would have a length between 6 and 10 nucleotides or between 10 and 14 nucleotides. The MAST program was utilized to determine the total number of occurrences of each motif in the promoter sequence databases. The command line arguments used for this purpose were as follows: -ev 500 -remcorr. This allows sequences with an e value of less than 500 and examines each pair of motifs and removes motifs that have a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.7. The hypergeometric distribution was used to determine the significance of enrichment for each motif identified. Motifs with a p value of less than 0.01 were determined to be significantly enriched within the promoters of the 57 H2O2-up-regulated genes (supplemental Table 2).

The nuclear pellet was then washed in 500 μl of Buffer A (without IGEPAL), followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 150 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the nuclei were resuspended in 150 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with the same protease inhibitor mixture.

Complementary overlapping probes were designed with the motif of interest centrally located, annealed, and labeled using [α-32P]dATP and Klenow fragment (Invitrogen) as described previously (29Hackney J.A. Ehrenkaufer G.M. Singh U. Identification of putative transcriptional regulatory networks in Entamoeba histolytica using Bayesian inference.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2141-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Binding reactions took place in a total volume of 20 μl and included EMSA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3% glycerol, 0.05% milk powder, and 0.05 mg of bromphenol blue), 5 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 50 fmol of labeled probe. Supershift assays were performed by the addition of 1 μg of either a specific α-Myc antibody (sc-40X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or control α-β-actin antibody (sc-47778X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and competition assays were performed with cold oligonucleotide probes provided in 100-fold excess. The supershift and competition assays required the addition of antibody or competitor to the binding reaction prior to the addition of the labeled probe (30-min room temperature incubation for antibody and 10 min for competitor). Upon the addition of the labeled probe, the final reaction mix was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and samples were loaded onto a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run for 3 h. Upon completion, the gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to a phosphor screen. Gels were imaged using software from Molecular Dynamics. The oligonucleotides used in EMSA (mutations underlined) were as follows: consensus probe, 5′-acgtcagtAAACCTCAATGAAGAcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgTCTTCATTGAGGTTTactg (antisense); mutant 1, 5′-acgtcagtAAACCTCAGATAAAGcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgCTTTATCTGAGGTTTactg (antisense); mutant 2, 5′-acgtcagtCAATCCAAATGAAGAcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgTCTTCATTTGGATTGactg (antisense); mutant 3, 5′-acgtcagtAAACCTAACTGAAGAcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgTCTTCAGTTAGGTTTactg (antisense); mutant 4, 5′-acgtcagtAAACCTCAATGAAGAcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgTCTTCATTGAGTGTTactg (antisense); mutant 5, 5′-acgtcagtAAACCTCAAGTAAGAcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgTCTTACTTGAGGTTTactg (antisense). The EMSA probes used for promoter analysis were as follows: EHI_029340, 5′-acgtcagtAAACCTCAATGTTGAcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgTCAACATTGAGGTTTactg (antisense); EHI_134960, 5′-acgtcagtAAACCTCAATAAACTcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgAGTTTATTGAGGTTTactg (antisense); EHI_176810, 5′-acgtcagtAAACCTCATTGTTCAcagt (sense) and 5′-acgtactgTGAACAATGAGGTTTactg (antisense). Promoter regions of genes EHI_029340, EHI_134960, and EHI_176810 were amplified from E. histolytica HM-1:IMSS genomic DNA using the following primers: EHI_029340, 5′-ACAAAGCTTTCATGTTGAGAATTAAGTGGTTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′- ACACCTAGGTGGTGTTGTGTTTGACATGAAT-3′ (reverse); EHI_134960, 5′-ACAAAGCTTTTCTTAATTAGATTCATGGTTATTC-3′ (forward) and 5′- ACACCTAGGTTTATCACTTTTTTTCATAATGAA-3′ (reverse); EHI_176810, 5′- ACAAAGCTTTTGAGTTATATATTCAAGAAAAGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′- ACACCTAGGAAGTGCATATCTTATCATTTTATG-3′ (reverse). Approximately 500 nucleotides were selected for each promoter region. All reverse primers incorporated the first 15 nucleotides downstream of the start codon for the given gene, which has previously been demonstrated to be important for optimal gene expression in E. histolytica (38Purdy J.E. Mann B.J. Pho L.T. Petri Jr., W.A. Transient transfection of the enteric parasite Entamoeba histolytica and expression of firefly luciferase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to insert the desired mutations into the DNA motif using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). All vectors were sequenced prior to being utilized in functional analyses. Transient transfection of E. histolytica HM-1:IMSS parasites was achieved as follows. Amoebae were plated into a 35-mm tissue culture dish 24 h prior to transfection. Medium was removed, and cells were washed with 4 ml of M199 and then covered with 1.8 ml of M199 plus 15% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was achieved using 10 μg of experimental plasmid DNA and 1 μg of a control Renilla luciferase plasmid, incubated at room temperature for 10 min with 30 μl of SuperFect (Qiagen) in M199 medium to a total volume of 200 μl. This mixture was added dropwise to the amoeba, and dishes were incubated at 36.5 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the dishes were iced for 10 min to release the parasites, and the amoeba were transferred to a standard 16-ml culture tube and resuspended in E. histolytica culture medium. Following a 16 h incubation, transfected amoebae were chilled on ice for 5 min, and the cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min. Luciferase assays were accomplished using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (plus 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm E-64-d, and 1× HALT protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce)) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were vortexed briefly prior to centrifugation (30 s, maximum speed), and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Of each sample, 10 μl was assessed for expression of both firefly and Renilla luciferase, and firefly luciferase results were normalized using the Renilla luciferase readings. Stress was applied by the addition of 1 mm H2O2 to parasites for 1 h prior to isolation of whole cell extracts, which were then processed as described above.

Cysteine proteases contribute to several key processes of pathogenic microbes including host entry, nutrient acquisition and modulation of host immune responses (1Rosenthal P.J.

Cathepsin proteases in Toxoplasma gondii.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2011; 712: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Most cathepsins are members of the papain family Clan CA cysteine proteases. In many eukaryotes including protozoan parasites, papain family cathepsins function classically as globular lysosomal proteases that degrade cellular proteins or proteins endocytosed from the environment (4Hsing L.C. Rudensky A.Y. The lysosomal cysteine proteases in MHC class II antigen presentation.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For example, the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum expresses three cathepsin L-like proteases (falcipain 2a, 2b, and 3) in the food vacuole to digest hemoglobin endocytosed from the host erythrocyte (1Rosenthal P.J.

A fourth cathepsin, falcipain 1, resides in intracellular vesicles and is dispensable for the intraerythrocytic stages (11Eksi S. Czesny B. Greenbaum D.C. Bogyo M. Williamson K.C.

African trypanosome cathepsin B is important for parasite survival probably due to its role in degrading endocytosed host transferrin for iron acquisition (13O'Brien T.C. Mackey Z.B. Fetter R.D.

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligatory intracellular protozoan parasite that can efficiently invade and replicate in many vertebrate hosts leading to a life-long infection (14Montoya J.G. Liesenfeld O. Toxoplasmosis.Lancet. 2004; 363: 1965-1976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). Although the chronic infection is typically contained by the host immune system, it can reactivate in patients with immune dysfunction, causing severe, even fatal, disease (15Fachado A. Fonseca L.

The parasite harbors three specialized secretory organelles named micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules, which discharge their contents sequentially during and after invasion (17Carruthers V.B. Host cell invasion by the opportunistic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii.Acta Trop. 2002; 81: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).

Host cell invasion by the opportunistic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii.Acta Trop. 2002; 81: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Reminiscent of prohormone maturation and secretion, more than half of the known microneme proteins are synthesized as preproproteins that are maturated by endoproteolytic removal of a propeptide before storage and secretion (17Carruthers V.B.

Consistent with it contributing to the microneme pathway, genetic disruption revealed TgCPL as a maturase for at least two microneme proteins, MIC2-associated protein (M2AP) and MIC3 (21Parussini F. Coppens I. Shah P.P. Diamond S.L. Carruthers V.B. Cathepsin L occupies a vacuolar compartment and is a protein maturase within the endo/exocytic system of Toxoplasma gondii.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1340-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Notably, antibodies to TgCPL identified a novel, acidic vacuolar compartment (VAC; also known as a plant-like vacuole or PLV) (21Parussini F. Coppens I. Shah P.P. Diamond S.L. Carruthers V.B. Cathepsin L occupies a vacuolar compartment and is a protein maturase within the endo/exocytic system of Toxoplasma gondii.Mol.

Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1358-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although the VAC was proposed to function in protein degradation, TgCPL is the only protease reported to occupy this organelle. Similar to other cathepsins, the three-dimensional structure of TgCPL indicates that its propeptide occupies the active site as an autoinhibitor until maturation (21Parussini F. Coppens I. Shah P.P. Diamond S.L. Carruthers V.B. Cathepsin L occupies a vacuolar compartment and is a protein maturase within the endo/exocytic system of Toxoplasma gondii.Mol.

TgCPL can self-maturate by removing its own propeptide in vitro, but the extent to which it undergoes self-maturation in vivo has not been reported. Similarly, although TgCPB also exhibits a propeptide and recombinant thioredoxin-proTgCPB can self-maturate in vitro, previous studies suggesting a key role for TgCPB in rhoptry biogenesis and infection did not address its proteolytic maturation in vivo (24Que X.

Here, we show that the intracellular conversion of TgCPB from a zymogen to a mature protease is dependent on TgCPL activity rather than its own proteolytic activity, further expanding the maturase function of TgCPL. We also establish that TgCPB does not reside in the rhoptries as previously reported, and instead it co-localizes with TgCPL in the VAC. Accordingly, genetic ablation of TgCPB showed that its expression is not required for rhoptry protein maturation or rhoptry biogenesis. We also suggest based on expression of a catalytically inert mutant of TgCPL that an additional protease(s) contributes to the in vivo maturation of TgCPL beside itself. Collectively, our findings indicate that TgCPL activates and coexists with at least one additional cathepsin protease in the VAC, further underscoring the putative digestive function of this endolysosomal organelle.

A 1.6-kb DNA fragment encoding recombinant proform TgCPB (rproTgCPB) was PCR-amplified from a T. gondii RH cDNA library with primers CPBstreptagNdeIFwd and CPBpropepXhoIRev (supplemental Table S1) using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The forward and reverse primers encode strep-tactin and hexahistidine tags, respectively. The product was gel-extracted, purified, and ligated into pET22b(+). The resulting pET22b(+)-Strep-Tactin-proTgCPB-His6 expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain Origami(DE3). Clones were identified by NdeI and XhoI digestion and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacteria were grown in 1 liter of LB at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.7, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h and harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was lysed in CelLyticTM B cell lysis buffer (Sigma) containing 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. Bacterial DNA was fragmented by ultrasonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer, incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C, washed with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF), and recovered in 10 2-ml fractions with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1 m imidazole, 1 mm PMSF). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that ∼50% of the protein had undergone self-cleavage on the column, creating mature rTgCPB. Fractions were pooled, and buffer was exchanged with PBS buffer using Amicon® Ultra 30-kDa cutoff concentrators (Millipore). Mature rTgCPB was further purified by absorbing the contaminating immature rTgCPB onto a 0.5-ml column of Strep· TactinTM Superflow-agarose beads (Novagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Mature rTgCPB was recovered in the flow-through after adding 5 bed volumes of wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF). The purified product (∼90% homogeneous) was PBS buffer exchanged and concentrated as above and stored at −20 °C. A 745-bp product encoding the propeptide of TgCPB was PCR-amplified using primers CPB-GST_103_BamHI_F and CPB-GST_819_XhoI_R and cloned into pGEX-4T3, creating an N-terminal fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The GST-TgCPB propeptide construct was transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for growth, induction, and cell lysis under native conditions as above. The cleared supernatant was mixed with 3 ml of GST·BindTM resin (Novagen), incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT), washed with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3) and eluted in 6 1.5-ml fractions of wash buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Fractions containing proTgCPB propeptide were pooled, and PBS buffer was exchanged, concentrated, and stored at −20 °C. A QuikChangeTM II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create a C31A mutation in the TgCPL expression plasmid, pQE30/100TgCPL (23Larson E.T. Parussini F. Huynh M.H. Giebel J.D.

Purified mature rTgCPB or the propeptide of TgCPB were used to immunize mice to generate polyclonal antibodies. Mice were injected with 50 μg of purified recombinant protein in Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted 3 times at 2-week intervals with 50 μg of recombinant protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The specificity of polyclonal antibodies was assessed by comparing their reactivity in RHΔku80 and RHΔku80Δcpb parasites by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assay. Genomic flanking sequences of TgCPL, TgCPB, and TgM2AP were obtained from the ToxoDB database (27Gajria B. Bahl A. Brestelli J. Dommer J. Fischer S. Gao X. Heiges M. Iodice J. Kissinger J.C.

Primers CPB.-3031(KpnI).F, CPB.-27(HindIII).R, CPB.5125(BamHI).F, and CPB.8138(XbaI).R were used to amplify ∼3 kb of 5′ and 3′ DNA sequences flanking TgCPB gene. The DNA fragments were digested with restriction endonucleases and cloned upstream and downstream of the chloramphenicol resistance gene (CAT) in pTubCATSag1. The resulting TgCPB knock-out construct was electroporated into RHΔku80 tachyzoites using previously described parameters (28Brydges S.D. Harper J.M. Parussini F. Coppens I. Carruthers V.B. A transient forward-targeting element for microneme-regulated secretion in Toxoplasma gondii.Biol. Cell. 2008; 100: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Clones were screened by PCR to confirm correct integration of the knock-out construct at the TgCPB locus using the oligonucleotides shown in Fig. 2A: CPB.5Flank.-3573.F (P1), pTubpromBglII.R (P2), CAT.500.F (P3), and CPB.3Flank.+3128.R (P4). Three pairs of primers (CPLcompSacIF and CPLcompSacIIR, CPLcompSacIIF and CPLcompNotIR, and CPLcompNotIF and CPLcompXbaIR) were used to amplify ∼1 kb of 5′ flanking sequence of TgCPL, ∼1.3 kb of TgCPL cDNA, and ∼1.4 kb of 3′ flanking region of TgM2AP, respectively. These PCR products were digested with enzymes depicted in the primer names and ligated into pTubCATSag1. The catalytically inert version of the TgCPL complementation construct was created by a single point mutation within the codon encoding the key cysteine residue within the active site to alanine using primers CPLCys31DelF and CPLCys31DelR and a QuikChangeTM II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The TgCPL WT and catalytically inert complementation constructs were introduced into RHΔku80Δcpl parasites by electroporation. Clones were screened for the presence of TgCPL expression by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assay. TgCPB genetic complementation plasmids were created using a combination of fusion PCR and conventional cloning. Briefly, 1 kb of TgCPB genomic 5′-flanking region was PCR-amplified from RH genomic DNA using primers CPB_F1 and CPB_R3_FusPcDNA. The TgCPB ORF was PCR-amplified from an RH cDNA library 3V. B. Carruthers, unpublished information. using primers CPB_F3_Fus_PrcDNA and CPB_R1. The two PCR products were gel-purified, mixed, and amplified as a fusion PCR product using primers CPB_F2_ApaI and CPB_R2_NdeI. This fusion product was gel-purified and cloned into pET15b digested with ApaI and NdeI. The resulting plasmid was digested with NdeI and ClaI to receive the TgCPB genomic 3′-flanking region amplified from RH genomic DNA using primers 3UTR_CPB_Fwd_NdeI and 3UTR_CPB_Rev_ClaI. The phleomycin resistance cassette was further introduced into the ApaI and HpaI restriction sites. The catalytically inert TgCPB complementation construct was created by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic cysteine (Cys30, numbered from the predicted mature N terminus; see also Fig. 2G) to alanine using primers TgCPB_cysDel_F and TgCPB_cysDel_R. Constructs were electroporated into RHΔku80Δcpb parasites. Stable populations were obtained after two rounds of selection with phleomycin. TgCPB expression was verified by immunoblotting, and the WT sequence and C30A mutation were confirmed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Samples were prepared in 100 °C SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min before resolving on 10% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and semidry-transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were blocked with skim milk and incubated with primary antibodies. Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as the secondary antibody. Immunoblots were developed with SuperSignalTM West Pico chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (19Harper J.M. Huynh M.H. Coppens I. Parussini F. Moreno S. Carruthers V.B.

Fresh lysed tachyzoites were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold Met/Cys-free DMEM medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1% FBS and 2 mm l-glutamine. Parasites were prewarmed at 37 °C for 3 min before pulsed-labeling with 500 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys for 15 min and chasing in unlabeled medium with 5 mm methionine, 5 mm cysteine at 37 °C at 20-min intervals for 1 h.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at RT. Polyclonal antibodies against TgROP2–4 were incubated with cell lysate for 1 h at RT with gentle shaking. Twenty microliters of 25% (v/v) slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads were added to precipitate antigen-antibody complexes.

We reported previously that IGF1 directly binds to αvβ3 and induces αvβ3-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation in these conditions. The integrin-binding defective IGF1 mutant (R36E/R37E) is defective in inducing ternary complex formation and IGF signaling, whereas it still binds to IGF1R. We studied if IGF1 can induce signaling in anchorage-independent conditions in transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells that express αvβ3 (β3-CHO) cells.

IGF1 acts through binding to the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R), a receptor tyrosine kinase. Ligand binding induces phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues of IGF1R. These phosphotyrosines then bind to adaptor molecules such as Shc and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1. Phosphorylation of these proteins leads to activation of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways (1Clemmons D.R. Maile L.A.

IGF1 has been implicated in cancer progression (2Clemmons D.R. Modifying IGF1 activity. An approach to treat endocrine disorders, atherosclerosis and cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). IGF1 is involved in cell growth and consequently IGF1 inhibition is being pursued as a potential measure for treating and preventing cancer. Many cancer cells secrete abnormally high levels of IGF1. Once released by cancer cells, IGF1 binds and activates IGF1R on their surface. This autocrine receptor activation causes the release of intracellular signals that are strongly anti-apoptotic, notably through their ability to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. Thereby IGF1 confers resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Several strategies to target IGF1 signaling have been developed, including siRNA and monoclonal antibodies for IGF1R and kinase inhibitors to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the receptor (2Clemmons D.R. Modifying IGF1 activity. An approach to treat endocrine disorders, atherosclerosis and cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It has been well established that integrin αvβ3 plays a critical role in regulating IGF1 signaling (2Clemmons D.R. Modifying IGF1 activity. An approach to treat endocrine disorders, atherosclerosis and cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In a current model, “ligand occupancy” of αvβ3 (i.e. the binding of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as vitronectin to αvβ3) enhances signaling induced by IGF1 binding to IGF1R (2Clemmons D.R. Modifying IGF1 activity. An approach to treat endocrine disorders, atherosclerosis and cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Indeed, antagonists to αvβ3 block IGF1 signaling. Anti-αvβ3 mAb and echistatin, a snake venom disintegrin that specifically inhibits αvβ3, blocks IGF1-induced cell migration (3Jones J.I. Doerr M.E. Clemmons D.R. Cell migration. Interactions among integrins, IGFs and IGFBPs.Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 319-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Also, echistatin blocks IGF1-stimulated DNA synthesis and IRS-1 phosphorylation and attenuates IGF1R-linked downstream signaling events, such as activation of PI3K and ERK1/2 (4Zheng B. Duan C. Clemmons D.R. The effect of extracellular matrix proteins on porcine smooth muscle cell insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein-5 synthesis and responsiveness to IGF-I.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8994-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We discovered recently that IGF1 directly and specifically binds to αvβ3 and generated an integrin-binding defective mutant (R36E/R37E) of IGF1 (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 24106-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). R36E/R37E is defective in inducing cell survival and in inducing IGF signaling, although the mutant still binds to IGF1R (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The direct binding of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to integrin αVβ3 is involved in IGF-1 signaling.J. Biol.

This suggests that the direct binding of integrins to IGF1 is critical for IGF signaling and a potential mechanism of IGF1R-integrin cross-talk. These findings are not consistent with the current model as described above, in which αvβ3-ECM interaction plays a major role in IGF signaling (2Clemmons D.R. Modifying IGF1 activity. An approach to treat endocrine disorders, atherosclerosis and cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether αvβ3-ECM ligand interaction or αvβ3-IGF interaction is related to cancer progression.

Also, we do not know the role of the ternary complex formation (αvβ3, IGF1, and IGF1R) induced by WT IGF1 in IGF1R activation. In this study, we studied whether IGF1 can induce signaling in anchorage-independent conditions in transformed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express human β3 (β3-CHO) cells. We describe that IGF1 signals were more clearly detectable in anchorage-independent conditions (in polyHEMA-coated plates) than in anchorage-dependent conditions (in regular tissue culture plates). This suggests that IGF signaling is masked by signals from cell-matrix interaction in anchorage-dependent conditions. IGF signaling required αvβ3 expression, and R36E/R37E was defective in inducing signals in anchorage-independent conditions. These results suggest that αvβ3-IGF1 interaction, not cell-matrix interaction, is essential for IGF signaling. We also asked whether IGF1-induced phosphorylation of IGF1R and downstream signaling pathways and/or β3 is required for the ternary complex formation. We used anchorage-independent conditions for studying the role of αvβ3 in IGF signaling because αvβ3-ECM interaction itself may induce β3 phosphorylation. Notably, inhibitors of IGF1R (PPP), Src (PP2), PI3K (LY294002), or ERK1/2 (PD098059) did not suppress αvβ3-IGF-IGF1R ternary complex formation, suggesting that activation of these kinases is not required for ternary complex formation. Also, mutations of the β3 cytoplasmic tail (Y747F and Y759F) that block β3 tyrosine phosphorylation did not affect IGF1R phosphorylation or AKT activation. Thus it appears that β3 phosphorylation is not required for ternary complex formation in anchorage-independent conditions. We propose a model, in which IGF1 binding to IGF1R induces recruitment of integrin αvβ3 to the IGF-IGF1R complex, and then β3 and IGF1R are phosphorylated. It is likely that αvβ3 should be together with the IGF1-IGF1R complex for triggering IGF signaling. Recombinant wt and R36E/R37E IGF1 were synthesized as described (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K.

DNA synthesis was measured by BrdU assays (cell proliferation ELISA kit (Roche)). β1-CHO cells or β3-CHO cells were plated in regular tissue culture plates (5000 cells/well) and serum-starved in DMEM at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence of WT IGF1. Cells were then incubated with BrdU for 2 h. After removing the labeling medium, the cells were fixed, and the DNA was denatured in one step by adding FixDenat (fixative). Incorporated BrdU was measured by using peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrDU antibody and tetramethyl-benzidine at 370 nm. In polyHEMA-coated plates, β1-CHO cells or β3-CHO cells were plated in polyHEMA-coated plates (20,000 cells/well) and serum-starved in DMEM at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence of WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E. Cells were then incubated with BrdU for 2 h. The cells were transferred to regular tissue culture plates, centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min, and the labeling medium was removed. The cells were dried using a hair dryer for 15 min and fixed with FixDenat. Incorporated BrdU was measured as described above. We cultured β1-CHO or β3-CHO cells in regular tissue culture to near confluence in DMEM with 10% FCS and then serum-starved them in DMEM without FCS overnight. We stimulated the starved cells with WT and/or R36E/R37E IGF1 for 10–20 min. We solubilized cells in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)). We analyzed cell lysates by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Bound IgG was detected using HRP-conjugated second antibody and Super Signal WestPico (Thermo Scientific). We analyzed the images using a Fuji LAS 4000 mini luminescent image analyzer and Multi Gauge v.3.0 software (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). PolyHEMA-coated plates were prepared as described (11Fukazawa H.

In polyHEMA-coated plates, we performed signaling assays as described above, except that we serum-starved them for 3 h in DMEM without FCS. We stimulated the starved cells with WT or R36E/R37E IGF1 for 5 to 30 min. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with PPP (10 μm) or PP2 (10 μm) for 60 min.

To detect the expression of IGF1 (6-His-tagged) from the cells that stably express WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E, cells were cultured with DMEM with 10% FCS. The culture medium was concentrated five times and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-6-His antibodies (IGF1 has an N-terminal 6-His tag). The Tyr-747- or Tyr-759-to-Phe mutants (the Y747F or Y759F mutants) of β3 were generated by quick-change mutagenesis. These β3 mutant expression constructs were transfected into CHO cells together with a neomycin-resistant plasmid using FuGENE (Promega). After selection with G418 cells stably expressing mutant β3 integrin were further enriched by limited dilution to obtain about 80% positive populations. Soft agar colony formation assays were performed as described previously (13Stephenson J.R. Axelrad A.A. McLeod D.L. Shreeve M.M. Induction of colonies of hemoglobin-synthesizing cells by erythropoietin in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1971; 68: 1542-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We cultured cells to near confluence in DMEM with 10% FCS and then serum-starved them in DMEM with 0.4% FCS overnight. We suspended starved cells (5 × 104 cells) in DMEM with 0.4% FCS containing 0.3% agar and layered them on a bottom layer of DMEM with 0.4% FCS containing 1.0% agar. We overlaid DMEM with 10% FCS and cultured cells for 3 weeks at 37 °C. We replaced the medium twice a week. We determined the number of the colonies from the digital images of colonies using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software. β3-CHO cells were cultured to be nearly confluent in DMEM/10% FCS. Cells were plated in polyHEMA-coated plates and serum-starved in DMEM for 3 h or plated in regular tissue culture plates and serum-starved in DMEM for 12 h. The cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E for 30 min. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with PPP (10 μm), PP2 (10 μm), PD098059 (50 μm), or LY294002 (50 μm) for 60 min. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-integrin β3 antibody or anti-IGF1R antibody overnight at 4 °C, and the immune complex was recovered by incubating with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors). The immunoprecipitated materials were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-IGF1R antibody or anti-integrin β3 antibody. MTS assays (14Ieguchi K. Fujita M. Ma Z. Davari P. Taniguchi Y. Sekiguchi K.

IGF1 directly binds to integrin αvβ3 and induces integrin-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation in non-transformed cells in anchorage-dependent conditions (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y.

These findings suggest that αvβ3-IGF1 interaction is critical for IGF signaling (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y.

Crosstalk between integrin and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in breast carcinoma progression.BMB Rep. 2010; 43: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). αvβ3 is a receptor for many ECM and non-ECM ligands. Previous studies used non-transformed cells (e.g. smooth muscle cells) as a model of IGF signaling in anchorage-dependent conditions in which cells attach to ECM. IGF signaling in anchorage-independent conditions has not been studied. We thus studied CHO cells (ovarian cancer cells) that overexpress αvβ3 (β3-CHO cells) to identify the role of αvβ3-ECM in IGF signaling. In anchorage-dependent conditions (regular tissue culture plates without an ECM coating), we found that IGF1 induced a slightly higher cell survival (Fig. 1a) and cell proliferation (b) in β3-CHO cells than that of control CHO cells that express human β1 (β1-CHO cells), and there was only small enhancement in ERK1/2 and AKT activation between β3- and β1-CHO cells (c). Although the enhancement in IGF1-induced cell survival and proliferation in β3-CHO cells is small, we showed that anti-β3 mAb (7E3) suppressed it (Fig. 1, d and e), suggesting that IGF1-induced cell survival and proliferation in anchorage-dependent condition is αvβ3-dependent. We used polyHEMA-coated plates to suppress cell matrix adhesion (anchorage independence) (11Fukazawa H. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. A microplate assay for quantitation of anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells.Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Folkman J. Moscona A. Role of cell shape in growth control.Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). In anchorage-independent conditions, WT IGF1 enhanced cell survival (Fig. 2a) in β3-CHO cells to much higher levels than in β1-CHO cells that responded to IGF1 only weakly. Also, IGF1-induced cell proliferation of β3-CHO cells was slightly higher than in anchorage-dependent conditions (Fig. 2b). In these conditions, WT IGF1 induced ERK1/2 and AKT activation in β3-CHO cells, whereas WT IGF1 induced only weak ERK1/2 and AKT activation and the signals quickly reduced in β1-CHO cells (Fig. 2c). Anti-β3 mAb 7E3 suppressed the enhanced cell survival and proliferation of β3-CHO cells induced by WT IGF1 in anchorage-dependent conditions (Fig. 2, d and e). These results suggest that enhanced IGF signaling in β3-CHO in anchorage-independent conditions is dependent on αvβ3. Our results suggest that IGF signaling in anchorage-dependent conditions is masked by cell matrix interaction in CHO cells. This is consistent with a previous report that cell matrix adhesion masks heparin-binding EGF signaling in cancer cells (21Mizushima H. Wang X. Miyamoto S. Mekada E. Integrin signal masks growth-promotion activity of HB-EGF in monolayer cell cultures.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 4277-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We reported previously that R36E/R37E is defective in enhancing cell survival and inducing phosphorylation of IGF1R, β3, AKT, and ERK1/2 and in ternary complex formation in non-transformed cells in anchorage-dependent conditions (5Saegusa J. Yamaji S. Ieguchi K. Wu C.Y. Lam K.S. Liu F.T. Takada Y.K. Takada Y. The direct binding of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to integrin αVβ3 is involved in IGF-1 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24106-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We studied whether R36E/R37E is defective in these functions in anchorage-independent conditions. In polyHEMA-coated plates, R36E/R37E was defective in enhancing cell survival (Fig. 3a); cell proliferation (b); and inducing phosphorylation of IGF1R, β3, AKT, and ERK1/2 (c) in β3-CHO cells. Also, WT IGF1 induced coprecipitation of IGF1R and integrin β3 in β3-CHO cells, whereas R36E/R37E was much less effective in this function (Fig. 3d). These findings suggest that integrin αvβ3-IGF1 interaction is involved in IGF signaling in anchorage-independent conditions. This suggests that the ternary complex formation through direct αvβ3-binding to IGF1 is critical for IGF signaling in β3-CHO cells. Therefore it is expected that αvβ3-IGF1 interaction, but not αvβ3-ECM interaction, is critical for IGF signaling. Interestingly, we obtained essentially the same results in IGF1-induced ternary complex formation in anchorage-dependent conditions (Fig. 3d). This suggests that the ternary complex formation through direct αvβ3-binding to IGF1 is involved in IGF signaling in β3-CHO cells in anchorage-dependent conditions as well. We stably expressed WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E in β3-CHO or CHO cells in the pSec-TagB secretion vector. Transfected cells secrete WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E at comparable levels (Fig. 4a). We first determined the survival of cells stably secreting WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E in polyHEMA-coated plates. WT IGF1 or R36E/R37E expression did not affect the survival of CHO cells (Fig. 4b). In contrast, WT IGF1 markedly enhanced cell survival of β3-CHO cells, whereas R36E/R37E did not (Fig. 4c), suggesting that IGF1 enhanced cell survival of β3-CHO cells requires αvβ3 expression and αvβ3-IGF1 interaction in anchorage-independent conditions. These results are consistent with the results with exogenous IGF1 (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). We studied whether IGF1 affects colony formation in three-dimensional culture, which mimics in vivo tumorigenesis, using CHO or β3-CHO cells that express WT and mutant IGF1. The cells were cultured in soft agar for 3 weeks, and the number of colonies was counted. We found that WT IGF1 had no effect in CHO cells (Fig. 4d) but markedly enhanced colony formation in β3-CHO cells (e). R36E/R37E did not enhance colony formation in β3-CHO or CHO cells. These findings suggest that the enhancing effect of WT IGF1 requires αvβ3 expression and direct αvβ3-IGF1 interaction in three-dimensional culture. Taken together, our results are consistent with the model in which IGF1-αvβ3 interaction, rather than αvβ3-ECM interaction, is required for IGF signaling. Our results so far suggest that IGF signaling d"
https://openalex.org/W2081095918,"Hypoxia is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression in numerous carcinomas. Responses to hypoxia are thought to operate via hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), but the importance of co-factors that regulate HIF signaling within tumors is not well understood. Here, we elucidate a signaling pathway that physically and functionally couples tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin to HIF1α signaling and HIF1α-mediated tumor EMT. Primary human lung adenocarcinomas accumulate pY654-β-catenin and HIF1α. All pY654-β-catenin, and only the tyrosine phosphorylated form, was found complexed with HIF1α and active Src, both within the human tumors and in lung tumor cell lines exposed to hypoxia. Phosphorylation of Y654, generated by hypoxia mediated, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent Src kinase activation, was required for β-catenin to interact with HIF1α and Src, to promote HIF1α transcriptional activity, and for hypoxia-induced EMT. Mice bearing hypoxic pancreatic islet adenomas, generated by treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, accumulate HIF1α/pY654-β-catenin complexes and develop an invasive phenotype. Concurrent administration of the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine abrogated β-catenin/HIF pathway activity and restored adenoma architecture. Collectively, the findings implicate accumulation of pY654-β-catenin specifically complexed to HIF1α and Src kinase as critically involved in HIF1α signaling and tumor invasion. The findings also suggest that targeting ROS-dependent aspects of the pY654-β-catenin/ HIF1α pathway may attenuate untoward biological effects of anti-angiogenic agents and tumor hypoxia."

Ag85 is not only considered to be a virulence factor because its expression is essential for intracellular survival within macrophages, but also because it contributes to adherence, invasion, and dissemination of mycobacteria in host cells. In this study, we report that the extracellular matrix components, elastin and its precursor (tropoelastin) derived from human aorta, lung, and skin, serve as binding partners of Ag85 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The binding affinity of M. tuberculosis Ag85 to human tropoelastin was characterized (K(D) = 0.13 ± 0.006 μm), and a novel Ag85-binding motif, AAAKAA(K/Q)(Y/F), on multiple tropoelastin modules was identified. In addition, the negatively charged Glu-258 of Ag85 was demonstrated to participate in an electrostatic interaction with human tropoelastin. Moreover, binding of Ag85 on elastin siRNA-transfected Caco-2 cells was significantly reduced (34.3%), implying that elastin acts as an important ligand contributing to mycobacterial invasion."

https://openalex.org/W2002979776,"c-Myc transformed human Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells are highly sensitive to TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Previously we demonstrated that TGF-β-mediated cell death in BL cells is regulated via the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis pathway, which is dependent on the activation of BAX and/or BAK. TGF-β directly induces transcription of the BH3-only protein BIK and represses expression of the pro-survival factor BCL-XL but has no effect on the direct BAX/BAK “activators” BIM or BID (tBID). Here we show that TGF-β induces the BH3-only activator PUMA to aid induction of the intrinsic cell death pathway. TGF-β also induced PUMA in normal germinal center CD77-positive centroblasts isolated from human tonsil tissue. PUMA was a direct TGF-β target gene in B-cells, and we identify a putative Smad-binding region within the human PUMA promoter that recruits Smad3 and Smad4 in cells in response to TGF-β signaling. Constitutive activity of the isolated Smad-binding region in luciferase reporter assays was dependent on Smad consensus sequences and was partially dependent on endogenous TGF-β signaling and Smad4. Knockdown of PUMA in BL cells using lentiviral shRNA resulted in slower kinetics of the TGF-β-mediated apoptotic response. Analysis of Eμ-Myc cell lines demonstrated that c-myc-driven murine lymphomas are also sensitive to TGF-β-mediated apoptosis.

Previously, a mutant with enhanced binding to unphosphorylated active rhodopsin (Rh*) was shown to partially compensate for lack of rhodopsin phosphorylation in vivo. Here we showed that reengineering of the receptor binding surface of arrestin-1 further improves the binding to Rh* while preserving protein stability. In mammals, arrestin-1 readily self-associates at physiological concentrations. The biological role of this phenomenon can only be elucidated by replacing wild type arrestin-1 in living animals with a non-oligomerizing mutant retaining all other functions. We demonstrate that constitutively monomeric forms of arrestin-1 are sufficiently stable for in vivo expression. We also tested the idea that individual functions of arrestin-1 can be independently manipulated to generate mutants with the desired combinations of functional characteristics. Here we showed that this approach is feasible; stable forms of arrestin-1 with high Rh* binding can be generated with or without the ability to self-associate.

These features require biochemically perfect signaling cascade with virtually no noise, enormous amplification, and extremely rapid shutoff. Light activates rhodopsin, which then sequentially catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on numerous molecules of its cognate G protein transducin (5Burns M.E. Baylor D.A.

Although in principle loss-of-function mutations can be cured by gene replacement therapy, in the case of gain-of-function defects, such as the loss of phosphorylation sites resulting in unquenchable signaling, viable therapeutic strategies remain to be developed. We have recently proposed a compensational approach using enhanced arrestin-1 mutant that binds Rh* with much higher affinity than wild type (WT) arrestin-1 to reduce excessive signaling by unphosphorylated rhodopsin (11Song X.

Although, the first proof-of-principle study showed that compensational gene therapy works in vivo, it also revealed the limitations of existing phosphorylation-independent arrestin-1 mutants (11Song X.

Enhanced arrestin-1 improved functional performance of phosphorylation-deficient rods, facilitated their recovery, and prolonged their survival, but “compensated” shutoff was still significantly slower than in WT animals with normal Rh* phosphorylation (11Song X.

Arrestin-1 is the only signaling protein in the visual system that forms inactive “storage” oligomers, and the biological significance of this phenomenon is unclear (20Gurevich V.V. Hanson S.M.

To elucidate the role of arrestin-1 self-association in photoreceptors, the consequences of the replacement of WT arrestin-1 with a constitutively monomeric mutant in vivo must be determined. In addition, it is unknown whether oligomerization needs to be preserved in a therapeutically effective enhanced mutant with high Rh* affinity. These in vivo experiments require a stable constitutively monomeric version of arrestin-1 as well as enhanced mutants both with normal and absent ability to oligomerize. Here we report extensive redesign of the rhodopsin binding surface of arrestin-1 that yielded mutants with significantly higher affinity for unphosphorylated Rh*. We identified further enhanced arrestins, constitutively monomeric forms, and a mutant that combines inability to self-associate with high Rh* binding, all of which are stable. These proteins are promising candidates for in vivo evaluation of the potential of compensational gene therapy and for elucidation of the role of arrestin-1 oligomerization.

Briefly, 1 nm arrestin-1 (50 fmol) was incubated with 0.3 μg of P-Rh* in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT for 5 min at 37 °C under room light. Samples were cooled on ice, and bound and free arrestin-1 was separated at 4 °C by gel filtration on a 2-ml column of Sepharose 2B-CL. Arrestin-1 eluting with rhodopsin-containing membranes was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific “binding” was determined in samples where rhodopsin was omitted and subtracted. Translated radiolabeled arrestin-1 was incubated for 0.5–4 h at the indicated temperatures and cooled on ice. The binding of arrestin-1 in these samples to P-Rh* was compared with that of control sample kept on ice as described above except that 2 nm arrestin-1 (100 fmol/sample) was used. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum as described (28Breitman M. Kook S. Gimenez L.E. Lizama B.N. Palazzo M.C. Gurevich E.V. Gurevich V.V.

Cells were transfected with 3 μg of DNA per well of a 6-well plate using Lipofectamine according to manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h cells were serum-starved overnight and then kept at 37 °C (control) or at 40 °C for 3 h. Cells were washed with PBS and non-enzymatically detached from plates with 2 × 500 μl of Versene. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 300 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge 5417R) and resuspended in 400 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm PMSF. Cells were lysed by sonication (Sonic Dismembrator Model 500, Fisher Scientific) 3 × 5 s at 30% power. Unbroken cells and debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 14,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge 5417R), and the supernatant was frozen in aliquots and stored at −80 °C until used. Total protein was measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and the expression of different forms of arrestin-1 was determined by Western blot with anti-arrestin rabbit polyclonal antibody (14Song X.

To determine functionality of soluble arrestins, equal volumes of lysates (10 μl) were incubated with or without (nonspecific) 1 μg of P-Rh* in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT for 5 min at 37 °C in room light. The samples were cooled on ice, loaded onto 0.1 ml of 0.2 m sucrose in binding buffer, and centrifuged 20 min at 100,000 rpm in Beckman TL-120 tabletop ultracentrifuge (rotor TLA120.1). Supernatants were removed, and pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. One-tenth of each sample along with one-tenth of the input were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-arrestin antibody (14Song X. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Seo J. Chen J.

Nonspecific binding (the amount of arrestin-1 pelleted in the absence of rhodopsin, likely due to aggregation, was subtracted from binding to P-Rh*. Protein survival was calculated as the ratio of the fraction of arrestin-1 in lysate of cells incubated at 40 °C that specifically bound to P-Rh* to the bound fraction in lysates of control cells kept at 37 °C. Mouse arrestin-1 mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified essentially as described (29Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Arrestin. Mutagenesis, expression, purification, and functional characterization.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All light-scattering measurements were made with a DAWN EOS detector coupled to an Optilab T-rEX refractometer (Wyatt Technologies) after gel filtration on a QC-PAK GFC 300 column (7.8 mm inner diameter × 15 cm) (Tosoh Bioscience). The arrestin samples (100 μl) at different concentrations were incubated in fresh 5 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature to disrupt covalent inter-arrestin disulfide bonds and injected onto the column at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min in 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. The column did not resolve oligomeric species but simply acted as a filter to remove highly scattering particulates. Light scattering at 7 angles (72–126°), absorbance at 280 nm, and refractive index (at 658 nm) for each sample were taken for a narrow slice centered at the peak of the elution profile (18Hanson S.M.

The experimental weight-averaged molecular weight values were obtained from the protein concentration and light scattering data using ASTRA 5.3.4.20 software (Wyatt Technologies). The weight-averaged molecular weight data were analyzed using the two-step monomer-dimer-tetramer (MDT) model, 2M⟶KdimD2D⟷KμlTREACTION 1 where M, D, and T are monomer, dimer, and tetramer, respectively. The data for arrestin-1 carrying F86A/F198A mutations did not fit the MDT model and was fitted using the monomer-dimer model instead. Details of the analysis have been previously described (30Hanson S.M. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hubbell W.L. Gurevich V.V.

Except where noted, the equilibrium constants are given in terms of the corresponding dissociation constants, KD,dimer (KD,dim) and KD,tetramer (KD,tet). The errors in equilibrium constants were determined from least-squares fitting of the data to MDT or monomer-dimer model taking into account an estimated error of ± 1 kDa in the computed values of the average molecular weight (70Kim M.

The first enhanced arrestin-1 mutant used in vivo to compensate for the defect in rhodopsin phosphorylation was preactivated simply by the elimination of one of the conformational constraints that holds arrestin-1 in its basal state (11Song X.

Triple alanine substitution of the bulky hydrophobic residues anchoring the C-tail (yielding arrestin-1-3A mutant) promotes its detachment, thereby facilitating arrestin-1 transition into a high affinity rhodopsin binding state and arrestin-1 binding to Rh* (31Gurevich V.V.

The replacement of WT arrestin-1 in GRK1-deficient mice with the arrestin-1-3A mutant resulted in an ∼3-fold acceleration of Rh* shutoff but did not bring the recovery rate to the WT level (11Song X.

Mouse arrestin-1 also carries all of these positive charges: Lys-15, Lys-16, Arg-19, Lys-164, Lys-167, Lys-168, Arg-172, and Arg-176. Therefore, we hypothesized that a mismatch between the presence of these positive charges on the receptor binding surface of arrestin-1 and the absence of negatively charged phosphates on the C terminus of Rh* destabilized the complex. To test this idea, we replaced phosphate binding lysines and arginines (Fig. 1A) with neutral hydrophilic glutamine with hydrogen-bonding capability, introducing K15Q, K16Q, R19Q, R172Q, K164Q, K167Q, and K168Q mutations. Although R176E mutation per se in mouse arrestin-1 significantly increases the binding to Rh*, it was not introduced because previously we found that it greatly reduces protein stability (11Song X.

As expected, on both backgrounds, mutations eliminating phosphate binding charges significantly reduced arrestin-1 ability to interact with dark P-Rh (Fig. 1). Combinations K15Q/K16Q and K15Q/K16Q/R19Q also reduced the binding to P-Rh*, but only R172Q mutation marginally enhanced Rh* binding (Fig. 1, B, C, and D). These data suggest that the presence of phosphate binding-positive charges is not the main factor destabilizing the complex of enhanced arrestin-1 with Rh*.

In the structure of MalFGK2 without ligands, the sites for ATP binding on the MalK dimer are separated, and the MalFG membrane domain forms a cavity that is exposed to the cytosol (inward facing state) (8Khare D.

Cell. 2009; 33: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the structure obtained in the presence of MalE and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, the ATP-binding sites are bound together, whereas the MalFG cavity opens toward the periplasm (outward facing state) (6Oldham M.L.

Together, these snapshots of the transporter structure have provided the molecular framework to explain how ATP binding and hydrolysis is coupled to membrane transport, the so-called alternating access mechanism. However, what triggers the transport reaction, why MalE stimulates ATP hydrolysis even in the absence of maltose, and how maltose is transferred from MalE to MalFG remain unclear. MalE consists of two lobes with the maltose-binding site located at the interface. When the sugar binds, the two lobes close and eventually capture maltose with a high affinity (conformation termed closed liganded MalE) (10Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y. Quiocho F.A.

Because the ATPase activity of the transporter is maximal only in the presence of MalE and maltose, it has been proposed that closed liganded MalE binds the transporter and triggers ATP hydrolysis (12Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Mechanism of maltose transport in Escherichia coli. Transmembrane signaling by periplasmic binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Davidson A.L. Mechanism of coupling of transport to hydrolysis in bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporters.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures were interpreted with this assumption in mind, leading to the model in Fig. 1A (2Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Structure, function, and evolution of bacterial ATP-binding cassette systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). In that model, the binding of closed liganded MalE to the transporter induces the pairing of MalK. The pairing of MalK triggers the MalFG outward facing conformation, which in turn forces the opening of MalE and the release of maltose. Upon ATP hydrolysis, the transporter returns to the inward facing state, and maltose enters the cytosol. In support of the model, an EPR spectroscopy study reported that the MalK nucleotide-binding interface closes only in the presence of MalE and ATP (14Orelle C. Ayvaz T. Everly R.M. Klug C.S. Davidson A.L. Both maltose-binding protein and ATP are required for nucleotide-binding domain closure in the intact maltose ABC transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A partial closure of the MalK interface was also observed when MalFGK2 was co-crystallized with closed liganded MalE. It was concluded that MalE facilitates the pairing of MalK and therefore hydrolysis of ATP (15Oldham M.L. Chen J. Crystal structure of the maltose transporter in a pretranslocation intermediate state.Science. 2011; 332: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, despite the evidence and the prevalence of the model, we recently reported that closed liganded MalE does not bind the transporter but dissociates when MalE captures maltose. We also reported that open state MalE binds with nanomolar affinity to the outward facing transporter and creates a low affinity receptor for maltose (16Bao H. Duong F. Discovery of an auto-regulation mechanism for the maltose ABC transporter MalFGK2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e34836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These data, difficult to reconciliate with the former model, led us to propose a new model (Fig. 1B and legend for details about the binding affinities). Here, we further investigate the effect of MalE, maltose, and ATP on the conformation of MalFGK2. Indeed, an important and central question is the mechanism leading to the outward facing conformation. The transition depends on MalE and maltose in the former model, but not in the newer model. Using cross-linking, co-sedimentation analysis, native gels, and fluorescence assays, we show that MalE and closed liganded MalE do not facilitate the closure of MalK dimer, nor the transition of MalFG to the outward facing state. Instead, we find that ATP alone is sufficient. Because MalE does not facilitate the binding of ATP to the transporter (16Bao H. Duong F.

The detergent n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) was purchased from Anatrace.

N-(1-Pyrene)-maleimide was obtained from AnaSpec. All other chemicals, including bis-maleimidoethane (BMOE) and N-ethylmaleimide, were obtained from Sigma. MalE and His-tagged MalFGK2 were purified as previously described (16Bao H. Duong F. Discovery of an auto-regulation mechanism for the maltose ABC transporter MalFGK2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e34836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) carrying plasmids pBAD33-MalE or pBAD22-MalFGKhis. The membrane scaffold protein MSP1D1 was obtained from the Sligar laboratory (18Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. Directed self-assembly of monodisperse phospholipid bilayer Nanodiscs with controlled size.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) were mixed at a ratio of 7:3, dissolved in chloroform, and dried under a steam of nitrogen. The lipids were resuspended in TSG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 0.2% DDM. The MalFGK2 complex, the membrane scaffold proteins, and the solubilized lipids were mixed together at a protein:MSP:lipid ratio of 1:3:60 in TSG buffer containing 0.08% DDM. Detergent was removed with BioBeads (one-third volume) and gentle shaking (overnight, 4 °C). BioBeads were removed by sedimentation, and the resulting nanodiscs were purified through Superdex 200 10/30 gel filtration equilibrated in TSG buffer. Proteoliposomes were prepared at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:2000 in TSG buffer containing 0.08% DDM. Detergent was removed using BioBeads as for nanodiscs reconstitution. The proteoliposomes were harvested by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1h, 4 °C) and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The orientation of the complex reconstituted in proteoliposomes was determined by the labeling of residue MalFT177C (in background MalKC40S) with 5-iodoacetamide fluorescein (5-IAF). Proteolipsomes (2 μm) were incubated with 5-IAF (10 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2 supplemented with or without 1% DDM. The reaction was stopped with DTT (2 mm), and unreacted 5-IAF was removed by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25). Proteoliposomes were extruded through a 100-nm polycarbonate filter before use. Proteoliposomes were reconstituted in R buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP). The transport reaction was carried out with 10 μm MalE, 0.5 μm MalFGK2, and 20 μm [14C]maltose (57 μCi/μmol). At the indicated time, samples (50 μl) were removed and diluted into 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 10 mm maltose followed by filtration through a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose Millipore filter and scintillation counting. The number of cpm were converted into nmol using known amounts of [14C]maltose. Cross-linking reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 containing 0.5 μm MalFGK2 proteoliposomes mixed with 1 mm ATP, 10 μm MalE, and 1 mm maltose as indicated. The samples were incubated with 50 μm BMOE (10 min at room temperature) and then treated with N-ethylmaleimide (5 mm) before analysis by SDS-PAGE. The dye N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide was used to label the MalFGK2 cysteine mutants. Briefly, the purified MalFGK2 complex was incubated with 0.5 mm DTT (30 min on ice) and passed through a G25 column. The labeling reaction was then performed by mixing MalFGK2 and N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide at a molar ratio of 1:10 in TSG buffer containing 0.01% DDM and 1 mm TCEP for 2 h at room temperature. The unreacted N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide was removed by Superdex 200 10/30 gel filtration. The purified and labeled complex was reconstituted in proteoliposomes as described above. The labeling efficiency was determined by absorbance spectroscopy (343 nm) using an extinction co-efficient of 40,000 cm−1 m−1. A typical ratio was between 1.2 and 1.4. Because there are two cysteine substitutions per MalFGK2 variant, this is equal to ∼60–70% labeling efficiency. The pyrene-labeled MalFGK2 variants retained ∼80% ATPase activity and 70% transport activity of wild type MalFGK2 (see Table 2). The fluorescent measurements were carried out at 25 °C in FL buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2) on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence spectrums were recorded from 365 to 520 nm with excitation wavelength at 345 nm (5-nm slide width). The binding of MalE to MalFGK2 was measured by fluorescence quenching assay, using MalE-31C labeled with the maleimide derivative ATTO-655 (Atto-Tech), as previously described (16Bao H. Duong F. Discovery of an auto-regulation mechanism for the maltose ABC transporter MalFGK2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e34836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

Cysteine residues were introduced at diagnostic positions on MalK, MalF, and MalG, so that sulfhydryl-based cross-linking methods could be employed to monitor the conformation of the transporter in the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2A). The cysteine residues were introduced into a complex mutated at the endogenous Cys-40 of MalK because this position naturally reacts with maleimide reagents (data not shown). According to the crystallographic data (8Khare D. Oldham M.L. Orelle C. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Alternating access in maltose transporter mediated by rigid-body rotations.Mol.

Crystal structure of a catalytic intermediate of the maltose transporter.Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), the distance between the periplasmic positions MalF446/MalG234 increases from ∼9 to ∼18 Å during the conformational transition from the inward facing state to the outward facing state. Meanwhile, the distance between the cytosolic positions MalK83/MalK83 and MalF396/MalG185 decreases from ∼ 21 to ∼8 Å. We thus employed the homobifunctional cross-linker BMOE with a spacer arm of 8 Å to monitor these conformational changes (Fig. 2). We note that the C-terminal tail of MalG in the crystal structure is located near the MalK dimer interface and may potentially interfere with the formation of the cross-link MalK83/MalK83. However, as reported by others, an efficient ATP-dependent cross-linking occurs with this pair (and also with MalK85/MalK85), showing that the C-terminal tail of MalG is sufficiently mobile in solution to allow cross-link formation (20Daus M.L.

We also considered the possibility that MalFGK2 becomes inaccessible to MalE when the transporter is reconstituted in liposomes. This was ruled out because (i) the transporter was functional (Table 1), and its activity was dependent on MalE and maltose, (ii) the sedimentation of MalE with the proteoliposome was dependent on MalFGK2 and nucleotides (Fig. 3, A and C), and (iii) the thiol-reactive membrane-impermeable reagent 5-IAF labeled the periplasmic side of the complex with at least 50% efficiency (Fig. 2B).TABLE 1The affinity of MalE for the transporter in nanodiscs determined by fluorescence quenching assay as previously described (16Bao H.

Open table in a new tab We then probed what the transporter conformation is in the membrane. In the absence of ligands (apo state), there was only a little cross-link formation with the pairs MalK83/MalK83 and MalF396/MalG185 (pairs located in the cytosolic side of the membrane), whereas cross-links readily formed with the pair MalF446/MalG234 (located on the periplasmic side) (Fig. 2, C–E). These results were expected because the transporter resides naturally in the inward facing state in the absence of ligands (8Khare D. Oldham M.L. Orelle C. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Alternating access in maltose transporter mediated by rigid-body rotations.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, however, a predominant cross-link appeared with the pairs MalK83/MalK83 and MalF396/MalG185, whereas the cross-link of MalF446/MalG234 was decreased by ∼90%, as determined by densitometry analysis (data not shown). The binding of ATP, and not its hydrolysis, was responsible for this conformational change because ATPγS produced the same effect (Fig. 2F). Strikingly, the addition of MalE with or without maltose did not cause any differences in the cross-linking efficiencies (Fig. 2, C–F). Together, these data provided strong preliminary evidence that ATP on its own controls the transition of the transporter from inward to outward facing state. We reported recently that MalE binds with nanomolar affinity to the outward facing transporter (16Bao H. Duong F. Discovery of an auto-regulation mechanism for the maltose ABC transporter MalFGK2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e34836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because ATP alone appears sufficient for the transition to the outward facing conformation, we hypothesized that ATP alone should also control the binding of MalE to the transporter. Accordingly, the stabilization of MalFGK2 in the outward facing state with ATP plus vanadate allowed an efficient co-sedimentation of MalE with the transporter (Fig. 3A, lanes 2). In the absence of vanadate, the binding of MalE was weak because the transporter hydrolyzes ATP and returns to the inward facing conformation, which has no affinity for MalE. Accordingly, when the mutants MalK83/MalK83 and MalF396/MalG185 were treated with ATP plus BMOE to stabilize the transporter in the outward facing state, the binding of MalE was as efficient as with ATP plus vanadate (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 with lanes 4). In contrast, when the transporter was locked in the inward facing state with the pair MalF446/MalG234, the binding of MalE was at background levels, even in the presence of ATP and vanadate (Fig. 3A, right panel, lane 4). The results therefore confirm that ATP controls the transition from inward to outward facing state, which in turn controls the binding of MalE to the transporter. We next employed a fluorescence-based assay to determine the binding affinity of MalE to MalFGK2 in the inward and outward facing states. We reconstituted the transporter in nanodisc because the system is well suited for spectroscopic analysis (22Bayburt T.H. Sligar S.G. Membrane protein assembly into Nanodiscs.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). First, we confirmed on native gel that MalE binds to the transporter with the same characteristics in nanodiscs as in proteoliposomes (Fig. 3, compare B with A; ATP dependence). We then titrated the fluorescent-labeled MalE with an increasing amount of transporter (Fig. 4). The data showed that MalE binds with a high affinity (Kd = ∼50–80 nm) only when the transporter is stabilized in the outward facing conformation with ATP-vanadate or ATP-BMOE (binding data and standard deviations reported in Table 1). In contrast, in the absence of nucleotides, the binding affinity of MalE for the transporter was ∼7 μm and increased furthermore to ∼45 μm when MalE was liganded with maltose (Table 1 and Fig. 3C). Because the transporter might spontaneously acquire its outward facing conformation even in the absence of ATP, the affinity of liganded MalE to the inward facing state may in fact be lower than 45 μm. Indeed, the interaction of maltose-bound MalE was virtually null when the transporter was stabilized in the inward facing state using the cysteine pair MalF446/MalG234 (Fig. 4D). The reaction was not saturable, and therefore the affinity could not be determined, in agreement with earlier binding assays in proteoliposomes (23Austermuhle M.I. Hall J.A. Klug C.S. Davidson A.L. Maltose-binding protein is open in the catalytic transition state for ATP hydrolysis during maltose transport.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28243-28250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We concluded that ATP controls the transporter outward facing conformation and thereby controls the high affinity binding of MalE to the transporter. As an additional way to probe the transporter conformational state and to explore the transition kinetics, we employed the fluorescent dye N-(1-pyrene) maleimide. When attached to a protein thiol, the dye produces two distinct emission peaks at 375 and 395 nm. When two pyrene-thiols interact within 6–10 Å distance, they form excited state dimers (excimers) that emit at longer wavelengths than the lone excited fluorophore (24Sahoo D. Narayanaswami V. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Pyrene excimer fluorescence.

Pyrene excimer fluorescence as a probe of protein conformational change.Subcell. Biochem. 1995; 24: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The transporter labeled with the pyrene probe at the cysteine positions described above retained ∼80% ATPase activity and 70–80% maltose transport activity as compared with the wild type complex (Table 2). The fluorescence spectra were recorded between 365 and 520 nm to monitor the conformational changes in the presence of ATP, MalE, and maltose (Fig. 5, red traces), compared with without ligands (black traces). With the pairs MalK83/MalK83 and MalF396/MalG185, which monitor the conformational changes on the cytosolic side of the membrane, ATP decreased the monomeric emissions but increased the excimer emissions (Fig. 5, A and B). The reverse was observed with the pair MalF446/MalG234. This was expected because the pair monitors the conformational change on the opposite side of the membrane (Fig. 5C). In contrast, MalE and maltose had no effect on the monomeric and excimer emissions, in agreement with the conclusion that ATP alone supports the outward facing conformation of the transporter. Furthermore, we observed that MalE and maltose had no effect on the kinetics of the conformational transition (Fig. 6). These time-resolved experiments showed that liganded MalE is unable to modify the kinetics of MalK closure, even though we employed a cysteine pair that produced the highest fluorescence signal difference (i.e., MalK83/MalK83). We therefore conclude that MalE is not required, nor does it facilitate the closure of the nucleotide-binding domain in the intact and functional maltose ABC transporter.FIGURE 6Transition kinetics toward the outward facing conformation. The time course fluorescence emission spectra for the pair MalK83/MalK83 were monitored after the addition of ATP, MalE, and maltose as indicated. The spectra were recorded at 375 nm to monitor pyrene monomers (A) and 460 nm to monitor exited state dimers (B). The fluorescence is expressed in arbitrary units as in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We report that ATP alone is sufficient for the closure of the MalK interface and for the conversion of MalFG to the outward facing conformation. This conclusion is based on cysteine cross-links and pyrene-based fluorescence of probes placed at diagnostic positions on the transporter. The cysteine substitutions and the pyrene label affect modestly the ATPase activity of the transporter, and do not affect its capacity to import maltose (i.e., 70–80% activity of the wild type; Table 2). The conclusion we reach is in fact not surprising but rather in agreement with other studies reporting that ATP drives the dimerization of MalK in the membrane or in solution (26Hunke S. Mourez M. Jehanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. ATP modulates subunit-subunit interactions in an ATP-binding cassette transporter (MalFGK2) determined by site-directed chemical cross-linking.J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The conclusion is also consistent with the x-ray structures that showed the rigid body rotation of MalFG upon closure of MalK (8Khare D. Oldham M.L. Orelle C. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Alternating access in maltose transporter mediated by rigid-body rotations.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). That ATP alone regulates the conformation of the transporter has also been reported for other type I and type II importers (ModBC and BtuCD, respectively), as well as for ABC exporters (7Hollenstein K.

Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Our results, however, disagree with the accepted notion that closed liganded MalE facilitates the closure of the MalK dimer. This mechanism was proposed (and perhaps intuitively accepted) because a rapid ATP hydrolysis activity occurs only in the presence of MalE and maltose. To the best of our knowledge, this model has been directly tested by EPR spectroscopy only (14Orelle C. Ayvaz T. Everly R.M. Klug C.S. Davidson A.L. Both maltose-binding protein and ATP are required for nucleotide-binding domain closure in the intact maltose ABC transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Why the study concluded that MalK closure strictly depends on MalE is puzzling. The spin label reduced the MalK ATPase activity by 2-fold (from 2,100 to 1,150 nmol/min/mg), yet the transporter was still active. The spin labels were, however, placed at two different positions on the same MalK subunit, giving rise to four different possible ways of spin interactions. Most importantly, the EPR distance measurements were performed in detergent solution, whereas the transporter ATPase is ∼100-fold higher than in the membrane and poorly dependent on MalE and maltose (16Bao H. Duong F. Discovery of an auto-regulation mechanism for the maltose ABC transporter MalFGK2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e34836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of EPR in the membrane environment is indeed problematic because of the large spin decay inherent to intermolecular dipolar interactions (33McHaourab H.S. Steed P.R. Kazmier K. Toward the fourth dimension of membrane protein structure. Insight into dynamics from spin-labeling EPR spectroscopy.Structure. 2011; 19: 1549-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and accordingly, the authors could not report the interspin distances with the transporter reconstituted in liposomes. Nevertheless, this pioneering work showed that ATP is essential for the pairing of MalK, and this conclusion is consistent with our results. Our results also contrast with the interpretation of the crystal structure that captured closed liganded MalE with the transporter in a semi-closed conformation (15Oldham M.L. Chen J. Crystal structure of the maltose transporter in a pretranslocation intermediate state.Science. 2011; 332: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It was concluded that closed liganded MalE binds to MalFG and induces the preclosure of MalK and thus ATP hydrolysis. Our pyrene-based fluorescence experiments rather show that the kinetics of MalK pairing is the same, whether MalE and maltose are present or not (Fig. 5). In addition, we find that the binding of closed liganded MalE to the inward facing transporter is quasi-null in solution (Kd > 45 μm; Table 1). In contrast, the binding of MalE to the outward facing transporter occurs with nanomolar affinity (Kd = ∼60 nm; Table 1). Clearly, a far more dominant interaction is taking place between ATP-bound outward facing MalFGK2 and unliganded open state MalE. Given the high concentration of ATP in the cytosol (∼1 mm), we think this mode of interaction represents the resting state of the transporter. This view is supported by an in vivo cross-linking analysis, which reported that MalE is bound to the transporter even in the absence of maltose (34Daus M.L. Berendt S. Wuttge S. Schneider E. Maltose binding protein (MalE) interacts with periplasmic loops P2 and P1 respectively of the MalFG subunits of the maltose ATP binding cassette transporter (MalFGK2) from Escherichia coli/Salmonella during the transport cycle.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 1107-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This view is also consistent with our conclusion that transporter-bound MalE forms a receptor for maltose (16Bao H. Duong F. Discovery of an auto-regulation mechanism for the maltose ABC transporter MalFGK2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e34836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, a model involving the low affinity interaction between closed liganded MalE and MalFGK2 (Kd > 45 μm), as a way to deliver the sugar and activate the transporter, seems unsustainable because the concentration of periplasmic MalE decreases further as the environmental maltose concentration decreases. An obvious question raised by this work is how MalE stimulates the MalK ATPase. The co-crystal of closed liganded MalE with MalFGK2 has led to the proposal that MalE lowers the energy barrier for ATP hydrolysis (15Oldham M.L. Chen J. Crystal structure of the maltose transporter in a pretranslocation intermediate state.Science. 2011; 332: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be excluded that the binding of MalE to the outward facing transporter instead stimulates the release of ADP and/or Pi and thus the ATP turnover rate (and furthermore in the presence of maltose). Earlier studies suggested that ATP product release may coincide with the reorientation of MalFGK2 to the inward facing conformation (14Orelle C. Ayvaz T. Everly R.M. Klug C.S. Davidson A.L. Both maltose-binding protein and ATP are required for nucleotide-binding domain closure in the intact maltose ABC transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For the mammalian P-glycoprotein, it was proposed that phosphate release is coupled to transport (35Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. Both P-glycoprotein nucleotide-binding sites are catalytically active.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Further work should therefore address what is the rate-limiting step during maltose transport. Our current work shows that the affinity of the transporter for ATP is not increased with MalE (16Bao H. Duong F. Discovery of an auto-regulation mechanism for the maltose ABC transporter MalFGK2.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e34836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and that ATP alone is sufficient to convert the transporter to the outward facing conformation. Together, these results imply that MalE must stimulate a step that occurs when the transporter returns to the inward facing conformation. This conclusion is compatible with the autoregulation model presented in Fig. 1B."

https://openalex.org/W2022100833,"It is difficult to explain the differential rates of progression of premalignant colonic lesions and differences in behaviour of morphologically similar lesions. Heterogeneity for microsatellite instability (MSI) and promoter methylation in driving these phenomena forward may explain this; however, no previous analysis has examined this in detail at the gland level, the smallest unit of colorectal premalignant lesions. We aimed to carry out an analysis of gland level genomic instability for MSI and promoter methylation. MSI occurred significantly more frequently (20%) in colonic glands than has previously been observed in whole colorectal polyps. Significant promoter methylation was seen in MLH1, PMS2, MLH3 and MSH3 as well as significant heterogeneity for both MSI and promoter methylation. Methylation and MSI may have a significant role in driving forward colorectal carcinogenesis, although in the case of MSI, this association is less clear as it occurs significantly more frequently than previously thought, and may simply be a passenger in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Promoter methylation in MLH1, MLH3, MSH3 and PMS2 was also found to be significantly associated with MSI and should be investigated further. A total of 273 colorectal glands (126 hyperplastic, 147 adenomatous) were isolated via laser capture microdissection (targeted at regions of MLH1 loss) from 93 colonic polyps and tested for MSI, and promoter methylation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MLH3, MSH6, PMS2, MGMT and MLH3 via methylation specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Logistic regression modelling was then used to identify significant associations between promoter methylation and gland histological type and MSI status."
https://openalex.org/W2038002795,"Two-pore domain potassium (K(2P)) channels play fundamental roles in cellular processes by enabling a constitutive leak of potassium from cells in which they are expressed, thus influencing cellular membrane potential and activity. Hence, regulation of these channels is of critical importance to cellular function. A key regulatory mechanism of K(2P) channels is the control of their cell surface expression. Membrane protein delivery to and retrieval from the cell surface is controlled by their passage through the secretory and endocytic pathways, and post-translational modifications regulate their progression through these pathways. All but one of the K(2P) channels possess consensus N-linked glycosylation sites, and here we demonstrate that the conserved putative N-glycosylation site in K(2P)3.1 and K(2P)9.1 is a glycan acceptor site. Patch clamp analysis revealed that disruption of channel glycosylation reduced K(2P)3.1 current, and flow cytometry was instrumental in attributing this to a decreased number of channels on the cell surface. Similar findings were observed when cells were cultured in reduced glucose concentrations. Disruption of N-linked glycosylation has less of an effect on K(2P)9.1, with a small reduction in number of channels on the surface observed, but no functional implications detected. Because nonglycosylated channels appear to pass through the secretory pathway in a manner comparable with glycosylated channels, the evidence presented here suggests that the decreased number of nonglycosylated K(2P)3.1 channels on the cell surface may be due to their decreased stability."

The DBD binds as a tetramer to response elements (REs), with each monomer recognizing a 5-bp quarter-site of the 20-bp full-site RE. A full-site RE has two half-site REs, where each half-site follows the 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′ consensus sequence, and in some cases, both half-sites can be separated by 1–3 nucleotides (1Riley T.

This work builds upon our previous structural research on RE spacers that highlights, using oligonucleotides with half-site REs, how the p73 DBD recognizes REs with spacers of 0, 1, 2, and 4 nucleotides between two half-sites (27Ethayathulla A.S. Tse P.-W. Monti P. Nguyen S. Inga A. Fronza G. Viadiu H. Structure of p73 DNA-binding domain tetramer modulates p73 transactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6066-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyze the oligomerization state and DNA affinity of the p73 DBD upon binding to full-site REs and present two crystal structures of the p73 DBD tetramer bound to continuous 20-bp full-site REs. We compare all of the solved structures of p73 DBD tetramers in complex with different DNA sequences and correlate changes in the RE sequence with changes in the conformation of the protein that could explain p73 target gene selectivity. The human p73 DBD (residues 115–312) was purified as described previously (27Ethayathulla A.S. Tse P.-W. Monti P. Nguyen S. Inga A. Fronza G. Viadiu H. Structure of p73 DNA-binding domain tetramer modulates p73 transactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6066-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Commercially purchased 20-bp oligonucleotides were used in crystallization (5′-GAACATGTTCGAACATGTTC-3′ for the GAACA crystals and 5′-GAACCGGTTCGAACCGGTTC-3′ for the GAACC crystals). Prior to crystallization, the p73 DBD (20 mg/ml) was mixed with DNA (6 mg/ml) at a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Both protein-DNA complexes were crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The GAACA crystals grew in 100 mm trihydrated sodium acetate, 100 mm Tris base (pH 9.0), and 18–20% PEG 3350. The GAACC crystals grew in 100 mm trihydrated sodium acetate, 100 mm Bistris propane (pH 7.5), and 12–15% PEG 3350. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen using 30% PEG 3350 as a cryoprotectant. Initial crystals that allowed optimization were diffracted at beamline BL7-1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, allowing optimization. The final data sets were collected at beamline 8.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Crystal data and intensity statistics are given in Table 1. Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). In both complexes, the asymmetric unit consists of two p73 DBD molecules (198 amino acids in each molecule) and half of the palindromic 20-bp oligonucleotide used in crystallization (10-bp dsDNA). The calculated VM values are 2.77 Å3/Da for the GAACA crystal and 2.14 Å3/Da for the GAACC crystal, which correspond to solvent contents of 55.6% and 42.3%, respectively. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (30McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14444) Google Scholar). First, we solved the GAACA structure using a p73 DBD dimer with chains A and B from Protein Data Bank 3VD0 Model 1 bound to a modeled 10-bp dsDNA molecule with the sequence 5′-GAACATGTTC-3′ as a search model (27Ethayathulla A.S. Tse P.-W. Monti P. Nguyen S. Inga A. Fronza G. Viadiu H. Structure of p73 DNA-binding domain tetramer modulates p73 transactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6066-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A unique molecular replacement solution was obtained. The initial solution was refined using rigid body, simulated annealing, and positional refinement in CNS 1.3 (31Brunger A.T. Version 1.2 of the crystallography and NMR system.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Initial refinement yielded a clear electron density for the DNA molecule, and the 10-bp half-site was built 1 bp at a time. Considering the adjacent symmetry-related molecule, a continuous 20-bp DNA is present in the model. Extra steps of positional and individual B-factor refinement were calculated with CNS 1.3 (31Brunger A.T. Version 1.2 of the crystallography and NMR system.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Cycles of manual and then real-space refinement were carried out for the protein, DNA, and waters with the program Coot 0.6.1 (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar). The model was verified using composite omit maps as implemented in CNS 1.3 (31Brunger A.T. Version 1.2 of the crystallography and NMR system.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). For the GAACC structure, the GAACA dimer with DNA was used as a search model to find a molecular replacement solution. As the crystal diffracted only to 4.0 Å, the structure was refined imposing tight non-crystallographic symmetry constraints between monomers A and B to reduce the number of refined parameters.

The final Rfactor/Rfree statistics are 25.0/27.4 for the GAACA structure and 24.4/30.7 for the GAACC structure. All residues were either in the most favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as evaluated by the program PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6066-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A fluorescein-labeled dsDNA (5′-6-FAM-GAACATGTTCGAACATGTTC-3′, where 6-FAM is fluorescein amidite) was used. The data collected were analyzed using SEDFIT software to calculate sedimentation coefficient distributions (38Schuck P.

For the binding studies, 15 samples were prepared in a total volume of 500 μl containing pure p73 DBD at 1 nm to 8 μm in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.1), 5 mm DTT, and 5 μm ZnCl2 in addition to a constant 10 nm final concentration of 5′-fluorescein-labeled 20-bp oligonucleotide (5′-FAM-GAACATGTTCGAACATGTTC-3′ or 5′-FAM-GAACCGGTTCGAACCGGTTC-3′). Measurements and analysis were carried out as described previously (27Ethayathulla A.S. Tse P.-W. Monti P. Nguyen S. Inga A. Fronza G. Viadiu H. Structure of p73 DNA-binding domain tetramer modulates p73 transactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6066-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We solved the structures of the p73 DBD bound as a tetramer to two REs (Fig. 1A). The structure of a p73 DBD tetramer in complex with a 20-bp full-site RE with a 5′-GAACA-3′ quarter-site sequence, hereafter termed the GAACA structure (Protein Data Bank code 4G82), crystallizes in space group P61, and it was solved to a resolution of 3.1 Å (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1A). The p73 DBD tetramer structure bound to a 20-bp full-site RE with a 5′-GAACC-3′ quarter-site sequence, hereafter termed the GAACC structure (Protein Data Bank code 4G83), crystallizes in space group P212121, and it was solved to a resolution of 4.0 Å (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1B). The final maps show electron density for all of the p73 DBD residues and DNA base pairs (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3, A and B). Although both crystals belong to different space groups, they contain a protein dimer and a half-site RE in the asymmetric unit. The adjacent molecule in the crystal, related by translation, completes the p73 DBD tetramer bound to the continuous 20-bp DNA molecule used during crystallization (supplemental Figs. S1 and S3, A and B). The p73 DBD shows the characteristic immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich also present in the DBDs of the other two members of the p53 transcription factor family (p63 and p53). The DBD has a β-sandwich fold with two highly twisted β-sheets, one formed by four strands (S1, S3, S8, and S5) and the other by five strands (S6, S7, S4, S9, and S10) (Fig. 1B). At one end of the β-sandwich, the short loops are compacted, whereas at the other end, two large loops and a large loop-sheet-helix motif are responsible for dimerization and DNA recognition. The two large loops, L2 and L3, contain helices H1 and 310, which form the dimerization interface. The conformation of both loops is maintained by a zinc ion coordinated by Cys-194 and His-197 from helix H1 in loop L2 and Cys-258 and Cys-262 in the 310 helix of loop L3. The larger motif at that end of the β-sandwich is a loop-sheet-helix motif that positions helix H2 to recognize DNA, together with residues in loop L3. The p73 DBD shares 85% and 58% sequence identity and all of the secondary structure elements with the p63 and p53 DBDs, respectively (Fig. 1C). Due to crystallographic symmetry, there are four unique p73 DBD monomers in the GAACA and GAACC crystals, two in each crystal form. All of the unique monomer structures are still very similar among them, with an r.m.s.d. of 1 or less. For example, only three regions differ significantly between monomers A and B of the GAACA structure. The N terminus, the loop between strands S3 and S4, and the loop between strands S7 and S8 all have significantly higher r.m.s.d. values (1.79, 2.84, and 2.12, respectively) than the rest of the structure. Due to the lower resolution of the GAACC crystal, non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were applied to restrain the monomer structures to each other and decrease the number of parameters to be refined. In summary, the monomer structure is conserved, and its flexibility is limited to individual side chains or few secondary structure elements. The ensuing structural description of the p73 DBD dimers and tetramers is simplified because, due to the symmetry present in both crystal forms, monomers A and B are identical to monomers D and C, respectively (Fig. 2A). As a consequence, the dimerization interface between monomers A and B is identical to the one between monomers D and C. Thus, the p73 DBD tetramer bound to a 20-bp full-site RE in both crystals is formed by two identical dimers bound to two identical half-sites. The dimerization interface of the p73 DBD tetramer is found ∼13 Å above the main DNA axis, allowing the dimer to embrace the DNA. The interface is formed by three residues located in helix H1 (Pro-195, Asn-196, and Leu-199) and one residue located in the 310 helix found in loop L3 (Val-263) (Fig. 2B). The dimerization interface has a surface area of 225 Å2, and it is formed by two helices, helix H1 from each monomer. It is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and two hydrogen bonds. The OD1 of Asn-196 in monomer B interacts with the amide nitrogen of Asn-196 in monomer A, and the ND2 of Asn-196 in monomer B interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Val-263 in monomer A. There are also numerous van der Waals interactions between the carbon atoms of the four residues that stabilize the dimer interface, most notably between the side chains of both Leu-199 residues and the intertwining between the side chains of Pro-195 and Asn-196 from both monomers. The zinc-binding residues in helix H1 and loop L3 are adjacent to the residues involved in dimerization. Thus, the bound zinc atom is essential to maintain the structure that allows dimerization of p73 DBD. As observed in the previously solved structures of the p73 DBD in complex with DNA, the p73 DBD binds as a tetramer to its REs. In this work, we report two structures of the p73 DBD tetramer bound to two distinct 20-bp full-site REs that are continuous DNA molecules. Previous p73 DBD structures had been solved with half-site REs that were only assembled as a full-site RE in the crystal by the stacking of two adjacent DNA molecules (27Ethayathulla A.S. Tse P.-W. Monti P. Nguyen S. Inga A. Fronza G. Viadiu H. Structure of p73 DNA-binding domain tetramer modulates p73 transactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6066-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The DNA-bound p73 DBD tetramer is stabilized by dimer-dimer contacts formed between two interfaces. The AD tetramerization interface is stabilized by contacts between monomers A and D, and the CB tetramerization interface is maintained through the interaction of monomers C and B (Fig. 2A). The total buried surface area for the tetramerization interface is 979 Å2 for the GAACA structure and 956 Å2 for the GAACC structure. Because of its higher resolution, we focused on the GAACA structure to describe the tetramer interfaces. The CB interface is slightly larger (502 Å2) than the AD interface (442 Å2). There is also a small 33 Å2 contribution to the tetramer buried surface interface from two residues across dimers B and D that are only 4.1 Å apart: Arg-201 from monomer B and Glu-205 from monomer D. Each of the two tetramerization interfaces, AD (Fig. 2C) and CB (Fig. 2D), is stabilized by two patches of atomic contacts. The first patch is formed by residues in the N terminus of monomer A or C that contact the loop between strands S7 and S8 of monomer D or B. The second patch of contacts is between residues in loop L2A from monomer A or C with residues in strands S2, S3, S5, and S8 from monomer D or B. Although both the AD and CB tetramerization interfaces are very similar, mostly conformed by van der Waals interactions, some of the individual contacts between monomers A and D differ from those between monomers C and B. For example, in monomer D, the loop between strands S7 and S8 has moved away and only keeps Gln-244 interacting with the N terminus of monomer A (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in the CB interface, Gln-244, Val-245, and Gly-246 of monomer B interact with the N terminus and Arg-287 of monomer C (Fig. 2D). Another contact, absent in the AD interface, occurs when loop L2A of monomer C interacts with Trp-142 in strand S3 of monomer B. The number of hydrogen bonds in each tetramerization interface is also different: there is only one hydrogen bond in the AD interface (Ser-117 OG in A with Gln-244 OE1 in D), whereas the CB interface has five (Ile-115 oxygen in C with Gln-244 OE1 in B, Ser-117 nitrogen in C with Gln-244 OE1 in B, Ser-117 OG in C with Gln-244 NE2 in B, Glu-185 OE1 in B with Trp-142 NE1 in C, and Arg-287 NH1 in C with Val-245 oxygen in B). Overall, p73 has flexible tetramerization interfaces that adjust to changes in the RE. When binding to DNA, hydrodynamic measurements have shown that the"
https://openalex.org/W2120259237,"We have trapped the catalytic domain of Dictyostelium (Dicty) myosin II in a weak actin-binding conformation by chemically crosslinking two engineered cysteines across the actin-binding cleft, using a bifunctional spin label (BSL). By connecting the lower and upper 50 kDa domains of myosin, the crosslink restricts the conformation of the actin-binding cleft. Crosslinking has no effect on the basal ATPase activity of isolated myosin, but it impairs rigor actin binding and actin-activation of myosin ATPase. EPR spectra of BSL provide insight into actomyosin structural dynamics. BSL is highly immobilized within the actin-binding cleft and is thus exquisitely sensitive to the global orientation and rotational motions of the myosin head. Conventional EPR shows that myosin heads bound to oriented actin filaments are highly disordered with respect to the actin filament axis, in contrast to the nearly crystalline order of myosin heads in rigor. This disorder is similar to that of weakly bound heads induced by ATP, but saturation transfer EPR shows that the disorder of crosslinked myosin is at least 100 times slower. Thus this cleft-crosslinked myosin is remarkably similar, in both actin affinity and rotational dynamics, to SH1-SH2 crosslinked BSL-myosin S1. We conclude that, whether myosin is trapped at the actin-myosin interface or in the force-generating region between the active site and lever arm, the structural state of myosin is intermediate between the weak-binding state preceding phosphate release and the strong-binding state that succeeds it. We propose that it represents the threshold of force generation."
https://openalex.org/W2070522144,"ΔEGFR is a potent glioblastoma oncogene which has been studied primarily as a plasma membrane kinase. Using intracranial xenograft studies in mice, we show that blocking ΔEGFR access to the nucleus attenuates its tumorigenicity and, conversely, that promoting nuclear accumulation enhances this, providing the first in vivo evidence that the nuclear actions of ΔEGFR contribute strongly to its oncogenic function. Nuclear actions of ΔEGFR include regulation of gene expression by participation in chromatin-bound complexes, and genome-wide mapping of these sequences by chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing identified 2294 peaks. Bioinformatic analysis showed enrichment of the E-box motif in the dataset, and c-Myc and ΔEGFR were corecruited to the promoters of and transcriptionally activated a subset of nuclear ΔEGFR chromatin targets. Knockdown of c-Myc decreased the expression of these targets and diminished ΔEGFR-stimulated anchorage-independent colony formation. We conclude that transcriptional regulation of target genes by association with gene regulatory chromatin in cooperation with c-Myc by nuclear ΔEGFR makes a unique contribution to its oncogenicity and propose that this venue provides new targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2156984841,"Current WHO guidelines recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation at CD4 counts ≤350 cells/µL. Increasing this threshold has been proposed, with a primary goal of reducing HIV-1 infectiousness. Because the quantity of HIV-1 in plasma is the primary predictor of HIV-1 transmission, consideration of plasma viral load in ART initiation guidelines is warranted.Using per-sex-act infectivity estimates and cross-sectional sexual behavior data from 2,484 HIV-1 infected persons with CD4 counts >350 enrolled in a study of African heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant couples, we calculated the number of transmissions expected and the number potentially averted under selected scenarios for ART initiation: i) CD4 count <500 cells/µL, ii) viral load ≥10,000 or ≥50,000 copies/mL and iii) universal treatment. For each scenario, we estimated the proportion of expected infections that could be averted, the proportion of infected persons initiating treatment, and the ratio of these proportions.Initiating treatment at viral load ≥50,000 copies/mL would require treating 19.8% of infected persons with CD4 counts >350 while averting 40.5% of expected transmissions (ratio 2.0); treating at viral load ≥10,0000 copies/mL had a ratio of 1.5. In contrast, initiation at CD4 count <500 would require treating 41.8%, while averting 48.4% (ratio 1.1).Inclusion of viral load in ART initiation guidelines could permit targeting ART resources to HIV-1 infected persons who have a higher risk of transmitting HIV-1. Further work is needed to estimate costs and feasibility."
