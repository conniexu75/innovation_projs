https://openalex.org/W2152617913,"Influenza virus presents an important and persistent threat to public health worldwide, and current vaccines provide immunity to viral isolates similar to the vaccine strain. High-affinity antibodies against a conserved epitope could provide immunity to the diverse influenza subtypes and protection against future pandemic viruses. Cocrystal structures were determined at 2.2 and 2.7 angstrom resolutions for broadly neutralizing human antibody CR6261 Fab in complexes with the major surface antigen (hemagglutinin, HA) from viruses responsible for the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic and a recent lethal case of H5N1 avian influenza. In contrast to other structurally characterized influenza antibodies, CR6261 recognizes a highly conserved helical region in the membrane-proximal stem of HA1 and HA2. The antibody neutralizes the virus by blocking conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. The CR6261 epitope identified here should accelerate the design and implementation of improved vaccines that can elicit CR6261-like antibodies, as well as antibody-based therapies for the treatment of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2133603157,"Store-operated Ca(2+) channels activated by the depletion of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are a major Ca(2+) entry pathway in nonexcitable cells and are essential for T cell activation and adaptive immunity. After store depletion, the ER Ca(2+) sensor STIM1 and the CRAC channel protein Orai1 redistribute to ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions, but the fundamental issue of how STIM1 activates the CRAC channel at these sites is unresolved. Here, we identify a minimal, highly conserved 107-aa CRAC activation domain (CAD) of STIM1 that binds directly to the N and C termini of Orai1 to open the CRAC channel. Purified CAD forms a tetramer that clusters CRAC channels, but analysis of STIM1 mutants reveals that channel clustering is not sufficient for channel activation. These studies establish a molecular mechanism for store-operated Ca(2+) entry in which the direct binding of STIM1 to Orai1 drives the accumulation and the activation of CRAC channels at ER-PM junctions."

How Earth's temperature changed during this climate transition remains poorly understood, and evidence for Northern Hemisphere polar ice is controversial. Here, we report proxy records of sea surface temperatures from multiple ocean localities and show that the high-latitude temperature decrease was substantial and heterogeneous. High-latitude (45 degrees to 70 degrees in both hemispheres) temperatures before the climate transition were ∼20°C and cooled an average of ∼5°C. Our results, combined with ocean and ice-sheet model simulations and benthic oxygen isotope records, indicate that Northern Hemisphere glaciation was not required to accommodate the magnitude of continental ice growth during this time."
https://openalex.org/W1993696187,"Energy use, mainly to reverse ion movements in neurons, is a fundamental constraint on brain information processing. Trafficking of mitochondria to locations in neurons where there are large ion fluxes is essential for powering neural function. Mitochondrial trafficking is regulated by Ca2+ entry through ionotropic glutamate receptors, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. We show that the protein Miro1 links mitochondria to KIF5 motor proteins, allowing mitochondria to move along microtubules. This linkage is inhibited by micromolar levels of Ca2+ binding to Miro1. With the EF hand domains of Miro1 mutated to prevent Ca2+ binding, Miro1 could still facilitate mitochondrial motility, but mitochondrial stopping induced by glutamate or neuronal activity was blocked. Activating neuronal NMDA receptors with exogenous or synaptically released glutamate led to Miro1 positioning mitochondria at the postsynaptic side of synapses. Thus, Miro1 is a key determinant of how energy supply is matched to energy usage in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1976433270,"Several neural codes have been proposed in order to explain how neurons encode sensory information. Here we tested the hypothesis that different codes might be employed concurrently and provide complementary stimulus information. Quantifying the information encoded about natural sounds in the auditory cortex of alert animals, we found that temporal spike-train patterns and spatial populations were both highly informative. However, the relative phase of slow ongoing rhythms at which these (temporal or population) responses occurred provided much additional and complementary information. Such nested codes combining spike-train patterns with the phase of firing were not only most informative, but also most robust to sensory noise added to the stimulus. Our findings suggest that processing in sensory cortices could rely on the concurrent use of several codes that combine information across different spatiotemporal scales. In addition, they propose a role of slow cortical rhythms in stabilizing sensory representations by reducing effects of noise."
https://openalex.org/W2146839980,"Background Compressive mechanical stress produced during growth in a confining matrix limits the size of tumor spheroids, but little is known about the dynamics of stress accumulation, how the stress affects cancer cell phenotype, or the molecular pathways involved. Methodology/Principal Findings We co-embedded single cancer cells with fluorescent micro-beads in agarose gels and, using confocal microscopy, recorded the 3D distribution of micro-beads surrounding growing spheroids. The change in micro-bead density was then converted to strain in the gel, from which we estimated the spatial distribution of compressive stress around the spheroids. We found a strong correlation between the peri-spheroid solid stress distribution and spheroid shape, a result of the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptotic cell death in regions of high mechanical stress. By compressing spheroids consisting of cancer cells overexpressing anti-apoptotic genes, we demonstrate that mechanical stress-induced apoptosis occurs via the mitochondrial pathway. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide detailed, quantitative insight into the role of micro-environmental mechanical stress in tumor spheroid growth dynamics, and suggest how tumors grow in confined locations where the level of solid stress becomes high. An important implication is that apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, induced by compressive stress, may be involved in tumor dormancy, in which tumor growth is held in check by a balance of apoptosis and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2065833903,"Human colorectal cancers (CRCs) display a large number of genetic and epigenetic alterations, some of which are causally involved in tumorigenesis (drivers) and others that have little functional impact (passengers). To help distinguish between these two classes of alterations, we used a transposon-based genetic screen in mice to identify candidate genes for CRC. Mice harboring mutagenic Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons were crossed with mice expressing SB transposase in gastrointestinal tract epithelium. Most of the offspring developed intestinal lesions, including intraepithelial neoplasia, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas. Analysis of over 16,000 transposon insertions identified 77 candidate CRC genes, 60 of which are mutated and/or dysregulated in human CRC and thus are most likely to drive tumorigenesis. These genes include APC, PTEN , and SMAD4 . The screen also identified 17 candidate genes that had not previously been implicated in CRC, including POLI, PTPRK , and RSPO2 ."

https://openalex.org/W2087301801,"In cerebral cortex, ongoing activity absent a stimulus can resemble stimulus-driven activity in size and structure. In particular, spontaneous activity in cat primary visual cortex (V1) has structure significantly correlated with evoked responses to oriented stimuli. This suggests that, from unstructured input, cortical circuits selectively amplify specific activity patterns. Current understanding of selective amplification involves elongation of a neural assembly's lifetime by mutual excitation among its neurons. We introduce a new mechanism for selective amplification without elongation of lifetime: “balanced amplification.” Strong balanced amplification arises when feedback inhibition stabilizes strong recurrent excitation, a pattern likely to be typical of cortex. Thus, balanced amplification should ubiquitously contribute to cortical activity. Balanced amplification depends on the fact that individual neurons project only excitatory or only inhibitory synapses. This leads to a hidden feedforward connectivity between activity patterns. We show in a detailed biophysical model that this can explain the cat V1 observations."
https://openalex.org/W2123858302,"Mating induces changes in the receptivity and egg-laying behavior in Drosophila females, primarily due to a peptide pheromone called sex peptide which is transferred with the sperm into the female reproductive tract during copulation. Whereas sex peptide is generally believed to modulate fruitless-GAL4-expressing neurons in the central nervous system to produce behavioral changes, we found that six to eight sensory neurons on the reproductive tract labeled by both ppk-GAL4 and fruitless-GAL4 can sense sex peptide to control the induction of postmating behaviors. In these sensory neurons, sex peptide appears to act through Pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and suppression of protein kinase A activity to reduce synaptic output. Our results uncover a neuronal mechanism by which sex peptide exerts its control over reproductive behaviors in Drosophila females."
https://openalex.org/W2047999252,"Cortico-hippocampal interactions during sleep are believed to reorganize neural circuits in support of memory consolidation. However, spike-timing relationships across cortico-hippocampal networks—key determinants of synaptic changes—are poorly understood. Here we show that cells in prefrontal cortex fire consistently within 100 ms after hippocampal cells in naturally sleeping animals. This provides evidence at the single cell-pair level for highly consistent directional interactions between these areas within the window of plasticity. Moreover, these interactions are state dependent: they are driven by hippocampal sharp-wave/ripple (SWR) bursts in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and are sharply reduced during REM sleep. Finally, prefrontal responses are nonlinear: as the strength of hippocampal bursts rises, short-latency prefrontal responses are augmented by increased spindle band activity and a secondary peak ∼100 ms later. These findings suggest that SWR events are atomic units of hippocampal-prefrontal communication during SWS and that the coupling between these areas is highly attenuated during REM sleep.

Many lines of evidence have shown that the hippocampus is critical for the formation of long-term memories, and that this hippocampal involvement is time limited (Squire, 1992Squire L.R.

Hippocampectomy impairs the memory of recently, but not remotely acquired trace eyeblink conditioned responses.Behav. Neurosci. 1995; 109: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The predominant conjecture is that memories are gradually established across neocortical circuits under the influence of the hippocampus (Buzsáki, 1996Buzsáki G.

Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). This circuit reorganization is believed to result from coordinated activity between and within the hippocampus and the neocortex not only during awake behavior, but also during sleep (Wilson and McNaughton, 1994Wilson M.A. McNaughton B.L.

Consistent with this conjecture, cortical and hippocampal networks remain highly active and plastic during sleep. One of the most striking features of mammalian sleep is the existence of discrete stages—slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—with different electrical and biochemical profiles. In particular, SWS and REM sleep differ drastically in the level of synchronous firing in the hippocampus (Figure 1). Given the importance of synchrony and spike timing in synaptic plasticity, and given the putative role of sleep in learning and memory, a key open question is whether there exist consistent spike-timing relationships across cortico-hippocampal circuits during sleep, and whether these differ in SWS versus REM sleep. The hippocampal-prefrontal circuit is of particular interest given both its importance in spatial and associative learning (Floresco et al., 1997Floresco S.B. Seamans J.K. Philips A.G.

Previous work has shown that hippocampal and prefrontal multiunit activity are significantly correlated during SWS, with the hippocampus leading the prefrontal cortex (Siapas and Wilson, 1998Siapas A.G.

Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, key questions remain open concerning the interactions between these areas: How common are directional interactions across hippocampal-prefrontal cell pairs? Is there diversity in their directionality, time lag, and strength? How are these interactions structured relative to prominent electrophysiological events in the sleeping brain, such as hippocampal ripples and neocortical spindles? Do they differ during SWS and REM sleep? The present study addresses these questions. In order to assess hippocampal-prefrontal timing relationships at the single cell-pair level during all stages of sleep, we used chronic multitetrode recordings to monitor the simultaneous activity of CA1 and medial prefrontal (mPFC) cells of freely behaving rats during long intervals of natural sleep (Figure 1). We computed cross-covariances between all pairs of simultaneously recorded prefrontal and hippocampal single units (219 CA1 cells, 76 mPFC cells). We restricted our analysis to putative pyramidal cells in the hippocampus (183 CA1 cells), by using a mean firing rate criterion of less than 1 Hz, and we considered only pairs in which the firing rates of both cells exceeded 0.05 Hz in SWS and REM (2779 total mPFC-CA1 pairs). Figure 2 shows an example of the cross-covariances computed between one mPFC cell and all of the simultaneously recorded CA1 cells in one data set during SWS and REM sleep. Each row in Figure 2ii represents the cross-covariance between the given mPFC cell and one CA1 cell as a function of lags ranging from −500 to 500 ms, where positive lags signify that prefrontal activity follows hippocampal activity. We note three features from this example. First, several CA1 cells show significant positive cross-covariances during SWS (Figure 2Aii), indicating that they tended to exhibit consistent spike timing relative to this prefrontal cell. Second, the significant cross-covariances have peaks at positive time lags, between 0 and 100 ms. This shows that this prefrontal cell tended to fire 0–100 ms after these hippocampal cells. Third, the same cell pairs with significant correlations in SWS are uncorrelated in REM sleep (Figure 2Bii). To test the generality of these observations, we computed all cross-covariances between mPFC cells and simultaneously recorded CA1 cells in both SWS and REM sleep across all data sets. First, we found that 11% (304 out of 2779) of hippocampal-prefrontal cell pairs were significantly correlated in SWS (false discovery rate of 1%; see Experimental Procedures). Second, we observed that, for these correlated cell pairs, the distribution of peak lags deviated from uniformity in several key respects. Prefrontal cells tended to fire after hippocampal cells for 70% of correlated cell pairs, a significant directional bias (p < 10−11, binomial test; Figure 3Aiii). More specifically, prefrontal firing followed hippocampal firing by an average of 36 ms (n = 304; SE = 12 ms). The concentration of peak lags in the range of 0–100 ms (39% of pairs) was also highly significant (p < 10−20, binomial test). In order to understand better the origin of these correlations, we tested the hypothesis that they are driven by coordinated activity during hippocampal sharp-wave/ripple (SWR) events. We therefore computed cross-covariances by using only the subset of spikes from both brain areas during ±250 ms windows around the center of SWR events (ripple band power > mean + 2 SD; see Experimental Procedures). These subsets comprised 26% of overall SWS and contained 28% of prefrontal and 50% of hippocampal spikes. We found that 141 out of 304 pairs still showed significant cross-covariances (Figure 3B) during this subset. In contrast, only 32 of the 304 pairs showed significant cross-covariances when this subset of SWR-driven spikes was excluded from SWS (Figure 3C). Focusing on the correlated cell pairs in SWS with peak lags between 0 and 100 ms, 78% (94/120) of these pairs were also correlated in SWS restricted to SWR events, whereas only 14% (17/120) were correlated in SWS outside of SWR events. We next addressed the question of whether the cell pairs that were significantly correlated in SWS also exhibited strong correlations during REM sleep. Surprisingly, we found that these significant hippocampal-prefrontal covariances were nearly abolished in REM sleep. In particular, only three of the cell pairs that were significantly correlated in SWS showed significant correlations during REM sleep (Figure 3D). Finally, only 19 out of all 2779 pairs showed significant correlations in REM sleep. The restriction of hippocampal-prefrontal interactions to discrete episodes during SWR events is also apparent in the time evolution of the short-term cross-covariance of mPFC and CA1 multiunit activity (Figure 4). Detecting correlations depends on the number of events, and rats spend 7–8 times longer in SWS than in REM sleep. We therefore examined whether the absence of significant correlation during REM might be due to this imbalance. First, we verified that firing rates during REM sleep and SWS do not differ grossly, neither on the whole (Figure 5) nor for cell pairs that are significantly correlated in SWS in particular (Figure 5, red points). Second, we computed all cross-covariances during SWS by using randomly drawn subsets of SWS of the same duration as REM sleep (Figure S1, available online). We then confirmed that the significant covariances identified by analyzing all of SWS (Figure 3Ai) are still apparent when using REM-sized subsets of SWS (Figure S1Ai), and these differ significantly from the scarcity of correlations observed during REM sleep (Figure S1Aii). As additional verification that SWS and REM differ in their overall short-term correlation structure, for each cell pair we counted the number of prefrontal spikes arriving within 0–100 ms of a CA1 spike and found significantly higher standardized counts in SWS compared to REM (p < 10−15, paired t test; see Experimental Procedures). To measure the prevalence of significant correlations at the level of single cells, as opposed to cell pairs, and to verify that our results were not driven by a handful of highly interacting cells, we computed a functional connectivity matrix between mPFC and CA1 for all data sets, including every cell used in this study (Figure 6). We defined the interaction rate of a cell as the fraction of cells in the other brain area with which it is significantly correlated. Interaction rates show a continuum of values in both brain regions, with median values of 10% and 7% for hippocampal and prefrontal units, respectively. Moreover, interaction matrices (Figure 6A) show that the significant interactions are distributed widely (though not uniformly) across cells in both brain regions and are not dominated by a few cells in either region. Finally, we investigated the fine temporal structure of prefrontal responses to the firing of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. Consistent with the result that significantly correlated prefrontal cells fire in a tight window after hippocampal cells, the aggregate cross-covariance of the 304 significantly correlated cell pairs (Figures 3Aii and 7Aii, red) shows a single peak at ∼10 ms. Surprisingly, the aggregate cross-covariance of all 2779 cell pairs shows two peaks: the first at 10 ms and a second prominent peak at ∼100 ms (Figure 7Ai, gray). Consistent with this observation, the aggregate cross-covariance of all but the 304 most correlated pairs reveals the second peak at 100 ms, but not the first (Figure 7Aii, black). Thus, the prefrontal response to hippocampal SWR events consists of two phases: a few highly correlated cell pairs at short latency, followed by many cell pairs with weak, but coherent, interactions 100 ms later. These latter interactions at 100 ms are not statistically significant for individual cell pairs (Figure 7Aiii, black), but their aggregate cross-covariance is. Next, we tested the hypothesis that the form of the prefrontal response to hippocampal bursts depends on the strength of the excitatory drive from the hippocampus. To study this question, we used multiunit spiking activity to identify hippocampal bursts (see Experimental Procedures). We then sorted all bursts in order of their strength, measured as the total number of spikes in the burst divided by the number of CA1 cells in the data set (Figure 8Ai), and we plotted the corresponding multiunit prefrontal response to each burst (Figure 8Bi). This arrangement reveals a systematic change in the prefrontal response: smaller hippocampal bursts lead to a single-peaked, short-latency prefrontal response, whereas sufficiently large hippocampal bursts lead to an additional prefrontal response 100 ms later. These more powerful hippocampal bursts are associated with significantly higher power in the spindle band of prefrontal local field potentials (LFPs), consistent with increased spindle activity surrounding these events. Moreover, this increase in spindle power is significantly biased after the onset of these events (Figure 8C). Whereas stronger hippocampal bursts lead to increasingly asymmetric prefrontal spiking, in the form of a second peak (Figure 8B), the hippocampal bursts themselves show no such trend (Figure 8Aii). This finding argues that the second peak is not simply due to asymmetric hippocampal drive, and it suggests instead that it emerges from spindle band activity within sufficiently excited cortical or corticothalamic circuits, as supported by Figure 8C. We note that for one of the data sets, the aggregate prefrontal response to hippocampal bursts also grew with burst strength, but with an opposite, inhibitory sign, and without a secondary peak (Figure S3). These results demonstrate the existence of consistent spike-timing relationships between the hippocampus and the neocortex within the window of plasticity during sleep that can be detected at the single cell-pair level. Previous work has shown monosynaptic projections from CA1 to mPFC (Swanson, 1981Swanson L.W. A direct projection from ammon's horn to prefrontal cortex in the rat.Brain Res. 1981; 217: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) that are excitatory (Thierry et al., 2000Thierry A.M. Gioanni Y. Dégenètais E. Hippocampo-prefrontal cortex pathway: anatomical and electrophysiological characteristics.Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and plastic (Laroche et al., 2000Laroche S. Davis S. Jay T.M. Plasticity at hippocampal to prefrontal cortex synapses: dual roles in working memory and consolidation.Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Combined with these studies, our results show in a naturally sleeping animal that the hippocampus and mPFC satisfy two major requirements of activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms as they are currently understood: synaptic contact and consistent spike timing. In addition to plasticity at CA1-mPFC synapses, the combination of population bursts in CA1 and consistent CA1-mPFC spike timing could lead to precise timing in cortico-cortical networks within the window of plasticity, perhaps under the additional organizing influence of contemporaneous cortical spindles (Siapas and Wilson, 1998Siapas A.G.

Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Such hippocampus-driven reorganization of cortical circuits is a key building block of current models of memory consolidation. The potential link between hippocampal-prefrontal interactions and systems-level consolidation is further strengthened by evidence that the mPFC is differentially activated (Maviel et al., 2004Maviel T. Durkin T.P. Menzaghi F. Bontempi B. Sites of neocortical reorganization critical for remote spatial memory.Science. 2004; 305: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and required (Takehara et al., 2003Takehara K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Time-dependent reorganization of the brain components underlying memory retention in trace eyeblink conditioning.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9897-9905PubMed Google Scholar) for the recall of remote, but not recent, hippocampus-dependent memories. A critical parameter for any theory of memory consolidation is the direction of signal flow during sleep, namely, whether the hippocampus leads the neocortex or vice versa. In particular, a prominent model of memory consolidation requires evidence for information flow from the hippocampus to the neocortex during sleep (Tononi et al., 2006Tononi G. Massimini M. Riedner B. Sleepy dialogues between cortex and hippocampus: Who talks to whom?.Neuron. 2006; 52: 748-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our data provide a clear answer at the single cell-pair level, at least for mPFC and area CA1, to this key question, on timescales relevant to synaptic plasticity. Over longer timescales, recent studies have found that neocortical activity, in turn, can bias the timing of SWR events relative to cortical “slow” oscillations (0.5–1.5 Hz) or up and down states (Mölle et al., 2006Mölle M.

In addition, the current results may be specific to the CA1-mPFC circuit, and the timing of cortico-hippocampal interactions may differ in other cortical areas (Sirota et al., 2003Sirota A. Csicsvari J. Buhl D. Buzsáki G. Communication between neocortex and hippocampus during sleep in rodents.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Studying these differences in multiple cortical areas by using the experimental and analysis framework presented here could substantially enrich our understanding of how hippocampal activity effects circuit-level changes across the neocortex. A unitary role for hippocampal population bursts in memory consolidation has been previously proposed based on their ability to drive cortical targets and engage plasticity mechanisms (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1996Chrobak J.J. Buzsáki G. High-frequency oscillations in the output networks of the hippocampal-entorhinal axis of the freely behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3056-3066PubMed Google Scholar). Our data confirm the critical importance of these population events for establishing consistent lead-lag relationships between hippocampal and prefrontal unit activity during sleep. Moreover, our results identify a nonlinear relationship between the magnitude of hippocampal bursts and the patterning of the prefrontal response, with more potent bursts leading to biphasic cortical responses and an increase in spindle band activity after the burst. Thus, although SWR bursts are unitary events in the hippocampus, variations in their strengths lead to qualitatively different cortical responses that may serve different functions. In one of the four data sets, we found a low-latency prefrontal response that grew with burst strength but with an inhibitory sign (Figure S3). A possible explanation for this difference is that this data set samples disproportionately from prefrontal cells receiving inhibitory input from other prefrontal units that are highly correlated with hippocampal cells (Tierney et al., 2004Tierney P.L. Dégenètais E. Thierry A.M. Glowinski J. Gioanni Y. Influence of the hippocampus on interneurons of the rat prefrontal cortex.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this case, one would expect an aggregate prefrontal response resembling that of correlated cell pairs (Figure 7Aii, red curve), but with an opposite sign. This hypothesis could also explain the absence of a secondary response around t = 100 ms for this data set. Despite this difference in aggregate prefrontal response, the incidence of correlated cell pairs and their characteristics are not atypical of the other three (Figure 6). Given the relatively short duration of REM sleep, its resemblance to the awake state in the hippocampus, and its association with dreaming, the function of REM sleep has been a persistent mystery, and its possible role in memory formation has been a longstanding controversy (Stickgold et al., 2001Stickgold R.

The REM sleep-memory consolidation hypothesis.Science. 2001; 294: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This study identifies a major distinction in cortico-hippocampal interactions between SWS and REM sleep. Computational theories of memory consolidation have identified the needs both for the gradual transfer of memory traces from the hippocampus to the neocortex (McClelland et al., 1995McClelland J.L. McNaughton B.L. O'Reilly R.C. Why there are complementary learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex: insights from the successes and failures of connectionist models of learning and memory.Psychol. Rev. 1995; 102: 419-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar) as well as reorganization of the memory traces themselves, driven by intrinsic activity rather than external input (Lubenov and Siapas, 2008Lubenov E.V. Siapas A.G. Decoupling through synchrony in neuronal circuits with propagation delays.Neuron. 2008; 58: 118-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Crick and Mitchison, 1983Crick F.

A learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines.Cogn. Sci. 1985; 9: 147-169Crossref Google Scholar). The former requires concerted activity in the hippocampus and neocortex; by contrast, the latter benefits from a functional disconnection of the two brain areas. One possibility consistent with our findings, therefore, is that these two needs—transfer and reorganization—are met by SWS and REM sleep, respectively. We note the possibility that although correlated cell pairs in REM sleep are rare, both overall and relative to SWS, they may play an important role in memory consolidation. Nevertheless, we speculate that the scarcity of coordinated cortico-hippocampal spiking during REM sleep may explain why the awake-like neural activity in prefrontal cortex during REM does not interact strongly with the hippocampus and therefore why dreams are, on the whole, forgotten. Electrophysiological signals were acquired by using tetrode recordings (Wilson and McNaughton, 1993Wilson M.A. McNaughton B.L. Dynamics of the hippocampal ensemble code for space.Science. 1993; 261: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Three 3- to 5-month-old male Long-Evans rats (weight = 350–450 g) were implanted with a custom-built microdrive array allowing for the independent adjustment of 24 individual tetrodes and four single-channeled reference electrodes. Twelve tetrodes targeted the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC (AP: 1.5–3.5 mm from bregma; ML: 1–1.75 mm, angled at 15° from the sagittal plane), and 12 tetrodes targeted the dorsal CA1 subfield of the hippocampus (AP: −3.75 to −4.75 mm from bregma; ML: 1.5–3.5 mm). Individual tetrodes were gradually lowered to their targets over several days and further microadjusted to optimize yield and stability. Each tetrode signal was buffered by a unity-gain headstage preamplifier and further differentially amplified with a gain of 2000. The broadband amplified signals were digitally acquired at 25KHz as 24-bit samples (National Instruments PXI-4472) and stored to disk by using custom acquisition software that we have developed. A skull screw above the ipsilateral cerebellum served as an electrical reference for all signals. Three light-emitting diodes were fixed to the top of the microdrive array to allow for tracking of the animal's position from video recordings. Each frame of video was time stamped by the acquisition system in order to synchronize position and neuronal data. All recordings were conducted immediately after the animal had performed a variety of spatial tasks (linear track traversal, T-maze) in a sleep box that was highly familiar to the animal. All animal procedures were done in accordance with National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines and with approval of the Caltech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sleep sessions lasted several hours (n = 4 sessions, 222 ± 19 min; range = 166–246 min) and contained multiple SWS and REM epochs, with a total of ∼0.5 hr per session spent in REM sleep (n = 4 sessions, 29 ± 3 min; range = 23–38 min) and the rest in SWS. We concatenated all SWS and REM episodes to create aggregate SWS and REM epochs for each sleep session. Spikes and LFP traces were obtained by digitally filtering the broadband signal. For spikes, a bandpass filter was designed by using the Parks-McClellan algorithm with transition bands of 500–600 Hz and 6000–6100 Hz and a maximal ripple of 10−5 in the stopband and 10−3 in the passband. LFPs were computed by downsampling the broadband signal by a factor of 12 in three stages (2, 2, 3); each stage used a 500-tap FIR linear-phase lowpass filter designed by using the window method. Spikes were clustered into single units on the basis of their amplitudes recorded on each of the four tetrode channels. Sleep sessions were segmented into periods of SWS and REM by using custom software on the basis of three physiological criteria: (1) muscle tone, recorded from a bipolar EMG electrode in the animal's neck and bandpass filtered to 100–300 Hz; (2) theta power; (3) the ratio of delta/theta power. Theta and delta power were measured by computing the energy of a selected hippocampal LFP in the theta (4–10 Hz) and delta frequency bands (0.5–2 Hz), respectively. Plotting these three features over the course of sleep typically reveals two clusters whose boundary can be cleanly selected by the user. One cluster of relatively low muscle tone, high theta, and low delta/theta power was designated as REM; the remainder was designated as SWS. REM sleep segments separated by less than 10 s were merged into one; following this step, putative REM sleep segments shorter than 30 s were eliminated. Brief periods of awake behavior during sleep sessions were identified by thresholding the speed of the animal by using position data and were removed from the analysis. Cross-covariances between two cells were first computed as raw spike counts by using 10 ms bins. These counts were then normalized to unit normal Z-scores at each lag; this computation is described by Siapas et al., 2005Siapas A.G. Lubenov E.V. Wilson M.A. Prefrontal phase-locking to hippocampal theta oscillations.Neuron. 2005; 46: 141-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar as a standardized cross-covariance. This standardized cross-covariance was smoothed by using a 3-bin boxcar centered around 0. The average cross-covariance between multiple cell pairs was computed by summing the standardized cross-covariances between all of the pairs and dividing by the square-root of the number of pairs. This computation is described by Siapas et al., 2005Siapas A.G. Lubenov E.V. Wilson M.A. Prefrontal phase-locking to hippocampal theta oscillations.Neuron. 2005; 46: 141-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar as the standardized mean cross-covariance. For a given cell pair, (i, j), we defined the peak lag time τij as the time bin of maximal cross-covariance, and the peak value Cij as the median of the cross-covariance at the peak lag and neighboring ±3 bins. This peak value was used as the test statistic for the interaction strength of cell pair (i, j). To convert Cij to a p value (i.e., to find a cumulative density function for Cij), we used one of two Monte-Carlo estimates for each cell pair depending on the value of λ = TΔtRiRj, where T is the total length of the data set in seconds, Δt is the bin size in seconds, and Ri,j are the mean firing rates of cells i and j in spikes per second. Under the null hypothesis of independent Poisson spiking, λ is the intensity of the Poisson process governing the number of spikes in a given bin of the cross-covariance histogram. When λ > 10, the Poisson process can be approximated with a normal distribution, and each bin of the standardized cross-covariance will be distributed as a unit normal. To compute the effect of the smoothing and median filtering that goes into the computation of Cij, we generated 107 101-dimensional vectors of unit normals and computed peak values for each, as defined above, to build an empirical distribution of Cij. The dimensionality of the vectors comes from the number of 10 ms histogram bins centered at 0, ±10, ±20, …, ±500 ms. The empirical distribution of Cij could be approximated very closely by a Gaussian with μ = ½ and σ = 1/3. When λ < 10, the normal approximation is invalid; for these cases, we generated 108 101-dimensional vectors with values (J−λ)/λ, where J is Poisson with intensity λ. In order to manage Type I errors in the face of multiple comparisons while maintaining statistical power, we used the false discovery rate (FDR) framework (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Statist. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar) to compute a single p value threshold for all individual cell pairs such that the expected number of false positives as a function of all positives is a desired fraction, q. Because of the dependencies, both positive and negative, between cell pairs, we used a version of FDR that does not assume independence nor positive dependence between tests (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001Benjamini Y. Yekutieli D. The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency.Ann. Stat. 2001; 29: 1165-1188Crossref Scopus (6196) Google Scholar). In all of this work, we use q = 0.01. This criterion led to p values for individual tests of 1.3 × 10−4 for SWS and 7.9 × 10−6 for REM sleep. To compare the cross-covariance of all prefrontal and hippocampal cell pairs over short timescales across SWS and REM, for each cell pair, (i, j), we computed Kij(m), defined as the number of prefrontal spikes from prefrontal unit i falling 0–100 ms after hippocampal unit j during sleep stage m, where m = (1,2) for SWS and REM, respectively. Under the null hypothesis of independent Poisson firing, Kij(m) is Poisson with intensity λij(m)=Ni(m)Nj(m)Δt/T(m), where Ni,j(m) is the total number of spikes from the prefrontal unit i (or hippocampal unit j) in sleep stage m, T(m) is the duration of sleep stage m, and Δt = 100 ms. Because λij(m) > 10 for all pairs, we used the normal approximation to the Poisson to create standardized counts Zij(m)=(Kij(m)−λij(m))/λij(m); under the null hypothesis, Zij(m) are standard normal variables. We then compared the samples Zij(1) to Zij(2) by using a paired t test. For each CA1 tetrode, we filtered the broadband signals between 80 and 250 Hz by using Parks-McClellan FIR filters, and we extracted the instantaneous amplitude and phase of the filtered signals by using the Hilbert transform. We identified candidate events as deviations in the amplitudes of the filtered traces that exceeded a threshold set as the mean plus twice the standard deviation. Candidate events separated by less than 15 ms were merged. From the remaining events, we identified ripples as candidate events that exceeded 20 ms in duration and that were consistently detected across multiple CA1 tetrodes (average amplitude from all CA1 tetrodes exceeding 30 μV). Hippocampal bursts were identified by using the peaks of the mean multiunit firing rate, rH(t), which was computed by binning the multiunit activity of putative CA1 pyramidal cells in 5 ms bins, smoothing the counts with a Gaussian window with 3σ = 50 ms, and dividing by the number of single units. The peaks of the resulting time series, tˆi, were identified as local maxima with amplitudes at least two standard deviations above the mean. Each row of Figure 8A was computed by sorting bursts by their spiking integrated ±100 ms around their peak value, in ascending order, extracting rH(t) at intervals of Ti={t:|t−tˆsort(i)|≤500ms} to form each row, and standardizing each row by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. Each row of Figure 8B was computed in the same way as A, substituting mPFC firing for CA1, but using the same time intervals, Ti. Finally, spindle amplitudes in Figure 8C were computed by filtering the LFP signal from a selected prefrontal tetrode in each data set in the spindle band (7–15 Hz) by using Parks-McClellan FIR filters, calculating the magnitude of its Hilbert transform, and smoothing the resulting envelope with a Gaussian window with 3σ = 120 ms. To enable comparison across data sets, the envelopes were normalized by subtracting their means and dividing by their standard deviations. Each row of Figure 8C corresponds to the same time intervals, Ti, as in panels A and B.

https://openalex.org/W2022298513,"Females of many animal species behave very differently before and after mating. In Drosophila melanogaster, changes in female behavior upon mating are triggered by the sex peptide (SP), a small peptide present in the male's seminal fluid. SP activates a specific receptor, the sex peptide receptor (SPR), which is broadly expressed in the female reproductive tract and nervous system. Here, we pinpoint the action of SPR to a small subset of internal sensory neurons that innervate the female uterus and oviduct. These neurons express both fruitless (fru), a marker for neurons likely to have sex-specific functions, and pickpocket (ppk), a marker for proprioceptive neurons. We show that SPR expression in these fru+ ppk+ neurons is both necessary and sufficient for behavioral changes induced by mating. These neurons project to regions of the central nervous system that have been implicated in the control of reproductive behaviors in Drosophila and other insects."
https://openalex.org/W2075098510,"The Pliocene warm interval has been difficult to explain. We reconstructed the latitudinal distribution of sea surface temperature around 4 million years ago, during the early Pliocene. Our reconstruction shows that the meridional temperature gradient between the equator and subtropics was greatly reduced, implying a vast poleward expansion of the ocean tropical warm pool. Corroborating evidence indicates that the Pacific temperature contrast between the equator and 32 degrees N has evolved from approximately 2 degrees C 4 million years ago to approximately 8 degrees C today. The meridional warm pool expansion evidently had enormous impacts on the Pliocene climate, including a slowdown of the atmospheric Hadley circulation and El Niño-like conditions in the equatorial region. Ultimately, sustaining a climate state with weak tropical sea surface temperature gradients may require additional mechanisms of ocean heat uptake (such as enhanced ocean vertical mixing)."
https://openalex.org/W2124163128,"The contribution of common genetic variation to one or more established smoking behaviors was investigated in a joint analysis of two genome wide association studies (GWAS) performed as part of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project in 2,329 men from the Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Trial, and 2,282 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). We analyzed seven measures of smoking behavior, four continuous (cigarettes per day [CPD], age at initiation of smoking, duration of smoking, and pack years), and three binary (ever versus never smoking, ≤10 versus >10 cigarettes per day [CPDBI], and current versus former smoking). Association testing for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was conducted by study and adjusted for age, cohabitation/marital status, education, site, and principal components of population substructure. None of the SNPs achieved genome-wide significance (p<10−7) in any combined analysis pooling evidence for association across the two studies; we observed between two and seven SNPs with p<10−5 for each of the seven measures. In the chr15q25.1 region spanning the nicotinic receptors CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, we identified multiple SNPs associated with CPD (p<10−3), including rs1051730, which has been associated with nicotine dependence, smoking intensity and lung cancer risk. In parallel, we selected 11,199 SNPs drawn from 359 a priori candidate genes and performed individual-gene and gene-group analyses. After adjusting for multiple tests conducted within each gene, we identified between two and five genes associated with each measure of smoking behavior. Besides CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, MAOA was associated with CPDBI (gene-level p<5.4×10−5), our analysis provides independent replication of the association between the chr15q25.1 region and smoking intensity and data for multiple other loci associated with smoking behavior that merit further follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2163588736,"Although many studies have shown that attention to a stimulus can enhance the responses of individual cortical sensory neurons, little is known about how attention accomplishes this change in response. Here, we propose that attention-based changes in neuronal responses depend on the same response normalization mechanism that adjusts sensory responses whenever multiple stimuli are present. We have implemented a model of attention that assumes that attention works only through this normalization mechanism, and show that it can replicate key effects of attention. The model successfully explains how attention changes the gain of responses to individual stimuli and also why modulation by attention is more robust and not a simple gain change when multiple stimuli are present inside a neuron's receptive field. Additionally, the model accounts well for physiological data that measure separately attentional modulation and sensory normalization of the responses of individual neurons in area MT in visual cortex. The proposal that attention works through a normalization mechanism sheds new light a broad range of observations on how attention alters the representation of sensory information in cerebral cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2093279832,"Conventional use of the site-specific recombinase Cre is a powerful technology in mouse, but almost absent in other vertebrate model organisms. In zebrafish, Cre-mediated recombination efficiency was previously very low. Here we show that using transposon-mediated transgenesis, Cre is in fact highly efficient in this organism. Furthermore, temporal control of recombination can be achieved by using the ligand-inducible CreER(T2). Site-specific recombination only occurs upon administration of the drug tamoxifen (TAM) or its active metabolite, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT). Cre-mediated recombination is detectable already 4 or 2 hours after administration of TAM or 4-OHT, demonstrating fast recombination kinetics. In addition, low doses of TAM allow mosaic labeling of single cells. Combined, our results show that conditional Cre/lox will be a valuable tool for both, embryonic and adult zebrafish studies. Furthermore, single copy insertion transgenesis of Cre/lox constructs suggest a strategy suitable also for other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2004873650,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release remain largely unknown. In a screen, we isolated mutations in Drosophila ephexin (Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factor) that disrupt the homeostatic enhancement of presynaptic release following impairment of postsynaptic glutamate receptor function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We show that Ephexin is sufficient presynaptically for synaptic homeostasis and localizes in puncta throughout the nerve terminal. However, ephexin mutations do not alter other aspects of neuromuscular development, including morphology or active zone number. We then show that, during synaptic homeostasis, Ephexin functions primarily with Cdc42 in a signaling system that converges upon the presynaptic CaV2.1 calcium channel. Finally, we show that Ephexin binds the Drosophila Eph receptor (Eph) and Eph mutants disrupt synaptic homeostasis.

Homeostatic signaling systems, operating at the level of individual nerve and muscle cells, are believed to interface with the mechanisms of neural plasticity to ensure that neural function remains stable over time (Burrone and Murthy, 2003Burrone J.

There are two general mechanisms by which homeostatic regulatory systems have been proposed to control neuronal excitability. In one paradigm, chronic perturbations of neuronal activity have been observed to cause compensatory changes to ion channel or neurotransmitter receptor abundance (Davis, 2006Davis G.W.

For example, impaired postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) initiates a rapid, compensatory increase in presynaptic release that offsets impaired receptor function and restores muscle excitation (Davis, 2006Davis G.W.

Work at the Drosophila NMJ has begun to uncover genes that are required for homeostatic compensation. It was recently demonstrated that homeostatic modulation of presynaptic release (synaptic homeostasis) is blocked by mutations that disrupt the function of a presynaptic CaV2.1 calcium channel subunit encoded by the gene cacophony (cac) (Frank et al., 2006Frank C.A.

Mechanisms underlying the rapid induction and sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis.Neuron. 2006; 52: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The observation that synaptic homeostasis, following inhibition of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, is blocked by mutations in a presynaptic calcium channel has been taken as further molecular evidence for the existence of a retrograde signal at this NMJ (Davis, 2006Davis G.W. Homeostatic control of neural activity: from phenomenology to molecular design.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Frank et al., 2006Frank C.A.

Mechanisms underlying the rapid induction and sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis.Neuron. 2006; 52: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The nature of this homeostatic, retrograde signal has been of great interest. Recent data have provided evidence that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling can function as a retrograde signal at the Drosophila NMJ, coupling the developmental growth of the muscle to the growth of the presynaptic nerve terminal (Aberle et al., 2002Aberle H. Haghighi A.P. Fetter R.D. McCabe B.D. Magalhaes T.R.

The BMP homolog Gbb provides a retrograde signal that regulates synaptic growth at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.Neuron. 2003; 39: 241-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Although this same BMP signaling system is required for synaptic homeostasis at the Drosophila NMJ, the BMPs do not function as the retrograde signal that directly modulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release (Goold and Davis, 2007Goold C.P. Davis G.W. The BMP ligand Gbb gates the expression of synaptic homeostasis independent of synaptic growth control.Neuron. 2007; 56: 109-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Rather, the BMPs confer competence upon the motoneurons such that they are able to express homeostatic plasticity (Goold and Davis, 2007Goold C.P. Davis G.W. The BMP ligand Gbb gates the expression of synaptic homeostasis independent of synaptic growth control.Neuron. 2007; 56: 109-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the nature of the retrograde signal that directly mediates the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic release remains unknown. Likewise, nothing is known regarding the signaling systems that reside within the presynaptic nerve terminal that couple retrograde signaling to the modulation of CaV2.1 calcium channels that appears necessary for a homeostatic change in synaptic vesicle release. Here we identify and characterize core components of a presynaptic signaling system that is necessary for the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic release at the Drosophila NMJ. We provide evidence that Ephexin (Exn), a Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF), is a presynaptic protein that is required for the homeostatic modulation of vesicle release. We then provide evidence that, during synaptic homeostasis, Exn acts primarily via Cdc42 within a signaling system that converges upon the CaV2.1 calcium channel. Finally, we show that Drosophila Ephexin, like its vertebrate homolog, binds to the Eph receptor. We then show that Eph mutants disrupt the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic release at the Drosophila NMJ. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Drosophila Eph receptor may receive a retrograde signal at the presynaptic nerve terminal. Exn and Cdc42 could then couple Eph activation to the modulation of CaV2.1 calcium channels necessary for the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic release. These data not only significantly advance our understanding of the presynaptic signaling systems that mediate a homeostatic modulation of presynaptic release but also define a function for Rho-GTPase signaling in the modulation of synaptic transmission at a fast, glutamatergic synapse. As part of an ongoing, large-scale screen, we have identified mutations in the gene CG3799 that disrupt the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release at the Drosophila NMJ. The gene CG3799 is annotated as the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF) termed exn. The N-terminal half of CG3799 is not conserved. However, the C-terminal half is highly homologous to vertebrate ephexin, including the presence of a Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) domain (Rho-GEF domain) and an SH3 domain (Shamah et al., 2001Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M. Hu L. Bazalakova M. Neve R.L. Corfas G. Debant A. Greenberg M.E.

These homologies strongly predict that CG3799 functions as a Rho-GEF. Based upon sequence homology, domain organization, and the current annotation of this gene in FlyBase, we refer to this gene as Drosophila exn (Figure 1). To complete a genetic analysis of Drosophila exn, we took advantage of a P element insertion mutation in the exn gene (exnEY01953; BDGP gene disruption project) (Bellen et al., 2004Bellen H.J. Levis R.W. Liao G. He Y. Carlson J.W. Tsang G. Evans-Holm M. Hiesinger P.R. Schulze K.L. Rubin G.M. et al.The BDGP gene disruption project: single transposon insertions associated with 40% of Drosophila genes.Genetics. 2004; 167: 761-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). This transposon insertion resides within the coding sequence of exon 2 (Figure 1A) and, as such, is predicted to cause a severe loss of gene function. In order to perform a genetic analysis of Drosophila exn, we generated additional alleles. We first excised the P(EY01953) transposon and screened for both imprecise and precise P element excisions. We isolated two imprecise excisions of the P(EY01953) transposon termed exnEY-Δ50 and exnEY-Δ23. These new mutations are deletions that remove large portions of the exn gene and are predicted to be null mutations (Figure 1). We also isolated exnEY-5, which is a precise excision of the P(EY01953) transposon (Figure 1A). We used these genetic tools to further test the requirement of exn for the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic release at the Drosophila NMJ. Mutations in the GluRIIA subunit of the muscle-specific glutamate receptor (GluRIIASP16) cause a significant decrease in the average spontaneous miniature release event (mepsp) amplitude (Petersen et al., 1997Petersen S.A. Fetter R.D. Noordermeer J.N. Goodman C.S. DiAntonio A. Genetic analysis of glutamate receptors in Drosophila reveals a retrograde signal regulating presynaptic transmitter release.Neuron. 1997; 19: 1237-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The decrease in mepsp amplitude is offset by a significant increase in presynaptic transmitter release as assessed by calculation of quantal content (see Experimental Procedures). This increase in quantal content has been confirmed to represent a change in presynaptic transmitter release by analysis of failures (Petersen et al., 1997Petersen S.A. Fetter R.D. Noordermeer J.N. Goodman C.S. DiAntonio A. Genetic analysis of glutamate receptors in Drosophila reveals a retrograde signal regulating presynaptic transmitter release.Neuron. 1997; 19: 1237-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and analysis of short-term synaptic plasticity (Frank et al., 2006Frank C.A. Kennedy M.J. Goold C.P. Marek K.W. Davis G.W. Mechanisms underlying the rapid induction and sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis.Neuron. 2006; 52: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This effect has been interpreted as evidence for a homeostatic modulation of presynaptic transmitter release, a conclusion supported by additional electrophysiological experiments using pharmacological agents to impair postsynaptic glutamate receptor function (Frank et al., 2006Frank C.A. Kennedy M.J. Goold C.P. Marek K.W. Davis G.W. Mechanisms underlying the rapid induction and sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis.Neuron. 2006; 52: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To analyze the requirements of exn for synaptic homeostasis, we generated double mutants of all exn alleles with the glutamate receptor mutation GluRIIASP16. We first demonstrate that the spontaneous mepsp amplitude is significantly decreased in the GluRIIASP16; exnEY01953 double mutant, an effect that is similar to that in the GluRIIASP16 mutant alone (Figure 2A). However, the homeostatic increase in presynaptic transmitter release is severely impaired in these double mutant animals (Figure 2; p = 0.01). These data suggest that disruption of the exn gene prevents the normal expression of synaptic homeostasis at the Drosophila NMJ. To confirm the specificity of this effect, we examined animals in which we place the precise P element excision allele (exnEY-5) in the background of the GluRIIASP16 mutation. In these animals, the significant decrease in mepsp amplitude is offset by an increase in presynaptic release, restoring excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitudes toward control values, thereby demonstrating normal homeostatic modulation of presynaptic transmitter release (Figure 2A). The exn gene appears to be ubiquitously expressed throughout most tissues in the Drosophila embryo including the central and peripheral nervous systems, as assessed by RNA in situ hybridization (data not shown). Therefore, we performed genetic rescue experiments to determine whether exn functions in the presynaptic neuron during the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic release. To do so, we generated transgenic animals that allow the expression of a UAS-YFP-exn transgene (YFP is placed at the extreme N terminus of the exn cDNA; see Experimental Procedures). We then expressed UAS-YFP-exn using a pan-neuronal GAL4 driver (elav-GAL4) in the GluRIIA; exn double mutant background. We performed the rescue experiments using both the exn P element insertion mutation exnEY10953 and the putative null allele exnEY-Δ23 in the GluRIIA mutant background. We find that presynaptic expression of UAS-YFP-exn is sufficient to fully rescue the expression of synaptic homeostasis in both the GluRIIA; exnEY10953 and the GluRIIA; exnEY-Δ23 double mutant backgrounds (Figure 3). These experiments demonstrate that presynaptic expression of exn is sufficient to restore synaptic homeostasis in an exn mutant background. To visualize Exn localization within the presynaptic nerve terminal, we imaged YFP-Exn in animals that express UAS-YFP-exn using the elaV-GAL4 driver. Because presynaptic expression of YFP-Exn is sufficient to rescue defective synaptic homeostasis in the exn mutant, the distribution of ectopically expressed YFP-Exn should reflect, at least in part, the endogenous localization of Exn during the process of synaptic homeostasis. In support of this approach, numerous synaptic proteins have been shown to have appropriate subsynaptic localization when overexpressed epitope-tagged proteins are visualized (Heerssen et al., 2008Heerssen H.

Unrestricted synaptic growth in spinster—a late endosomal protein implicated in TGF-β-mediated synaptic growth regulation.Neuron. 2002; 36: 403-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We find that YFP-Exn is efficiently trafficked to the presynaptic nerve terminal at the NMJ (Figure 4). YFP-Exn localizes to small puncta that are distributed throughout the presynaptic nerve terminal. These YFP-Exn puncta are found in close proximity to active zones, defined by costaining with antibodies that recognize postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters (Figures 4B and 4C). However, our image analysis indicates that YFP-Exn is not strictly an active zone-associated protein because it is not found in direct opposition to all glutamate receptor clusters, whereas the active zone-associated protein Bruchpilot (Brp) is found opposed to each postsynaptic glutamate receptor cluster (Pielage et al., 2006Pielage J.

From these data, we conclude that Exn is trafficked to the presynaptic nerve terminal and resides in a position where it could reasonably participate in the modulation of presynaptic vesicle release. We next examined baseline synaptic transmission in the exn mutant background. We observe a small, but statistically significant, defect in synaptic vesicle release in the exn mutants compared to wild-type (WT) controls (Figures 5A and 5B). We also observe a trend toward an increase in mepsp amplitude (p > 0.10). We assayed presynaptic release over a range of external calcium concentrations (0.2–0.5 mM). We find a statistically significant decrease in presynaptic release in exn compared to wild-type at each calcium concentration tested (Figure 5C). Nevertheless, our data indicate that the calcium cooperativity of vesicle release remains normal in the exn mutant background. These data highlight a requirement for exn within the presynaptic nerve terminal, either during NMJ development, which could have a basal requirement for synaptic homeostasis, or in the regulation of synaptic vesicle release. Because synaptic homeostasis is normal in mutant backgrounds that disrupt baseline synaptic transmission to a far greater extent than exn (including mutations in syx1A and cysteine string protein; Goold and Davis, 2007Goold C.P. Davis G.W. The BMP ligand Gbb gates the expression of synaptic homeostasis independent of synaptic growth control.Neuron. 2007; 56: 109-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we speculate that the change in baseline synaptic transmission is not the primary cause of impaired synaptic homeostasis, although it could contribute. We also find that the percent decrease in quantal content in exn compared to wild-type is significantly less than the percent decrease in quantal content in GluRIIA; exn double mutant animals compared to GluRIIA mutants (Figure 2; p < 0.05). Again, these data suggest that Exn has an important function during synaptic homeostasis. We next determined whether exn mutations alter anatomical NMJ development or active zone number. It has been established that synaptic growth is normal in the GluRIIASP16 mutant background (Petersen et al., 1997Petersen S.A. Fetter R.D. Noordermeer J.N. Goodman C.S. DiAntonio A. Genetic analysis of glutamate receptors in Drosophila reveals a retrograde signal regulating presynaptic transmitter release.Neuron. 1997; 19: 1237-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and that the rapid induction of synaptic homeostasis is protein synthesis independent and occurs without a change in NMJ morphology or active zone number (Frank et al., 2006Frank C.A. Kennedy M.J. Goold C.P. Marek K.W. Davis G.W. Mechanisms underlying the rapid induction and sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis.Neuron. 2006; 52: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that a defect in NMJ development could disrupt the NMJ such that it could not express homeostatic plasticity. Therefore, we examined NMJ morphology and active zone number in GluRIIASP16 animals compared to GluRIIASP16; exn double mutant animals. We stained NMJs with anti-HRP and anti-Brp antibodies, which mark the presynaptic membrane and presynaptic active zone, respectively (Pielage et al., 2006Pielage J. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. A postsynaptic spectrin scaffold defines active zone size, spacing, and efficacy at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.J.

We find that the GluRIIASP16; exn double mutants have a slight, though statistically significant, increase in bouton number (Figure 6). Thus, decreased NMJ growth cannot account for impaired synaptic homeostasis in these animals. We also quantified the average number of active zones per NMJ using anti-Brp to define active zones as done previously (Pielage et al., 2006Pielage J. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. A postsynaptic spectrin scaffold defines active zone size, spacing, and efficacy at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Active zones were visualized and quantified in three dimensions, allowing us to quantify total active zone number per NMJ. We find no difference in average active zone number per NMJ in GluRIIA mutants versus GluRIIASP16; exn double mutants (Figure 6F). Thus, the exn-dependent block of synaptic homeostasis is not a secondary consequence of defective morphological development or a deficit in presynaptic active zone number. It is formally possible that the small increase in bouton number reflects a response of the NMJ to impaired synaptic homeostasis. However, this seems unlikely because the change is small and there is no change in total active zone number. In a previous study, we demonstrated that cacophony (cac) mutations, which impair the pore-forming subunit of the CaV2.1 presynaptic calcium channel, completely block synaptic homeostasis at the Drosophila NMJ (Frank et al., 2006Frank C.A.

Mechanisms underlying the rapid induction and sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis.Neuron. 2006; 52: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To test for a genetic interaction between exn and cac, we generated double heterozygous mutant combinations (cac/+; exn/+) within a GluRIIA mutant background. The exn/+ heterozygous mutations (exnEY01953/+ and exnEY-Δ23/+) alone had no significant effect on synaptic homeostasis when placed in the GluRIIA mutant background (Figure 7A; p > 0.2; data not shown), whereas the presence of the cacS/+ mutation (a point mutation) in the GluRIIA mutant background showed a mild suppression (24% decrease; p < 0."

To study nutritional control of larval development, we analyzed growth and gene expression profiles during L1 arrest and recovery. Larvae that were fed responded relatively slowly to starvation compared with the rapid response of arrested larvae to feeding. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) followed by deep sequencing showed that during L1 arrest, Pol II continued transcribing starvation-response genes, but the enzyme accumulated on the promoters of growth and development genes. In response to feeding, promoter accumulation decreased, and elongation and messenger RNA levels increased. Therefore, accumulation of Pol II at promoters anticipates nutritionally controlled gene expression during C. elegans development."

The mechanism(s) by which CFTR mediates inflammatory signaling is under debate.We tested the hypothesis that wt-CFTR down-regulates NFkappaB mediated IL-8 secretion. We transiently co-expressed wt-CFTR and IL-8 or NFkappaB promoters driving luciferase expression in HEK293 cells. Wt-CFTR expression in HEK293 cells suppresses both basal and IL1beta induced IL-8, and NFkappaB promoter activities as compared to the control cells transfected with empty vector (p<0.05). We also confirmed these results using CFBE41o- cells and observed that cells stably transduced with wt-CFTR secrete significantly lower amounts of IL-8 chemokine as compared to non-transfected control cells. To test the hypothesis that CFTR must be localized to cell surface lipid rafts in polarized airway epithelial cells in order to mediate the inflammatory response, we treated CFBE41o- cells that had been stably transduced with wt-CFTR with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD). At baseline, CD significantly (p<0.05) induced IL-8 and NFkappaB reporter activities as compared to control cells suggesting a negative regulation of NFkappaB mediated IL-8 signaling by CFTR in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Untreated cells exposed to the CFTR channel blocker CFTR-172 inhibitor developed a similar increase in IL-8 and NFkappaB reporter activities suggesting that not only must CFTR be present on the cell surface but it must be functional. We verified these results in vivo by comparing survival, body weight and pro-inflammatory cytokine response to P. aeruginosa LPS in CFTR knock out (CFKO) mice as compared to wild type controls. There was a significant (p<0.05) decrease in survival and body weight, an elevation in IL-1beta in whole lung extract (p<0.01), as well as a significant increase in phosphorylated IkappaB, an inducer of NFkappaB mediated signaling in the CFKO mice.Our data suggest that CFTR is a negative regulator of NFkappaB mediated innate immune response and its localization to lipid rafts is involved in control of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2060964204,"The C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) cascade plays a central role in regulating life span, dauer, metabolism, and stress. The major regulatory control of IIS is through phosphorylation of its components by serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. An RNAi screen for serine/threonine protein phosphatases that counterbalance the effect of the kinases in the IIS pathway identified pptr-1, a B56 regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Modulation of pptr-1 affects IIS pathway-associated phenotypes including life span, dauer, stress resistance, and fat storage. We show that PPTR-1 functions by regulating worm AKT-1 phosphorylation at Thr 350. With striking conservation, mammalian B56beta regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In C. elegans, this ultimately leads to changes in subcellular localization and transcriptional activity of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16. This study reveals a conserved role for the B56 regulatory subunit in regulating insulin signaling through AKT dephosphorylation, thereby having widespread implications in cancer and diabetes research."

The ability to keep track of information and one's actions from moment to moment is necessary to accomplish even the simple tasks of everyday life. Lateral prefrontal cortices in primates, especially dorsolateral areas 46 and 9, have a key role in the process broadly called working memory (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S.

The ACC is involved in affective and mnemonic processing, but is also engaged in cognitive operations, especially in tasks with high cognitive demands. However, there is no general agreement on the specific role of dorsolateral areas and the ACC in cognitive control (Devinsky et al., 1995Devinsky O. Morrell M.J.

Corticocortical pathways in primates are excitatory and mainly form synapses with other excitatory neurons (White, 1989White E.L. Cortical Circuits. Synaptic Organization of the Cerebral Cortex.

Salient features of synaptic organisation in the cerebral cortex.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 113-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Theoretical computational studies have proposed that interactions between excitatory neurons underlie selection of relevant signals (Wang, 2001Wang X.J. Synaptic reverberation underlying mnemonic persistent activity.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). A smaller but significant proportion of axons from excitatory neurons form synapses with inhibitory GABAergic neurons, triggering inhibition at the site of termination. Though fewer in number than excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons are considerably more diverse in morphology and function (Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A. Silberberg G. Wu C. Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). In primates, inhibitory neurons can be grouped into three nonoverlapping neurochemical classes identified by their expression of the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR), and calbindin (CB), though each class contains several morphological types (DeFelipe, 1997DeFelipe J.

Neuroanat. 1997; 14: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). PV neurons innervate the proximal dendrites, soma, or axon initial segment of other neurons, eliciting strong inhibition (DeFelipe et al., 1989bDeFelipe J. Hendry S.H. Jones E.G.

CB neurons innervate mostly distal dendrites of excitatory neurons (DeFelipe et al., 1989aDeFelipe J. Hendry S.H. Jones E.G.

CR neurons preferentially innervate other inhibitory neurons in the upper cortical layers, and thus have a disinhibitory role (Meskenaite, 1997Meskenaite V.

Disinhibition by CR neurons is thought to enhance signals, whereas CB neurons dampen activity at the fringes of active cortical columns to suppress noise, collectively enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of relevant activity in working memory (Wang et al., 2004Wang X.J. Tegner J. Constantinidis C. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Division of labor among distinct subtypes of inhibitory neurons in a cortical microcircuit of working memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Prefrontal pathways might interact with these inhibitory neurons to improve response selectivity in behavioral tasks, which is disrupted after blockade of GABAergic activity (Rao et al., 1999Rao S.G. Williams G.V. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Isodirectional tuning of adjacent interneurons and pyramidal cells during working memory: evidence for microcolumnar organization in PFC.J.

Destruction and creation of spatial tuning by disinhibition: GABA(A) blockade of prefrontal cortical neurons engaged by working memory.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 485-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, microstimulation of the interareal pathway from prefrontal area 8 improves sensitivity to target stimuli in visual cortex by increasing their gain and decreasing noise from competing signals (Moore et al., 2003Moore T. Armstrong K.M. Fallah M. Visuomotor origins of covert spatial attention.Neuron. 2003; 40: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004Reynolds J.H. Chelazzi L. Attentional modulation of visual processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). We reasoned that because ACC and dorsolateral areas differ in their capacity for inhibitory control in cognitive tasks, they might interact differentially with inhibitory neurons. One possibility is that the functionally distinct ACC might help reduce noise by innervating CB neurons in dorsolateral area 9, whereas area 46 might innervate more CR neurons and disinhibit the related area 9, particularly in the upper layers where these interneurons are most prevalent (Condé et al., 1994Condé F.

The synaptic underpinnings of working memory functions for selection and suppression of signals are not known. To address this issue, we investigated the synaptic organization of dorsolateral area 46 and ACC (area 32) with excitatory and inhibitory neurons in dorsolateral area 9. This design allowed us to study the synaptic pathway between two related areas with respect to working memory (dorsolateral area 46 to dorsolateral area 9), and between two distinct areas (ACC to dorsolateral area 9). We provide evidence that the ACC has more prevalent and larger synapses with inhibitory neurons in area 9, in patterns suggesting increased inhibitory control in demanding cognitive tasks. To compare the organization of two pathways, one from dorsolateral area 46 and the other from ACC (area 32), we investigated their synapses within the upper layers (I-IIIa) of area 9. Figure 1 summarizes the essence of our experimental approach. Briefly, injection of distinct neural tracers in areas 32 (Figure 1A, gray and white) and 46 (Figure 1B, gray and black) labeled axon terminals in area 9. We examined at the light and electron microscope (EM) sites in area 9 with labeled terminals among excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which were labeled for PV, CB, or CR (Figure 1B, dotted fill and inset). Labeled terminals from the two pathways were dense in the central anteroposterior extent of area 9. Axon terminals from area 32 were diffuse and widespread, with a strong bias for the upper layers (I–IIIa; Figure 1C), and from area 46 they were more restricted and columnar, including the middle layers (IIIb–Va; Figure 1D). As summarized in Figure 2A, we found three major types of terminals (boutons) from axons originating in area 32 (n = 345 boutons, from three cases) and area 46 (n = 325, from two cases), based on their synapses and postsynaptic targets in area 9. The first and largest group formed single synapses with spines emerging from spiny dendrites of excitatory neurons (from area 32, 69% of labeled boutons; from area 46, 80%; Figures 2A, bouton 1; 2B, 2C, and 2H; see Table S1, available online). The second group of labeled boutons innervated aspiny or sparsely spiny dendritic shafts, characteristic of cortical inhibitory neurons (area 32, 18%; area 46, 13%; Figures 2A, bouton 2; 2D, 2E, and 2I). The third group consisted of multisynaptic boutons that formed synapses with two or more spines (area 32, 6%; area 46, 5%; Figures 2A, bouton 3e; 2F and 2J), or 1 or 2 spines and an aspiny or sparsely spiny dendritic shaft (area 32, 7%; area 46, 3%; Figures 2A, bouton 3m; 2G and 2K). Only a few labeled boutons formed synapses on shafts of spiny dendrites (≤1%). Labeled boutons that appeared to be non-synaptic varicosities were not included in this analysis (4% for area 32; 8% for area 46). We classified boutons with major diameters less than 1.0 μm (2D analysis), or volumes < 0.2 μm3 (3D analysis) as small, and boutons above this size as large, based on cluster analysis (p < 0.01; Figures 3A–3C). Bouton size is correlated with the number of synaptic vesicles (Germuska et al., 2006Germuska M. Saha S. Fiala J. Barbas H. Synaptic distinction of laminar specific prefrontal-temporal pathways in primates.Cereb. Cortex. 2006; 16: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and synaptic efficacy (Murthy et al., 1997Murthy V.N. Sejnowski T.J. Stevens C.F. Heterogeneous release properties of visualized individual hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1997; 18: 599-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Small boutons made up the majority in each pathway (Figure 3D, gray bars). A smaller but significant proportion of boutons were large in both pathways (Figure 3D, black bars), but in this respect the two pathways diverged. Boutons from area 32 were larger than boutons from area 46, both at the light microscope (n = 10,920 boutons from 5 cases, measured for major diameter; Figure 3A), and at the synaptic level (n = 197, 2D major diameter, Figure 3B; n = 198, 3D volume, Figure 3C; analysis of variance [ANOVA], Bonferroni's post hoc, p < 0.01). This pathway-specific difference in size was due to a larger overall size of boutons (Figures 3A–3C), as well as a higher frequency of large boutons from area 32 than from area 46 (Figures 3D–3F). Further analysis revealed that the differences in bouton size depended largely on the type of postsynaptic target. In the pathway from area 32 to 9, boutons that innervated dendritic shafts of inhibitory neurons were significantly larger (more than two times) than those from area 46 to 9 (two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni's post hoc, p < 0.01; Figures 4A, red dots; 4B, 4H, and 4I). Similarly, multisynaptic boutons from area 32 were larger (more than two times) than multisynaptic boutons from area 46 (p < 0.01; Figures 4A, triangles; 4B, 4F, 4G, 4J, and 4K). In contrast, boutons innervating single spines were comparatively uniform in size across pathways (p = 0.84; Figures 4A, green dots; 4B, 4D, and 4E), consistent for data obtained from 3D and 2D EM analysis (Table S1). Boutons from area 32 that innervated shafts of inhibitory neurons or ensembles of spines and shafts in area 9 were also more prevalent than those from area 46 (p < 0.05, Figure 4C; Table S1). Overall, the pathway from area 32 to 9 formed more synapses with inhibitory neurons (p < 0.01, Figure 5A), through larger boutons than the pathway from area 46 to 9. The two pathways also differed in their synapses in area 9 with specific neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons labeled for CB, PV, or CR. Boutons from area 32 formed synapses preferentially with aspiny CB+ dendrites (∼49% of labeled inhibitory targets; Figures 5B and 5C), significantly more than in the pathway from area 46 to 9 (∼22% of labeled targets; p < 0.01; Figures 5D1–5D3). Axons from area 32 formed synapses with a lower but significant proportion of CR+ dendrites (∼36% of labeled targets; Figures 5B, 5E, and 5F). The opposite relationship was seen for the pathway from area 46 to area 9, where about half (∼46%) of the labeled inhibitory targets were CR+ (Figures 5B and 5G), and CB constituted a smaller proportion. However, because axons from area 32 innervated inhibitory neurons at a higher frequency (Figure 5A), the extent of synapses with CR+ elements was comparable in the two pathways (∼6% of all targets; Figure 5B). Boutons from area 32 formed fewer synapses with PV+ neurons in area 9 (∼15% of labeled targets; Figures 5B and 5H) than either CB+ or CR+ neurons. In the pathway from area 46 to 9, the proportion of synapses with PV+ neurons was comparable with synapses with CB+ neurons (∼28% of labeled targets; Figures 5B and 5I). The innervation of PV neurons by the two pathways is comparable to prefrontal-temporal pathways in primates (Medalla et al., 2007Medalla M. Lera P. Feinberg M. Barbas H. Specificity in inhibitory systems associated with prefrontal pathways to temporal cortex in primates.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: i136-i150Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but lower than in pathways linking visual areas in rats (Gonchar and Burkhalter, 2003Gonchar Y. Burkhalter A. Distinct GABAergic targets of feedforward and feedback connections between lower and higher areas of rat visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10904-10912PubMed Google Scholar). These findings might reflect differences in the proportion of PV inhibitory neurons, which is higher in rat visual and frontal cortices than in monkey prefrontal cortex (Condé et al., 1994Condé F. Lund J.S. Jacobowitz D.M. Baimbridge K.G. Lewis D.A. Local circuit neurons immunoreactive for calretinin, calbindin D-28k or parvalbumin in monkey prefrontal cortex: distribution and morphology.J.

Hilgetag C.C. Barbas H. Quantitative architecture distinguishes prefrontal cortical systems in the rhesus monkey.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 975-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The above findings indicate that the two pathways mainly differed by the higher prevalence of synapses with CB+ inhibitory neurons from the ACC than the area 46 pathway. A majority (74%–80%) of the inhibitory targets of prefrontal pathways were positive for CB, PV, or CR. A smaller proportion of inhibitory targets were morphologically identified as aspiny or sparsely spiny shafts that were immunonegative for CB, PV, or CR, which might be attributed to weak or absent labeling of distal dendrites in the upper cortical layers, suggesting an underestimate of synapses on labeled postsynaptic sites. Alternatively, unlabeled postsynaptic sites might represent the complementary population of inhibitory neurons. For example, in triple-labeled tissue for prefrontal terminals, CB, and CR, unlabeled inhibitory targets could have been PV+. The use of serial sections helped identify and classify postsynaptic elements with a high degree of confidence. Counterbalancing staining methods using gold or tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) yielded consistent results across labeling conditions, suggesting that the pathway specificity found was not due to methodological issues. We also used another approach to classify dendrites as spiny (excitatory) or sparsely spiny (inhibitory), especially because CB and CR also label a minority of pyramidal neurons (DeFelipe et al., 1989aDeFelipe J.

DeFelipe J. Synaptic connections of calretinin-immunoreactive neurons in the human neocortex.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5143-5154PubMed Google Scholar). In our sample, sparsely spiny dendrites had lower spine densities (<0.5 spines/μm length) than spiny dendrites (>0.5 and up to 4 spines/μm; p < 0.01), consistent with previous studies (Feldman and Peters, 1978Feldman M.L. Peters A. The forms of non-pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex of the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 179: 761-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, Larkman, 1991Larkman A.U.

Dendritic branch typing and spine expression patterns in cortical nonpyramidal cells.Cereb. Cortex. 2006; 16: 696-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Further, the average synapse density on shafts of aspiny dendrites (2 synapses/μm), or sparsely spiny dendrites (0.6 synapses/μm) was considerably higher than for spiny dendrites, which virtually had no asymmetric shaft synapses. There was a linear relationship between bouton volume and postsynaptic density (PSD) area across pathways and postsynaptic targets (spine targeting: R2 = 0.51, Figure 6A; shaft targeting: R2 = 0.72, Figure 6D; volume of multisynaptic boutons versus total PSD: R2 = 0.7, not shown; p < 0.01; Table S1). Accordingly, boutons of comparable size that innervated spines had comparable PSD area and spine volume (bouton volume versus spine volume: R2 = 0.49, Figure 6B; spine volume versus PSD: R2 = 0.58, Figure 6C; p < 0.01; Table S1). The same relationships were found for multisynaptic boutons and their postsynaptic targets (spine volume versus PSD: R2 = 0.74–0.81, p < 0.01). However, for boutons innervating dendritic shafts, bouton size was related to synapse size, but not dendritic size (bouton volume versus dendrite diameter: R2 = 0.02, p = 0.53, Figure 6E; dendrite diameter versus PSD: R2 = 0.07, p = 0.21, Figure 6F). To determine whether the two pathways from areas 32 and 46 terminated in similar or distinct compartments of area 9, we used unbiased estimates of populations of unlabeled boutons forming asymmetric synapses in the neuropil around labeled boutons (White, 1989White E.L. Cortical Circuits. Synaptic Organization of the Cerebral Cortex. Structure, Function and Theory. Birkhäuser, Boston1989Google Scholar). In addition to the types of synapses seen for labeled pathways, unlabeled boutons also innervated somata (<1%), or multiple dendrites (<1%). We found a comparable proportion of unlabeled synapses with spines and dendrites as for labeled synapses in each pathway (p > 0.05; Table S1). However, as shown above, the two pathways differed from each other, suggesting that boutons from areas 32 and 46 terminate in distinct compartments of area 9. Unlabeled boutons in the surrounding neuropil (mean volume ± SEM, 0.13 ± 0.02 μm3) were comparable in size with labeled boutons from area 46 (p = 0.42), but were significantly smaller (0.12 ± 0.01 μm3) than boutons from area 32 (p < 0.01), especially those innervating dendritic shafts or multiple postsynaptic sites (Table S1). There was a higher prevalence of large multisynaptic boutons labeled from area 32 than in the surrounding neuropil (∼6% of unlabeled boutons; p < 0.01; Table S1). Further, within the same dendritic segment, synapses from area 32 (PSD area, 0.14 ± 0.02 μm2) were larger than unlabeled synapses (0.07 ± 0.005 μm2; p < 0.05), whereas synapses from area 46 (0.1 ± 0.02 μm2) were comparable in size with unlabeled synapses (0.1 ± 0.03 μm2; p = 0.63) on the same dendrite. We provide evidence that two pathways from ACC and dorsolateral area 46 differ specifically in their synapses with inhibitory neurons in dorsolateral area 9. The pathway from the functionally distinct ACC formed more and larger synapses with inhibitory neurons, and targeted preferentially the neurochemical class of calbindin inhibitory neurons, than the pathway linking the functionally related areas 46 and 9. This evidence suggests that ACC has strong influence on an inhibitory control system of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Both pathways innervated mostly spines of excitatory neurons in area 9, as in other corticocortical pathways (White, 1989White E.L. Cortical Circuits. Synaptic Organization of the Cerebral Cortex. Structure, Function and Theory. Birkhäuser, Boston1989Google Scholar, Callaway, 1998Callaway E.M. Local circuits in primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 47-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and these terminals did not differ in size. The significance of the large terminals from ACC that targeted inhibitory neurons is based on evidence that bouton size is correlated with the number of synaptic vesicles (Germuska et al., 2006Germuska M.

This evidence suggests that ACC can effectively recruit inhibitory neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, the ACC preferentially innervated CB inhibitory neurons, which target the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (DeFelipe et al., 1989aDeFelipe J. Hendry S.H. Jones E.G.

https://openalex.org/W1966225328,"Background Intensification of world trade is responsible for an increase in the number of alien species introductions. Human-mediated dispersal promotes not only introductions but also expansion of the species distribution via long-distance dispersal. Thus, understanding the role of anthropogenic pathways in the spread of invading species has become one of the most important challenges nowadays. Methodology/Principal Findings We analysed the invasion pattern of the pinewood nematode in China based on invasion data from 1982 to 2005 and monitoring data on 7 locations over 15 years. Short distance spread mediated by long-horned beetles was estimated at 7.5 km per year. Infested sites located further away represented more than 90% of observations and the mean long distance spread was estimated at 111–339 km. Railways, river ports, and lakes had significant effects on the spread pattern. Human population density levels explained 87% of the variation in the invasion probability (P<0.05). Since 2001, the number of new records of the nematode was multiplied by a factor of 5 and the spread distance by a factor of 2. We combined a diffusion model to describe the short distance spread with a stochastic, individual based model to describe the long distance jumps. This combined model generated an error of only 13% when used to predict the presence of the nematode. Under two climate scenarios (stable climate or moderate warming), projections of the invasion probability suggest that this pest could expand its distribution 40–55% by 2025. Conclusions/Significance This study provides evidence that human-induced dispersal plays a fundamental role in the spread of the pinewood nematode, and appropriate control measures should be taken to stop or slow its expansion. This model can be applied to Europe, where the nematode had been introduced later, and is currently expanding its distribution. Similar models could also be derived for other species that could be accidentally transported by humans."
https://openalex.org/W2102401377,"Olfactory processing in the insect antennal lobe is a highly dynamic process, yet it has been studied primarily with static step stimuli. To approximate the rapid odor fluctuations encountered in nature, we presented flickering “white-noise” odor stimuli to the antenna of the locust and recorded spike trains from antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs). The responses varied greatly across PNs and across odors for the same PN. Surprisingly, this diversity across the population was highly constrained, and most responses were captured by a quantitative model with just 3 parameters. Individual PNs were found to communicate odor information at rates up to ∼4 bits/s. A small group of PNs was sufficient to provide an accurate representation of the dynamic odor time course, whose quality was maximal for fluctuations of frequency ∼0.8 Hz. We develop a simple model for the encoding of dynamic odor stimuli that accounts for many prior observations on the population response."
https://openalex.org/W2027269991,"Background Formaldehyde crosslinking is in widespread use as a biological fixative for microscopy and molecular biology. An assumption behind its use is that most biologically meaningful interactions are preserved by crosslinking, but the minimum length of time required for an interaction to become fixed has not been determined. Methodology Using a unique series of mutations in the DNA binding protein MeCP2, we show that in vivo interactions lasting less than 5 seconds are invisible in the microscope after formaldehyde fixation, though they are obvious in live cells. The stark contrast between live cell and fixed cell images illustrates hitherto unsuspected limitations to the fixation process. We show that chromatin immunoprecipitation, a technique in widespread use that depends on formaldehyde crosslinking, also fails to capture these transient interactions. Conclusions/Significance Our findings for the first time establish a minimum temporal limitation to crosslink chemistry that has implications for many fields of research."
https://openalex.org/W2085374185,"Background Morphological changes in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have functional consequences on lung volume, ventilation inhomogeneity and respiratory mechanics. Although some studies have shown lower lung volumes and increased ventilation inhomogeneity in BPD infants, conflicting results exist possibly due to differences in sedation and measurement techniques. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied 127 infants with BPD, 58 preterm infants without BPD and 239 healthy term-born infants, at a matched post-conceptional age of 44 weeks during quiet natural sleep according to ATS/ERS standards. Lung function parameters measured were functional residual capacity (FRC) and ventilation inhomogeneity by multiple breath washout as well as tidal breathing parameters. Preterm infants with BPD had only marginally lower FRC (21.4 mL/kg) than preterm infants without BPD (23.4 mL/kg) and term-born infants (22.6 mL/kg), though there was no trend with disease severity. They also showed higher respiratory rates and lower ratios of time to peak expiratory flow and expiratory time (tPTEF/tE) than healthy preterm and term controls. These changes were related to disease severity. No differences were found for ventilation inhomogeneity. Conclusions Our results suggest that preterm infants with BPD have a high capacity to maintain functional lung volume during natural sleep. The alterations in breathing pattern with disease severity may reflect presence of adaptive mechanisms to cope with the disease process."

We have used Aplysia neuronal cultures to examine the contribution of transsynaptic signals in both types of synapse formation. We find that during de novo synaptogenesis, specific presynaptic innervation is required for the clustering of postsynaptic AMPA-like but not NMDA-like receptors. We further find that the cell adhesion molecule Dscam is involved in these transsynaptic interactions. Inhibition of Dscam either pre- or postsynaptically abolishes the emergence of synaptic transmission and the clustering of AMPA-like receptors. Remodeling of both AMPA-like and NMDA-like receptors also occurs during learning-related synapse formation and again requires the reactivation of Dscam-mediated transsynaptic interactions. Taken together, these findings suggest that learning-induced synapse formation recapitulates, at least in part, aspects of the mechanisms that govern de novo synaptogenesis.

Taken together, these findings suggest that learning-induced synapse formation recapitulates, at least in part, aspects of the mechanisms that govern de novo synaptogenesis. Generation of specific connections between neurons is critical for precise wiring of the central nervous system during both developmental and learning-induced synapse formation in the mature brain. Several studies have implicated candidate genes in mediating the generation of synapse specificity in the context of development (Hummel et al., 2003Hummel T. Vasconcelos M.L. Clemens J.C.

In contrast, little is known about their contribution to activity-dependent synaptic growth, and thus the degree to which these two events may share molecular features in common remains unclear. To address these questions, we have exploited the elementary monosynaptic sensory neuron (SN) to motor neuron (MN) connections of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia reconstituted in culture. This reduced system has several distinct features that are advantageous for these studies. First, SN only make synapses with selective postsynaptic MN (e.g., L7 and LFS MN). SN do not form either inappropriate connections with other cells or with themselves (autapses) (Kleinfeld et al., 1990Kleinfeld D. Parsons T.D. Raccuia-Behling F. Salzberg B.M. Obaid A.L. Foreign connections are formed in vitro by Aplysia californica interneuron L10 and its in vivo followers and non-followers.J. Exp. Biol. 1990; 154: 237-255PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this system is well suited for delineating the molecular mechanisms that underlie the generation of specific neuronal connections. Second, freshly cultured SN and MN normally re-establish their synaptic connections during the first 4 days in culture (Montarolo et al., 1986Montarolo P.G. Goelet P. Castellucci V.F. Morgan J. Kandel E.R. Schacher S. A critical period for macromolecular synthesis in long-term heterosynaptic facilitation in Aplysia.Science. 1986; 234: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The events that occur during this early period (days 1–4) of the coculture reflect, at least in part, a developmental program for synaptogenesis. Exposure of the mature 5 day cultures to a single pulse of serotonin (5-HT), a modulatory neurotransmitter that mediates behavioral sensitization in vivo, induces short-term facilitation (STF) that lasts minutes to hours. In contrast, five spaced pulses of 5-HT elicit long-term facilitation (LTF) that persists for several days (Montarolo et al., 1986Montarolo P.G. Goelet P. Castellucci V.F. Morgan J. Kandel E.R. Schacher S. A critical period for macromolecular synthesis in long-term heterosynaptic facilitation in Aplysia.Science. 1986; 234: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). LTF but not STF is accompanied by growth of new synapses (Bailey et al., 1994Bailey C.H. Alberini C. Ghirardi M. Kandel E.R. Molecular and structural changes underlying long-term memory storage in Aplysia.Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1994; 29: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Bailey and Kandel, 1993Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Structural changes accompanying memory storage.Annu.

Identified target motor neuron regulates neurite outgrowth and synapse formation of aplysia sensory neurons in vitro.Neuron. 1989; 3: 441-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, the Aplysia SN-MN coculture allows one to study directly the molecular mechanisms that contribute to both developmental and learning-related synapse formation and to address the question of how each process relates to the other. We first cloned several glutamate receptors in Aplysia and found that specific contact between presynaptic SN and an appropriate postsynaptic MN is required for the clustering of AMPA-like but not NMDA-like receptors during de novo synapse formation. The molecular diversity of two sets of molecules, Dscam in Drosophila and protocadherins in mammals, makes them attractive candidates for mediating specific recognition during synapse formation (Hummel et al., 2003Hummel T. Vasconcelos M.L. Clemens J.C. Fishilevich Y. Vosshall L.B. Zipursky S.L.

In Aplysia, we found several protocadherin isoforms, but did not detect a vast repertoire of Dscam. Among the neurons we examined, the expression profiles of selective protocadherin isoforms do not display neuronal specificity. However, using selective primers against ApDscam, we detected the Dscam messages in both SN and its cognate L7 postsynaptic MN, but not in mismatched L11 MN. We further found that postsynaptic Dscam colocalizes with AMPA-like receptors, whereas presynaptic Dscam is localized to stable SN varicosities and to the base of growth cones. During de novo synapse formation, both pre- and postsynaptic blockade of Dscam abolishes synaptic transmission and the clustering of AMPA-like receptors, suggesting that Dscam-mediated transsynaptic interactions are crucial for developmental synapse formation. In comparison, we found that LTF but not STF is associated with the postsynaptic remodeling of both types of glutamate receptors. However, in contrast to de novo synapse formation, this learning-related remodeling of both NMDA-like and AMPA-like receptors requires transsynaptic interactions between SN and MN. Moreover, at mature synapses, Dscam-mediated transsynaptic signaling is required for the expression of long-term synaptic plasticity and growth. Blockade of Dscam either pre- or postsynaptically does not interfere with STF or with pre-existing synaptic strength, but does inhibit the induction of LTF and the LTF-associated remodeling of glutamate receptors. Taken together, these data suggest that Dscam-mediated signaling required for remodeling of glutamate receptors is one of the key molecular mechanisms for both developmental and learning-related synaptic growth. We first cloned one subunit of NMDA-like receptors and two members of AMPA-like receptors in Aplysia. We have classified these glutamate receptors based on the criteria proposed by Sprengel et al., 2001Sprengel R. Aronoff R. Volkner M. Schmitt B. Mosbach R. Kuner T. Glutamate receptor channel signatures.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and their homology with glutamate receptors from the pond snail (Lymnaea) and vertebrates (details in Figure S1 available online). The comparison of our nomenclature and others is listed in Table S1. Using single-cell RT/PCR and in situ hybridization, we found that Aplysia sensory neurons express comparable levels of these glutamate receptors to their target L7 MN as well as to the mismatched L11 MN (Figure S1). These data suggest that the failure of SN to make connections with L11 MN must be due to the lack of crucial elements other than glutamate receptors. To begin to identify the components that mediate the specific transsynaptic interactions between SN and L7 MN, we next sought to determine how these interactions regulate the distribution of glutamate receptors. We tracked the distribution of NMDA-like receptors fused with EGFP (ApNR1/EGFP) (Figure 1 and Table S2). We found that the tagged receptors cluster equally well in the processes of solitary L7 MN or in L7 MN cocultured with SN (Figure 1A, left and right panels, respectively). These NMDA-like receptors are expressed on the cell surface as demonstrated by immunostaining nonpermeabilized cells with anti-GFP antibody (Figure 1B). In contrast, both AMPA-like receptors—ApGluR1/EGFP and ApGluR2/EGFP—displayed a diffuse and gradient distribution along the processes of isolated MN (Figure 1C, top panels). Since the expression of AMPA-like receptors occurred in a gradient along the neurites of solitary MN, we acquired images under conditions of higher laser power in order to clearly display the overall distribution of AMPA-like receptors. We observed the same diffuse distribution of AMPA-like receptors in isolated MN using different laser intensities, suggesting that this diffuse distribution is not an artifact of signal saturation (Figure 1C, middle panels). This diffuse distribution was converted to a distinct punctate array when the SN innervate the MN in coculture (Figure 1C, bottom panels). Moreover, these AMPA-like receptors are targeted to the cell surface as demonstrated by immunostaining nonpermeabilized cells with anti-GFP antibody (Figure 1C, right panels). Together, these data suggest that during de novo synapse formation the clustering of AMPA-like, but not NMDA-like, receptors requires presynaptic innervation. (A) ApNR1/EGFP clusters distribute along the entire neuritic arbors of postsynaptic L7 MN alone and cocultured with SN (left and right panels, respectively). Unless otherwise specified, the quantification of the numbers of glutamate receptor clusters in this study was performed using an algorithm described in Experimental Procedures. The results are expressed as the mean numbers of puncta per 100 μm of neurite ± standard error (19 ± 4.203 and 22.75 ± 4.958 puncta in L7 MN alone and cocultured with SN, respectively; there is no statistical difference between these two groups by a two-sample t test, p > 0.05, n = 4). (B) NMDA-like receptors are targeted to the membrane even in the absence of presynaptic neurons. Isolated L7 MN that express ApNR1/EGFP were fixed under nonpermeabilized condition. Surface expression of ApNR1/EGFP was detected using anti-GFP antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (arrowheads). (C) ApGluR1/EGFP or ApGluR2/EGFP was expressed into L7 MN in the absence or presence of SN (left and right columns, respectively). Both ApGluR1 and ApGluR2 show diffuse and gradient distribution along the processes of solitary MN using both high and low laser intensity (5 mW and 1.5 mW, respectively) at the same sample (top and middle panels). The images acquired under lower magnification are shown in insets. By contrast, both subunits of AMPA-like receptors form distinctive punctate structures along the neurites of L7 MN when innervated by SN (bottom panels). Surface expression of ApGluR1 was detected using anti-GFP antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (right panels). In L7 MN alone, the number of puncta per 100 μm of neurite is (mean ± SEM) 3 ± 0.2 for both ApGluR1 (n = 6) and ApGluR2 (n = 7), whereas they are 29.41 ± 2.324 (n = 10) for ApGluR1 and 32.38 ± 6.628 (n = 7) for ApGluR2 in L7 MN cocultured with SN, p < 0.001, by a two-sample t test. (D) Presynaptic innervation is required for the maintenance of the clustering of glutamate receptors. ApGluR1/EGFP or ApGluR2/EGFP was expressed in L7 MN cocultured with SN after 1 day in vitro. We allowed the cells to re-establish synapses for 5 days before killing SN (middle and bottom left panels). Clusters of ApGluR1 and ApGluR2 disperse over time, and prominent changes in the clustering patterns could be clearly observed at 4 days after denervation (middle and bottom right panels, n = 3), whereas there was very little change in the distribution of ApGluR2 clusters in the MN innervated by intact SN at the same time point (top panels). (E) Specific interaction between pre- and postsynaptic neurons is required for the clustering of AMPA receptors. ApNR1/RFP and ApGluR1/EGFP were coexpressed in isolated L7 MN (left panels), L7 MN cocultured with SN (middle panels), or L11 MN cocultured with SN (right panels). ApNR1/RFP cluster in the processes of MN under all culture configurations, whereas ApGluR1/EGFP cluster only in MN that is properly innervated by presynaptic SN (middle panels). ApGluR1/EGFP fails to cluster in either solitary L7 MN (top left panels) or mismatched L11 MN cocultured with presynaptic SN (top right panels). The phase images of each culture condition are shown in the bottom panels. Please note that it is very common that the size of Aplysia neurons varies among individual cultures. However, this does not affect the major conclusions of the experiments. For full-size images of this experiment, see Supplemental Data. (F) The enlarged images of the colocalization pattern of ApGluR1/EGFP and ApNR1/RFP receptors of Figure 1E (SN-L7 MN coculture, middle panel). To clearly demonstrate the colocalized and noncolocalized puncta (blue and pink arrowheads), we presented the results acquired at lower laser intensity compared to that in Figure 1E. These data were quantified and presented as the percentage of AMPA receptors colocalized with NMDA receptors (74.34 ± 2.146%, n = 4). To verify this observation, we performed two additional experiments. First, we determined whether elimination of the presynaptic inputs at an established SN to MN synapse would trigger dispersion of the AMPA-like receptor clusters in L7 MN. We found that both subunits of AMPA-like receptors cluster throughout the neurites (Figure 1D, left panels). To eliminate the presynaptic neuron, we injected media into the cell body of SN and followed over time the changes in the distribution of AMPA-like receptors. Concomitant with the death of the presynaptic cell, the AMPA-like receptor puncta gradually dispersed, resulting in a more diffuse receptor distribution similar to the pattern observed on isolated MN (Figure 1D, right middle and bottom panels). This dispersion became prominent at 4 days after denervation and lasted the duration of the experiment (6 days after denervation). By contrast, the distribution of AMPA-like receptors remained punctate over the same time period in MN cocultured with intact SN (Figure 1D, top right panels). Second, we coexpressed NMDA-like receptors tagged with the red fluorescent protein (RFP) and AMPA-like receptors/GFP in the L7 MN cultured alone. The AMPA-like receptors distributed homogeneously, whereas NMDA-like receptors formed discrete clusters (Figure 1E, left column; for full-size images, see Supplemental Data). We next asked: Do postsynaptic glutamate receptors cluster in a target-neuron-specific manner? We found that, in response to SN innervation, both AMPA-like and NMDA-like receptors cluster along the neurites of L7 MN and that most of the AMPA-like punctate structures colocalize with NMDA-like clusters (Figure 1E, middle column, and Figure 1F; see Supplemental Data for full-size images). In contrast, the AMPA-like, but not NMDA-like, receptors failed to form discrete puncta in the mismatched L11 MN innervated by SN (Figure 1E, right column, and for full-size images, see Supplemental Data). Together, these findings suggest that, during de novo synapse formation, specific recognition between synaptically related pre- and postsynaptic cells is required for the clustering of two AMPA-like receptor subunits but not for the clustering of NMDA-like receptors. Precise alignment of the pre- and postsynaptic compartment is thought to rely on the binding specificities of cell adhesion molecules. The complex genomic organization of the protocadherin family in mammals and the extensive alternative splicing of Dscam in Drosophila have made them attractive candidates for synaptic recognition because each of these families is capable of generating a large number of isoforms and each of these isoforms might, in turn, contribute to the specificity of neuronal recognition via its specific binding activity (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Drosophila Dscam is an axon guidance receptor exhibiting extraordinary molecular diversity.Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, Wu and Maniatis, 1999Wu Q. Maniatis T. A striking organization of a large family of human neural cadherin-like cell adhesion genes.Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We therefore asked: Do protocadherins and Dscam have a role in the clustering of glutamate receptors at Aplysia SN-MN synapses? To address this question, we have identified several isoforms of Aplysia homologs of protocadherins and Dscam that display a domain organization similar to their mammalian and Drosophila homologs, respectively (Figure 2A and Table S1). The Aplysia protocadherins contain six or seven cadherin domains followed by a transmembrane domain, whereas the Aplysia Dscam (ApDscam) consists of ten immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, six fibronectin type III (FN III) domains, and a transmembrane domain (TM) followed by an intracellular domain. We next characterized the expression patterns of these Dscam and protocadherin isoforms in a variety of Aplysia neurons by single-cell RT/PCR. We did not observe any difference in the expression of five different isoforms of protocadherins in SN or the MN L7 and L11, suggesting that these isoforms might have a role in cell adhesion rather than in neuronal selection at Aplysia SN-MN synapses (Figure 2A). This observation does not exclude the possibility that other protocadherins that we have not yet identified might be involved in target selection. (A) The structural organization of Aplysia protocadherins and Dscam is shown in the diagram. Single-cell RT/PCR showed that the pleural SN, L7, and L11 MN express comparable levels of five different protocadherins tested compared to total RNA isolated from Aplysia ganglia. There is no detectable signal in samples containing no cells or reverse transcriptase. The expression of ApDscam was tested using four sets of primers. The ApDscam messages in both SN and L7 MN, but not in L11 MN, can be amplified by specific primer set 1 that covers Ig6 and partial Ig7 domain. However, using primer 3 that covers the entire Ig7 domain, we were able to detect comparable amounts of signal in all three cell types. Our sequencing results further suggest that there is no diversity of Ig 7 domain in Aplysia. The difference of Dscam on L7 and L11 resides in the region before Ig7 domain. This ApDscam is also expressed in L10 interneuron that makes both excitatory and inhibitory synapses with L7 MN (bottom row). In these experiments, primer sets 2 and 4 were used as internal controls. (B) ApGluR2/RFP was coexpressed with EGFP or INDscam/EGFP in L7 MN on day 1 after being cocultured with SN (panel I and II). Overexpression of INDscam/EGFP, but not EGFP, abolishes clustering of ApGluR2/RFP. INDscam has no effect on the clustering of ApNR1/RFP (panel III), even when the expression level is higher than that required to abolish the clustering of ApGluR2/RFP (panel II). The quantification for these results is shown in the bottom left panel. The number of puncta per 100 μm of neurite in ApGluR2/INDscam is statistically different from that in ApGluR2/EGFp and ApNR1/INDscam (mean ± SEM, 1.75 ± 0.25, 28.5 ± 4.39, and 26.25 ± 3.275, respectively; n = 4 and p < 0.05, by a two-sample t test). The mean EPSP in SN-MN synapses expressing EGFP alone, INDscam/EGFP alone, coexpressing INDscam/EGFP and WTDscam/RFP, and expressing WTDscam/EFP alone are (in mV) 17.56 ± 0.985, 1.087 ± 0.928, 16.73 ± 4.018, and 18.7 ± 2.42, respectively. The effect of INDscam/EGFP on evoked EPSP is statistically different from that in EGFP alone, p < 0.002, n = 4 by a two-sample t test. These results are further supported by the RNAi approach. A mixture of three species of Dscam-targeted RNAi, but not the equivalent mixture of control RNAi, blocks the evoked SN-MN EPSP. The mean EPSP between SN-MN synapses in Dscam-targeted RNAi and control RNAi are 1.5 ± 0.95 mV and 20.25 ± 3.70 mV, respectively (p < 0.002, n = 4 by a two-sample t test). (C) AMPA receptors are colocalized with WTDscam in L7 MN cocultured with SN (arrowheads). The left panels show the confocal images, and the diagrams in the right panels illustrate several examples of superimposed puncta (arrowheads). The quantitative results are presented as the percentage of AMPA receptors (mean ± SEM) that are either completely or partially colocalized with WTDscam over total AMPAR (48.25% ± 3.11%, n = 3). In Drosophila, a vast repertoire of Dscam isoforms can be generated by alternative splicing. We next sought to determine whether Aplysia neurons also express a large number of Dscam isoforms by performing RT/PCR using the total ganglia RNA as templates. In contrast to the fly Dscam, we did not detect a large collection of Aplysia Dscam isoforms. Thus, the proliferation of splice isoforms of Dscam appears to be specific to the insect lineage, as neither vertebrates nor mollusks show evidence for this event. (Agarwala et al., 2001Agarwala K.L. Ganesh S. Amano K. Suzuki T. Yamakawa K. DSCAM, a highly conserved gene in mammals, expressed in differentiating mouse brain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Barlow et al., 2001Barlow G.M. Micales B. Lyons G.E. Korenberg J.R. Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule is conserved in mouse and highly expressed in the adult mouse brain.Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 94: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the vertebrate Dscam lacks the molecular diversity, Dscam and its paralog (Dscam L1) are differentially expressed in various regions of the mouse CNS (Barlow et al., 2002Barlow G.M. Micales B. Chen X.N. Lyons G.E. Korenberg J.R. Mammalian DSCAMs: roles in the development of the spinal cord, cortex, and cerebellum?.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For instance, Dscam and Dscam L1 are inversely expressed in the ventral and dorsal spinal cord. In the adult cortex, Dscam is predominantly expressed in layer 3/5 pyramidal neurons, whereas Dscam L1 is expressed in layer 2 granule cells. This suggests that mammalian Dscam, even in the absence of a repertoire of isoforms, might have the same but perhaps more restricted role in neuronal specification or recognition. We therefore sought to determine whether there is any correlation in the expression of ApDscam in synaptically related neurons. Using a panel of primers against various regions of ApDscam, we performed single-cell RT/PCR to determine the expression of Dscam in SN, L7, and L11 MN (Figure 2A and see Table S4 for primer sequences and PCR conditions). When one set of primers flanking the Ig7 domain of ApDscam was used for single-cell RT/PCR, we detected comparable signals in Aplysia SN and L7 but not in mismatched L11 MN (Figure 2A, primer set 1). By contrast, we detected comparable signals in SN, L7, and L11 MN using the primer sets covering the Ig6 and N-terminal half of Ig7 domains of ApDscam (Figure 2A, primer set 2). These data suggest that the ApDscam on L11 might be different from that on L7 in the Ig7 domain of ApDscam. To test this possibility, we directly amplified the Ig7 domain from SN, L7, and L11 MN (Figure 2A, primer set 3). We found that SN, L7 and L11 MN express comparable amounts of the Ig7 domain by single-cell RT/PCR. In this experiment, the primer set 4 covering the Ig9 and FNIII domain was used for internal control (Figure 2A). Based on the sequencing results, we did not observe diversity in the Ig7 domain of ApDscam. Together, primer set 1 failed to amplify the ApDscam (encoding aa 536–717) from L11 MN, but not from SN or L7 MN, whereas primer set 2 and 3 could amplify the segment encoding aa 560–686 and aa 634–722 from these three types of neurons. These data suggest that, unlike Drosophila Dscam 2, the difference in ApDscam on L7 and L11 most likely is not due to diversity of the Ig7 domain. The difference resides in a region before the Ig7 domain (between aa 536 and 560 or between nt 1608 and 1680) (Figure 2A). We next asked: Does this ApDscam only participate in the formation of glutamatergic excitatory connections, such as the synapses between SN and L7 MN, or does it also participate in the formation of connections mediated by other transmitters, such as the dual excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections between the cholinergic interneuron L10 and L7 MN? We therefore examined the expression of ApDscam in interneuron L10. We found that the expression level of ApDscam in interneuron L10 is comparable to that in both SN and L7 MN (Figure 2A), suggesting that matched expression of Dscam in synaptically related neurons is not restricted to the chemical nature of synaptic transmission. We next sought to test the role of Dscam in de novo synapse formation. We reasoned that it might be difficult to block the extracellular binding activity of Dscam since there might be as-yet identified Dscam isoforms or paralogs on SN and L7 MN, even though we did not detect a molecular diversity of Dscam so far. Thus, we first knocked down the signaling cascade downstream of Dscam by overexpressing the intracellular domain of Dscam (INDscam) in L7 MN. INDscam contains several putative binding sites for SH2 and SH3 domains, such as YDXX and PXXP motifs, as well as PKC-binding sites, even though this region of Dscam is not highly homologous between species. We found that postsynaptic overexpression of INDscam in immature SN-MN cocultures blocked both the clustering of AMPA-like receptors and synaptic transmission (panel II and bottom charts in Figure 2B; see Supplemental Data for full-size images). However, overexpression of this truncated mutant had no effect on the clustering of NMDA-like receptors (panel III in Figure 2B and see Supplemental Data for full-size images), even when the expression level of INDscam was higher than that required to abolish the clustering of AMPAR (panel II). This demonstrates that the blockade is receptor specific. In addition, we showed that AMPA-like receptors colocalize with wild-type Dscam (WTDscam), further suggesting that Dscam is required for the clustering of AMPA-like receptors (Figure 2C). Since it is possible that INDscam might interfere with signaling pathways other than those downstream of Dscam, we next determined (1) whether coexpression of WTDscam/RFP with INDscam/EGFP could rescue the competence for synapse formatio"
https://openalex.org/W2004150338,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant neurodegeneration in the cortex and hippocampus; intraneuronal tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein; and accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) proteins 40 and 42 in the brain parenchyma as well as in the cerebral vasculature. The current understanding that AD is initiated by the neuronal accumulation of Abeta proteins due to their inefficient clearance at the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), places the neurovascular unit at the epicenter of AD pathophysiology. The objective of this study is to investigate cellular mechanisms mediating the internalization of Abeta proteins in the principle constituents of the neurovascular unit, neurons and BBB endothelial cells. Laser confocal micrographs of wild type (WT) mouse brain slices treated with fluorescein labeled Abeta40 (F-Abeta40) demonstrated selective accumulation of the protein in a subpopulation of cortical and hippocampal neurons via nonsaturable, energy independent, and nonendocytotic pathways. This groundbreaking finding, which challenges the conventional belief that Abeta proteins are internalized by neurons via receptor mediated endocytosis, was verified in differentiated PC12 cells and rat primary hippocampal (RPH) neurons through laser confocal microscopy and flow cytometry studies. Microscopy studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of F-Abeta40 or F-Abeta42 internalized by differentiated PC12 cells or RPH neurons is located outside of the endosomal or lysosomal compartments, which may accumulate without degradation. In contrast, BBME cells exhibit energy dependent uptake of F-Abeta40, and accumulate the protein in acidic cell organelle, indicative of endocytotic uptake. Such a phenomenal difference in the internalization of Abeta40 between neurons and BBB endothelial cells may provide essential clues to understanding how various cells can differentially regulate Abeta proteins and help explain the vulnerability of cortical and hippocampal neurons to Abeta toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2068582444,"Superagonistic CD28-specific monoclonal antibodies (CD28SA) are highly effective activators of regulatory T-cells (Treg cells) in rats, but a first-in-man trial of the human CD28SA TGN1412 resulted in an unexpected cytokine release syndrome. Using a novel mouse anti-mouse CD28SA, we re-investigate the relationship between Treg activation and systemic cytokine release. Treg activation by CD28SA was highly efficient but depended on paracrine IL-2 from CD28SA-stimulated conventional T-cells. Systemic cytokine levels were innocuous, but depletion of Treg cells prior to CD28SA stimulation led to systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines, indicating that in rodents, Treg cells effectively suppress the inflammatory response. Since the human volunteers of the TGN1412 study were not protected by this mechanism, we also tested whether corticosteroid prophylaxis would be compatible with CD28SA induced Treg activation. We show that neither the expansion nor the functional activation of Treg cells is affected by high-dose dexamethasone sufficient to control systemic cytokine release. Our findings warn that preclinical testing of activating biologicals in rodents may miss cytokine release syndromes due to the rapid and efficacious response of the rodent Treg compartment, and suggest that polyclonal Treg activation is feasible in the presence of antiphlogistic corticosteroid prophylaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2153750616,"Paraptosis is the programmed cell death pathway that leads to cellular necrosis. Previously, rodent and human monocytes/macrophages killed glioma cells bearing the membrane macrophage colony stimulating factor (mM-CSF) through paraptosis, but the molecular mechanism of this killing process was never identified. We have demonstrated that paraptosis of rat T9 glioma cells can be initiated through a large potassium channel (BK)-dependent process initiated by reactive oxygen species. Macrophage mediated cytotoxicity upon the mM-CSF expressing T9-C2 cells was not prevented by the addition of the caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk. By a combination of fluorescent confocal and electron microscopy, flow cytometry, electrophysiology, pharmacology, and genetic knock-down approaches, we demonstrated that these ion channels control cellular swelling and vacuolization of rat T9 glioma cells. Cell lysis is preceded by a depletion of intracellular ATP. Six-hour exposure to BK channel activation caused T9 cells to over express heat shock proteins (Hsp 60, 70, 90 and gp96). This same treatment forced HMGB1 translocation from the nuclear region to the periphery. These last molecules are ""danger signals"" that can stimulate immune responses. Similar inductions of mitochondrial swelling and increased Hsp70 and 90 expressions by BK channel activation were observed with the non-immunogenic F98 glioma cells. Rats injected with T9 cells which were killed by prolonged BK channel activation developed immunity against the T9 cells, while the injection of x-irradiated apoptotic T9 cells failed to produce the vaccinating effect. These results are the first to show that glioma cellular death induced by prolonged BK channel activation improves tumor immunogenicity; this treatment reproduces the vaccinating effects of mM-CSF transduced cells. Elucidation of strategies as described in this study may prove quite valuable in the development of clinical immunotherapy against cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1990096044,"Heterophyllous aquatic plants show marked phenotypic plasticity. They adapt to environmental changes by producing different leaf types: submerged, floating and terrestrial leaves. By contrast, homophyllous plants produce only submerged leaves and grow entirely underwater. Heterophylly and submerged homophylly evolved under selective pressure modifying the species-specific optima for photosynthesis, but little is known about the evolutionary outcome of habit. Recent evolutionary analyses suggested that rbcL, a chloroplast gene that encodes a catalytic subunit of RuBisCO, evolves under positive selection in most land plant lineages. To examine the adaptive evolutionary process linked to heterophylly or homophylly, we analyzed positive selection in the rbcL sequences of ecologically diverse aquatic plants, Japanese Potamogeton.Phylogenetic and maximum likelihood analyses of codon substitution models indicated that Potamogeton rbcL has evolved under positive Darwinian selection. The positive selection has operated specifically in heterophyllous lineages but not in homophyllous ones in the branch-site models. This suggests that the selective pressure on this chloroplast gene was higher for heterophyllous lineages than for homophyllous lineages. The replacement of 12 amino acids occurred at structurally important sites in the quaternary structure of RbcL, two of which (residue 225 and 281) were identified as potentially under positive selection.Our analysis did not show an exact relationship between the amino acid replacements and heterophylly or homophylly but revealed that lineage-specific positive selection acted on the Potamogeton rbcL. The contrasting ecological conditions between heterophyllous and homophyllous plants have imposed different selective pressures on the photosynthetic system. The increased amino acid replacement in RbcL may reflect the continuous fine-tuning of RuBisCO under varying ecological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1970596466,"The human lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 LOX-1, encoded by the ORL1 gene, is the major scavenger receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein in endothelial cells. Here we report on the functional effects of a coding SNP, c.501G>C, which produces a single amino acid change (K>N at codon 167). Our study was aimed at elucidating whether the c.501G>C polymorphism changes the binding affinity of LOX-1 receptor altering its function. The presence of p.K167N mutation reduces ox-LDL binding and uptake. Ox-LDL activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2) is inhibited. Furthermore, ox-LDL induced biosynthesis of LOX-1 receptors is dependent on the p.K167N variation. In human macrophages, derived from c.501G>C heterozygous individuals, the ox-LDL induced LOX-1 46 kDa band is markedly lower than in induced macrophages derived from c.501G>C controls. Investigation of p.K167N mutation through molecular dynamics simulation and electrostatic analysis suggests that the ox-LDL binding may be attributed to the coupling between the electrostatic potential distribution and the asymmetric flexibility of the basic spine residues. The N/N-LOX-1 mutant has either interrupted electrostatic potential and asymmetric fluctuations of the basic spine arginines."
https://openalex.org/W1999017545,"Cerebral activation during planning of reaching movements occurs both in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and premotor cortex (PM), and their activation seems to take place in parallel.The activation of the SPL and PM has been investigated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during planning of reaching movements under visual guidance.A facilitory effect was found when TMS was delivered on the parietal cortex at about half of the time from sight of the target to hand movement, independently of target location in space. Furthermore, at the same stimulation time, a similar facilitory effect was found in PM, which is probably related to movement preparation.This data contributes to the understanding of cortical dynamics in the parieto-frontal network, and suggests that it is possible to interfere with the planning of reaching movements at different cortical points within a particular time window. Since similar effects may be produced at similar times on both the SPL and PM, parallel processing of visuomotor information is likely to take place in these regions."
https://openalex.org/W1974618243,"Matrix attachment regions (MARs) are important in chromatin organization and gene regulation. Although it is known that there are a number of MAR elements in the beta-globin gene cluster, it is unclear that how these MAR elements are involved in regulating beta-globin genes expression. Here, we report the identification of a new MAR element at the LCR (locus control region) of human beta-globin gene cluster and the detection of the inter-MAR association within the beta-globin gene cluster. Also, we demonstrate that SATB1, a protein factor that has been implicated in the formation of network like higher order chromatin structures at some gene loci, takes part in beta-globin specific inter-MAR association through binding the specific MARs. Knocking down of SATB1 obviously reduces the binding of SATB1 to the MARs and diminishes the frequency of the inter-MAR association. As a result, the ACH establishment and the alpha-like globin genes and beta-like globin genes expressions are affected either. In summary, our results suggest that SATB1 is a regulatory factor of hemoglobin genes, especially the early differentiation genes at least through affecting the higher order chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2006762667,"Background Large-scale sequencing projects have now become routine lab practice and this has led to the development of a new generation of tools involving function prediction methods, bringing the latter back to the fore. The advent of Gene Ontology, with its structured vocabulary and paradigm, has provided computational biologists with an appropriate means for this task. Methodology We present here a novel method called ARGOT (Annotation Retrieval of Gene Ontology Terms) that is able to process quickly thousands of sequences for functional inference. The tool exploits for the first time an integrated approach which combines clustering of GO terms, based on their semantic similarities, with a weighting scheme which assesses retrieved hits sharing a certain number of biological features with the sequence to be annotated. These hits may be obtained by different methods and in this work we have based ARGOT processing on BLAST results. Conclusions The extensive benchmark involved 10,000 protein sequences, the complete S. cerevisiae genome and a small subset of proteins for purposes of comparison with other available tools. The algorithm was proven to outperform existing methods and to be suitable for function prediction of single proteins due to its high degree of sensitivity, specificity and coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2031020334,"Background Antineoplastic therapy may impair the survival of malignant cells to produce cell death. Consequently, direct measurement of tumor cell death in vivo is a highly desirable component of therapy response monitoring. We have previously shown that APOMAB® representing the DAB4 clone of a La/SSB-specific murine monoclonal autoantibody is a malignant cell-death ligand, which accumulates preferentially in tumors in an antigen-specific and dose-dependent manner after DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Here, we aim to image tumor uptake of APOMAB® (DAB4) and to define its biological correlates. Methodology/Principal Findings Brisk tumor cell apoptosis is induced in the syngeneic EL4 lymphoma model after treatment of tumor-bearing mice with DNA-damaging cyclophosphamide/etoposide chemotherapy. Tumor and normal organ accumulation of Indium 111 (111In)-labeled La-specific DAB4 mAb as whole IgG or IgG fragments was quantified by whole-body static imaging and organ assay in tumor-bearing mice. Immunohistochemical measurements of tumor caspase-3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage, which are indicators of early and late apoptosis, respectively, were correlated with tumor accumulation of DAB4. Increased tumor accumulation of DAB4 was associated directly with both the extent of chemotherapy-induced tumor cell death and DAB4 binding per dead tumor cell. Tumor DAB4 accumulation correlated with cumulative caspase-3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage as tumor biomarkers of apoptosis and was directly related to the extended median survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions/Significance Radiolabeled La-specific monoclonal antibody, DAB4, detected dead tumor cells after chemotherapy, rather than chemosensitive normal tissues of gut and bone marrow. DAB4 identified late apoptotic tumor cells in vivo. Hence, radiolabeled DAB4 may usefully image responses to human carcinoma therapy because DAB4 would capture the protracted cell death of carcinoma. We believe that the ability of radiolabeled DAB4 to rapidly assess the apoptotic tumor response and, consequently, to potentially predict extended survival justifies its future clinical development as a radioimmunoscintigraphic agent. This article is part I of a two-part series providing proof-of-concept for the the diagnostic and therapeutic use of a La-specific monoclonal antibody, the DAB4 clone of which is represented by the registered trademark, APOMAB®."
https://openalex.org/W1982450703,"To better design association studies for complex traits in isolated populations it's important to understand how history and isolation moulded the genetic features of different communities. Population isolates should not ""a priori"" be considered homogeneous, even if the communities are not distant and part of a small region. We studied a particular area of Sardinia called Ogliastra, characterized by the presence of several distinct villages that display different history, immigration events and population size. Cultural and geographic isolation characterized the history of these communities. We determined LD parameters in 8 villages and defined population structure through high density SNPs (about 360 K) on 360 unrelated people (45 selected samples from each village). These isolates showed differences in LD values and LD map length. Five of these villages show high LD values probably due to their reduced population size and extreme isolation. High genetic differentiation among villages was detected. Moreover population structure analysis revealed a high correlation between genetic and geographic distances. Our study indicates that history, geography and biodemography have influenced the genetic features of Ogliastra communities producing differences in LD and population structure. All these data demonstrate that we can consider each village an isolate with specific characteristics. We suggest that, in order to optimize the study design of complex traits, a thorough characterization of genetic features is useful to identify the presence of sub-populations and stratification within genetic isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2059290723,"Aging likely plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders. In Huntington's disease (HD), a disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the protein huntingtin (Htt), the role of aging is unclear. For a given tract length, the probability of disease onset increases with age. There are mainly two hypotheses that could explain adult onset in HD: Either mutant Htt progressively produces cumulative defects over time or ""normal"" aging renders neurons more vulnerable to mutant Htt toxicity. In the present study, we directly explored whether aging affected the toxicity of mutant Htt in vivo. We studied the impact of aging on the effects produced by overexpression of an N-terminal fragment of mutant Htt, of wild-type Htt or of a beta-Galactosidase (beta-Gal) reporter gene in the rat striatum. Stereotaxic injections of lentiviral vectors were performed simultaneously in young (3 week) and old (15 month) rats. Histological evaluation at different time points after infection demonstrated that the expression of mutant Htt led to pathological changes that were more severe in old rats, including an increase in the number of small Htt-containing aggregates in the neuropil, a greater loss of DARPP-32 immunoreactivity and striatal neurons as assessed by unbiased stereological counts.The present results support the hypothesis that ""normal"" aging is involved in HD pathogenesis, and suggest that age-related cellular defects might constitute potential therapeutic targets for HD."
https://openalex.org/W1986260003,"The mammalian nose employs several olfactory subsystems to recognize and transduce diverse chemosensory stimuli. These subsystems differ in their anatomical position within the nasal cavity, their targets in the olfactory forebrain, and the transduction mechanisms they employ. Here we report that they can also differ in the strategies they use for stimulus coding. Necklace glomeruli are the sole main olfactory bulb (MOB) targets of an olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) subpopulation distinguished by its expression of the receptor guanylyl cyclase GC-D and the phosphodiesterase PDE2, and by its chemosensitivity to the natriuretic peptides uroguanylin and guanylin and the gas CO2. In stark contrast to the homogeneous sensory innervation of canonical MOB glomeruli from OSNs expressing the same odorant receptor (OR), we find that each necklace glomerulus of the mouse receives heterogeneous innervation from at least two distinct sensory neuron populations: one expressing GC-D and PDE2, the other expressing olfactory marker protein. In the main olfactory system it is thought that odor identity is encoded by a combinatorial strategy and represented in the MOB by a pattern of glomerular activation. This combinatorial coding scheme requires functionally homogeneous sensory inputs to individual glomeruli by OSNs expressing the same OR and displaying uniform stimulus selectivity; thus, activity in each glomerulus reflects the stimulation of a single OSN type. The heterogeneous sensory innervation of individual necklace glomeruli by multiple, functionally distinct, OSN subtypes precludes a similar combinatorial coding strategy in this olfactory subsystem."

Our study demonstrates that signals emanating from ITAM-containing receptors mediated by Vav family Rho GEFs control the velocity, but not the directionality, of neutrophil migration towards sites of bacterial infection.Here we show that during neutrophil migration towards sites of bacterial infection, signals emanating from ITAM-containing receptors specifically control interstitial neutrophil velocity."
https://openalex.org/W2052020365,"Background To date, inefficient delivery of therapeutic doses of radionuclides to solid tumors limits the clinical utility of radioimmunotherapy. We aim to test the therapeutic utility of Yttrium-90 (90Y)-radio-conjugates of a monoclonal antibody, which we showed previously to bind specifically to the abundant intracellular La ribonucleoprotein revealed in dead tumor cells after DNA-damaging treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings Immunoconjugates of the DAB4 clone of the La-specific monoclonal antibody, APOMAB®, were prepared using the metal chelator, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), and then radiolabeled with 90Y. Mice bearing established subcutaneous tumors were treated with 90Y-DOTA-DAB4 alone or after chemotherapy. Non-radiosensitizing cyclophosphamide/etoposide chemotherapy was used for the syngeneic EL4 lymphoma model. Radiosensitizing cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy was used for the syngeneic Lewis Lung carcinoma (LL2) model, and for the xenograft models of LNCaP prostatic carcinoma and Panc-1 pancreatic carcinoma. We demonstrate the safety, specificity, and efficacy of 90Y-DOTA-DAB4-radioimmunotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy. EL4 lymphoma-bearing mice either were cured at higher doses of radioimmunotherapy alone or lower doses of radioimmunotherapy in synergy with chemotherapy. Radioimmunotherapy alone was less effective in chemo- and radio-resistant carcinoma models. However, radioimmunotherapy synergized with radiosensitizing chemotherapy to retard significantly tumor regrowth and so prolong the survival of mice bearing LL2, LNCaP, or Panc-1 subcutaneous tumor implants. Conclusions/Significance We report proof-of-concept data supporting a unique form of radioimmunotherapy, which delivers bystander killing to viable cancer cells after targeting the universal cancer antigen, La, created by DNA-damaging treatment in neighboring dead cancer cells. Subsequently we propose that DAB4-targeted ionizing radiation induces additional cycles of tumor cell death, which further augments DAB4 binding to produce a tumor-lethal ‘genotoxic chain reaction’. Clinically, this approach may be useful as consolidation treatment after a drug-induced cell death among (small-volume) metastatic deposits, the commonest cause of cancer death. This article is part II of a two-part series providing proof-of-concept for the diagnostic and therapeutic use of the DAB4 clone of the La-specific monoclonal antibody, APOMAB®."

https://openalex.org/W2124193994,"Background Early randomized controlled trials have suggested that neuraxial blockade may reduce cardiorespiratory complications after non-cardiothoracic surgery, but recent larger trials have been inconclusive. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of conducting a large multicentre randomized controlled trial in Canada. Methodology/Principal Findings After Research Ethics Board approvals from the participating institutions, subjects were recruited if they were ≥45 years old, had an expected hospital stay ≥48 hours, were undergoing a noncardiothoracic procedure amenable to epidural analgesia, met one of six risk criteria, and did not have contraindications to neuraxial blockade. After informed consent, subjects were randomly allocated to combined epidural analgesia (epidural group) and neuraxial anesthesia, with or without general anesthesia, or intravenous opioid analgesia (IV group) and general anesthesia. The primary outcomes were the rate of recruitment and the percents of eligible patients recruited, crossed over, and followed completely. Feasibility targets were defined a priori. A blinded, independent committee adjudicated the secondary clinical outcomes. Subjects were followed daily while in hospital and then at 30 days after surgery. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Over a 15-month period, the recruitment rate was 0.5±0.3 (mean±SEM) subjects per week per centre; 112/494 (22.7%) eligible subjects were recruited at four tertiary-care teaching hospitals in Canada. Thirteen (26.5%) of 49 subjects in the epidural group crossed over to the IV group; seven (14.3%) were due to failed or inadequate analgesia or complications from epidural analgesia. Five (9.8%) of 51 subjects in the IV group crossed over to the epidural group but none were due to inadequate analgesia or complications. Ninety-eight (97.0%) of 101 subjects were successfully followed up until 30 days after their surgery. Conclusion/Significance Of the criteria we defined for the feasibility of a full-scale trial, only the follow-up target was met. The other feasibility outcomes did not meet our preset criteria for success. The results suggest that a large multicentre trial may not be a feasible design to study the perioperative effects of neuraxial blockade.

https://openalex.org/W2063710108,"Background RAF kinases direct ERK MAPK signaling to distinct subcellular compartments in response to growth factor stimulation. Methodology/Principal Findings Of the three mammalian isoforms A-RAF is special in that one of its two lipid binding domains mediates a unique pattern of membrane localization. Specific membrane binding is retained by an N-terminal fragment (AR149) that corresponds to a naturally occurring splice variant termed DA-RAF2. AR149 colocalizes with ARF6 on tubular endosomes and has a dominant negative effect on endocytic trafficking. Moreover actin polymerization of yeast and mammalian cells is abolished. AR149/DA-RAF2 does not affect the internalization step of endocytosis, but trafficking to the recycling compartment. Conclusions/Significance A-RAF induced ERK activation is required for this step by activating ARF6, as A-RAF depletion or inhibition of the A-RAF controlled MEK-ERK cascade blocks recycling. These data led to a new model for A-RAF function in endocytic trafficking."

Our objective was to determine if patients who were prescribed psychopharmacological drugs by family physicians at a community health center in Karachi, Pakistan were provided adequate education about their disease and its management.A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Community Health Centre (CHC), Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, Pakistan. Details about the prescriptions and patient education were acquired from the patients after their consultations.A total of 354 adult patients were interviewed during 3 days. Among them, 73 (20.6%) were prescribed psychopharmacological medications. Among patients receiving psychopharmacological medicines, 37 (50.7%) did not know their diagnosis; 50 (68.5%) were unaware of the disease process; 52 (71.2%) were unaware of alternative treatments; 63 (86.3%) were not cautioned about the potential adverse effects of the drugs; 24 (32.9%) were unaware of the duration of treatment and in 60 (82.2%) of the participants an appropriate referral had not been discussed. For all aspects of education, patients prescribed psychopharmacological medications knew less as compared to those patients that were prescribed other medications.The practice of imparting information to patients who receive psychopharmacological medications seems to be inadequate in Pakistan. We have hypothesized about the possible reasons for our findings, and identified a need for further research to determine the cause for such findings and to address them accordingly. At the same time there is a need to educate family physicians in Pakistan about the special importance of providing adequate information to such patients."
https://openalex.org/W2051306300,"Human neural precursor cells (hNPC) are candidates for neural transplantation in a wide range of neurological disorders. Recently, much work has been done to determine how the environment for NPC culture in vitro may alter their plasticity. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) are used to expand NPC; however, it is not clear if continuous exposure to mitogens may abrogate their subsequent differentiation. Here we evaluated if short-term removal of FGF-2 and EGF prior to plating may improve hNPC differentiation into neurons.We demonstrate that culture of neurospheres in suspension for 2 weeks without EGF-FGF-2 significantly increases neuronal differentiation and neurite extension when compared to cells cultured using standard protocols. In this condition, neurons were preferentially located in the core of the neurospheres instead of the shell. Moreover, after plating, neurons presented radial rather than randomly oriented and longer processes than controls, comprised mostly by neurons with short processes. These changes were followed by alterations in the expression of genes related to cell survival.These results show that EGF and FGF-2 removal affects NPC fate and plasticity. Taking into account that a three dimensional structure is essential for NPC differentiation, here we evaluated, for the first time, the effects of growth factors removal in whole neurospheres rather than in plated cell culture."
https://openalex.org/W2055106639,"The serious and growing impact of the neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an individual and societal burden raises a number of key questions: Can a blanket test for Alzheimer's disease be devised forecasting long-term risk for acquiring this disorder? Can a unified therapy be devised to forestall the development of AD as well as improve the lot of present sufferers? Inflammatory and oxidative stresses are associated with enhanced risk for AD. Can an AD molecular signature be identified in signaling pathways for communication within and among cells during inflammatory and oxidative stress, suggesting possible biomarkers and therapeutic avenues? We postulated a unique molecular signature of dysfunctional activity profiles in AD-relevant signaling pathways in peripheral tissues, based on a gain of function in G-protein-coupled bradykinin B2 receptor (BKB2R) inflammatory stress signaling in skin fibroblasts from AD patients that results in tau protein Ser hyperphosphorylation. Such a signaling profile, routed through both phosphorylation and proteolytic cascades activated by inflammatory and oxidative stresses in highly penetrant familial monogenic forms of AD, could be informative for pathogenesis of the complex multigenic sporadic form of AD. Comparing stimulus-specific cascades of signal transduction revealed a striking diversity of molecular signaling profiles in AD human skin fibroblasts that express endogenous levels of mutant presenilins PS-1 or PS-2 or the Trisomy 21 proteome. AD fibroblasts bearing the PS-1 M146L mutation associated with highly aggressive AD displayed persistent BKB2R signaling plus decreased ERK activation by BK, correctible by gamma-secretase inhibitor Compound E. Lack of these effects in the homologous PS-2 mutant cells indicates specificity of presenilin gamma-secretase catalytic components in BK signaling biology directed toward MAPK activation. Oxidative stress revealed a JNK-dependent survival pathway in normal fibroblasts lost in PS-1 M146L fibroblasts. Complex molecular profiles of signaling dysfunction in the most putatively straightforward human cellular models of AD suggest that risk ascertainment and therapeutic interventions in AD as a whole will likely demand complex solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2002369200,"Background Cells are not mixed bags of signaling molecules. As a consequence, signals must travel from their origin to distal locations. Much is understood about the purely diffusive propagation of signals through space. Many signals, however, propagate via signaling cascades. Here, we show that, depending on their kinetics, cascades speed up or slow down the propagation of signals through space, relative to pure diffusion. Methodology/Principal Findings We modeled simple cascades operating under different limits of Michaelis-Menten kinetics using deterministic reaction-diffusion equations. Cascades operating far from enzyme saturation speed up signal propagation; the second mobile species moves more quickly than the first through space, on average. The enhanced speed is due to more efficient serial activation of a downstream signaling module (by the signaling molecule immediately upstream in the cascade) at points distal from the signaling origin, compared to locations closer to the source. Conversely, cascades operating under saturated kinetics, which exhibit zero-order ultrasensitivity, can slow down signals, ultimately localizing them to regions around the origin. Conclusions/Significance Signal speed modulation may be a fundamental function of cascades, affecting the ability of signals to penetrate within a cell, to cross-react with other signals, and to activate distant targets. In particular, enhanced speeds provide a way to increase signal penetration into a cell without needing to flood the cell with large numbers of active signaling molecules; conversely, diminished speeds in zero-order ultrasensitive cascades facilitate strong, but localized, signaling."
