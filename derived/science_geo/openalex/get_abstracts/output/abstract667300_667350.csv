https://openalex.org/W3125266951,"Antibodies are a potential therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the risk of the virus evolving to escape them remains unclear. Here we map how all mutations to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 affect binding by the antibodies in the REGN-COV2 cocktail and the antibody LY-CoV016. These complete maps uncover a single amino acid mutation that fully escapes the REGN-COV2 cocktail, which consists of two antibodies, REGN10933 and REGN10987, targeting distinct structural epitopes. The maps also identify viral mutations that are selected in a persistently infected patient treated with REGN-COV2 and during in vitro viral escape selections. Finally, the maps reveal that mutations escaping the individual antibodies are already present in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. These complete escape maps enable interpretation of the consequences of mutations observed during viral surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3122148095,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—a new coronavirus that has led to a worldwide pandemic1—has a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein that is absent in other group-2B coronaviruses2. To explore whether the furin cleavage site contributes to infection and pathogenesis in this virus, we generated a mutant SARS-CoV-2 that lacks the furin cleavage site (ΔPRRA). Here we report that replicates of ΔPRRA SARS-CoV-2 had faster kinetics, improved fitness in Vero E6 cells and reduced spike protein processing, as compared to parental SARS-CoV-2. However, the ΔPRRA mutant had reduced replication in a human respiratory cell line and was attenuated in both hamster and K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Despite reduced disease, the ΔPRRA mutant conferred protection against rechallenge with the parental SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, the neutralization values of sera from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 were lower against the ΔPRRA mutant than against parental SARS-CoV-2, probably owing to an increased ratio of particles to plaque-forming units in infections with the former. Together, our results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site in infection with SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the importance of this site for evaluating the neutralization activities of antibodies. Experimental deletion of the furin cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein highlights an important role for this site in infection and the need to consider this site when evaluating the neutralization activities of antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3121833403,"Targeting sarbecoviruses As we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, we must confront the possibility of new pathogenic coronaviruses emerging in humans in the future. With this in mind, Rappazzo et al. isolated antibodies from a survivor of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), used yeast display libraries to introduce diversity into these antibodies, and then screened for binding to SARS-CoV-2. One of the affinity-matured progeny strongly neutralized SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and two SARS-related viruses from bats. In addition, this antibody bound to the receptor-binding domains from a panel of sarbecoviruses, suggesting broader activity, and provided protection against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in mouse models.

https://openalex.org/W3122927255,"Hurting the virus by targeting the host Many host proteins play a role in the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and some are required for viral replication and translation. There are efforts toward finding drugs that target viral proteins, but a complementary approach is to target these required host proteins. White et al. explored the antiviral activity of the cyclic depsipeptide drug plitidepsin, which targets the hosts cell's translational machinery (see the Perspective by Wong and Damania). The authors show that in cells, the drug is substantially more potent than remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2, with limited cellular toxicity. Prophylactic treatment protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection, so further investigation of plitidepsin as a therapeutic is warranted. Science , this issue p. 926 ; see also p. 884"
https://openalex.org/W3121478780,"Although infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has pleiotropic and systemic effects in some individuals1-3, many others experience milder symptoms. Here, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the distinction between severe and mild phenotypes in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its origins, we performed a whole-blood-preserving single-cell analysis protocol to integrate contributions from all major immune cell types of the blood-including neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and the contents of the serum. Patients with mild COVID-19 exhibit a coordinated pattern of expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)3 across every cell population, whereas these ISG-expressing cells are systemically absent in patients with severe disease. Paradoxically, individuals with severe COVID-19 produce very high titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and have a lower viral load compared to individuals with mild disease. Examination of the serum from patients with severe COVID-19 shows that these patients uniquely produce antibodies that functionally block the production of the ISG-expressing cells associated with mild disease, by activating conserved signalling circuits that dampen cellular responses to interferons. Overzealous antibody responses pit the immune system against itself in many patients with COVID-19, and perhaps also in individuals with other viral infections. Our findings reveal potential targets for immunotherapies in patients with severe COVID-19 to re-engage viral defence."
https://openalex.org/W3122115907,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common, serious, genetic heart disorder. Rare pathogenic variants in sarcomere genes cause HCM, but with unexplained phenotypic heterogeneity. Moreover, most patients do not carry such variants. We report a genome-wide association study of 2,780 cases and 47,486 controls that identified 12 genome-wide-significant susceptibility loci for HCM. Single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability indicated a strong polygenic influence, especially for sarcomere-negative HCM (64% of cases; h2g = 0.34 ± 0.02). A genetic risk score showed substantial influence on the odds of HCM in a validation study, halving the odds in the lowest quintile and doubling them in the highest quintile, and also influenced phenotypic severity in sarcomere variant carriers. Mendelian randomization identified diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as a key modifiable risk factor for sarcomere-negative HCM, with a one standard deviation increase in DBP increasing the HCM risk fourfold. Common variants and modifiable risk factors have important roles in HCM that we suggest will be clinically actionable. Genome-wide association analyses identify 12 susceptibility loci for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). A genetic risk score for HCM was associated with disease status in a validation study and influenced phenotypic severity in carriers of risk variants in sarcomere genes."
https://openalex.org/W3124597376,"Grasslands are among the most widespread ecosystems on Earth and among the most degraded. Their characterization and monitoring are generally based on field measurements, which are incomplete spatially and temporally. The recent advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides data at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. This study aims to test and compare three approaches based on multispectral imagery acquired by UAV to estimate forage biomass or vegetation cover in grasslands. The study site is composed of 30 pasture plots (25 × 50 m), 5 bare soil plots (25 x 50), and 6 control plots (5 × 5 m) on a 14-ha field maintained at various biomass levels by grazing rotations and clipping over a complete growing season. A total of 14 flights were performed. A first approach based on structure from motion was used to generate a volumetric-based biomass estimation model (R 2 of 0.93 and 0.94 for fresh biomass [FM] and dry biomass [DM], respectively). This approach is not very sensitive to low vegetation levels but is accurate for FM estimation greater than 0.5 kg/m 2 (0.1 kg DM/m 2 ). The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) was selected to develop two additional approaches. One is based on a regression biomass prediction model (R 2 of 0.80 and 0.66 for FM and DM, respectively) and leads to an accurate estimation at levels of FM lower than 3 kg/m 2 (0.6 kg DM/m 2 ). The other approach is based on a classification of vegetation cover from clustering of GNDVI values in four classes. This approach is more qualitative than the other ones but more robust and generalizable. These three approaches are relatively simple to use and applicable in an operational context. They are also complementary and can be adapted to specific applications in grassland characterization."
https://openalex.org/W3121991432,"The aim of this study is to provide a landslide susceptibility map of the Xunyang District of a mountainous terrain, at the southern part of the Qin-Ba Mountain Region, which has been highly exposed to widely distributed shallow landslides over the past few decades. The Weight of Evidence (WoE) method was adopted in this research considering both the presence of a certain landslide causative factor class and the absence of remaining classes, which was used for determining a clearly spatial correlation between a landslide occurrence and the causative factors. Intrinsic factors, including geomorphological factors, geological factors, and river flow networks, and external factors of anthropogenic engineering activities in terms of density of road network were all considered and involved in the Geological Information System (GIS) environment for reconstructing the thematic layers of factor dataset. Significant assumptions prior to the analysis were emphasized to ensure conditional independence between each pair of factors for this bivariate statistical approach. In addition, a detailed landslide inventory map was constructed through field investigation and a remote sensing interpretation process at a scale of 1:50000. The thematic layers and landslide map were overlapped to obtain a spatial statistical relationship by using the frequency ratio method. At last, the validation process for the derived susceptibility map was conducted by applying the ROC curve, indicating that more than 90% of the landslides were in categories of high and moderate susceptibility zones. The causative factor classes, including the slope angles ranging from 20 to 40°, strong weathered and fractured strata, and road network density were identified to considerably influence the landslide distribution in the study area. The results have proven to be significantly meaningful for landslide hazard risk mitigation and land use management for the local authorities responsible for these fields."
https://openalex.org/W3121203124,"Background Worldwide, preterm birth accounts for 1 million deaths of infants each year and 60% of these deaths occur in developing countries. In addition to the significant health consequences on the infant, preterm birth can lead to economic costs. There was a lack of study in western Ethiopia, and most of those studies conducted in other parts of a country were based on card review with a cross-sectional study design. The risk factors of preterm birth may vary from region to region within the same country due to variation in socioeconomic status and health care service coverage. Therefore, this study aimed to identify determinants of preterm birth in western Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based case-control study was conducted from February 15 to April 15, 2020, in western Ethiopia. The eligible 188 cases and 377 controls were randomly selected for this study. Cases were women who gave birth after 28 weeks and before 37 completed weeks of gestation, and controls were women who gave birth at and after 37 weeks of gestation from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Data were collected by a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epi info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify determinants of preterm birth at P-value &lt;0.05. Results From a total of 565 eligible participants, 516 (172 cases and 344 controls) participated in this study with a response rate of 91.3%. The result of the multivariable analysis shows that mothers who developed pregnancy-induced hypertension (AOR = 3.13, 95% CI; 1.78, 5.50), only one time ANC visits (AOR = 5.99, 95% CI; 2.65, 13.53), experienced premature rupture of membrane (AOR = 3.57, 95% CI; 1.79, 7.13), birth interval less than two years (AOR = 2.96, 95% CI; 1.76, 4.98), developed anemia during the current pregnancy (AOR = 4.20, 95% CI; 2.13, 8.28) and didn’t get dietary supplementation during the current pregnancy (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI; 1.51, 3.91) had statistically significant association with experiencing preterm birth. Conclusion Antenatal care service providers should focus on mothers with pregnancy-induced hypertension, premature rupture of membrane, and anemia during pregnancy, and refer to the senior experts for early management to reduce the risk of preterm delivery. Antenatal care services such as counseling the mother on the benefit of dietary supplementation during pregnancy, antenatal care follow up, and lengthening birth interval should be integrated into the existing health extension packages. New and inclusive strategies such as the establishment of comprehensive mobile clinic services should also be designed to reduce the burden of preterm birth among women living in the rural community. Lastly, we recommend future researchers to conduct longitudinal and community-based studies supplemented with qualitative methods."
https://openalex.org/W3121268165,"Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) with bilateral opacities causes fatalities in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is often difficult to identify the causes of AHRF at the time of admission. The SpO 2 to FiO 2 (S/F) ratio has been recently used as a non-invasive and alternative marker of the PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) ratio in acute respiratory failure. This retrospective cohort study was conducted from October 2010 to March 2019 at the Showa University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. We enrolled 94 AHRF patients who had bilateral opacities and received mechanical ventilation in ICU to investigate their prognostic markers including S/F ratio. Significant differences were observed for APACHE II, S/F ratio, PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) ratio, and ventilator−free-days at day 28 for ICU mortality, and for age, S/F ratio, P/F ratio, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ventilator−free days at day 28 for hospital mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the S/F ratio was significantly and independently associated with the risk of death during in ICU (p = 0.003) and hospitalization (p = 0.002). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) based on the S/F ratio were significantly greater than those based on simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) for ICU mortality (0.785 in S/F ratio vs. 0.575 in SAPS II, p = 0.012; 0.785 in S/F ratio vs 0.594 in SOFA, p = 0.021) and for hospital mortality (0.701 in S/F ratio vs. 0.502 in SAPS II, p = 0.012; 0.701 in S/F ratio vs. 0.503 in SOFA, p = 0.005). In the subanalysis for bacterial pneumonia and interstitial lung disease groups, the AUC based on the S/F ratio was the greatest among all prognostic markers, including APACHE II, SAPS II, and SOFA. The S/F ratio may be a useful and noninvasive predictive prognostic marker for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral opacities in the ICU."
https://openalex.org/W3126055275,"The Strait of Georgia, Canada, has complex interactions among natural and human pressures that confound understanding of changes in this system. We report on the interannual variability in biomass of 12 zooplankton taxonomic groups in the deep (bottom depths greater than 50 m) central and northern Strait of Georgia from 1996 to 2018, and their relationships with 10 physical variables. Total zooplankton biomass was dominated (76%) by large-sized crustaceans (euphausiids, large and medium size calanoid copepods, amphipods). The annual anomaly of total zooplankton biomass was highest in the late 1990s, lowest in the mid-2000s, and generally above its climatological (1996–2010) average after 2011, although many individual groups had different patterns. Two latent trends (derived from dynamic factor analyses) described the variability of annual biomass anomalies underlying all zooplankton groups: a U-shaped trend with its minimum in the mid-2000s, and a declining trend from 2001 to 2011. Two latent trends also described the physical variables. The variability represented by these four latent trends clustered into two periods: 1996–2006, with generally declining zooplankton biomass and increasing salinities, and 2007–2018, with increasing zooplankton biomass and decreasing salinities. ARIMA modelling showed sea surface salinity at Entrance Island in the middle Strait of Georgia, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the peak date of the spring phytoplankton bloom were significantly related to the two latent zooplankton trends. ARIMA models comparing zooplankton and physical variables with the marine survivals of four salmon populations which enter the Strait as juveniles (Chinook: Cowichan River, Puntledge River, Harrison River; Coho: Big Qualicum River) all included zooplankton groups consistent with known salmon prey; prominent among the physical variables were sea surface salinity and variables representing the flow from the Fraser River. These regressions explained ( adj R 2 ) 38 to 85% of the annual variability in marine survival rates of these salmon populations over the study time period. Although sea temperature was important in some relationships between zooplankton biomass and salmon marine survival, salinity was a more frequent and more important variable, consistent with its influence on the hydrodynamics of the Strait of Georgia system."
https://openalex.org/W3122586893,"Background Despite the efforts made by the government of Ethiopia, the community-based health insurance (CBHI) enrollment rate failed to reach the potential beneficiaries. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the enrollment status of households for community-based health insurance and associated factors in peripheral areas of Southern Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a community based cross-sectional study design with both quantitative and qualitative methods. Systematic random sampling was employed to select 820 households from 27, April to 12 June 2018. A pretested structured questionnaire, in-depth interview, and focus group discussion guiding tool were used to obtain information. A binary logistic regression model was used to assess the association between independent and outcome variables. A P-Value of less than 0.05 was taken as a cutoff to declare association in multivariable analysis. Qualitative data were analyzed manually using the thematic analysis method. Results Out of 820 households, 273[33.30%; 95% CI: 29.9–36.20] were enrolled in the community based health insurance scheme. Having good knowledge [AOR = 13.97, 95%CI: 8.64, 22.60], having family size of greater than five [AOR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.06], presence of frequently ill individual [AOR = 3.90, 95% CI: 2.03, 7.51] and presence of chronic illness [AOR = 3.64, 95% CI: 1.67, 7.79] were positively associated with CBHI enrollment. In addition, poor quality of care, lack of managerial commitment, lack of trust and transparency, unavailability of basic logistics and supplies were also barriers for CBHI enrollment. Conclusion and recommendation The study found that lower community based health insurance enrollment status. A higher probability of CBHI enrollment among higher health care demanding population groups was observed. Poor perceived quality of health care, poor managerial support and lack of trust were found to be barriers for non-enrollment. Therefore, wide-range awareness creation strategies should be used to address adverse selection and poor knowledge. In addition, trust should be built among communities through transparent management. Furthermore, the quality of care being given in public health facilities should be improved to encourage the community to be enrolled in CBHI."
https://openalex.org/W3123548371,"Agricultural modernization and intensification have been regarded as a significant way to support agricultural development and improve farm income in China. Agricultural cooperatives have played an important role in promoting the modernization and intensification of Chinese agricultural sector. Given the increasing concerns about environmental harm, however, it still remains unclear whether and the extent to which agricultural cooperatives contributes to reducing environmental impacts of agricultural production. Hence, this study performed an environmental evaluation using life cycle assessment for three different organization forms of grape production in Changli County, Hebei Province, China: smallholder farmers, farmer-owned cooperatives and investor-owned firm-led cooperatives. Then the results of life cycle assessment were monetarized and cost benefit analysis was used to evaluate the economic performance of these three organization forms of grape production. The results demonstrate that investor-owned firm-led cooperatives present an overall improvement in environmental and economic performance with the lowest weighted environmental index (integrating all impact categories into a single score), the highest net profit and the highest total net benefit. The results also show a difference in potential improvement in environmental impacts and economic returns between cooperatives and smallholder farmers. Additionally, the production and application of organic and chemical fertilizer and pesticide have been identified as major contributors to total environmental damage."
https://openalex.org/W3121525849,"Current management and control of Aedes aegypti populations in urban areas are based on the spraying of insecticides. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of spraying larvicide ( Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis ) using a truck-mounted Buffalo Turbine and adulticide (Deltamethrin) using a Grizzly ULV Sprayer in an urban area with high densities of Ae . aegypti and many cryptic and difficult to reach aquatic breeding habitats. Experiments were conducted in a tire shop located in Miami-Dade County, Florida with approximately 100,000 used airplane tires. Insecticide interventions were performed after a baseline survey consisting of 3 weeks of collections, followed by two insecticide interventions: (i) application of the adulticide followed by the application of larvicide on the subsequent week; and (ii) application of both adulticide and larvicide on two consecutive weeks. The first insecticide intervention resulted in a non-significant decrease in the relative abundance of Ae . aegypti . On the other hand, the second insecticide intervention significantly reduced the Ae . aegypti relative abundance ( P &lt; 0.002). Our results demonstrated that the combined insecticide interventions on two consecutive weeks significantly reduced the relative abundance of Ae . aegypti . This result indicated that the larvicide was successfully propelled reaching cryptical and difficult to reach aquatic habitats. However, even though the number of mosquitoes was greatly reduced, it was still greatly above the 10-mosquito threshold by trap night used by the Miami-Dade Mosquito Control Division to deploy an inspector to survey the area. Considering the lack of new and effective mosquito control tools, efficient and mobile insecticide propellers such as Buffalo Turbine can be of great help to manage mosquito populations in urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W3125254537,"The heat shock response is a transcriptional program of organisms to counteract an imbalance in protein homeostasis. It is orchestrated in all eukaryotic cells by heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1). Despite very intensive research, the intricacies of the Hsf1 activation-attenuation cycle remain elusive at a molecular level. Post-translational modifications belong to one of the key mechanisms proposed to adapt the Hsf1 activity to the needs of individual cells, and phosphorylation of Hsf1 at multiple sites has attracted much attention. According to cell biological and proteomics data, Hsf1 is also modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) at several sites. How SUMOylation affects Hsf1 activity at a molecular level is still unclear. Here, we analyzed Hsf1 SUMOylation in vitro with purified components to address questions that could not be answered in cell culture models. In vitro Hsf1 is primarily conjugated at lysine 298 with a single SUMO, though we did detect low-level SUMOylation at other sites. Different SUMO E3 ligases such as protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4 enhanced the efficiency of in vitro modification but did not alter SUMO site preferences. We provide evidence that Hsf1 trimerization and phosphorylation at serines 303 and 307 increases SUMOylation efficiency, suggesting that Hsf1 is SUMOylated in its activated state.

We propose that SUMOylation acts at the transcription level of the heat shock response. Protein misfolding is detrimental for cells because of not only loss of function but also gain of toxicity of some misfolded and aggregated protein species. To cope with proteotoxic stress, a highly conserved homeostatic transcriptional program, the so-called heat shock response (HSR), emerged early in cellular evolution. The main regulator of the HSR in eukaryotic cells is the heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1). Like with other transcription factors, the activity of Hsf1 is controlled on many levels (1Bekhbat M. Rowson S.A. Neigh G.N.

Upon proteotoxic stress, Hsf1 trimers accumulate in the nucleus and bind to heat shock elements (HSEs), three to four inverted NGAAN repeats, in promoters and enhancers to drive transcription of heat shock genes (4Larson J.S.

Hsf1 acetylation at K80 was shown to reduce DNA binding of Hsf1 and was proposed to be important for attenuation of the HSR (9Westerheide S.D. Anckar J. Stevens S.M. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Stress-inducible regulation of heat shock factor 1 by the deacetylase SIRT1.Science. 2009; 323: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Likewise, acetylation at K118 by E1A binding protein P300 was proposed to impair functionality of Hsf1 (10Raychaudhuri S. Loew C. Körner R. Pinkert S. Theis M. Hayer-Hartl M. Buchholz F. Hartl F.U.

In contrast, acetylation at K208 and K298 by E1A binding protein P300 reduced degradation of Hsf1 through the proteasome resulting in enhanced HSR (10Raychaudhuri S. Loew C. Körner R. Pinkert S.

Less studied is the post-translational modification of Hsf1 with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), although SUMOylation per se has been intensively studied in the context of transcriptional regulation (15Rosonina E.

Something about SUMO inhibits transcription.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and in HSR (see later). SUMOylation is a reversible and highly dynamic modification that regulates the function of more than thousand proteins, many of which are associated with chromatin (reviewed in Refs. (18Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: A regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 19Lima L.C.A.C.D.

SUMO conjugation – a mechanistic view.Biomol. Concepts. 2017; 8: 13-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). SUMO-specific conjugating enzymes (E1 activating, E2 conjugating, and E3 ligating enzymes) form an isopeptide bond between the carboxy terminus of SUMO and the ε-amino group of lysines in an ATP-dependent reaction cascade, whereas SUMO isopeptidases revert the modification by hydrolysis. Many proteins that are SUMOylated carry a short SUMOylation consensus motif, ΨKxE (where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue and x is any residue), which is recognized by the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (Ubc9). Vertebrates express at least three SUMO proteins: SUMO2 and SUMO3 are virtually identical, frequently form chains via a SUMOylation consensus motif in their flexible N termini, and their modification is strongly stimulated upon stress including heat shock. SUMO1, which shares only 50% sequence identity with SUMO2/3, exists largely in conjugated form under normal growth conditions and does usually not form chains as it lacks the N-terminal SUMOylation site (18Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: A regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 20Pichler A. Fatouros C. Lee H.

Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The SUMO stress response is activated upon heat stress and results in rapid conjugation of SUMO2/3 to protein substrates (16Chymkowitch P. Nguéa P A. Enserink J.M.

Chromatin SUMOylation in heat stress: To protect, pause and organise?: SUMO stress response on chromatin.Bioessays. 2017; 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This general protein SUMOylation is proposed to be an early reaction to protein misfolding, protecting partially misfolded proteins by increasing their solubility through addition of SUMO chains (24Liebelt F.

Consistently, cells depleted for SUMO2/3 are more sensitive to heat stress (25Golebiowski F. Matic I. Tatham M.H. Cole C. Yin Y. Nakamura A. Cox J. Barton G.J. Mann M. Hay R.T. System-wide changes to SUMO modifications in response to heat shock.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra24Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The SUMO stress response also leads to massive changes in the proteome, suggesting an influence on gene expression. SUMOylated proteins are found at sites of actively transcribed inducible genes (like heat shock genes) (25Golebiowski F. Matic I. Tatham M.H. Cole C. Yin Y. Nakamura A. Cox J. Barton G.J. Mann M.

Global SUMOylation on active chromatin is an acute heat stress response restricting transcription.Genome Biol. 2015; 16: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On one side, SUMO2/3 modification upon heat stress upregulates genes connected with not only survival and growth but also cell death (26Seifert A. Schofield P. Barton G.J. Hay R.T. Proteotoxic stress reprograms the chromatin landscape of SUMO modification.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8: rs7Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other side, SUMO2/3 modification upon heat stress represses mostly genes associated with transcription, reducing the overall load on the protein quality surveillance machinery (prosurvival function). SUMOylation was proposed to inhibit transcription reinitiation, thereby sustaining polymerase II pausing (23Niskanen E.A. Palvimo J.J. Chromatin SUMOylation in heat stress: To protect, pause and organise?: SUMO stress response on chromatin.Bioessays. 2017; 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Golebiowski F. Matic I.

Manley J.L. Sumoylation of transcription factor Gcn4 facilitates its Srb10-mediated clearance from promoters in yeast.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In acute stress, increase in SUMO modification is correlated with the occupancy of heat shock gene promoters by protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1 (PIAS1) SUMO E3 ligase and RNA polymerase II. Thereby, SUMOylation has been proposed as a mechanism to tightly regulate heat shock genes by preventing transcriptional hyperactivation (28Niskanen E.A. Malinen M. Sutinen P. Toropainen S. Paakinaho V. Vihervaara A. Joutsen J. Kaikkonen M.U. Sistonen L. Palvimo J.J. Global SUMOylation on active chromatin is an acute heat stress response restricting transcription.Genome Biol. 2015; 16: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). How SUMO exerts its function in transcription regulation is largely unknown. On one side, stress-induced SUMO modification on active chromatin was proposed to act indirectly by stabilizing protein complexes on DNA rather than to act on transcription directly (26Seifert A. Schofield P. Barton G.J. Hay R.T. Proteotoxic stress reprograms the chromatin landscape of SUMO modification.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8: rs7Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other side, transcription factors are frequent targets for SUMO modification (15Rosonina E. Akhter A. Dou Y. Babu J. Sri Theivakadadcham V.S. Regulation of transcription factors by sumoylation.Transcription. 2017; 8: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Chymkowitch P. Nguéa P A. Enserink J.M. SUMO-regulated transcription: Challenging the dogma.Bioessays. 2015; 37: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Hsf1 is very rapidly and transiently SUMOylated upon heat stress (25Golebiowski F. Matic I. Tatham M.H. Cole C. Yin Y. Nakamura A. Cox J. Barton G.J. Mann M. Hay R.T.

Phosphorylation of serine 303 is a prerequisite for the stress-inducible SUMO modification of heat shock factor 1.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2953-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This transient modification is linked to phosphorylation in proximity to a conventional SUMOylation consensus motif surrounding K298, a finding that led to the first description of a phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation motif (PDSM) (30Hietakangas V. Ahlskog J.K. Jakobsson A.M. Hellesuo M. Sahlberg N.M. Holmberg C.I. Mikhailov A. Palvimo J.J. Pirkkala L. Sistonen L.

PDSM, a motif for phosphorylation-dependent SUMO modification.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The described PDSM consists of eight residues: ΨKxExxSP, where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue and x is any residue. Ser 303, which is part of the PDSM, and Ser 307 (Fig. 1, A and B) can both be phosphorylated in response to heat shock. S307 phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase may be required for modification of S303 by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (13Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. Sequential phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase and glycogen synthase kinase 3 represses transcriptional activation by heat shock factor-1.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), but this is a matter of debate (30Hietakangas V. Ahlskog J.K. Jakobsson A.M. Hellesuo M. Sahlberg N.M. Holmberg C.I. Mikhailov A. Palvimo J.J. Pirkkala L. Sistonen L. Phosphorylation of serine 303 is a prerequisite for the stress-inducible SUMO modification of heat shock factor 1.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2953-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Increased transcriptional activity has been observed for the non-SUMOylatable Hsf1–K298R and Hsf1–S303A variants in a cell culture model, strongly implying that SUMOylation downregulates Hsf1 activity (31Hietakangas V. Anckar J. Blomster H.A. Fujimoto M. Palvimo J.J. Nakai A. Sistonen L. PDSM, a motif for phosphorylation-dependent SUMO modification.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation regulates Hsf1 by reducing its transactivation capability (30Hietakangas V. Ahlskog J.K. Jakobsson A.M. Hellesuo M. Sahlberg N.M. Holmberg C.I. Mikhailov A. Palvimo J.J. Pirkkala L. Sistonen L. Phosphorylation of serine 303 is a prerequisite for the stress-inducible SUMO modification of heat shock factor 1.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2953-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Whether K298 is the only relevant SUMOylation site in Hsf1, however, is not clear. Proteomics identified four additional SUMOylation sites in Hsf1 (K126, K157, K208, and K224) (Fig. 1B) (32Hendriks I.A. D'Souza R.C.J. Yang B. Verlaan-de Vries M. Mann M. Vertegaal A.C.O. Uncovering global SUMOylation signaling networks in a site-specific manner.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 33Hendriks I.A. Lyon D. Young C. Jensen L.J. Vertegaal A.C.O. Nielsen M.L. Site-specific mapping of the human SUMO proteome reveals co-modification with phosphorylation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2017; 24: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One of these sites (K208) is within the sequence essential for monomerization and dislocation of Hsf1 from DNA by the Hsp70 machinery (34Kmiecik S.W. Le Breton L. Mayer M.P. Feedback regulation of heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) activity by Hsp70-mediated trimer unzipping and dissociation from DNA.EMBO J. 2020; 39: e104096Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and may affect this process. Consistent with the possibility that Hsf1 may carry more than one SUMO is an unusual low electrophoretic mobility of SUMOylated Hsf1 in SDS-PAGE (30Hietakangas V. Ahlskog J.K. Jakobsson A.M. Hellesuo M. Sahlberg N.M. Holmberg C.I. Mikhailov A. Palvimo J.J. Pirkkala L. Sistonen L. Phosphorylation of serine 303 is a prerequisite for the stress-inducible SUMO modification of heat shock factor 1.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2953-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, how SUMOylation regulates Hsf1 at a molecular level remained unclear in the published cell culture–based studies. Whether Hsf1 can be SUMOylated before activation in the monomeric state or subsequent to activation, in the trimeric state, and how exactly this modification influences Hsf1–DNA binding also remained unknown. The role of phosphorylation in regulating Hsf1 SUMOylation was also not clear. To address these questions, we reconstituted Hsf1 SUMOylation in vitro with purified components. We demonstrated that Hsf1 can be SUMOylated in vitro with high efficiency. Consistent with cell culture studies, our data indicate that lysine 298 is the preferred SUMOylation site within Hsf1 in vitro. Furthermore, we show that most Hsf1 molecules are conjugated with a single SUMO, and we only find traces of double SUMOylated species, suggesting a low degree of SUMO chain formation or additional SUMOylation sites in vitro. MS and biochemical data strongly imply that Hsf1 mono SUMOylation results in a 50-kDa upshift observed on SDS-PAGE, most likely because of branched conjugate formation. In our in vitro system, trimeric Hsf1 is more efficiently SUMOylated than monomeric Hsf1 by Ubc9. The phosphomimetic Hsf1–S303E,S307E variant is slightly better SUMOylated in vitro than wildtype Hsf1, indicating that Hsf1 phosphorylation at S303/307 is not strictly required for SUMO transfer onto Hsf1. SUMOylation did not interfere with Hsf1–DNA binding or heat shock cognate 71kDa protein (HSPA8) (Hsc70)-mediated dissociation of Hsf1 from DNA. Thus, we propose that Hsf1 SUMOylation attenuates Hsf1 action by interfering with the process of transcription itself, for example, by recruiting corepressors to heat shock gene promoters or by impairing the interaction of Hsf1 transactivation domain with the transcription machinery. To clarify the nature of Hsf1 SUMOylation, we turned to in vitro SUMOylation experiments with full-length Hsf1. In light of the observation that heat stress–induced Hsf1 SUMOylation requires phosphorylation, we decided to test both wildtype Hsf1 and a phosphomimetic variant. As serines 303 and 307 are both phosphorylated under stress conditions, we considered the double phosphomimetic variant Hsf1–S303E,S307E to best imitate the in vivo situation. In a first step, the conditions for Hsf1 SUMOylation in vitro had to be established. The SUMOylation reaction is catalyzed by a system of three enzymes: the E1 SUMO activating enzyme (heterodimer SUMO-activating enzyme subunit 1 [Aos1]/SUMO-activating enzyme subunit 2 [Uba2]), the E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9), and an E3 ligase such as one of several PIAS E3 ligases or the nucleoporin and E3 ligase E3 SUMO-protein ligase Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2). In vitro, a combination of E1 and E2 seems to be sufficient to transfer SUMO to the consensus site containing substrate, and E3 ligases are proposed to accelerate the reaction or drive substrate specificity (18Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: A regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Preliminary screening for Hsf1 SUMOylation conditions demonstrated that a combination of E1 (0.1 μM) enzyme with the E2 enzyme at high concentration (1.1 μM) was sufficient to modify Hsf1 in vitro with His-tagged SUMO1 (Fig. 1C). A 70 amino acid fragment of the E3 ligase RanBP2 (IR1+M) that can stimulate SUMO transfer from the E2 conjugating enzyme to many different targets (35Pichler A. Knipscheer P. Saitoh H. Sixma T.K. Melchior F. The RanBP2 SUMO E3 ligase is neither HECT- nor RING-type.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) did not increase efficiency of Hsf1 conjugation under these conditions (possibly because of the His tag; see below Fig. 4). Under optimal conditions, we observed six major bands above unmodified Hsf1 (labeled a to f) that are only visible in the presence of the SUMOylation machinery and ATP but not in the absence of ATP, with the dominant band (d) approximately 50 kDa above unmodified Hsf1. The N-His-SUMO1 that was used in these initial experiments has a theoretical mass of 13164.66 Da (measured 13164.33 Da), but according to previous reports, mono-SUMOylation causes an increase in apparent molecular weight on SDS-PAGE of 15 to 20 kDa (36Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. Detection of sumoylated proteins.Met. Mol. Biol. 2009; 464: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were intrigued by the fact that the molecular weight shift for the dominant band (d) above unmodified Hsf1 was around 50 kDa according to SDS-PAGE, arguing against Hsf1 mono-SUMOylation (also observed in Ref. (30Hietakangas V. Ahlskog J.K. Jakobsson A.M. Hellesuo M. Sahlberg N.M. Holmberg C.I. Mikhailov A. Palvimo J.J. Pirkkala L. Sistonen L. Phosphorylation of serine 303 is a prerequisite for the stress-inducible SUMO modification of heat shock factor 1.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2953-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar)). In addition, another study investigating Hsf1 SUMOylation reported upon Hsf1 SUMOylation a shift smaller than 50 kDa arousing controversies (37Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Mayhew C.N. Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. Goodson M. Regulation of heat shock transcription factor 1 by stress-induced SUMO-1 modification.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40263-40267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Three explanations appear possible for the observed 50 kDa increase in molecular weight of modified Hsf1: (i) the branched Hsf1–SUMO conjugate has a strongly reduced electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE; (ii) Hsf1 is simultaneously SUMOylated at more than one site; and (iii) SUMO chains are f"

Most COVID-19 related studies in Ethiopia mainly focused on the general population, whereas, this study aimed to assess the knowledge of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors among waiters in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1 to June 15, 2020, among waiters working in food and drinking establishments found in Mizan-Aman, Jemu, and Masha towns in Southwest Ethiopia. A total of 422 waiters were selected using a simple random sampling technique, and the data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. The data were entered into Epi-data manager version 4.0.2 and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify predictors of good preventive behaviors at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results Four hundred and sixteen respondents participated in this study, with a response rate of 98.6%. A significant proportion of participants know the cause, route of transmission, symptoms, and prevention methods of COVID-19 virus. However, very few (21.2%) had good preventive behaviors. The study showed that good preventive behavior was positively associated with female sex (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.38–3.94), higher schooling (AOR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17–0.88), high-risk perception (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.51–4.32), and high perceived self-efficacy (AOR = 1.1.75, 95% CI: 1.05–2.90). Conclusions A significant proportion of waiters know common symptoms of COVID 19, route of transmission, and its prevention methods. However, the preventive behavior was very low. Thus, all concerned bodies working on the prevention and control of COVID-19 should give attention to this population group to enhance compliance with recommended preventive behaviors."

In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that, after activation by GPCRs at the PM, some Gβγ dimers can translocate from the PM to intracellular organelles, including the Golgi apparatus (GA), likely via passive diffusion, and that the efficiency of translocation is determined by Gγ anchoring to the PM, as well as Gγ interaction with the receptors (5Akgoz M.

The MAPKs extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and PI3Ks are crucially involved in many fundamental cellular processes and are directly associated with the pathogenesis of human diseases, particularly cancer. It is known that almost all GPCRs can activate the MAPK Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. However, ERK1/2 activation by different GPCRs or the same GPCR in different cell types may be mediated through different biochemical pathways, involving distinct signaling molecules, such as Gβγ subunits, arrestins, small GTPases, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and protein kinases (18Crespo P.

PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases that specifically phosphorylate the inositol moiety of phospholipids at the 3’ position and can be divided into three classes based on their sequence homology and substrate specificity. Class I PI3Ks include PI3Kα, β, γ, and δ isoforms, which are heterodimers consisting of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit, and the PI3Kγ catalytic subunit p110γ can form a complex with the regulatory subunit p101 or p87. It has been known that the cell surface GPCRs can activate PI3Kβ, γ, and δ isoforms and Gβγ dimers activate PI3Kβ and γ isoforms. PI3Kγ activation by Gβγ has been extensively studied, and these studies have shown that Gβγ can directly interact with both p110γ and p101 (31Balla T.

Over the past decades, multiple signaling cascades have been defined to contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. Among these cascades, the ERK1/2 and PI3K pathways are hyperactivated in prostate cancer and enhanced activation of ERK1/2 and PI3Ks is correlated with disease progression, androgen independence, and poor prognosis (33Thorpe L.M.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the hyperactivation of the ERK1/2 and PI3K pathways in prostate cancer remain poorly understood. Here we study the function of Gβγ translocation to the GA in ERK1/2 activation by the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in human androgen-insensitive prostate cancer (DU145 and PC3) cells and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. CXCR4 is a crucial factor involved in bone metastasis of prostate cancer and CXCR4 antagonists inhibit prostate cancer growth and metastasis (37Chatterjee S. Behnam Azad B. Nimmagadda S. The intricate role of CXCR4 in cancer.Adv. Cancer Res. 2014; 124: 31-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 38Taichman R.S. Cooper C. Keller E.T. Pienta K.J. Taichman N.S. McCauley L.K. Use of the stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCR4 pathway in prostate cancer metastasis to bone.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1832-1837PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Gβγ translocation to the GA activates the ERK1/2 pathway through the PI3Kγ heterodimer p110γ-p101. We also show that knockout of the most translocatable Gγ9 subunit and p110γ markedly inhibits prostate cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. These data reveal a novel function of Gβγ translocation to the GA to spatiotemporally regulate MAPK activation by GPCRs and control tumor progression. Individual YFP-tagged Gγ subunits were expressed together with Gβ1, a commonly expressed Gβ subunit, Gαi1 subunit, and the Golgi marker pmTurquoise2-Golgi in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells. Gβγ translocation to the GA in response to CXCR4 activation by stimulation with stromal cell–derived factor 1α (SDF1α) was measured by the increase in total YFP signal at the GA by confocal microcopy in live cells (Fig. S1A). All 12 Gγ subunits were mainly expressed at the PM in unstimulated cells, and SDF1α stimulation induced Gγ translocation from the PM to intracellular compartments at different magnitudes and rates. However, translocation of Gγ9 to the GA was dramatically more efficient than that of any other Gγ subunit (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1B). The total Gγ9 signal at the GA increased by approximately 80% (Fig. 1B). The quantification of relative expression of Gγ9 at the PM, nucleus, and GA showed that SDF1α stimulation markedly reduced Gγ9 expression at the PM and increased Gγ9 expression at the GA (Fig. 1C). Translocation of Gγ9 from the PM to the GA occurred with a half time (t1/2) of about 5 s (Fig. 1D). The closest Gγ subunit to Gγ9 was Gγ11, which GA translocation increased by only 30%. In contrast, Gγ3 showed the least translocation (<10%) (Fig. 1B). Across Gγ subunits, the kinetics and extent of translocation were similar in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, B and D). These data indicate that Gγ9 is a unique Golgi-translocating Gγ subunit. To study the function of Gβγ translocation, we focused on ERK1/2 activation. SDF1α strongly activated ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner, and the EC50 values were 3.5 ± 0.09, 6.3 ± 0.2, and 5.8 ± 0.03 nM (n = 3) in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α was completely blocked by treatments with pertussis toxin (PTX), the Gβγ inhibitor gallein (39Lehmann D.M. Seneviratne A.M. Smrcka A.V. Small molecule disruption of G protein beta gamma subunit signaling inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis and inflammation.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and the selective CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (Fig. 2C). Transient expression of Golgi-GRK2ct, which sequesters free Gβγ dimers at the GA, abolished ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α. In contrast, expression of the Golgi-GRK2ctR587Q mutant, which does not bind Gβγ, had no effect on ERK/2 activation (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2). These data suggest an important role of Golgi-localized Gβγ in ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4. In order to discriminate the roles of translocating and nontranslocating Gγ subunits in MAPK activation, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system to selectively knock out Gγ9 or Gγ3 in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells. Gγ9 and Gγ3 knockout cells were verified by Western blotting using Gγ-specific antibodies (Fig. 2E). Gγ9 knockout did not affect Gγ3 expression, and vice versa (Fig. 2E). Gγ9 and Gγ3 knockout cells were also confirmed by the respective depletion of transiently expressed YFP-Gγ9 and YFP-Gγ3, without affecting YFP-Gγ2 expression (Fig. S3A). Gγ9 knockout in all three cells almost completely inhibited ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α, whereas Gγ3 knockout did not have a clear effect (Fig. 2F). Gγ9 knockout abolished ERK1/2 activation after SDF1α stimulation at all time points tested in PC3 cells (Fig. S3, B and C). Furthermore, transient expression of single guide RNA (sgRNA)-resistant Gγ9 successfully rescued ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α in Gγ9 knockout cells (Fig. 2G and Fig. S3D). These data strongly indicate that the normal expression of endogenous Gγ9 is essential for ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4. To further define the role of Gβγ translocation to the GA in ERK1/2 activation, a rapamycin-inducible translocation system was utilized to specifically recruit Gβγ dimers to either the GA or the PM. In this system, specific targeting peptides (i.e., the mutant KDELr-D193N for GA targeting and amino acids 1–11 of Lyn for PM targeting) were fused to FK506-binding protein (FKBP), while individual cytosolic Gγ subunits were fused to the FKBP-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain. This system has been used previously to recruit Gβγ to the GA and the PM in HeLa cells and cardiomyocytes (11Malik S. deRubio R.G. Trembley M. Irannejad R. Wedegaertner P.B. Smrcka A.V. G protein betagamma subunits regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through a perinuclear Golgi phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate hydrolysis pathway.Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2010; 285: 32393-32404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The system was confirmed by using venus-Gβ1 and Gγ9 (Fig. S4). Of interest, rapamycin-induced recruitment of Gγ2, Gγ3, or Gγ9 to the GA (Golgi-Gγ), each in complex with Gβ1, was able to activate ERK1/2 in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells, whereas recruitment to the PM (PM-Gγ) had no obvious effect (Fig. 3A). Rapamycin incubation to induce Gγ9 translocation to the GA activated ERK1/2 in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3, B and C). These data suggest that different Gβγ dimers can specifically activate ERK1/2 if they are present at the GA. To verify if Golgi-Gβγ–mediated activation of ERK1/2 indeed occurred at the GA, we measured the effects of well-known Golgi disruptors, including brefeldin A (BFA), ilimaquinone, monensin, nigericin, nocodazole, and swainsonine, which induce Golgi fragmentation via distinct mechanisms (40Dinter A. Berger E.G. Golgi-disturbing agents.Histochem. Cell. Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Incubation with each of these Golgi disruptors caused Golgi fragmentation as indicated by GalT, a trans-Golgi marker (Fig. S5), and abolished ERK1/2 activation induced by Golgi-Gγ9 (Fig. 3D). BFA dose dependently inhibited ERK1/2 activation by Golgi-Gγ9 expression, and the IC50 values were 0.37 ± 0.03, 0.19 ± 0.05, and 0.18 ± 0.03 μM (n = 3) in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells, respectively (Fig. 3, E and F). These data demonstrate that the integrity of the Golgi structure is required for ERK1/2 activation by Golgi-Gγ. As BFA treatment to disrupt the GA inhibits CXCR4 expression at the PM, likely by interfering its anterograde transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface (41Dong C. Zhang X. Zhou F. Dou H. Duvernay M.T. Zhang P. Wu G. ADP-ribosylation factors modulate the cell surface transport of G protein-coupled receptors.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 333: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we did not measure the effects of these Golgi disruptors on ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α. We then determined the effect of different Gα subunits on ERK1/2 activation by Gβγ translocation to the GA. Expression of Gαo, Gαi, Gαs, or Gαq subunits each remarkably attenuated ERK1/2 activation by Golgi-Gγ9 in DU145 and PC3 cells (Fig. 3G). In the presence of Gαi subunits, Gβγ normally translocated to the GA. Similar to Gβγ, Gαi also translocated to the GA and strongly colocalized with Gβγ (Fig. 3H), suggesting that overexpression of Gα subunits inhibits Gβγ-mediated ERK1/2 activation by forming the inactive Gαβγ heterotrimers on the GA. Similar to SDF1α-mediated ERK1/2 activation, Golgi-Gγ9–induced ERK1/2 activation was inhibited by expression of Golgi-GRK2ct but not Golgi-GRK2ctR587Q mutant (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, expression of Gγ9 alone, without coexpression of Gβ1, was unable to activate ERK1/2 (Fig. 3G), suggesting a functional unit of Gβγ complex, not just Gγ subunit alone, in ERK1/2 activation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Golgi-localized Gβγ in ERK1/2 activation, we first measured the effects of pharmacological inhibition of well-known Gβγ downstream effectors on ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α. Treatments with LY294002 and wortmannin, two common PI3K inhibitors, partially inhibited ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α. The PI3Kγ inhibitor AS-604850 and the PI3Kδ inhibitor GSK2292767 markedly attenuated ERK1/2 activation, but the PI3Kα inhibitor HS-173, the PI3Kβ inhibitor TGX-221, the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, U73433 (an inactive derivative of U73122), the protein kinase D inhibitor CRT006610, and the protein kinases C inhibitor Go6976 had no effect (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation by AS-604850 was in a dose-dependent fashion, and the IC50 values were 0.32 ± 0.02, 0.39 ± 0.05, and 0.59 ± 0.07 μM (n = 3) in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). ERK1/2 activation induced by recruitment of Gγ9 to the GA was also abrogated by treatments with AS-604850 or GSK2292767, but not HS-173 or TGX-221 (Fig. 4D). Of interest, the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 did not alter ERK1/2 activation by Golgi-Gγ9 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that ERK1/2 activation by Golgi-localized Gβγ is mediated through an AKT-independent mechanism. As positive controls, treatments with two MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, and the Raf1 inhibitor GW5074 abolished ERK1/2 activation by Golgi-Gγ9 (Fig. 4D). To further investigate the role of PI3Kγ in ERK1/2 activation, we generated p110γ knockout DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (Fig. 5A). Similar to the results obtained from Gγ9 knockout cells, SDF1α was unable to activate ERK1/2 in p110γ knockout cells (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, inducible translocation of Gγ9 to the GA failed to activate ERK1/2 in p110γ knockout cells (Fig. 5C). These data demonstrate that ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α and Gβγ translocation to the GA depends on PI3Kγ. To define the role of regulatory subunits of PI3Kγ in ERK1/2 activation by Gβγ, we determined the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of p101 and p87. Similar to p110γ knockout by CRISPR-Cas9, p101 knockdown by siRNA markedly inhibited ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α and Golgi-Gγ9 in PC3 cells, whereas p87 knockdown had no effect (Fig. 5, D and E). To study if p110γ and p101 were expressed at the GA, p110γ and p101 tagged with GFP or DsRed were transiently expressed together with the Golgi marker pmTurquoise2-Golgi in PC3 cells. As expected, p110γ and p101 were mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and extensively colocalized. Both p110γ and p101 were partially colocalized with the Golgi marker (Fig. S6). These data suggest that p110γ-p101 heterodimers, but not p110γ-p87 heterodimers, mediate ERK1/2 activation by Gβγ on the GA. To determine if Gβγ and PI3Kγ were also important for ERK1/2 activation by other endogenous GPCRs in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells, we examined α2-adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs). Stimulation with UK14304, an α2-AR agonist, markedly activated ERK1/2, which was inhibited by treatments with PTX, gallein, and the α2-AR antagonist rauwolscine (Fig. S7A). α2-AR–m"

The spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target of antiviral drugs. Focusing on the existing S protein structure, molecular docking was used in this study to calculate the binding energy and interaction sites between 14 antiviral molecules with different structures and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and the potential drug candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were analyzed. Tizoxanide, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and arbidol were found to have high binding energies, and they effectively bind key sites of the S1 and S2 subunits, inhibiting the virus by causing conformational changes in S1 and S2 during the fusion of the S protein with host cells. Based on the interactions among the drug molecules, the S protein and the amino acid environment around the binding sites, rational structure-based optimization was performed using the molecular connection method and bioisosterism strategy to obtain Ti-2, BD-2, and Ar-3, which have much stronger binding ability to the S protein than the original molecules. This study provides valuable clues for identifying S protein inhibitor binding sites and the mechanism of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect as well as useful inspiration and help for the discovery and optimization of small molecule S protein inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3122353999,"Background Low back pain (LBP) and decreased mobility function are common problem among older people. Muscle weakness has been reported as a risk factor for these conditions, and exercise therapy can improve them. We created a novel exercise device that also measures abdominal trunk muscle strength. Malnutrition has also emerged as a major problem among older people. Muscle is a direct key linking decreased mobility function and malnutrition. This study aimed to examine the associations of LBP with not only decreased physical function and muscle weakness but also nutritional status of older people. Methods We examined the associations of LBP with muscle weakness, decreased mobility function (locomotive syndrome [LS]), and malnutrition among older women. The study included 101 female patients aged 60 years or older scheduled to undergo surgery for degenerative lower extremity diseases. Preoperatively, physical tests including abdominal trunk muscle strength assessment using the device and laboratory tests were conducted. Subjects with LBP (numerical rating scale ≥2; range, 0–4) during the preceding month were allocated to the LBP group (n = 36). Other subjects were allocated to the non-LBP group (n = 65). Results The LBP group had lower abdominal trunk and knee extensor muscle strength, lower serum albumin, and hemoglobin levels as blood biomarkers associated with malnutrition risk, and higher LS test scores than the non-LBP group. A multivariate analysis showed that abdominal trunk muscle weakness and advanced LS were associated with LBP. LBP intensity was negatively correlated with abdominal trunk and knee extensor muscle strength and positively correlated with the LS test score. The serum hemoglobin level was negatively correlated with the LS test score. Conclusion Abdominal trunk muscle weakness and decreased mobility function were associated with LBP among older women."
https://openalex.org/W3122561409,"Epigenetics, such as the dynamic interplay between DNA methylation and demethylation, play diverse roles in critical cellular events. Enzymatic activity at CpG sites, where cytosines are methylated or demethylated, is known to be influenced by the density of CpGs, methylation states, and the flanking sequences of a CpG site. However, how the relevant enzymes are recruited to and recognize their target DNA is less clear.

However, these targets have been rarely exploited. There are several conventional methods for studying protein–DNA interactions. NMR, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy have been extensively used for understanding the protein–DNA interactions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay can estimate at best a Kd value to examine the binding affinity between a protein and a simple sequence. Isothermal titration calorimetry provides thermodynamic information about the protein–DNA interactions but consumes large quantities of protein and DNA. At high concentrations of testing samples, the evaluation of binding affinities is sophisticated. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence methods (10Visacka K. Hofr C. Willcox S. Necasova I.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation offers a high-throughput evaluation of protein–DNA interactions in vivo. However, it is not easy to reach the base-pair (bp) resolution for site-specific interactions. Sequencing methods have been recently developed to discover protein–DNA interactions with bp resolution but do not provide information on dynamics (12Whitaker J.W. Chen Z. Wang W.

Single-molecule techniques have been used to probe site-specific protein–DNA interactions by mechanically driving DNA-stand separation (14Koch S.J.

How do site-specific DNA-binding proteins find their targets?.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3040-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). For example, DNA unzipping experiments using magnetic tweezers demonstrate that interactions between a Tus protein and a DNA sequence of Ter establish a sustained lock at a replication fork with bp resolution (16Berghuis B.A. Dulin D.

A single-molecule counting approach based on a hairpin unzipping assay with magnetic tweezers was recently used to measure the dissociation dynamics of H-NS protein from a single DNA-binding site (17Gulvady R.

A mechanical profiling strategy based on magnetic tweezers and optical tweezers was recently developed to precisely and accurately examine the interactions between a DNA with multiplexed recognition sites and its ligands (18Manosas M. Camunas-Soler J. Croquette V. Ritort F. Single molecule high-throughput footprinting of small and large DNA ligands.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 304Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that single-molecule magnetic tweezers are an excellent platform for studying interactions between proteins of epigenetic enzymes and multiplexed DNA binding sites. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach that allows multiplexed profiling of protein–DNA complexes using magnetic tweezers. To detect protein–DNA interactions, we designed a DNA hairpin containing multiple binding sites of a target protein. When a DNA hairpin is unzipping, strand separation pauses at the positions bound by a protein. We can thus measure site-specific binding probabilities and dissociation time directly. Because the TET1 CXXC domain binds to CpG with C being nonmethylated, methylated, or hydroxymethylated (19Xu Y. Wu F. Tan L. Kong L. Xiong L. Deng J. Barbera A.J. Zheng L. Zhang H. Huang S. Min J. Nicholson T. Chen T. Xu G. Shi Y. et al.Genome-wide regulation of 5hmC, 5mC, and gene expression by Tet1 hydroxylase in mouse embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cel. 2011; 42: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), we take the CXXC domain of TET1 protein as an example showing how TET1 CXXC binds multiple CpG motifs with various flanking nucleotides or different methylation patterns in an AT-rich DNA sequence. We can determine probabilities and dissociation time of CXXC-interacting events on DNA at nanometer resolution. With the DNA containing multiplexed binding sites, we show that TET1 CXXC prefers G/C flanked CpG motif over C/G, A/T, or T/A flanked ones, which is previously unknown. CpG methylation strengthens TET1 CXXC recruitment but has little effect on dissociation time. In a proof of concept, we finally demonstrate that TET1 CXXC can distinguish five CpG clusters in a CGI with crowded binding motifs. Via multivalent interactions, CpG clusters extend the dissociation time of TET1 CXXC 10x longer than that at a single CpG site. Our results suggest the feasibility of single-molecule multiplexed profiling assays using magnetic tweezers for investigating the interactions between a protein and DNA with diverse binding motifs. We designed a CCGG hairpin to directly measure the interactions between a CpG-binding protein and its targeting DNA. The 194 bp stem of the hairpin construct has eight evenly distributed CCGG motifs with 18 bp spacers between two neighbors (Figs. 1A and S1). To specifically probe CpG-binding events on CCGG sites, we generate the interspersed spacers of 18 bp with A and T only using a random number function in MatLab and minimize the formation of secondary structures by mFold (See DNA sequences in Table S1) (20Zuker M. Mfold web server for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9511) Google Scholar, 21SantaLucia Jr., J. A unified view of polymer, dumbbell, and oligonucleotide DNA nearest-neighbor thermodynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1460-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). We commercially synthesized the TET1 CXXC of 46 amino acids (Table S2) and validated its activities using SPR (Fig. 1B and S2). The Kd for TET1 CXXC binding a CCGG DNA is 3.2 μM by SPR (Fig. 1B), similar to the Kd of 3.1 ± 0.4 μM in the literature (22Xu C. Liu K. Lei M. Yang A. Li Y. Hughes T.R. Min J. DNA sequence recognition of human CXXC domains and their structural Determinants.Structure. 2018; 26: 85-95.e83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using single-molecule magnetic tweezers, we unzip the hairpin stem above melting forces. CXXC-binding events on CCGG sites can block the strand separation of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from the upstream to the downstream. By measuring signals of interruptions with precise positions and durations upon breaking the complex of protein–DNA, we can site-specifically interpret the dynamics of CXXC dissociation from a CCGG motif in real time. We employed a force-manipulating protocol of three levels in single-molecule profiling assays (Experimental procedures). At a low force (Flow), e.g., 6 pN, the stem of the hairpin construct remains a dsDNA conformation (Fig. 1C, left, bottom cartoon). At a testing force (Ftest) above the critical melting force of the hairpin stem, e.g., 14.75 pN, the dsDNA of the stem cooperatively unzips to be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) without pauses (Fig. 1C, left, top cartoon). For the CCGG hairpin construct, the critical force of unzipping the stem is 11.9 pN ± 0.6 pN (Mean ± sd, n = 54, Fig. S1D). At a high force (Fhigh), e.g., 30 pN, the melted hairpin further extends, assuring the complete dissociation of bound proteins. We next decrease the force from Fhigh to Ftest, then to Flow, finishing a round of the protocol. At [CXXC] = 3 μM, we probe the binding events of CXXC on the CCGG hairpin stem using a force manipulating protocol with Flow = 6 pN, Ftest = 14.75 pN, and Fhigh = 30 pN (Fig. 1D). The pausing signals in a single trace at Ftest explicitly show eight states that are evenly spaced along with the DNA extension. The evenly distributed footprints of TET1 CXXC on the CCGG hairpin can serve as a ruler to convert the DNA extension from nanometer to bp. Using the fully opened extension of the CCGG hairpin as the reference position of zero at Ftest, we take 101 traces to build histograms along with the ssDNA extension (Fig. 2A). We divide the peak heights by the sampling rate (200 Hz in this case) to obtain the overall dwell time on a specific site. Averaging the 101 histograms with the same bins (Here bin size = 1.2 nm), we observe eight peaks that exactly matched with the eight CCGG sites in the hairpin stem as designed. We theoretically calculate the extension differences between adjacent CCGG sites using a worm-like chain model of Marko–Siggia (Experimental procedures, Equation 1) at a salt condition of 100 mM NaCl (23Guo S. Tang Q. Yao M. You H. Le S. Chen H. Yan J. Structural-elastic determination of the force-dependent transition rate of biomolecules.Chem. Sci. 2018; 9: 5871-5882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bosco A. Camunas-Soler J. Ritort F. Elastic properties and secondary structure formation of single-stranded DNA at monovalent and divalent salt conditions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 2064-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By comparing the theoretically calculated results with the peak-to-peak distances measured in the experiments of the CCGG DNA, we find that the hairpin fork preferentially pauses at the expected high-affinity CXXC-binding motifs of CCGG within a relative error of 4% at Ftest = 14.75 pN. We thus convert the axis of DNA extension from nanometer to bp using Equation 1. Binding probabilities of TET1 CXXC at the eight CCGG sites show two distinct modes, either high or low. To locate a protein-binding event at a CpG site, we check whether there is a pause (>10 ms) within ±11 bp around the CpG site at Ftest. We count only once for multiple visits at the same CCGG site. After dividing the number of pauses at a CCGG site by the total rounds of force manipulations, we obtain the site-specific binding probabilities (Fig. 2B, bin size = 2.46 bp, n = 240 traces). The binding events at the three upstream CCGGs show high probabilities of >10%, while the binding probabilities at the other five downstream CCGGs are as low as < 5% (Fig. 2B). Since the eight CCGGs are the same, which TET1 CXXC cannot distinguish, the two distinct modes may reflect the asymmetry of the fork-like DNA hairpin construct. During target search, a protein can bind DNA nonspecifically and laterally diffuse on DNA until it dissociates or lands on a target site (15Halford S.E. Marko J.F. How do site-specific DNA-binding proteins find their targets?.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3040-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 25Chandradoss S.D. Schirle N.T. Szczepaniak M. MacRae I.J. Joo C. A dynamic search process Underlies MicroRNA targeting.Cell. 2015; 162: 96-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The upstream CCGG sites are close to the fork handles of dsDNA, which may thus influence the TET1 CXXC-binding probability by nonspecific attraction. Analysis of pausing time reveals the site-specific dynamics of TET1 CXXC dissociation forced by DNA-strand separation. Considering the sampling rate of 200 Hz and its Nyquist frequency, we only measure pauses of >10 ms (Fig. 2C). We site-specifically build histograms of the pausing time for each CCGG, i.e., covering ±11 bp around a CpG site (See Experimental procedures for detailed data analysis). At the five downstream CCGG sites (CCGG4-8), we find that a single-exponential function fits the histograms well (Fitting equations in Experimental procedures), revealing an expected value of pausing time to be ∼14 ms at Ftest = 14.75 pN (Fig. 2D, bottom, and Table S3 for fitting goodness). In contrast, a double-exponential function fits the two histograms well at upstream CCGG2 and CCGG3, in which the short pausing time (tS) is at the same level as that at CCGG4-8, ∼14 ms. However, the long pausing time (tL) of ∼140 ms is 10x more prolonged than the short one (Fig. 2D, bottom, Ftest = 14.75 pN). At CCGG1, the first TET1 CXXC-binding site to be unzipped in our single-molecule mechanical manipulation, we only find the long pausing time of 126 ms, almost identical to tL = 140 ms at CCGG2-3 within error (Fig. 2D, bottom, Ftest = 14.75 pN). Because the downstream CCGG4-8 only shows the short pausing time of tS = ∼ 14 ms upon unzipping the dsDNA at the presence of TET1 CXXC (3 μM), we attribute this short-lived process to the events of disrupting a simple CXXC-CCGG complex by a testing force (14.75 pN). When unzipping the upstream dsDNA, a long pausing time of tL = ∼ 140 ms indicates a different event from that merely breaking a CXXC-CCGG complex. The asymmetry of the fork-like hairpin construct may explain the event with a long pausing time. TET1 CXXC may simultaneously interact with the CCGG sites in the upstream hairpin stem, and the nearby fork handles of dsDNA nonspecifically, resulting in a long pausing time for a complex dissociation event. To test whether protein-mediated nonspecific interactions between the upstream hairpin stem and fork handles cause the bimodal effect, i.e., two different modes of the protein dissociation under forces, we further examined this effect on the CCGG hairpin using a concentration of [TET1 CXXC] = 0.8 μM, which is ∼4x lower than the previous concentration of 3 μM. At CCGG2-3, overall dwell time and binding probability dramatically decrease compared with that at CCGG1 at the lowered concentration of TET1 CXXC and become comparable with that at CCGG4-8 (Fig. S3). The concentration responses support our assumption of a nonspecific binding mechanism, allowing us to adjust the ligand concentration to suppress the bimodal effect. We also find that the bimodal effect depends on the binding motif of TET1 CXXC. We mutate the CCGG1-3 of the CCGG hairpin to be CATG. As shown in Figure S4, the bimodal effect disappears in the CATG hairpin construct, supporting the hypothesis of nonspecific interactions between hairpin upstream stem and fork handles. In addition, we make a new construct of dense CCGG hairpin by adding three more CCGG sites at the upstream stem of the CCGG hairpin (Fig. S5). Such an arrangement creates two domains with either high or low density of CCGG sites in the hairpin stem. The bimodal effect remains at the upstream hairpin stem with a high density of CCGG sites, while the binding event is almost nondetectable at the downstream hairpin stem with a low density of CCGG sites. This observation could also be explained by the assumption of nonspecific interactions between upstream hairpin stem and fork handles. The positions of binding motifs play an essential role in the bimodal effect. The five CCGG sites in the downstream hairpin stem are beyond the influence of nonspecific interactions, like that in the CCGG hairpin under the same experimental conditions. Overall, the current set of data supports our assumption of nonspecific interactions regarding the bimodal effect. To develop a multiplexed profiling method for probing interactions between a CXXC protein and its different targeting sites, we designed an ATCG hairpin to examine how the immediate neighboring nucleotides of a CpG site affect TET1 CXXC’s binding activity. Although dinucleotides targeted by TET1 CXXC can be either CpG or CpH (H for any base other than G), TET1 CXXC has a preference of CpG over CpH (22Xu C. Liu K. Lei M. Yang A. Li Y. Hughes T.R. Min J. DNA sequence recognition of human CXXC domains and their structural Determinants.Structure. 2018; 26: 85-95.e83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Like the CCGG hairpin construct, the ATCG hairpin has eight CpG sites evenly distributed in the stem of 194 bp (Fig. 3A). Unlike the CCGG hairpin with only C/G flanked CpGs, the eight CpGs in the ATCG hairpin have the two 5′ and 3′ neighboring nucleotides to be C/G, G/C, A/T, and T/A, forming subsequent sites of CCGG, GCGC, ACGT, and TCGA, which are duplicated once in the downstream stem (Fig. 3A and Table S1). Considering the bimodal effect is position-sensitive along the hairpin stem in the CCGG construct, we have remained the CCGG1 and CCGG4 unchanged when preparing the ATCG hairpin. CCGG1 and CCGG4 thus serve as internal controls when performing a site-specific comparison between CCGG and ATCG hairpins. Spacers among the eight CpGs of the ATCG hairpin are AT only as that in the CCGG hairpin. Multiplexed profiling assays reveal that TET1 CXXC interrupts the unzipping of the ATCG hairpin by binding at the CpG sites. We performed the single-molecule profiling assays under the same experimental conditions as that for the CCGG hairpin. Without TET1 CXXC, we find no pauses (Fig. S6). With TET1 CXXC, we frequently observe pausing events at Ftest = 14.75 pN (Fig. 3B, left). The pausing positions at Ftest precisely show the footprints of TET1 CXXC on the sites of CpGs as designed above (Fig. 3B, right). TET1 CXXC’s pausing events show overall longer durations at C/G and G/C flanked CpGs than that at the A/T and T/A flanked ones in the ATCG hairpin. Along with the extension of the ATCG hairpin stem, we take averages of 211 histograms from individual traces at Ftest = 14.75 pN. The overall pausing durations at the upstream CpGs of the ATCG hairpin are more prolonged than that at the downstream CpGs (Fig. 3C), a similar phenomenon happening in the CCGG hairpin. Unlike the CCGG hairpin, we observe that accumulative durations are close to zero at A/T and T/A flanked CpGs in the ATCG hairpin (Fig. 3C). The site-specific pausing durations thus show that TET1 CXXC prefers to bind C/G and G/C flanked CpGs over A/T and T/A flanked ones, similar to that for the CXXC domain of CFP1 (4Lee J.H. Voo K.S. Skalnik D.G. Identification and characterization of the DNA binding domain of CpG-binding protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44669-44676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Binding probabilities also validate the preference of TET1 CXXC on CG flanked CpGs over the AT flanked ones. At either the upstream or the downstream stem, binding probabilities at CG flanked CpGs are higher than their neighboring AT flanked ones (Fig. 3D, bars and red curves, n = 445 traces). Binding probabilities of TET1 CXXC at the first two upstream CCGG and GCGC sites are higher than the rest sites. The binding probabilities at the upstream ACGT are higher than that at the downstream one (3% vs. 0%). Such a bimodal phenomenon is like that in the CCGG hairpin. Furthermore, we find that TET1 CXXC prefers the GCGC motif over the CCGG motif. At the downstream stem of the ATCG hairpin, we observe an outstanding binding probability at the GCGC site in contrast to its neighboring CCGG site (9% versus 3%). Because the experimental conditions are the same between the CCGG hairpin and the ATCG hairpin, we compare the binding probabilities along the eight CpGs in the two hairpins (Fig. 3D, red solid curves for the ATCG hairpin, black dotted curves for the CCGG hairpin). By comparison at the downstream GCGC site of the ATCG hairpin to its corresponding place in the CCGG hairpin, TET1 CXXC indeed shows a much higher preference to GCGC over CCGG (9% vs. 2%). At the CpG1-2 sites in the ATCG hairpin, TET1 CXXC-binding probabilities are identical to that in the CCGG hairpin, assuring a fair comparison. In addition, we find that TET1 CXXC binds CCGG more often than either ACGT or TCGA at both upstream and downstream stem (Fig. 3D). The binding probabilities at the two TCGA sites in the ATCG hairpin are close to zero. Such comparison again supports our finding that TET1 CXXC prefers CCGG over AT flanked CpGs, as shown above. Analysis of pausing time further supports the G/C preference of TET1 CXXC over C/G, A/T, or T/A flanking sequences. We measure the pausing times for each CpG site in the ATCG hairpin (Fig. 3E). All the available histograms can be fitted well with a single-exponential function (Fig. 3F). The expected pausing time from fittings at the upstream ACGT and the downstream CCGG sites is ∼14 ms, identical to the short pausing time in the CCGG hairpin, suggesting a simple dissociation event of TET1 CXXC from DNA. The expected pausing time at the upstream CCGG site of the ATCG hairpin is 159 ms, close to a long pausing time of 126 ms in the CCGG hairpin, indicating a complex dissociation event. Interestingly, the pausing times at either the upstream or the downstream GCGC sites are 50 ∼ 60 ms, about 4x longer than the dissociation time of TET1 CXXC from a CCGG site. The pausing time analysis thus shows that TET1 CXXC prefers G/C flanked CpGs over others with a rank of GCGC > CCGG > ACGT ∼ TCGA. To further explore TET1 CXXC’s targeting sequences, we methylated the CCGG hairpin at cytosines to examine how TET1 CXXC dynamically interacts with fully methylated or hemimethylated CpGs with various methylation patterns. SPR assays show that TET1 CXXC can bind to a CpG with C being nonmethylated or methylated (Fig. 1B and S2). In the eight CCGGs, we leave CCGG1-2 unmethylated and modified CCGG3 to mCmCGGGGmCmC, CCGG4 to mCCGGGGCmC, CCGG5 to CmCGGGGmCC, CCGG6 to mCmCGGGGCC, CCGG7 to mCCGGGGCC, and CCGG8 to CmCGGGGCC (Experimental procedures, Table S1). The methylated CCGG hairpin (mCCGG hairpin) thus contains six mCCGG sites with different methylation patterns and two CCGG sites as nonmethylation controls (Fig. 4A). Under the same experimental conditions as that for the CCGG hairpin, we run multiplexed profiling assays for TET1 CXXC on the mCCGG hairpin. The TET1 CXXC’s overall pausing times in the mCCGG hairpin show an entirely different pattern from that without TET1 CXXC (Fig. S7) and that in the CCGG hairpin (Fig. 2A), suggesting an effect due to the interactions between TET1 CXXC and methylated CCGGs (Fig. 4B, n =177). After calculating the binding probabilities of TET1 CXXC on the mCCGG hairpin, we find a bimodal effect, like that on the CCGG hairpin, but with almost doubled binding chances (Fig. 4C, bars and red curves for the mCCGG hairpin, black dotted curves for the CCGG hairpin). The binding probability at mCCGG7 (mCCGGGGCC) is an exception, showing the same likelihood as its related site in the CCGG hairpin. The hemimethylated mCCGG7 has just one methylated cytosine in two strands and beyond the CpG motif, giving a negligible effect on TET1 CXXC’s binding probability. Other than the methylated sites in the mCCGG hairpin, the binding chances at the nonmethylated CCGG1-2 also increase compared with their corresponding sites in the CCGG hairpin, indicating that enhanced recruitment of TET1 CXXC by t"

Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs or Navs) are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable tissues such as nerve, muscle, and other excitable cells (1Yu F.H.

Structurally, all VGSCs consist of an approximately 260-kDa α subunit and associated smaller β subunits. Nine distinct VGSC α subunit subtypes (Nav1.1–Nav1.9) have been cloned from mammals and showed tissue-specific localization and functional differences. Nav1.1 to Nav1.3 are the primary VGSCs in the central nervous system, whereas the Nav1.6 subtype is expressed both centrally and peripherally and Nav1.7 to Nav1.9 are located in the peripheral nervous system. Nav1.4 is present in skeletal muscle, whereas Nav1.5 is primarily in the heart (3Rahnama S. Deuis J.R. Cardoso F.C. Ramanujam V. Lewis R.J. Rash L.D. King G.F. Vetter I. Mobli M.

Mutations in VGSC proteins have been associated with several diseases in human; modifying VGSC function is a useful clinical intervention strategy in states such as pain (4Dib-Hajj S.D. Cummins T.R.

There has always been a desperate need for new analgesics with higher efficacy and reduced side effects (6Goldberg D.S. McGee S.J. Pain as a global public health priority.BMC public health. 2011; 11: 770Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). hNav1.7 plays a major role in governing cellular electrical excitability as it amplifies stimuli below the threshold for action potential generation (7Waxman S.G. Neurobiology: A channel sets the gain on pain.Nature. 2006; 444: 831-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In recent years, hNav1.7 has emerged as a validated pain target based on clinical genetic studies, as gain-of-function mutations in the SCN9A gene encoding hNav1.7 result in disorders of spontaneous pain and itch, including erythromelalgia, paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, and small fiber neuropathy (8Yang Y.

Moreover, global hNav1.7 knockout mice abolished sensitivity to thermal, mechanical, chemical, and inflammatory pain (13Gingras J. Smith S. Matson D.J. Johnson D. Nye K. Couture L. Feric E. Yin R.

Accordingly, unremitting efforts have been underway to produce analgesics with higher efficacy and better selectivity to address the large unmet medical need in chronic pain, as the existing clinical broad VGSC antagonists, such as lidocaine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, have been reported to be effective on alleviating pain in humans and animal models but may cause side effects because of the lack of Nav subtype specificity (14Mao J.

There exist challenges in developing subtype-selective VGSC inhibitors since VGSCs share the same domain structure with a high amino acid sequence similarity between different subtypes (16Mulcahy J.V. Pajouhesh H. Beckley J.T. Delwig A. Du Bois J. Hunter J.C. Challenges and opportunities for therapeutics targeting the voltage-gated sodium channel isoform NaV1.7.J. Med.

Spider venoms are a rich source of diverse bioactive peptides interacting with VGSCs and have attracted much attention as potential lead molecules for pharmaceutical development owing to their extremely high specificity and potency for targets (18Klint J.K.

These disulfide-rich venom peptides typically bind to the less conserved voltage-sensing domain, and hence they often achieve much better subtype selectivity than small molecules that bind to the pore region of the channel (18Klint J.K.

Moreover, the resolution of the spatial structure of hNav1.7 greatly promoted the development of drug design and modification based on structure–activity relationship (30Shen H. Liu D. Wu K. Lei J.

Here we report the engineering of a potent and selective Hainantoxin-III (HNTX-III) analogue of hNav1.7 with improved therapeutic properties in rodent models based on molecular docking. HNTX-III is a 33-residue neurotoxic polypeptide isolated from the venom of the spider Ornithoctonus hainana and is a member of the inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) superfamily. The ICK motif forms a rigid structure fold with unique physicochemical stability and proteolytic resistance and is an excellent scaffold for drug design (32Kolmar H. Biological diversity and therapeutic potential of natural and engineered cystine knot miniproteins.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009; 9: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HNTX-III acts selectively on tetrodotoxin-sensitive VGSCs, preferentially inhibiting neuronal subtypes hNav1.7 (IC50 211 ± 0.022 μM) over the muscle subtype Nav1.4 and cardiac subtype Nav1.5 (IC50 > 10 μM) (33Liu Z. Cai T. Zhu Q. Deng M. Li J. Zhou X. Zhang F. Li D. Li J. Liu Y. Hu W. Liang S. Structure and function of hainantoxin-III, a selective antagonist of neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels isolated from the Chinese bird spider Ornithoctonus hainana.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 20392-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on its potency and desirable Nav subtype selectivity, we investigated the structure–activity relationship of HNTX-III and Nav1.7 based on molecular docking and finally engineered the H4 analogue with improved potency and selectivity against off-target Nav subtypes, especially Nav1.4 and Nav1.5, as well as robust analgesic effects. Molecular surface analysis of HNTX-III showed that the basic residues (K3, K13, K27, K25, and H26) are mainly distributed on one side, forming a basic patch on the surface of HNTX-III, whereas most hydrophobic residues (F5, P18, Y20, A21, V31, Y32, and L33) are clustered on the other side, forming a hydrophobic patch (33Liu Z. Cai T. Zhu Q. Deng M. Li J. Zhou X. Zhang F. Li D. Li J. Liu Y. Hu W. Liang S. Structure and function of hainantoxin-III, a selective antagonist of neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels isolated from the Chinese bird spider Ornithoctonus hainana.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 20392-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To evaluate the structure–activity relationship of HNTX-III, a series of alanine substitution analogues were prepared at some amino acid residues in or near the surface of the amino acid sequence, excluding the cysteines and alanines. The inhibitory potencies of the Ala-scan analogues were determined using manual whole-cell patch-clamp recording platform on Hek293T cells transiently expressing hNav1.7. Figure 1 showed that the inhibitory potencies of basic amino acid residue mutants K3A, K25A, and K30A were reduced 8-, 22-, and 12-fold, respectively. The acidic amino acid residue mutant E15A had little effect on HNTX-III inhibitory activity. Neutral amino acid residue mutants F5A, S24A, V31A, and L33A could also reduce the inhibitory activity by 135-, 7-, 5-, and 4-fold, respectively. The CD spectrum of W28A was changed compared with the native peptide, indicating that W28A reduces activity by changing the overall structure of HNTX-III (Fig. S1). Taken together, the key residues of HNTX-III binding to hNav1.7 may be F5, N19, Y20, K25, and K30, and these mutations significantly decreased the activity; the residues K3 and S24 are also involved in the interaction, as well as V31 and L33 have moderate effect on the inhibitory activity; the residue W28 is necessary for the forming of the correct structure. These results indicated that the interaction between HNTX-III and hNav1.7 relied on not only electrostatic force but also hydrophobic interaction force. In our previous report, HNTX-III mainly binds to the DIIS3-S4 linker of hNav1.7 (33Liu Z. Cai T. Zhu Q. Deng M. Li J. Zhou X. Zhang F. Li D. Li J. Liu Y. Hu W. Liang S. Structure and function of hainantoxin-III, a selective antagonist of neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels isolated from the Chinese bird spider Ornithoctonus hainana.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 20392-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the key amino acid residues on hNav1.7 may play an important role in the activity or selectivity of HNTX-III binding with hNav1.7. To figure out the structure–activity relationship of hNav1.7 inhibition by HNTX-III, we designed a series of channel mutants to ascertain the key amino acid residues of hNav1.7 binding with HNTX-III. As shown in Figure 2A, when the amino acid residues on DIIS1-S2 of hNav1.7 was mutated to alanine, their affinity for HNTX-III did not change significantly, indicating that DIIS1-S2 does not participate in the interaction. However, mutations of E818, L822, V823, and F826 of DIIS3-S4 (Fig. 2B) and D890 and D891 of DIIS5-S6 on hNav1.7 caused more than 100-fold lower potency, whereas V1408, V1410, and D1411 of DIIIS5-S6 caused 3- to 5-fold lower potency (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that the above amino acid residues in DIIS3-S4, DIIS5-S6, and DIIIS5-S6 are key sites on hNav1.7 and are responsible for binding with HNTX-III. To better understand the binding interface between HNTX-III and hNav1.7 and assist molecular design, we established a molecular docking model according to the above results (Fig. 3A and B). In the docking model, the complex shows that negatively charged amino acid residues E818, D890, D891, and D1411 on hNav1.7 interacted with positively charged amino acid residues K3, K25, H26, and K30 on HNTX-III by electrostatic interaction; hydrophobic amino acid residues V822, L823, F826, V1408, and V1410 on hNav1.7 interacted with hydrophobic amino acid residues F5, W28, V31, Y32, and L33 on HNTX-III by hydrophobic interaction force; neutral amino acid residues N19, Y20, and S24 may form hydrogen bonds with some residues on hNav1.7. These results suggest that HNTX-III is an amphiphilic molecule interacting with hNav1.7 by electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interaction. According to the distribution of key amino acid residues on HNTX-III and hNav1.7, key residues and a number of additional residues around the edges of interaction surface based on molecular model were selected for substitution with a variety of residues of opposite charge or varied size and shape of aliphatic and aromatic residues to explore for potential increase in Nav potency. First, as shown in Table 1, the activity of mutations of the positively charged amino acid residues in HNTX-III was substantially reduced, indicating that they play an essential role in the interaction between HNTX-III and hNav1.7. For example, substitution of arginine for the native lysine (K25R, 22), aspartic acid (H26D, 23), leucine (H26L, 24), and lysine (H26K, 25), respectively, for the native histidine, glutamine for the native lysine (K27Q, 26), and arginine for the native lysine (K30R, 27) resulted in analogues that show a significant decrease in affinity for hNav1.7. Second, the activity of mutations of hydrophobic amino acid residues in HNTX-III also changed significantly. For example, the activity of proline at position 11 was slightly increased when it was mutated into lysine with positive charge (P11K, 10), whereas that of glutamate with negative charge (P11E, 11) was reduced by nearly fivefold; the activity of proline at position 18 mutated to leucine (P18L, 14) or tryptophan with benzene ring (P18W, 15) changed little, whereas that of lysine with positive charge (P18K, 13) increased; the activity of alanine at position 21 was increased when it was mutated to leucine (A21L, 19) or valine (A21V, 20), whereas the activity was decreased by about twofold when it was added directly after alanine (21V, 21). Last, amino acid residues near the interaction surface regulate the activity of the peptide to the channel to some extent. The activity of substitution of phenylalanine for the native glycine at position 1 (G1F, 2) or alanine (A0G1, 33), phenylalanine (F0G1, 35) added before the glycine showed little or slight decrease. However, the activity of substitution of lysine for the native glycine (G1K, 3) or lysine added before the glycine (K0G1, 34) was increased. After substitution of glycine to hydrophobic leucine (K0L1, 36) based on K0G1, the activity was improved compared with wildtype HNTX-III, but it decreased 1.7-fold compared with K0G1. These results indicate that the increase in the positive charge of the first residue and adjacent residues may enhance the activity of the peptide to the channel, while the hydrophobic interaction may destroy this binding force. In summary, K0G1 (34), P11K (10), P18K (13), N19L (17), A21L (19), A21V (20), and Y32W (29) mutants showed increased affinity of hNav1.7. According to the structure–activity relationship of HNTX-III interacting with hNav1.7, the results suggest that these residues may interact with corresponding sites on target that facilitate combination.Table 1Nav inhibitory activity of HNTX-III analogsCompoundSubstitutionhNav1.7 IC50 (μM)p Values1Wildtype0.211 ± 0.049-2Gly1Phe0.282 ± 0.056NS3Gly1Lys0.150 ± 0.024NS4Gly4delete>10<0.00015Gly4Gln0.815 ± 0.031<0.00016Phe5Trp1.227 ± 0.167<0.0017Phe5Leu2.041 ± 0.015<0.00018Gly6Trp0.167 ± 0.017NS9Thr10Glu1.657 ± 0.037<0.00110Pro11Lys0.127 ± 0.026<0.0111Pro11Glu0.927 ± 0.076<0.0112Gly12Glu1.891 ± 0.142<0.000113Pro18Lys0.050 ± 0.002<0.000114Pro18Leu0.255 ± 0.078NS15Pro18Trp0.225 ± 0.027NS16Asn19Lys0.431 ± 0.058<0.000117Asn19Leu0.092 ± 0.046<0.000118Tyr20Trp0.495 ± 0.039<0.000119Ala21Leu0.133 ± 0.010<0.0120Ala21Val0.099 ± 0.019<0.00012121Val0.512 ± 0.078<0.000122Lys25Arg0.647 ± 0.046<0.000123His26Asp7.58 ± 0.020<0.000124His26Leu5.781 ± 0.117<0.000125His26Lys>10<0.000126Lys27Gln0.568 ± 0.042<0.000127Lys30Arg>10<0.000128Tyr32Leu3.076 ± 0.054<0.000129Tyr32Trp0.075 ± 0.016<0.000130Leu33Glu>10<0.000131Leu33Lys>10<0.000132Leu33Phe0.215 ± 0.029NS33Ala0Gly10.486 ± 0.073<0.000134Lys0Gly10.086 ± 0.012<0.000135Phe0Gly10.475 ± 0.091<0.000136Lys0Leu10.145 ± 0.049NSData are shown mean ± SD, n = 3 to 5 cells, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc tests.NS, not significant.

Next, we performed incorporation of multiple substitutions into a single analogue based on molecular model in the hope that individual mutations would work synergistically. As shown in Figure 4, we constructed a series of double mutants mainly focused on P18K (13) in hopes of optimizing properties to hNav1.7. However, the activity of most double mutants did not increase as expected, but significantly decreased, especially P11E-G6W, P18K-T10K, P18K-K30F, and P18K-K30L. Although the efficacy of P18K-K0G1, P18K-K0L1, P18K-N19L, P18K-A21L, and P18K-Y32W on hNav1.7 was improved, those double mutants did not show significantly better affinity than the single substitutions. These results suggest that single mutations may contribute individually or collectively to some extent. According to the results of mutations, we designed a series of analogues based on the molecular docking, mainly containing K0, K18, L19, L21, or V21, in hope to synergize and accumulate the antagonistic effect on hNav1.7. Valine or leucine was added following A21 to strengthen the hydrophobic interaction. As shown in Table 2, the inhibitory activity of A21L-V (37) on hNav1.7 was significantly increased. Although the activity of analogues with two single mutations was not significantly increased, the activity was significantly increased by the combination of multiple mutations, especially analogues containing A21L-V. Also, K0G1-P18K-A21V (38), K0G1-A21L-V (39), and P18K-A21L-V (40) showed stronger activity than single mutation. Subsequently, we designed analogues with four single mutations, namely, K0G1-N19L-A21L-V (41) and K0G1-P18K-A21L-V (42), and found that both of them significantly enhanced hNav1.7 activity and that the activity of KOG1-P18K-A21L-V (42) had the largest increase (IC50 0.007 ± 0.001 μM). Then, we replaced K0G1 with K0K1 or K0L1, and A21L-V with A21V-V or A21L-L based on the amino acid sequence of KOG1-P18K-A21L-V in hope of obtaining better mutants and further obtained 43 to 48 analogues. The results showed that the inhibitory activity of 43 to 48 analogues on hNav1.7 was significantly lower than that of K0G1-P18K-A21L-V, indicating that the analogues containing A21L-V were more active than those containing A21V-V or A21L-L and that K0G1 and the inserted V were more suitable for enhancing the binding of peptides to hNav1.7. Finally, [K0G1-P18K-A21L-V] (named H4, 42) was found to be exceptionally potent and selective against hNav1.7 with an IC50 value of 0.007 ± 0.001 μM. In addition, H4 had similar folding properties to wildtype HNTX-III (Fig. S2) and scale-up has been achieved for future studies (Fig. S3).Table 2Summary of potent HNTX-III analoguesIDPeptideAmino acid sequencehNav1.7 IC50 (μM)1Native HNTX-IIIGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCPNY ACSSK HKWCK VYL0.211 ± 0.04937A21L-VGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCPNY LVCSSK HKWCK VYL0.047 ± 0.01638 (H0)K0G1-P18K-A21VKGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCKNY VCSSK HKWCK VYL0.040 ± 0.00639 (H1)K0G1-A21L-VKGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCPNY LVCSSK HKWCK VYL0.027 ± 0.00740 (H2)P18K-A21L-VGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCKNY LVCSSK HKWCK VYL0.013 ± 0.00241 (H3)K0G1-N19L-A21L-VKGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCPLY LVCSSK HKWCK VYL0.017 ± 0.00542 (H4)K0G1-P18K-A21L-VKGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCKNY LVCSSK HKWCK VYL0.007 ± 0.00143 (H5)K0G1-P18K-A21V-VKGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCKNY VVCSSK HKWCK VYL0.526 ± 0.04844 (H6)K0G1-P18K-A21L-LKGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCKNY LLCSSK HKWCK VYL0.087 ± 0.01745 (H7)K0G1-N19L-A21L-LKGCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCPLY LLCSSK HKWCK VYL0.121 ± 0.01046 (H8)K0K1-P18K-A21L-LKKCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCKLY LLCSSK HKWCK VYL0.112 ± 0.02747 (H9)K0K1-N19L-A21L-LKKCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCPLY LLCSSK HKWCK VYL0.048 ± 0.02248 (H10)K0L1-P18K-A21L-LKLCKGF GDSCT PGKNE CCKNY LLCSSK HKWCK VYL0.022 ± 0.003The amino acid residues in bold represent mutated residues in the amino acid sequence.

Although these stimuli have proved to be valid, they do not offer the level of realism that virtual humans have achieved. The objective of the present paper is the validation of a new set of dynamic virtual faces (DVFs) that mimic the six basic emotions plus the neutral expression. The faces are prepared to be observed with low and high dynamism, and from front and side views. For this purpose, 204 healthy participants, stratified by gender, age and education level, were recruited for assessing their facial affect recognition with the set of DVFs. The accuracy in responses was compared with the already validated Penn Emotion Recognition Test (ER-40). The results showed that DVFs were as valid as standardised natural faces for accurately recreating human-like facial expressions. The overall accuracy in the identification of emotions was higher for the DVFs (88.25%) than for the ER-40 faces (82.60%). The percentage of hits of each DVF emotion was high, especially for neutral expression and happiness emotion. No statistically significant differences were discovered regarding gender. Nor were significant differences found between younger adults and adults over 60 years. Moreover, there is an increase of hits for avatar faces showing a greater dynamism, as well as front views of the DVFs compared to their profile presentations. DVFs are as valid as standardised natural faces for accurately recreating human-like facial expressions of emotions."
https://openalex.org/W3122065186,"The epididymis is divided into three regions including the caput, corpus and cauda. Gene expression profiles in different regions indicate the different functions of epididymis which are crucial for sperm maturation. In this study, three one-year-old rams was used as the experimental animal. Transcriptome sequencing technology was used to sequence mRNA in the caput, corpus and cauda of the epididymis. Based on the spatiotemporal-specific expression pattern in the epididymis, the mRNA expression profiles of the three parts of the epididymis were analysed. Region-specifically expressed genes were analysed by GO and KEGG analyses to screen the key genes involved in sheep sperm maturation. We obtained 129, 54 and 99 specifically expressed genes in the caput, corpus and cauda, respectively. And twenty specific expressed genes related to sperm maturation were used to construct functional networks. The heatmap showed that 6 genes of LCN protein family were highly expressed in the head of epididymis of sheep. We infer that sperm maturation is gradual in the epididymis and that there are significant differences in epididymal gene expression patterns between different species. This provides a data resource for analysing the regulatory mechanism of epididymis genes related to sperm maturation in rams."
https://openalex.org/W3122649244,"Hyperglycaemia provides a suitable environment for infections and the mechanisms of glucose toxicity include the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which comprise non-enzymatically glycosylated proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid amino groups. Among AGE-associated phenotypes, glycolaldehyde-derived toxic AGE (AGE-3) is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Internalisation of endotoxin by various cell types contributes to innate immune responses against bacterial infection. An endotoxin derived from Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was reported to enhance its own uptake by RAW264.7 mouse macrophage-like cells, and an LPS binding protein, CD14, was involved in the LPS uptake. The LPS uptake induced the activation of RAW264.7 leading to the production of chemokine CXC motif ligand (CXCL) 10, which promotes T helper cell type 1 responses. Previously, we reported that AGE-3 was internalised into RAW264.7 cells through scavenger receptor-1 Class A. We hypothesized that AGEs uptake interrupt LPS uptake and impair innate immune response to LPS in RAW264.7 cells. In the present study, we found that AGE-3 attenuated CD14 expression, LPS uptake, and CXCL10 production, which was concentration-dependent, whereas LPS did not affect AGE uptake. AGEs were reported to stimulate the receptor for AGEs and Toll-like receptor 4, which cause inflammatory reactions. We found that inhibitors for RAGE, but not Toll-like receptor 4, restored the AGE-induced suppression of CD14 expression, LPS uptake, and CXCL10 production. These results indicate that the receptor for the AGE-initiated pathway partially impairs the immune response in diabetes patients."
https://openalex.org/W3122994679,"Lactobacillus helveticus carries many properties such as the ability to survive gastrointestinal transit, modulate the host immune response, accumulate biopeptides in milk, and adhere to the epithelial cells that could contribute to improving host health. In this study, the applicability as functional cultures of four L . helveticus strains isolated from Italian hard cheeses was investigated. A preliminary strain characterization showed that the ability to produce folate was generally low while antioxidant, proteolytic, peptidase, and β-galactosidase activities resulted high, although very variable, between strains. When stimulated moDCs were incubated in the presence of live cells, a dose-dependent release of both the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12p70 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, was shown for all the four strains. In the presence of cell-free culture supernatants (postbiotics), a dose-dependent, decrease of IL-12p70 and an increase of IL-10 was generally observed. The immunomodulatory effect took place also in Caciotta-like cheese made with strains SIM12 and SIS16 as bifunctional (i.e., immunomodulant and acidifying) starter cultures, thus confirming tests in culture media. Given that the growth of bacteria in the cheese was not necessary (they were killed by pasteurization), the results indicated that some constituents of non-viable bacteria had immunomodulatory properties. This study adds additional evidence for the positive role of L . helveticus on human health and suggests cheese as a suitable food for delivering candidate strains and modulating their anti-inflammatory properties."
https://openalex.org/W3121373283,"When plants are exposed to high-light conditions, the potentially harmful excess energy is dissipated as heat, a process called non-photochemical quenching. Efficient energy dissipation can also be induced in the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII) in vitro, by altering the structure and interactions of several bound cofactors. In both cases, the extent of quenching has been correlated with conformational changes (twisting) affecting two bound carotenoids, neoxanthin, and one of the two luteins (in site L1). This lutein is directly involved in the quenching process, whereas neoxanthin senses the overall change in state without playing a direct role in energy dissipation. Here we describe the isolation of an intermediate state of LHCII, using the detergent n-dodecyl-α-D-maltoside, which exhibits the twisting of neoxanthin (along with changes in chlorophyll–protein interactions), in the absence of the L1 change or corresponding quenching. We demonstrate that neoxanthin is actually a reporter of the LHCII environment—probably reflecting a large-scale conformational change in the protein—whereas the appearance of excitation energy quenching is concomitant with the configuration change of the L1 carotenoid only, reflecting changes on a smaller scale. This unquenched LHCII intermediate, described here for the first time, provides for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of quenching.

This unquenched LHCII intermediate, described here for the first time, provides for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of quenching. During the first steps of the photosynthetic process, solar photons are absorbed by specialized light-harvesting complexes (LHCs), and the resulting excitation energy is transferred to reaction center pigments, where it is converted into a chemical potential. In low-light conditions, most of the photons absorbed lead to a charge separation event at the reaction center (1Scholes G.D. Fleming G.R. Olaya-Castro A. van Grondelle R.

However, when the absorbed energy is in excess of that which can be used for energy transduction, the overaccumulation of excited states can result in damage to the photosynthetic membrane, in particular, via the production of reactive oxygen species. In high-light conditions, the antenna system of plants and algae reorganizes reversibly, creating energy traps that dissipate the excess excitation as heat (3Niyogi K.K. Truong T.B.

This regulatory mechanism is known as non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ). NPQ is a multi-component phenomenon whose fastest phase, qE (energy-dependent quenching), is triggered by the ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane, itself resulting from photosynthetic activity. qE induction and relaxation occurs in seconds, and it cannot involve de novo protein synthesis but rather corresponds to a reorganization of the existing photosynthetic membrane. Over the last two decades, a large number of studies have been performed to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying qE (6Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H.M. Kennis J.T.M.

LHCII, the major antenna complex in higher plants, occurs as a trimer of nearly identical monomers. Each monomer binds 14 chlorophyll molecules (8 Chl a and 6 Chl b), three tightly-bound carotenoids (two luteins and one 9-cis neoxanthin), and one weakly-bound violaxanthin carotenoid (16Liu Z.

Changes in the interaction state of several chlorophylls with the protein host were observed, as well as in the configuration of the neoxanthin molecule (27Ruban A.V. Horton P. Robert B.

The amplitude of the neoxanthin change is strictly correlated with the extent of quenching in LHCII as well as in intact chloroplasts and leaves (6Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H.M.

In this work, we have studied the vibrational properties of the different pigments bound to LHCII in the presence of α-DM or β-DM. We show that the Raman signals of Chls a and b and neoxanthin that were previously associated with LHCII quenching are already present in LHCII purified in the presence of α-DM—even though this preparation is unquenched—while aggregation-induced quenching affects the L1 carotenoid-binding site alone. The molecular structure of Chl a, Chl b, lutein and neoxanthin pigments and those of the detergents used for the purification of LHCII are dispayed in Figure 1. As already reported (31Akhtar P.

In the blue region, the Soret absorption transition of Chl is perturbed—in α-DM, an increase in intensity is seen at 432 nm, concomitant with a loss at 438 nm. The carotenoid contributions appear to lose intensity at 480 and 472 nm and gain intensity at 457 nm. In the Chl Qy region, a new band is present at 660 nm in LHCII isolated in α-DM, while the intensity of the transitions at 676 and 672 nm is reduced. All these changes are more easily observed in the difference spectrum (Fig. 2B). None of these changes in absorption induces any observable differences in fluorescence properties (e.g., Fig. 2C). Resonance Raman spectroscopy has seen extensive application to the assessment of pigment structure and interactions in photosynthetic proteins (35Robert B. Resonance Raman spectroscopy.Photosynth.

Liu Z. Broess K. van Oort B. van Amerongen H. Wang C. Horton P. Robert B. Chang W. Ruban A.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy of the photosystem II light-harvesting complex of green plants: A comparison of trimeric and aggregated states.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Raman spectra of chlorophyll molecules are particularly rich, containing a number of bands that are sensitive to the chlorophyll conformation and to its interactions with the immediate environment. Upon aggregation-induced quenching in LHCII, two bound Chl a molecules lose a hydrogen bond to their conjugated keto carbonyl group on position C131, while one or two Chls b gain H-bonds to their conjugated formyl group at position C7 (observed for excitations at 413.1 and 441.6 nm, respectively [27Ruban A.V. Horton P. Robert B. Resonance Raman spectroscopy of the photosystem II light-harvesting complex of green plants: A comparison of trimeric and aggregated states.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar]). Chlorophyll resonance Raman spectra of the two LHCII preparations at 77 K are presented in Figure 3. Comparing α-DM-LHCII relative to β-DM-LHCII for the Chl a excitation at 413.1 nm (Fig. 3A), there is a clear increase in contributions on the high-frequency side of the envelope of bands in the 1660 to 1700 cm−1 region, which corresponds to stretching modes of Chl a keto groups conjugated with the macrocycle. This increase around 1690 cm−1 is accompanied by a corresponding decrease at lower frequency at ∼1670 cm−1 (shown by black arrow heads in Fig. 3A). As discussed elsewhere (34Llansola-Portoles M.J. Li F. Xu P. Streckaite S. Ilioaia C. Yang C. Gall A. Pascal A.A. Croce R. Robert B. Tuning antenna function through hydrogen bonds to chlorophyll a.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 2019; 1861: 148078Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), this reflects the loss of an H-bond to probably two LHCII-bound Chl a molecules, at the level of their conjugated keto carbonyl group. Excitation at 441.6 nm yields spectra in which Chl b vibrational modes dominate. The high-frequency region thus corresponds to stretching modes of both conjugated carbonyl groups of Chl b – C7-formyl and C131-keto, in the 1620 to 1660 and 1660 to 1700 cm−1 ranges, respectively. When the two preparations are compared at this wavelength (Fig. 3B), an intense contribution is observed for α-DM-LHCII at 1637 cm−1 that is not present in β-DM-LHCII, accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of the contribution at 1666 cm−1 (shown by black arrow heads in Fig. 3B). This indicates that the formyl carbonyl of at least one Chl b, which is free from interactions in β-DM-LHCII, becomes strongly H-bonded in α-DM-LHCII. It is particularly interesting to note that the changes in Chl a and b interactions observed for α-DM-LHCII are strikingly similar to those seen upon aggregation-induced quenching in LHCII (27Ruban A.V.

Carotenoid resonance Raman spectra are mainly composed of four groups of bands, termed ν1–ν4. The ν1 band above 1500 cm−1 arises from stretching vibrations of C=C double bonds, and its frequency depends on the length of the π-electron conjugated chain and on the molecular configuration of the carotenoid (38Saito S.

However, the regulatory pathway centered on NTS in lung cancer remains unclear. Here we identified the NTS-specific enhancer in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The AF4/FMR2 (AFF) family protein AFF1 occupies the NTS enhancer and inhibits NTS transcription. Clustering analysis of lung adenocarcinoma gene expression data demonstrated that NTS expression is highly positively correlated with the expression of the oncogenic factor CPS1. Detailed analyses demonstrated that the IL6 pathway antagonizes NTS in regulating CPS1. Thus, our analyses revealed a novel NTS-centered regulatory axis, consisting of AFF1 as a master transcription suppressor and IL6 as an antagonist in lung adenocarcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W3121933778,"Uptake of modified lipoproteins by macrophages turns them into foam cells, the hallmark of the atherosclerotic plaque. The initiation and progression of atherosclerosis have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. It is known that aggregated low-density lipoproteins (agLDL) induce massive cholesterol accumulation in macrophages in contrast with native LDL (nLDL) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL). In the present study we aimed to assess the effect of agLDL on the mitochondria and ER function in macrophage-derived foam cells, in an attempt to estimate the potential of these cells, known constituents of early fatty streaks, to generate atheroma in the absence of oxidative stress. Results show that agLDL induce excessive accumulation of free (FC) and esterified cholesterol in THP-1 macrophages and determine mitochondrial dysfunction expressed as decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and diminished intracellular ATP levels, without generating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. AgLDL did not stimulate intracellular ROS (superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide) production, and did not trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) or apoptosis. In contrast to agLDL, oxLDL did not modify FC levels, but stimulated the accumulation of 7-ketocholesterol in the cells, generating oxidative stress which is associated with an increased mitochondrial dysfunction, ERS and apoptosis. Taken together, our results reveal that agLDL induce foam cells formation and mild mitochondrial dysfunction in human macrophages without triggering oxidative or ERS. These data could partially explain the early formation of fatty streaks in the intima of human arteries by interaction of monocyte-derived macrophages with non-oxidatively aggregated LDL generating foam cells, which cannot evolve into atherosclerotic plaques in the absence of the oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3122771241,"Potyviruses encode a large polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic processing, producing 10 mature proteins: P1, HC-Pro, P3, 6K1, CI, 6K2, VPg, NIa-Pro, NIb-RdRp, and CP. While P1/HC-Pro and HC-Pro/P3 junctions are cleaved by P1 and HC-Pro, respectively, the remaining seven are processed by NIa-Pro. In this study, we analyzed 135 polyprotein sequences from approved potyvirus species and deduced the consensus amino acid residues at five positions (from −4 to +1, where a protease cleaves between −1 and +1) in each of nine cleavage sites. In general, the newly deduced consensus sequences were consistent with the previous ones. However, seven NIa-Pro cleavage sites showed distinct amino acid preferences despite being processed by the same protease. At position −2, histidine was the dominant amino acid residue in most cleavage sites (57.8–60.7% of analyzed sequences), except for the NIa-Pro/NIb-RdRp junction where it was absent. At position −1, glutamine was highly dominant in most sites (88.2–97.8%), except for the VPg/NIa-Pro junction where glutamic acid was found in all the analyzed proteins (100%). At position +1, serine was the most abundant residue (47.4–86.7%) in five out of seven sites, while alanine (52.6%) and glycine (82.2%) were the most abundant in the P3/6K1 and 6K2/VPg junctions, respectively. These findings suggest that each NIa-Pro cleavage site is finely tuned for differential characteristics of proteolytic reactions. The newly deduced consensus sequences may be useful resources for the development of models and methods to accurately predict potyvirus polyprotein processing sites."

Mutual gliding motility protein C (MglC), a paralog of GTPase-activating protein Mutual gliding motility protein B (MglB), is a member of the polarity module involved in regulating motility. However, little is known about the structure and function of MglC. Here, we determined ∼1.85 Å resolution crystal structure of MglC using Selenomethionine Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. The crystal structure revealed that, despite sharing <9% sequence identity, both MglB and MglC adopt a Regulatory Light Chain 7 family fold. However, MglC has a distinct ∼30° to 40° shift in the orientation of the functionally important α2 helix compared with other structural homologs. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and size-exclusion chromatography, we show that MglC binds MglB in 2:4 stoichiometry with submicromolar range dissociation constant. Using small-angle X-ray scattering and molecular docking studies, we show that the MglBC complex consists of a MglC homodimer sandwiched between two homodimers of MglB.

Myxococcus xanthus is an anaerobic, rod-shaped, gram-negative δ-proteobacteria. It is widely studied for its complex social behavior, life cycle, and motility (1Shi W. Kohler T. Zusman D.R.

Extracellular biology of Myxococcus xanthus.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 34: 89-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It exhibits two types of motilities, S “social” motility and A “adventurous” motility (3Hodgkin J. Kaiser D.

In the S-motility, a large group of bacterial cells coordinate to move together. The S-motility uses the type IVa pilus filaments that are formed at the leading pole and moves the cells forward (5Wu S.S. Kaiser D. Genetic and functional evidence that type IV pili are required for social gliding motility in Myxococcus xanthus.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas in the A-motility, single cells move at the periphery of bacterial colonies to explore the surrounding environment (6Kaiser D.

The “frizzy” signal transduction proteins, part of the Frz system, are known to start and regulate the polarity reversal process (24Sun M. Wartel M. Cascales E. Shaevitz J.W. Mignot T.

The FrzE phosphorylates its response regulators FrzX and FrzZ known to interact and modulate MglB and MglA, respectively (26Inclan Y.F. Vlamakis H.C. Zusman D.R. FrzZ, a dual CheY-like response regulator, functions as an output for the Frz chemosensory pathway of Myxococcus xanthus.Mol.

Phosphorylation-dependent localization of the response regulator FrzZ signals cell reversals in Myxococcus xanthus.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 88: 740-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The exact sequence of events for the reversal process is not known. However, the MglA proteins first dissociate from the leading pole because of FrzZ signal and travel toward the lagging pole (8Herrou J. Mignot T. Dynamic polarity control by a tunable protein oscillator in bacteria.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2020; 62: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). MglA and MglB colocalize at the leading pole for about 30 s, and during this time, the GTPase activity of MglB is not functional because of inactivation by FrzX (17Guzzo M. Murray S.M. Martineau E. Lhospice S. Baronian G. My L. Zhang Y. Espinosa L. Vincentelli R. Bratton B.P. Shaevitz J.W. Molle V. Howard M. Mignot T. A gated relaxation oscillator mediated by FrzX controls morphogenetic movements in Myxococcus xanthus.Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Then the MglB proteins detach from the lagging pole, move to the opposite pole, and RomRX loads more MglA–GTP molecules to the new leading pole. The RomRX complex then slowly dissociates from the new leading pole and moves to the opposite pole, marking the formation of the new leading and lagging poles (8Herrou J. Mignot T. Dynamic polarity control by a tunable protein oscillator in bacteria.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2020; 62: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The time taken by RomRX to detach from one pole and get accumulated at the opposite pole in a sufficient amount marks the refractory period as no reversal activity of MglA and MglB can occur at this time (28Keilberg D. Sogaard-Andersen L. Regulation of bacterial cell polarity by small GTPases.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Currently, the mechanism of the detachment of MglB and RomRX proteins from pole and their attachment to opposite poles is not clear. Recently, a new protein, Mutual gliding motility protein C (MglC), has been identified as a member of the Regulatory Light Chain 7 (RLC7) family protein, probably formed by gene duplication and divergence, that over time has lost its ability to bind MglA (29McLoon A.L. Wuichet K. Hasler M. Keilberg D. Szadkowski D. Sogaard-Andersen L. MglC, a paralog of Myxococcus xanthus GTPase-activating protein MglB, plays a divergent role in motility regulation.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). MglC is required for polarity reversal and interacts with MglB and RomR. MglC is recruited asymmetrically at the lagging poles by RomR as in the absence of RomR, the MglC protein is diffused in the cytoplasm (29McLoon A.L. Wuichet K. Hasler M. Keilberg D. Szadkowski D. Sogaard-Andersen L. MglC, a paralog of Myxococcus xanthus GTPase-activating protein MglB, plays a divergent role in motility regulation.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). MglC is localized in a bipolar manner in the presence of RomR, but the presence of MglB mediates localization of MglC mainly at the lagging pole. Using bacterial two-hybrid system, MglC has been shown to interact with MglB and RomR (29McLoon A.L. Wuichet K. Hasler M. Keilberg D. Szadkowski D. Sogaard-Andersen L. MglC, a paralog of Myxococcus xanthus GTPase-activating protein MglB, plays a divergent role in motility regulation.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Upon deletion of MglC, M. xanthus cells remain motile but the rate of cellar reversals for motility apparatus reduces significantly, suggesting MglC is probably involved in regulating the rate of cellular reversals for MglB and RomR (29McLoon A.L. Wuichet K. Hasler M. Keilberg D. Szadkowski D. Sogaard-Andersen L. MglC, a paralog of Myxococcus xanthus GTPase-activating protein MglB, plays a divergent role in motility regulation.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To understand the role of MglC in regulating pole reversals and functional divergence from its paralog MglB, it is important to structurally characterize MglC and its interactions with the binding partners. Here, we determined the crystal structure of MglC (selenomethionine derivative) and MglC (native) at 1.85 Å and 2.19 Å resolution, which revealed structural similarity with MglB despite sharing poor sequence conservation. Comparative structural analysis also revealed distinct structural features compared with other RLC7 family proteins. We further established and characterized MglB and MglC protein–protein interactions using analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Based on data from site-directed mutagenesis, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), SEC, ITC, and protein–protein docking studies, we propose a structural model of MglBC protein–protein complex. Based on the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and predicted secondary structure assignments, MglC has been predicted to be a member of RLC7 family proteins (30Levine T.P. Daniels R.D. Wong L.H. Gatta A.T. Gerondopoulos A. Barr F.A. Discovery of new Longin and Roadblock domains that form platforms for small GTPases in ragulator and TRAPP-II.Small GTPases. 2013; 4: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because MglB is also a member of this family sharing ∼8% sequence identity and ∼17% similarity with MglC, we performed MSA to identify the conserved regions among these proteins. Although both these proteins share poor sequence identity, as expected, we observed only few key highly conserved residues. The representative MSA of MglC and MglB with sequences sharing >30% identity is shown in Fig. S1. All the annotated MglC homologs are shorter than those of MglB because of the absence of the extra N- and C-terminal residues (Fig. S1, A and B). These extra N-terminal residues of MglB adopt a β-strand conformation, whereas the C-terminal residues adopt an α-helical conformation and linker residue connecting α3-α4. These extra N- and C-terminal residues are functionally important in mediating MglA–MglB interactions (20Baranwal J. Lhospice S. Kanade M. Chakraborty S. Gade P.R. Harne S. Herrou J. Mignot T. Gayathri P. Allosteric regulation of a prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase contributes to cell polarity oscillations in bacterial motility.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000459Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). MSA also highlights various other key differences and similarities among MglC and MglB proteins (Fig. S1). As shown previously by McLoon et al., (29McLoon A.L. Wuichet K. Hasler M. Keilberg D. Szadkowski D. Sogaard-Andersen L. MglC, a paralog of Myxococcus xanthus GTPase-activating protein MglB, plays a divergent role in motility regulation.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) highly conserved G27 in MglC (structurally equivalent residue G38 in MglB) is crucial for the formation of turn connecting β1-β2 strands. We also noticed that G103 in MglC (structurally equivalent residue G112 in MglB) present in α3 is also highly conserved. The residue at 106 position in MglC (115 in MglB) is also occupied by positively charged amino acid in both MglC and MglB. In MglC, we also observed another conserved G67, which is absent in MglB. In MglC, the residue number 62 is occupied by negatively charged residues, whereas in MglB, this equivalent position 79 is occupied by positively charged residue. It has been previously shown that F25, D26, and I28 (FDI sequence motif) of MglC might be involved in the MglBC interactions (29McLoon A.L. Wuichet K. Hasler M. Keilberg D. Szadkowski D. Sogaard-Andersen L. MglC, a paralog of Myxococcus xanthus GTPase-activating protein MglB, plays a divergent role in motility regulation.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our MSA analysis suggests that highly conserved I28 residue of MglC is absent in MglB. The MglC is characterized by the presence of negatively charged [D/E]26 but is not conserved in MglB. However, as also observed by McLoon et al., (29McLoon A.L. Wuichet K. Hasler M. Keilberg D. Szadkowski D. Sogaard-Andersen L. MglC, a paralog of Myxococcus xanthus GTPase-activating protein MglB, plays a divergent role in motility regulation.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) there is the presence of conserved D36 in MglB near this position. We successfully crystallized and determined the crystal structure of MglC. MglC crystallized in P6522 space group (a = 96.69 Å, b = 96.69 Å, c = 58.28 Å, α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 120°) with one molecule in an asymmetric unit. There was no good structural template to use as a model for solving structure using molecular replacement. The closest homologue available at RCSB PDB shared ∼8% sequence identity. So, we solved the crystal structure using Selenomethionine Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (Se-SAD) experimental phasing technique at 1.85 Å resolution. The final refined model contains all 120 residues of MglC. The crystal structure revealed the typical RLC7 fold (α1β1β2α2β3α3) (Fig. 2A). We also solved the crystal structure of MglC in the native form at 2.192 Å resolution (a = 96.91 Å, b = 96.91 Å, c = 58.05 Å, α = 90°, β = 90° and γ = 90°) by molecular replacement using the structure obtained by Se-SAD as a template. The native and Se-SAD structures superpose well with r.m.s.d. of 0.144. MglC monomer contains five antiparallel β-strands sandwiched between three α-helices. MglC also contains a 310 helix just after the α2 helix. The two β hairpins connect β1-β2 and β4-β5 strands. Other secondary structural elements include five β-bulges and eight β turns. We also observed an electron density for a metal ion in the crystal structure having a square pyramidal geometry. We placed Na+ which is coordinated by two water molecules and main chain oxygen atoms of L64, T66, and V69. The structural analysis further suggests that, like other members of RLC7 family, MglC also forms homodimers and two protomers are related by crystallographic two-fold symmetry (Fig. 2B, Fig. S2A). PDBePISA (31Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (5953) Google Scholar) analysis suggests that MglC monomer has a total surface area of 6277 Å2 and the dimer interface buries 792 Å2 area (∼12.61%). The total surface area of MglC dimer is 10,970 Å2 with the 1580 Å2 (∼14.4%) being buried. The ΔGint predicted using PDBePISA (31Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (5953) Google Scholar) for the dimer association is −9.1 kcal/mol and ΔGdiss is 3.9 kcal/mol, suggesting that MglC may form a stable dimer. MglC dimerization is mediated by β sheet extension, that is, β3 from each monomer comes together to form an antiparallel sheet consisting of ten β strands (five strands from each monomer) sandwiched by four helices on one side and two helices on the other side. The dimer is stabilized by six main chain hydrogen bonds and four hydrogen bonds involving side chains between the interacting β strands at the binding interface. Besides these, several nonbonded interactions are also observed between the interacting β strands and α2 helices at the binding interface (Fig. 2C, Fig. S2B). The residues involved in the formation of main chain H-bonds at the dimeric interface, that is, S70, E71, S73, V74, and N75 are highly conserved in MglC. Residue N75 and E71 also form hydrogen bonds with E71 and N75 of the other monomer (Fig. 2D, Fig. S2B). The α2 helices form hydrophobic contacts between chain A and chain B via the residues L53-V69′, A60-A60′, V69-L53′, V69-V74′, V72-V74′, V74-V69′, V74-V72′, and F102-F102′. The F102-F102 is also involved in aromatic–aromatic interactions. Besides this, F102 and R106 form a cation-п interaction (Fig. 2C, Fig. S2B). To further study the oligomeric status of MglC in the solution, we performed analytical SEC experiments. MglC eluted predominantly at ∼17 ml corresponding to a molecular weight of ∼35 kDa close to the expected size of the dimer (∼32 kDa). This further supports the crystallographic observations, hence confirming that MglC predominantly exists as a dimer in the solution (Fig. S2A). To obtain information about the probable binding sites of MglC with MglB and RomR, we preformed cleft analysis of MglC using PDBsum (32Laskowski R.A. Hutchinson E.G. Michie A.D. Wallace A.C. Jones M.L. Thornton J.M. PDBsum: A web-based database of summaries and analyses of all PDB structures.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 488-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed the presence of 3 prominent clefts in MglC (Fig. 3A). Cleft 1 is the largest among all and is formed at the interface of the dimer with a volume of ∼3946 Å3. This cleft 1 includes highly conserved positively charged residues imparting a net positive charge to the region as revealed by the ConSurf analysis and electrostatic potential map, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C) (33Ashkenazy H.

The clefts 2 and 2′ (the prime is used for identical cleft on another protomer in the dimer) include the ‘FDI’ region shown to be involved in binding MglB and have a volume of ∼580 Å3. The clefts 3 and 3′ have ∼600 Å3 volume and are lined by variable residues. So, these clefts may be the probable sites for mediating interactions with the binding partners. ConSurf (33Ashkenazy H.

Methods A cross-sectional study design was employed, and data were collected using a self-reported questionnaire from 462 youth (211 boys and 251 girls) aged 15–24 years in senior grades of three public high schools (two rural and one urban) in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland). A hierarchical binary regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between PYSRC and premarital sexual debut, and to test whether parenting style moderates this relationship. Results The mean age of participants was 18.9 (±1.85) years, and a slight majority were females (54.3%). About 35.9% of participants reported having had sex (i.e., premarital sexual debut). After adjusting for age, gender, living arrangement, school location, and peer sexual activity, neither PYSRC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.03) nor parenting style (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.04) significantly predicted premarital sexual debut in the sample. Likewise, parenting style did not significantly moderate the relationship between PYSRC and premarital sexual debut (AOR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.02). Conclusion Contrary to propositions of the contextual model of parenting style, in this study, parenting style (authoritativeness) did not moderate the studied relationship, indicating the need for more studies to test the applicability of the contextual model of parenting style in African settings."
https://openalex.org/W3123259452,"The paper shows the effect of the probe on the performance of a transonic axial speed compressor. The unobstructed flow case with the experimental data was validated and used as a guide for all subsequent study cases. The aerodynamic performance for different probe parameters were calculated numerically using ANSYS-CFX. This covered the results on compressor output from changing probe axial positions, the radial immersion depths, the size of the probe, and the total number of probes. The findings were evaluated in relation to the total pressure ratio, performance, margin of deflation and stability. The velocity part distributions further showed that the probe block and raises the flow Mach value, which is the explanation why the compressor rotor’s total pressure ratio is lost. In fact, the parameters of the sample will significantly influence the calculation outcomes and affect the standard margin. The range of stability was also affected, which changes the performance trend from the choke to the stall. Consequently, the collection of correct probe parameters with fewer impact on compressor output is addressed."
https://openalex.org/W3123596090,"This research aims to determine the attitudes of the farmers whose lands are affected by liquefaction in Jono Oge, Central Sulawesi Province, The Republic of Indonesia. The methods used here were integrated survey and experimental design. The survey approach was intended to figure out the attitudes of the farmers viewpoints: (1) to return to their activities on the agricultural lands affected by liquefaction; (2) to consume their own agricultural products; and (3) of their willingness to be relocated. The experimental design approach was used to figure out the effectiveness of organic material input combined with the SP-36 fertilizer. The obtained results were analyzed using the Likert Scale, diversity test, correlational test, and regression test. The results showed that the farmers persevered farming on the lands affected by liquefaction (Index = 88.82%) yet refused to consume their own agricultural products with the reason that corpses remained buried beneath their lands (Index = 27.82%); and they also refused to be relocated (Index = 28.80%). The continued production suitability of the affected land was also investigated. Terrain profile identification results in Jono Oge showed the disaster impact was dominantly landslide as it still showed a clear characteristic horizon between the topsoil and the sub soil. This contrasts to terrain at Petobo, Central Sulawesi Province, where the high mix of the topsoil with the sub soil of agricultural land affected by liquefaction, prevented demarcation of the horizon. The land treatment of organic material and SP-36 fertilizer showed that the combined dose (M) of 40-kg ha -1 with P 300-kg ha -1 had the highest effect by changing the field pH from 5.7 to 6.41, increased the availability of P and increased the corncob indicator plant weight. Based on these indications, the lands affected by the liquefaction in Jono Oge can still be used as agricultural lands through restoration, from both social and technical aspects."
https://openalex.org/W3124611754,"Aim At arrival in new home country, internationally adopted children often have intestinal parasites. International adoptees also exhibit more behavioral problems than their biological peers. We examined whether intestinal parasite infections in international adoptees on arrival in Finland are associated with their later behavioral and emotional problems. Methods Data for this study were sourced from the Finnish Adoption Study (FinAdo) based on parental questionnaires for all internationally adopted children under 18 years ( n = 1450) who arrived in Finland from 1985 to 2007. A total of 1293 families provided sufficient information on the adoptee’s background, parasitic status on arrival, and behavioral symptoms at the median time of 5 years after arrival (mean age = 7.8 years). Behavioral and emotional disorders were evaluated with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Statistical analyses were conducted using linear regression. Results Of the 1293 families, parents of 206 adoptive children reported intestinal parasites in their adopted children on arrival. Parasite-infected children had subsequently higher CBCL problem scores than the children without parasites ( p &lt; 0.001). The association between intestinal parasites and later behavioral problems was stronger than that between intestinal parasites and any other factors measured in this study, except disability. Limitations The control group was naturally provided by the adopted children without parasite infections, but we could not compare the adopted children to non-adopted children without a defined parasite infection. We were unable to specify the effects associated with a specific parasite type. It was not possible either to include multiple environmental factors that could have been associated with behavioral problems in the models, which indicated only modest explanatory values. Conclusions In this study, intestinal parasite infections in early childhood may be associated with children’s later psychological wellbeing, even in children who move to a country with a low prevalence of parasites. Our findings may support further developments pertaining to the gut-brain theory."

Patients who had received PCI during hospitalization for AMI (between 2013 and 2016) and were initially treated with aspirin and ticagrelor and without adverse events after 3 months of treatment were retrospectively evaluated. In total, 1,901 and 8,199 patients were identified as “de-escalated DAPT” (switched to aspirin and clopidogrel) and “unchanged DAPT” (continued on aspirin and ticagrelor) cohorts, respectively. With a mean follow-up of 8 months, the incidence rates (per 100 person-year) of death, AMI readmission and MACE were 2.89, 3.68, and 4.91 in the de-escalated cohort and 2.42, 3.28, and 4.72 in the unchanged cohort, respectively, based on an inverse probability of treatment weighted approach that adjusting for baseline characteristics of the patients. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed the two groups had no significant differences in the hazard risk of death, AMI admission, and MACE. Additionally, there was no observed difference in the risk of bleeding, including major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. The real-world data revealed that de-escalation of P2Y 12 inhibitor in DAPT was not associated with a higher risk of death or AMI readmission in Taiwanese patients with AMI undergoing successful PCI."
https://openalex.org/W3125371634,"Speleothems (dominated by cave-hosted carbonate deposits) are valuable archives of paleoclimate conditions. As such, they are potential targets of clumped isotope analyses that may yield quantified data about past temperature variations. Clumped isotope analyses of stalagmites, however, seldom provide useful temperature values due to various isotope fractionation processes. This study focuses on the determination of the microbially induced vital effect, i.e., the isotope fractionation processes related to bacterial carbonate production. A cave site with biologically mediated amorphous calcium carbonate precitation was selected as a natural laboratory. Calcite deposits were farmed under a UV lamp to prevent bacterial activity, as well as under control conditions. Microbiological analyses and morphological investigations using scanning electron microscopy showed that the UV lamp treatment effectively reduced the number of bacterial cells, and that bacterial carbonate production strongly influenced the carbonate’s morphology. Stable oxygen isotope analyses of calcite and drip waters, as well as clumped isotope measurements revealed that, although most of the studied carbonates formed close to oxygen isotope equilibrium, clumped isotope Δ 47 values varied widely from equilibrium to strongly fractionated data. Site-specific kinetic fractionations played a dominant role in the distribution of Δ 47 values, whereas bacterial carbonate production did not result in a detectable clumped isotope effect."

Hence, the determination of risk factors of UGI helps to reduce the economic and social burden of this cancer in communities. In Iran, the consumption of opium because of its neighborhood with Afghanistan are considerable. In this study, we examine the causal effect of opium use on the time to UGI cancer death. Based on the Golestan Cohort Study (GCS) in northeastern of Iran, about 50000 adults were enrolled to the study for four years (2004–2008) and followed annually until July 2018. We used “parametric g-formula” to study the causal effect of opium use on the time to death due to UGI. In this study, the information of 49946 individuals due to missingness were analyzed. So the median of follow-up time was 144 months and the prevalence of opium use was 17% (about 8489 persons). During the follow-up period, 593 (1.2%) death from upper gastrointestinal cancer were reported. The study showed that the effect of opium use on the time to UGI death was statistically significant (adjusted risk-ratio based on parametric g-formula = 1.31, 95% CI: [1.04, 1.65]). Additionally, the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) in UGI cancer deaths of opium use was estimated 5.3% (95% CI: [0.6%, 11.3%]). Our results showed a causal effect of opium use on the intensity of upper gastrointestinal cancer death."
https://openalex.org/W3125175215,"Background Tuberculosis is one of the major infectious diseases and is both complex and serious. It is spread from person to person through the air, causing a public health burden, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This study aims to assess the knowledge on tuberculosis and the utilization of Directly-Observed Therapy, Short Course (DOTS) service from the public DOTS centers in Lalitpur district of Nepal. Method A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 23 DOTS centers in Lalitpur district. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was applied to assess the knowledge on tuberculosis and utilization of DOTS among people living with tuberculosis. Results Among 390 respondents, 80% of patients had knowledge of tuberculosis and 76.92% utilized the DOTS service from the DOTS center. People of higher age (50–60 years) [aOR; 13.96, 95% CI 4.79,40.68], [aOR; 10.84,95% CI 4.09,28.76] had significantly more knowledge on TB and utilization of the DOTS service compared to the younger group. Additionally, those who completed twelfth class [aOR; 2.25, 95% CI 0.46,11.07] and [aOR;2.47, 95% CI 0.51,11.28] had greater knowledge of Tuberculosis and utilization of DOTS compared to those who had not completed twelfth class. Likewise, compared to urban residents, respondents in rural areas (aOR; 0.51, 95% CI 0.27,0.97) had less knowledge of tuberculosis, (aOR; 0.57, 95% CI 0.32,1) and less chance of utilization of the DOTS service from the DOTS center. Conclusion Approximately one quarter of patients did not have adequate knowledge of tuberculosis and were not utilizing the DOTS service, particularly in younger age groups, people living in a combined family, with no education, poor economic position, and from rural areas. Findings of this study revealed that some specific programs are needed for enhancing the knowledge and utilization of DOTS, particularly for those patients whose economic situations extended from low to mid range."

In the recent inclusion in the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, the assessment of hip-hop performance is undertaken by a panel of judges. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of different visualisation tools utilised in the assessment of the hip-hop dance movements. Ten dancers performed basic rhythmic hip-hop movements which were captured using a motion capture system and video camera. Humanoid and stick figure animations of the dancers’ movements were created from the motion capture data. Ten judges then assessed 20 dance trials through observation using three different visualisation tools on a computer display, each of which provided different representations of a given hip-hop performance: (1) the actual video of the dancers; (2) an anonymous stick figure animation; (3) an anonymous humanoid animation. Judges were not informed that they were repeating an assessment of the performances across the three visualisation tools. The humanoid animation demonstrated the highest inter-class correlation coefficients among the three methods. Despite the stick figure animation demonstrating moderate to high reliability, both the humanoid animation and the video demonstrated very high reliability in the intra-class correlation coefficient. It is recommended that further research is undertaken exploring the use of humanoid animation as a formative assessment tool in the evaluation of hip-hop dance and the evolution of hip-hop into a respected artistic athletic discipline."
https://openalex.org/W3112585088,"Aim Hypertension is the leading cause of heart failure (HF) in sub-Saharan Africa. Preventive public health approach to reduce the scourge of HF must seek to understand the risk factors of HF in at-risk populations. The aim of this study was to characterize the risk factors of HF among patients with hypertension attending a cardiology clinic. Methods and results One hundred and one (101) case-control age- and sex-matched pairs were recruited. The study population were adults with a clinical diagnosis of hypertensive HF (cases) and individuals with systemic hypertension without HF. They were interviewed and evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors. Associations between variables were tested with chi square test, Fisher’s exact test and independent sample t test as appropriate. Logistic regression modelling was used to determine the independent risk factors of hypertensive HF (HHF) in the study population while ‘punafcc’ package in stata12 was used to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of the risk factors. Suboptimal medication adherence was the strongest adverse risk factor of HHF (medium adherence aOR: 3.53, 95%CI: 1.35–9.25; low adherence aOR: 9.44, 95%CI: 3.41–26.10) with a PAF of 67% followed by dipstick proteinuria (aOR: 4.22, 95%CI: 1.62–11.02; PAF: 34%) and alcohol consumption/day per 10grams (aOR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.02–1.49; PAF: 22%). The protective risk factors of HHF were use of calcium channel blockers (aOR 0.25, 95%CI: 0.11–0.59; PAF: 59%), then daily fruits and vegetable consumption (aOR 0.41, 95%CI: 0.17–1.01; PAF: 46%), and eGFR (aOR 0.98, 95%CI: 0.96–0.99; PAF: 5.3%). Conclusions The risk factors of HHF are amenable to lifestyle and dietary changes. Public health interventions and preventive cardiovascular care to improve medication adherence, promote fruit and vegetable consumption and reduce alcohol consumption among patients with hypertension are recommended. Renoprotection has utility in the prevention of HF among hypertensives."
https://openalex.org/W3121711563,"Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability from cancer in China. To provide a scientific basis for tobacco control strategies and measures, this study investigated cancer deaths attributed to smoking from 2005 to 2017 and predicted mortality trends from 2018 to 2020 in Qingdao. We used time series analysis to evaluate the number of deaths attributed to smoking among residents over 35 years old in Qingdao and predicted mortality trends. The number of cancer deaths attributed to smoking in Qingdao from 2005 to 2016 was between 170 and 407, showing an upward trend and a certain periodicity. The best model is the ARIMA (2,1,0)×(3,1,0) 12 , with the lowest BIC (6.640) and the highest stationary R 2 (0.500). The predicted cancer deaths curve attributed to smoking in 2017 is consistent with the actual curve, with an average relative error of 5.74%. Applying this model to further predict the number of cancer deaths attributed to smoking in Qingdao from January 2018 to December 2020, the predicted results were 5,249, 5,423 and 6,048, respectively. The findings emphasized the need to further strengthen tobacco control measures to reduce the burden of disease caused by tobacco."
https://openalex.org/W3121873781,"Self-medication using over-the-counter (OTC) drugs is an option for the autonomous treatment of several health problems. However, the use of OTC drugs to treat psychiatric conditions remains controversial. To clarify opinions regarding the use of OTC drugs to treat psychiatric problems, we conducted an anonymous online survey of 3000 people in Japan. Participants were stratified into three groups according to their history of mental health problems. Few participants had engaged in self-medication using OTC drugs for psychiatric symptoms, with the exception of insomnia. Participants who had used OTC drugs reported feeling less satisfied with their experience compared with those who had consulted a specialist. Participants who had used sleeping pills were likely to hold relatively positive opinions regarding the use of OTC psychiatric drugs. In conclusion, the need for self-medication of psychiatric symptoms appears to be limited. Education and further research may be necessary to promote self-medication for proper treatment of psychiatric conditions in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W3122988669,"In this study, we developed a simulation code powered by lattice dose-response functions (hereinafter SIBYL), which helps in the quick and accurate estimation of external gamma-ray doses emitted from a radioactive plume and contaminated ground. SIBYL couples with atmospheric dispersion models and calculates gamma-ray dose distributions inside a target area based on a map of activity concentrations using pre-evaluated dose-response functions. Moreover, SIBYL considers radiation shielding due to obstructions such as buildings. To examine the reliability of SIBYL, we investigated five typical cases for steady-state and unsteady-state plume dispersions by coupling the Gaussian plume model and the local-scale high-resolution atmospheric dispersion model using large eddy simulation. The results of this coupled model were compared with those of full Monte Carlo simulations using the particle and heavy-ion transport code system (PHITS). The dose-distribution maps calculated using SIBYL differed by up to 10% from those calculated using PHITS in most target locations. The exceptions were locations far from the radioactive contamination and those behind the intricate structures of building arrays. In addition, SIBYL’s computation time using 96 parallel processing elements was several tens of minutes even for the most computationally expensive tasks of this study. The computation using SIBYL was approximately 100 times faster than the same calculation using PHITS under the same computation conditions. From the results of the case studies, we concluded that SIBYL can estimate a ground-level dose-distribution map within one hour with accuracy that is comparable to that of the full Monte Carlo simulation."
https://openalex.org/W3124240976,"Objective Although progress has been made in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, China still remains one of the high-burden TB countries. One important reason that has not received sufficient scholarly attention is that Chinese individuals tend to underestimate the threat of TB. This contributed to the high rate of delay in seeking TB treatment and noncompliance with doctors’ regimen. Hence, this research examined how TB knowledge affected Chinese parents’ risk perceptions and their efficacy appraisal in TB treatment, and how their risk perception and efficacy appraisal affected their intentions to seek timely TB treatment for their children and adhere to doctors’ regimen. Methods We conducted an online cross-sectional survey with 1129 parents of children attending kindergarten, primary school, and middle school in Shajing, a region with high TB incidence in China. Perceived severity of TB threat to self and to others, perceived susceptibility, response efficacy, and self-efficacy were measured, in addition to TB knowledge and intentions to seek timely TB treatment and adhere to doctors’ regimens. Results Ordinal least squares regression demonstrated that TB knowledge was positively associated with perceived severity of TB threat to self, perceived severity of TB threat to others, perceived susceptibility, response efficacy, and self-efficacy, but it did not affect their medical decisions. In addition, binary logistic regression revealed that response efficacy and self-efficacy predicted both intentions positively, and perceived severity of TB threat to self only enhanced Chinese individuals’ intention to follow doctors’ regimens. Conclusion Health education aimed at knowledge improvement may be effective in changing one’s perceptions of the given health threat but may not be effective to change their behavior. Thus, practitioners need to focus on changing Chinese parents’ perceptions of TB rather than simply improving their knowledge. Specifically, it is necessary to lower their efficacy in self-management and enhance their perceived infectiousness of TB."
https://openalex.org/W3124738099,"The objective of this study is to prepare cationized gelatin-molecular beacon (MB) complexes for the visualization of intracellular messenger RNA (mRNA). The complexes were prepared from cationized gelatins with different extents of cationization and different mixing ratios of MB to cationized gelatin. The apparent size of complexes was almost similar, while the zeta potential was different among the complexes. Irrespective of the preparation conditions, the complexes had a sequence specificity against the target oligonucleotides in hybridization. The cytotoxicity and the amount of complexes internalized into cells increased with an increase in the cationization extent and the concentration of cationized gelatin. After the incubation with complexes prepared from cationized gelatin with the highest extent of cationization and at mixing ratios of 10 and 20 pmole MB/μg cationized gelatin, a high fluorescent intensity was detected. On the other hand, the complex prepared with the mixing ratio at 20 pmole/μg did not show any cytotoxicity. The complex was the most effective to visualize the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA endogenously present. In addition, even for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA exogenously transfected, the complex permitted to effectively detect it as well. It is concluded that both the endogenous and exogenous mRNA can be visualized in living cells by use of cationized gelatin-MB complexes designed."
https://openalex.org/W3122692937,"Finding suitable habitats for specific functions such as breeding provides examples of key biotic adaptation. The adult marine midge Pontomyia oceana requires an extremely specific habitat, i.e., hard substrates above water in shallow water, to deposit fertilized eggs. We investigated how these sea surface-skimming insects accomplished this with a stringent time constraint of 1–2 h of the adult life span in the evenings. We observed that in artificial containers, midges aggregated at bright spots only if the light was not in the direction of the sea. This behavior could potentially attract midges toward the shore and away from the open water. Experiments were performed in the intertidal zone in southern Taiwan to test three hypotheses explaining such behavior: gradients of temperature and CO 2 , and soundscape. No differences were observed in moving directions or aggregation of midges under artificial temperature and CO 2 gradients. However, midges preferred sounds at 75 Hz compared with other frequencies (all ≤300 Hz) as observed in a field experiment involving floating traps with loudspeakers. Moreover, when background noise was experimentally masked using white noise of all frequencies, midges were significantly more likely to aggregate at bright spots in the direction of the sea than in the absence of white noise. These results establish that sound is used by midges to navigate in dark seas and move toward the shore where exposed hard substrates are in abundance. Marine mammals present well-known cases of sound pollution at sea; here the finding in the insignificant marine midge is just the harbinger of the potential effects noise at shore may have to affect critical reproductive stages of marine organisms."

https://openalex.org/W3125062276,"The complex physics and biology underlying intracranial hemodynamics are yet to be fully revealed. A fully resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS) study has been performed to identify the intrinsic flow dynamics in an idealized carotid bifurcation model. To shed the light on the significance of considering blood shear-thinning properties, the power-law model is compared to the commonly used Newtonian viscosity hypothesis. We scrutinize the kinetic energy cascade (KEC) rates in the Fourier domain and the vortex structure of both fluid models and examine the impact of the power-law viscosity model. The flow intrinsically contains coherent structures which has frequencies corresponding to the boundary frequency, which could be associated with the regulation of endothelial cells. From the proposed comparative study, it is found that KEC rates and the vortex-identification are significantly influenced by the shear-thinning blood properties. Conclusively, from the obtained results, it is found that neglecting the non-Newtonian behavior could lead to underestimation of the hemodynamic parameters at low Reynolds number and overestimation of the hemodynamic parameters by increasing the Reynolds number. In addition, we provide physical insight and discussion onto the hemodynamics associated with endothelial dysfunction which plays significant role in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms."
https://openalex.org/W3125765594,"Objectives In breast diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) protocol standardization, it is recently shown that no breast tumor tissue selection (BTTS) method outperformed the others. The purpose of this study is to analyze the feasibility of three fixed-size breast tumor tissue selection (BTTS) methods based on the reproducibility, accuracy and time-measurement in comparison to the largest oval and manual delineation in breast diffusion weighted imaging data. Methods This study is performed with a consecutive dataset of 116 breast lesions (98 malignant) of at least 1.0 cm, scanned in accordance with the EUSOBI breast DWI working group recommendations. Reproducibility of the maximum size manual (BTTS1) and of the maximal size round/oval (BTTS2) methods were compared with three smaller fixed-size circular BTTS methods in the middle of each lesion (BTTS3, 0.12 cm 3 volume) and at lowest apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (BTTS4, 0.12 cm 3 ; BTTS5, 0.24 cm 3 ). Mean ADC values, intraclass-correlation-coefficients (ICCs), area under the curve (AUC) and measurement times (sec) of the 5 BTTS methods were assessed by two observers. Results Excellent inter- and intra-observer agreement was found for any BTTS (with ICC 0.88–0.92 and 0.92–0.94, respectively). Significant difference in ADCmean between any pair of BTTS methods was shown (p = &lt;0.001–0.009), except for BTTS2 vs. BTTS3 for observer 1 (p = 0.10). AUCs were comparable between BTTS methods, with highest AUC for BTTS2 (0.89–0.91) and lowest for BTTS4 (0.76–0.85). However, as an indicator of clinical feasibility, BTTS2-3 showed shortest measurement times (10–15 sec) compared to BTTS1, 4–5 (19–39 sec). Conclusion The performance of fixed-size BTTS methods, as a potential tool for clinical decision making, shows equal AUC but shorter ADC measurement time compared to manual or oval whole lesion measurements. The advantage of a fixed size BTTS method is the excellent reproducibility. A central fixed breast tumor tissue volume of 0.12 cm 3 is the most feasible method for use in clinical practice."
