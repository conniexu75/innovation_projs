https://openalex.org/W3010781739,"Rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) has a variable clinical course for which predicting prognosis is difficult. However, the role of blood biomarkers in RA-ILD is ill-defined. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels in RA-ILD patients. The medical records of 84 patients with RA-ILD were retrospectively reviewed. Plasma KL-6 levels were measured by Nanopia KL-6 assay (SEKISUI MEDICAL, Tokyo), using latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. The median follow-up period was 61 months. Mean age was 61.4 years, 45.2% were men, 44.0% were ever-smokers, and 35.7% showed a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on high-resolution computed tomography. The median KL-6 level at baseline was 741.2 U/mL (interquartile range, 439.7-1308.9 U/mL). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a high KL-6 level (≥ 640 U/mL) was an independently associated with a UIP pattern (odds ratio [OR], 5.173; P = 0.005) with old age (OR, 1.104, P = 0.005). On multivariate Cox analysis, a high KL-6 level (≥ 685 U/mL) was an independent prognostic factor for the mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.984; P = 0.016) with a older age (HR, 1.061; P = 0.030), male sex (HR, 3.610; P = 0.001), lower forced vital capacity (HR, 0.957; P = 0.002), and a UIP pattern (HR, 4.034; P = 0.002). Our results suggest that high KL-6 levels might be useful as a biomarker for the presence of a UIP pattern and prognosis in patients with RA-ILD."
https://openalex.org/W3011005101,"Innovations supporting a shift towards more sustainable food systems can be developed within the dominant food system regime or in alternative niches. No study has compared the challenges faced in each context. This paper, based on an analysis of 25 cases of European innovations that support crop diversification, explores the extent to which barriers to crop diversification can be related to the proximity of innovation settings with dominant food systems. Drawing on a qualitative analysis of interviews and participatory brainstorming, we highlight 46 different barriers to crop diversification across the cases, at different levels: production; downstream operations from farm to retailing, marketing and consumers; and contracts and coordination between actors. To characterise the diversity of innovation strategies at food system level, we introduce the concept of “food system innovation settings” combining: (i) the type of innovative practice promoted at farm level; (ii) the type of value chain supporting that innovation; and (iii) the type of agriculture involved (organic or conventional). Through a multiple correspondence analysis, we show different patterns of barriers to crop diversification according to three ideal-types of food system innovation settings: (i) “Changing from within”, where longer rotations are fostered on conventional farms involved in commodity supply chains; (ii) “Building outside”, where crop diversification integrates intercropping on organic farms involved in local supply chains; and (iii) “Playing horizontal”, where actors promote alternative crop diversification strategies—either strictly speaking horizontal at spatial level (e.g. strip cropping) or socially horizontal (arrangement between farmers)–without directly challenging the vertical organisation of dominant value chains. We recommend designing targeted research and policy actions according to the food systems they seek to develop. We then discuss further development of our approach to analyse barriers faced in intermediate and hybrid food system configurations."
https://openalex.org/W3011072089,"In medicine, a misdiagnosis or the absence of specialists can affect the patient’s health, leading to unnecessary tests and increasing the costs of healthcare. In particular, the lack of specialists in otolaryngology in third world countries forces patients to seek medical attention from general practitioners, whom might not have enough training and experience for making correct diagnosis in this field. To tackle this problem, we propose and test a computer-aided system based on machine learning models and image processing techniques for otoscopic examination, as a support for a more accurate diagnosis of ear conditions at primary care before specialist referral; in particular, for myringosclerosis, earwax plug, and chronic otitis media. To characterize the tympanic membrane and ear canal for each condition, we implemented three different feature extraction methods: color coherence vector, discrete cosine transform, and filter bank. We also considered three machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and decision trees to develop the ear condition predictor model. To conduct the research, our database included 160 images as testing set and 720 images as training and validation sets of 180 patients. We repeatedly trained the learning models using the training dataset and evaluated them using the validation dataset to thus obtain the best feature extraction method and learning model that produce the highest validation accuracy. The results showed that the SVM and k-NN presented the best performance followed by decision trees model. Finally, we performed a classification stage –i.e., diagnosis– using testing data, where the SVM model achieved an average classification accuracy of 93.9%, average sensitivity of 87.8%, average specificity of 95.9%, and average positive predictive value of 87.7%. The results show that this system might be used for general practitioners as a reference to make better decisions in the ear pathologies diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3011559030,"Caesarean section is considered a relatively preferable and safe method of delivery as compared to normal delivery. Since the last decade, its prevalence has increased in both developed and developing countries. In the context of developing countries viz., South Asia (the highest populated region) and South-East Asia (the third-highest populated region), where a significant proportion of home deliveries were reported,however, the preference for, caesarean delivery and its associated factors are not well understood.To study the caesarean delivery in the South and South-East Asian countries and to determine the factors associated with the preference for caesarean delivery.Demographic and Health Survey Data on from ever-married women of nine developing countries of South and South-East Asia viz., Vietnam, India, Maldives, Timor-Leste, Nepal, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Cambodia have been considered. Both bivariate and binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the propensity of a woman undergoing for caesarean delivery and to assess the influence of maternal socioeconomic characteristics towards the preference for caesarean delivery.Obtained results have shown an inclination of caesarean delivery among urban than rural women and are quite conspicuous, but is found to be underestimated mostly among rural women. Caesarean delivery in general is mostly predisposed among women whose baby sizes are either very large or smaller than average, have a higher level of education and place of delivery is private medical institutions. The logistic regression also revealed the influence of maternal socioeconomic characteristics towards the preference for caesarean delivery. Based on nine South and South-East Asian countries an overall C-section prevalence of 13%, but based on institutional births its increase to 19%. The forest plot demonstrated that a significant inclination of C-section among urban than rural regions. In Meta-Analysis, very high and significant heterogeneity among countries is observed, but confirms that in terms of prevalence of C-section all of the countries follow independent pattern.Study of seven urban and four rural regions of nine South and South- East Asian countries showed, a significant inclination towards the caesarean delivery above the more recent outdated WHO recommended an optimal range of 10-15%and are associated maternal socioeconomic characteristics. In order to control unwanted caesarean delivery, the government needs to develop better healthcare infrastructure and along with more antenatal care related schemes to reduce the risks associated with increased caesarean delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3010925426,"Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are increasingly employed for tissue regeneration, largely mediated through paracrine actions. Currently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by MSCs are major mediators of these paracrine effects. We evaluated whether rat-bone-marrow-MSC-derived EVs (rBMSCs-EVs) can ameliorate tendon injury in an in vivo rat model. Pro-collagen1A2 and MMP14 protein are expressed in rBMSC-EVs, and are important factors for extracellular-matrix tendon-remodeling. In addition, we found pro-collagen1A2 in rBMSC-EV surface-membranes by dot blot. In vitro on cells isolated from Achilles tendons, utilized as rBMSC -EVs recipient cells, EVs at both low and high doses induce migration of tenocytes; at higher concentration, they induce proliferation and increase expression of Collagen type I in tenocytes. Pretreatment with trypsin abrogate the effect of EVs on cell proliferation and migration, and the expression of collagen I. When either low- or high-dose rBMSCs-EVs were injected into a rat-Achilles tendon injury-model (immediately after damage), at 30 days, rBMSC-EVs were found to have accelerated the remodeling stage of tendon repair in a dose-dependent manner. At histology and histomorphology evaluation, high doses of rBMSCs-EVs produced better restoration of tendon architecture, with optimal tendon-fiber alignment and lower vascularity. Higher EV-concentrations demonstrated greater expression of collagen type I and lower expression of collagen type III. BMSC-EVs hold promise as a novel cell-free modality for the management of tendon injuries."
https://openalex.org/W3012282992,"In Brazil, Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are reported as being transmitted exclusively by Aedes aegypti in urban settings. This study established the vectors and viruses involved in an arbovirus outbreak that occurred in 2019 in a rural area of Espírito Santo state, Brazil. Mosquitoes collected were morphologically identified, sorted in samples, and submitted to molecular analysis for arboviruses detection. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed for the viral sequence obtained. All 393 mosquitoes were identified as Aedes albopictus. DENV-1 genotype V was present in one sample and another sample was positive for ZIKV. The DENV-1 clustered with viruses that have circulated in previous years in large urban centers of different regions in Brazil. This is the first report of A. albopictus infected by DENV and ZIKV during an outbreak in a rural area in Brazil, indicating its involvement in arboviral transmission. The DENV-1 strain found in the A. albopictus was not new in Brazil, being involved previously in epidemics related to A. aegypti, suggesting the potential to A. albopictus in transmitting viruses already circulating in the Brazilian population. This finding also indicates the possibility of these viruses to disperse across urban and rural settings, imposing additional challenges for the control of the diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3011757169,"Introduction Significant number of women present with advanced-stage breast cancer in Ghana. These women usually depend on family caregivers for their multi-dimensional needs. Yet, there are gaps in research about what motivates family caregivers to assume the caring role and their experiences with caregiving within the Ghanaian context. Aim To explore and describe the caregiving motivations and experiences among family caregivers of patients living with advanced breast cancer. Methods In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 family caregivers who were providing unpaid care for women living with advanced breast cancer. Colaizzi’s thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Results Family relationship normally prescribed the caregiving role among family caregivers. Due to the lack of home-based palliative services in Ghana, findings suggest that family caregivers are the main managers of advanced breast cancer-related symptoms in the home. These findings are discussed under three major themes: (i) motivation for assuming the caregiving role; (ii) meeting self-care and psychosocial needs of the patient; and (iii) symptom management and monitoring. Conclusion Socio-cultural values influence the role of family caregivers in Ghana. This presents opportunities for health professionals and relevant stakeholders to develop a culturally-appropriate intervention to support informal caregivers in their home-based care for women living with advanced breast cancer in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3011655858,"Attention operates through top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) mechanisms. Recently, it has been shown that slow (alpha) frequencies index facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms of TD attention and faster (gamma) frequencies signal BU attentional capture. Ageing is characterized by increased behavioral distractibility, resulting from either a reduced efficiency of TD attention or an enhanced triggering of BU attention. However, only few studies have investigated the impact of ageing upon the oscillatory activities involved in TD and BU attention. MEG data were collected from 14 elderly and 14 matched young healthy human participants while performing the Competitive Attention Task. Elderly participants displayed (1) exacerbated behavioral distractibility, (2) altered TD suppressive mechanisms, indexed by a reduced alpha synchronization in task-irrelevant regions, (3) less prominent alpha peak-frequency differences between cortical regions, (4) a similar BU system activation indexed by gamma activity, and (5) a reduced activation of lateral prefrontal inhibitory control regions. These results show that the ageing-related increased distractibility is of TD origin."
https://openalex.org/W3012295192,"In sweet cherry trees, flowering is commercially important because the flowers, after fertilization, will generate the fruits. In P. avium, the flowering induction and flower organogensis are the first developmental steps towards flower formation and they occur within specialized organs known as floral buds during the summer, nine months before blooming. During this period the number of floral buds per tree and the bud fruitfulness (number of flowers per bud) are stablished affecting the potential yield of orchards and the plant architecture. The floral bud development is sensitive to any type of stress and the hotter and drier summers will interfere with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular and hormonal mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis, very little is known about floral induction in sweet cherry. To explore the molecular mechanism of floral bud differentiation, high-throughput RNA sequencing was used to detect differences in the gene expression of P. avium floral buds at five differentiation stages. We found 2,982 differentially expressed genes during floral bud development. We identified genes associated with floral initiation or floral organ identity that appear to be useful biomarkers of floral development and several transcription factor families (ERF, MYB, bHLH, MADS-box and NAC gene family) with novel potential roles during floral transition in this species. We analyzed in deep the MADS-box gene family and we shed light about their key role during floral bud and organs development in P. avium. Furthermore, the hormonal-related signatures in the gene regulatory networks and the dynamic changes of absicic acid, zeatin and indolacetic acid contents in buds suggest an important role for these hormones during floral bud differentiation in sweet cherry. These data provide a rich source of novel informacion for functional and evolutionary studies about floral bud development in sweet cherry and new tools for biotechnology and breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3011762361,"Background and aims This paper was primarily devoted to understand the interactions of soil aggregates, organic carbon (C) and carbon cycle enzymes in aggregates under different fertilization managements, aiming to identify the effects of organic and inorganic fertilizer amendments on soil organic C accumulation and the activities of carbon cycle enzymes within aggregates in Vertisol. Methods A Vertisol soil following 4-year compost and inorganic fertilizer amendments, i.e. no fertilizer (CK), mineral fertilizer (FR) and 60% compost N plus 40% fertilizer N (FRM), was collected to identify the dynamics of organic C, enzymes activities and their associations with macroaggregation using aggregate fractionation techniques. Results The organic C content in all FR and FRM treatments was 8.24–41.15% higher than that in CK. An increased amounts of carbon cycle enzymes in aggregates or 0–20 cm bulk soil were also observed in FRM plots. Compared to FR, FRM significantly strengthened the structural stability of macroaggregates and the intimate connection between enzyme activities and macroaggregates. Conclusions As a recommended measure, supplementation with organic manure such as compost strengthened the process of mutual promotion between carbon cycle enzymes and macroaggregates, and the synergistic effect would be highly beneficial to soil organic C sequestration."
https://openalex.org/W3010957586,"A decrease in alpha band power is defined as a hallmark of electroencephalogram (EEG) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study devotes to understanding the neuronal correlates of alpha rhythm slowing associated with AD from the view of neurocomputation. Firstly, a modified computational model of thalamo-cortico-thalamic (TCT) circuitry is constructed by incorporating two important biologically plausible ingredients. One is the disinhibition property between different inhibitory interneurons in the cortical module. The other is the full relay function of thalamic relay nucleus (TCR) to the cortical module. Then, by decreasing synaptic connectivity parameters to mimic the neuropathological condition of synapse loss in AD, the correlation between neuronal synaptic behavior and abnormal alpha rhythm is simulated by means of power spectral analysis. The results indicate that these decreases of synaptic activity, i.e., not only the excitatory synaptic connections from TCR to fast inhibitory interneurons Cfte and from excitatory interneurons to pyramidal neurons Cpxe but also the inhibitory synaptic connections from fast inhibitory interneurons to slow inhibitory interneurons Clfi and from inhibitory interneurons to TCR Ctii, can significantly diminish the peak power density over the alpha band of the thalamic output, which implies that there is a slowing of alpha band. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism behind the alpha rhythmic changes is analyzed using nonlinear dynamical technique. The results reveal that decreases of Cfte, Cpxe, Clfi and Ctii can make the thalamic module transfer from a limit cycle mode to a point attractor mode, which may lead to the alpha rhythm slowing in the modified TCT model. We expect this work can be helpful in identifying early biomarkers of AD's EEG and understanding potential pathogenesis of AD."
https://openalex.org/W3011046461,"Measurement of oxygen uptake during exercise () is currently non-accessible to most individuals without expensive and invasive equipment. The goal of this pilot study was to estimate cycling from easy-to-obtain inputs, such as heart rate, mechanical power output, cadence and respiratory frequency. To this end, a recurrent neural network was trained from laboratory cycling data to predict values. Data were collected on 7 amateur cyclists during a graded exercise test, two arbitrary protocols (Prot-1 and -2) and an “all-out” Wingate test. In Trial-1, a neural network was trained with data from a graded exercise test, Prot-1 and Wingate, before being tested against Prot-2. In Trial-2, a neural network was trained using data from the graded exercise test, Prot-1 and 2, before being tested against the Wingate test. Two analytical models (Models 1 and 2) were used to compare the predictive performance of the neural network. Predictive performance of the neural network was high during both Trial-1 (MAE = 229(35) mlO2min-1, r = 0.94) and Trial-2 (MAE = 304(150) mlO2min-1, r = 0.89). As expected, the predictive ability of Models 1 and 2 deteriorated from Trial-1 to Trial-2. Results suggest that recurrent neural networks have the potential to predict the individual response from easy-to-obtain inputs across a wide range of cycling intensities."
https://openalex.org/W3011281516,"There is a limitation in the size of an image that can be processed using computationally demanding methods such as e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Furthermore, many networks are designed to work with a pre-determined fixed image size. Some imaging modalities—notably biological and medical—can result in images up to a few gigapixels in size, meaning that they have to be divided into smaller parts, or patches, for processing. However, when performing pixel classification, this may lead to undesirable artefacts, such as edge effects in the final re-combined image. We introduce windowing methods from signal processing to effectively reduce such edge effects. With the assumption that the central part of an image patch often holds richer contextual information than its sides and corners, we reconstruct the prediction by overlapping patches that are being weighted depending on 2-dimensional windows. We compare the results of simple averaging and four different windows: Hann, Bartlett-Hann, Triangular and a recently proposed window by Cui et al., and show that the cosine-based Hann window achieves the best improvement as measured by the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). We also apply the Dice score to show that classification errors close to patch edges are reduced. The proposed windowing method can be used together with any CNN model for segmentation without any modification and significantly improves network predictions."

In this study, we aimed to verify how the Zika epidemic has moulded the scientific articles published worldwide by analysing international collaborations and the knowledge landscape through time, as well as research topics and country involvement.We searched the Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and PubMed for studies published up to 31st December 2018 on Zika using the search terms ""zika"", ""zkv"" or ""zikv"". We analysed the scientific production regarding which countries have published the most, on which topics, as well as country level collaboration. We performed a scientometric analysis of research on Zika focusing on knowledge mapping and the scientific research path over time and space.We found two well defined research areas divided into three subtopics accounting for six clusters. With regard to country analysis, the USA and Brazil were the countries with the highest numbers of publications on Zika. China entered as a new player focusing on specific research areas. When we took into consideration the epidemics and reported cases, Brazil and France were the leading research countries on related topics. As for international collaboration, the USA followed by England and France stand out as the main hubs. The research areas most published included public health-related topics from 2015 until the very beginning of 2016, followed by an increase in topics related to the clinical aspects of the disease in 2016 and the emergence of laboratory research in 2017/2018.Mapping the response to Zika, a public health emergency, demonstrated a clear pattern of the participation of countries in the scientific advances. The pattern of knowledge production found in this study represented varying country perspectives, research capacity and interests based first on their level of exposure to the epidemic and second on their financial positions regarding science."
https://openalex.org/W3010807117,"Seafood mislabeling occurs in a wide range of seafood products worldwide, resulting in public distrust, economic fraud, and health risks for consumers. We quantified the extent of shrimp mislabeling in coastal and inland North Carolina. We used standard DNA barcoding procedures to determine the species identity of 106 shrimp sold as “local” by 60 vendors across North Carolina. Thirty-four percent of the purchased shrimp was mislabeled, and surprisingly the percentage did not differ significantly between coastal and inland counties. One third of product incorrectly marketed as “local” was in fact whiteleg shrimp: an imported and globally farmed species native to the eastern Pacific, not found in North Carolina waters. In addition to the negative ecosystem consequences of shrimp farming (e.g., the loss of mangrove forests and the coastal buffering they provide), North Carolina fishers—as with local fishers elsewhere—are negatively impacted when vendors label farmed, frozen, and imported shrimp as local, fresh, and wild-caught."
https://openalex.org/W3011110870,"While several basic properties of cholera outbreaks are common to most settings-the pathophysiology of the disease, the waterborne nature of transmission, and others-recent findings suggest that transmission within households may play a larger role in cholera outbreaks than previously appreciated. Important features of cholera outbreaks have long been effectively modeled with mathematical and computational approaches, but little is known about how variation in direct transmission via households may influence epidemic dynamics. In this study, we construct a mathematical model of cholera that incorporates transmission within and between households. We observe that variation in the magnitude of household transmission changes multiple features of disease dynamics, including the severity and duration of outbreaks. Strikingly, we observe that household transmission influences the effectiveness of possible public health interventions (e.g. water treatment, antibiotics, vaccines). We find that vaccine interventions are more effective than water treatment or antibiotic administration when direct household transmission is present. Summarizing, we position these results within the landscape of existing models of cholera, and speculate on its implications for epidemiology and public health."
https://openalex.org/W3011426179,"Background Personality traits and mental health problems have been previously reported in unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) patients; however, few studies have clarified the relations between these variables and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study was designed to characterize the personality traits, HRQoL and mental health of patients with UIA and to evaluate whether personality has an influence on HRQoL and whether this is mediated by the patients' emotional symptoms. Methods Sixty-three patients with UIAs (mean age 62.6 years, 83.9% women) answered questionnaires for depression, anxiety, HRQoL and personality traits between June 2016 and May 2019. Results Eight percent of the sample had depression, and 27.4% had anxiety. Participants showed high levels of responsibility, kindness and neuroticism and low levels of extraversion and openness. HRQoL scores were normal compared with the Colombian population. Structural equation analysis showed that patients' HRQoL was negatively affected by anxiety levels and that the latter are associated with the patient's personality, where neuroticism is directly associated with symptomatology and inversely associated with extraversion. Conclusions The results of this study showed the importance of personality and emotional symptoms in the HRQoL of UIA patients. These results are important for developing strategies for psychological counseling in patients with UIAs."
https://openalex.org/W3010790351,"In the last few years, DNA barcoding became an established method for species identification in biodiversity inventories and monitoring studies. Such studies depend on the access to a comprehensive reference data base, covering all relevant taxa. Here we present a comprehensive DNA barcode inventory of all amphibian and reptile species native to Austria, except for the putatively extinct Vipera ursinii rakosiensis and Lissotriton helveticus, which has been only recently reported for the very western edge of Austria. A total of 194 DNA barcodes were generated in the framework of the Austrian Barcode of Life (ABOL) initiative. Species identification via DNA barcodes was successful for most species, except for the hybridogenetic species complex of water frogs (Pelophylax spp.) and the crested newts (Triturus spp.), in areas of sympatry. However, DNA barcoding also proved powerful in detecting deep conspecific lineages, e.g. within Natrix natrix or the wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), resulting in more than one Barcode Index Number (BIN) per species. Moreover, DNA barcodes revealed the presence of Natrix helvetica, which has been elevated to species level only recently, and genetic signatures of the Italian water frog Pelophylax bergeri in Western Austria for the first time. Comparison to previously published DNA barcoding data of European amphibians and reptiles corroborated the results of the Austrian data but also revealed certain peculiarities, underlining the particular strengths and in the case of the genus Pelophylax also the limitations of DNA barcoding. Consequently, DNA barcoding is not only powerful for species identification of all life stages of most Austrian amphibian and reptile species, but also for the detection of new species, the monitoring of gene flow or the presence of alien populations and/or species. Thus, DNA barcoding and the data generated in this study may serve both scientific and national or even transnational conservation purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3011751013,"Despite achievements in the reduction of malaria globally, imported malaria cases to the United States by returning international travelers continue to increase. Immigrants to the United States from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) who then travel back to their homelands to visit friends and relatives (VFRs) experience a disproportionate burden of malaria illness. Various studies have explored barriers to malaria prevention among VFRs and non-VFRs-travelers to the same destinations with other purpose for travel-but few employed robust epidemiologic study designs or performed comparative analyses of these two groups. To better quantify the key barriers that VFRs face to implement effective malaria prevention measures, we conducted a comprehensive community-based, cross-sectional, survey to identify differences in malaria prevention knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among VFRs and others traveling to Africa and describe the differences between VFRs and other types of international travelers.Three distinct populations of travelers with past or planned travel to malaria-endemic countries of SSA were surveyed: VFRs diagnosed with malaria as reported through a state health department; members of the general VFR population (community); and VFR and non-VFR travelers presenting to a travel health clinic, both before their pretravel consultation and again, after return from travel. A Community Advisory Board of African immigrants and prior qualitative research informed survey development and dissemination. Across the three groups, 489 travelers completed surveys: 351 VFRs and 138 non-VFRs. VFRs who reported taking antimalarials on their last trip rated their concern about malaria higher than those who did not. Having taken five or more trips to SSA was reported more commonly among VFRs diagnosed with malaria than community VFRs (44.0% versus 20.4%; p = 0.008). Among travel health clinic patients surveyed before and after travel, VFR travelers were less successful than non-VFRs in adhering to their planned use of antimalarials (82.2% versus 98.7%; p = 0.001) and employing mosquito bite avoidance techniques (e.g., using bed nets: 56.8% versus 81.8%; p = 0.009). VFRs who visited the travel health clinic were more likely than VFR respondents from the community to report taking an antimalarial (83.0% versus 61.9%; p = 0.009), or to report bite avoidance behaviors (e.g., staying indoors when mosquitoes were out: 80.9% versus 59.5%; p = 0.009).We observed heterogeneity in malaria prevention behaviors among VFRs and between VFR and non-VFR traveler populations. Although VFRs attending the travel health clinic appear to demonstrate better adherence to malaria prevention measures than VFR counterparts surveyed in the community, specialized pretravel care is not sufficient to ensure chemoprophylaxis use and bite avoidance behaviors among VFRs. Even when seeking specialized pretravel care, VFRs experience greater barriers to the use of malaria prevention than non-VFRs. Addressing access to health care and upstream barrier reduction strategies that make intended prevention more achievable, affordable, easier, and resonant among VFRs may improve malaria prevention intervention effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3011108251,"We characterised 80 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from human patients with SSTIs at a rural hospital in Ethiopia. Susceptibility to antibiotic of all strains was tested. The MLST method was used to type and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted employing the sequences of 7 housekeeping genes. PCR amplification was used to investigate the presence of the following virulence genes in all strains: hla (α-haemolysin), tstH (toxic shock syndrome toxin), luk PV (Panton-Valentine leukocidin), fnbA (fibronectin binding protein A) and mecA (methicillin resistance). Most of the strains were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin, but only 3 strains were resistant to oxacillin, and 1 of them was a true MRSA. The MLST results showed a high diversity of sequence types (ST), 55% of which were new, and ST152 was the most prevalent. A phylogeny study showed that many of the new STs were phylogenetically related to other previously described STs, but bore little relationship to the only ST from Ethiopia described in the database. Virulence gene detection showed a high prevalence of strains encoding the hla, fnbA and pvl genes (98.77%, 96.3% and 72.84%, respectively), a low prevalence of the tst gene (13.58%) and a markedly low prevalence of MRSA (1.25%). S. aureus strains isolated from patients in a rural area in Ethiopia showed low levels of antibiotic resistance, except to penicillin. Moreover, this study reveals new STs in Eastern Africa that are phylogenetically related to other previously described STs, and confirm the high prevalence of the pvl gene and the low prevalence of MRSA on the continent."

Testing indicators included the ocular surface disease index (OSDI), fluorescein tear film breakup time (FBUT), corneal fluorescence staining (CFS), the Schirmer test (SI), lipid layer thickness (LLT), blink rate (BR) per 20 seconds, incomplete blinking rate, noninvasive keratograph assessment of first and average tear film breakup time (NIKBUTf, NIKBUTav), and tear meniscus height (TMH). Each indicator was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 w, 1 mo and 3 mo.The mean age was 29.12±5.95 years. There were no significant differences among the three groups (p>0.05), except preoperative age (p = 0.006). There were significant differences in the FBUT among the three groups at postoperative 1 w and 1 mo (p<0.05). There were significant differences in the incomplete blinking rate and FBUT between the LMG and the HMG at postoperative 1 mo (p<0.05). The number of first tear film breakup points located beyond the 6 mm diameter of the cornea was higher in the HMG than in the other groups. The prevalence of DED in the LMG, the MMG, the HMG was 15%, 8% and 23%, respectively, at 1 w postoperative and 30%, 45% and 53%, respectively, at postoperative 1 mo. The change in LLT was significantly correlated with the changes in FBUT (r = 0.408, p<0.001) and incomplete blinking rate (r = -0.266, p = 0.007). The change in OSDI was negatively correlated with the change in SI (r = -0.502, p = 0.000).The changes in LLT and incomplete blinking rate decreased the stability of the tear film. The changes in LLT, FBUT and incomplete blinking rate differed postoperatively with different myopia degrees. The prevalence of DED was higher in the HMG than in the other two groups."
https://openalex.org/W3011499678,"A method was developed and validated for low-level detection of glucose. The method involves quantitation of glucose though derivitization with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) and HPLC-DAD analysis. The developed method was found to be accurate and robust achieving detection limits as low as 0.09 nM. The applicability of the method was tested against microbial samples with glucose acting as a carbon fuel source. The method was shown to be able to accurately discriminate and quantify PMP-glucose derivatives within Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 samples. The method proved capable at examining glucose usage during the early hours of microbial growth, with detectable usage occurring as early as two hours. S. oneidensis cultures were found to grow more effectively in the presence of oxygen which coincided with more efficient glucose usage. Glucose usage further increased in the presence of competing electron acceptors. The rate at which S. oneidensis reached exponential growth was affected by the presence of ferric iron under microaerobic conditions. Such samples reached exponential growth approximately two hours sooner than aerobic samples."
https://openalex.org/W3012434184,"Neighborhood environment perception (NEP) has been associated with health outcomes. However, little is known about how NEP relates to routine healthcare utilization. This study investigated the relationship between NEP and independent subfactors with healthcare utilization behavior, as measured by self-reported (1) usual source of healthcare and (2) time since last routine healthcare check-up. We used cross-sectional data from the Dallas Heart Study, which features a diverse, probability-based sample of Dallas County residents ages 18 to 65. We used logistic regression modeling to examine the association of self-reported NEP and routine healthcare utilization. NEP was assessed via a questionnaire exploring residents’ neighborhood perceptions, including violence, the physical environment, and social cohesion. Routine healthcare utilization was assessed via self-reported responses regarding usual source of care and time since last routine healthcare check-up. The analytic sample (N = 1706) was 58% black, 27% white, 15% Hispanic, 42% male, and had a mean age of 51 (SD = 10.3). Analysis of NEP by tertile demonstrated that younger age, lower income, and lower education were associated with unfavorable overall NEP (p trend <0.05 for each). After adjustment for potential confounders, including neighborhood deprivation, health insurance, disease burden and psychosocial factors, we found that individuals with more unfavorable perception of their physical environment were more likely to report lack of a usual source of care (p = 0.013). Individuals with more unfavorable perception of the neighborhood physical environment or greater neighborhood violence reported longer time periods since last routine visit (p = 0.001, p = 0.034 respectively). There was no relationship between perceived social cohesion and healthcare utilization. Using a multi-ethnic cohort, we found that NEP significantly associates with report of a usual source of care and time since last routine check-up. Our findings suggest that public health professionals should prioritize improving NEP since it may act as barrier to routine preventive healthcare and ideal health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3011194011,"Falls cause negative impacts on society and the economy. Slipping is a common initiating event for falling. Yet, individuals differ in their ability to recover from slips. Persons experiencing mild slips can accommodate the perturbation without falling, whereas severe slipping is associated with inadequate or slow pre- or post-slip control that make these individuals more prone to fall. Knowing the discrepancies between mild and severe slippers in kinematic and kinetic variables improves understanding of adverse control responsible for severe slipping. This study examined differences across these participants with respect to center of mass (COM) height, sagittal angular momentum (H), upper body kinematics, and the duration of single/double phase. Possible causality of such relationships was also studied by observing the time-lead of the deviations. Twenty healthy young adults performed walking trials in dry and slippery conditions. They were classified into mild and severe slippers based on their heel slipping speed. No inter-group differences were observed in the upper extremity kinematics. It was found that mild and severe slippers do not differ in the studied variables during normal gait; however, they do show significant differences through slipping. Compared to mild slippers, sever slippers lowered their COM height following a slip, presented higher H, and shortened their single support phase (p-value<0.05 for all). Based on the time-lead observed in H over all other variables suggests that failure to control angular momentum may influence slip severity."

https://openalex.org/W3011464872,"Borrowing concepts from public health, we examined the association of several social determinants with the mental health of middle-aged and older queer men in India by combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies. A cross-sectional survey guided by Meyer’s Minority Stress Model was carried out to assess the links between minority stressors (internalized homophobia and degree of closetedness), age-related stressors (ageism and fear of ageing) and psychological wellbeing (loneliness, depressive symptoms and sexual compulsivity) among 207 Indian men (aged 40 years and above) who identified themselves as non-heterosexuals. Results from simple and multivariable linear regression models showed significant positive associations of ageism, internalized homophobia, and fear of ageing with loneliness, even after accounting for sociodemographic and stress mitigating factors. Ageism was not significantly related to depressive symptoms. However, fear of ageing and internalized homophobia was positively associated with depressive symptoms after accounting for covariates. Further, regression models demonstrated a consistent and statistically significant inverse association between income and adverse psychological outcomes suggesting the centrality of social class in the lived experience of Indian gay and bisexual men. The qualitative inquiry addressed the same research questions as the quantitative survey through in-depth interviews of thirty middle-aged and older gay and bisexual men in Mumbai. We found that older and midlife gay and bisexual men with higher income (a proxy for social class) found ways to manage their masculinities with no discernible adverse psychological outcomes. Depressive symptoms and loneliness in this population made them further vulnerable to excessive sexual impulses, especially in the older queer men who were passing off as heterosexuals. Overall, the theory-driven empirical findings suggest that even in India, where family and friends are social insurance for later life, the issues of ageism and internalized homophobia have the potential to lead to worse mental health outcomes among older queer men."
https://openalex.org/W3011806330,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in adolescence are associated with adverse outcomes, but whether the timing of the onset of TBIs leads to greater deficits has not been determined. We evaluate the relationship between the first and most recent TBI, and current academic performance and medically treated physical injuries.Data were derived from the 2015 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS) administered to adolescents in grades 7 to 12 (ages 12 to 18). TBI was defined as a head injury that resulted in loss of conscious for at least five minutes or at least one overnight hospitalization.One in five students reported having had a history of TBI in their lifetime and were more prevalent in males. Odds ratios were 2 times higher for males to have had their first (or only) and most recent TBI in grades 5 to 8, compared to females. Sports-related TBIs accounted for 41.1% of all TBIs. Hockey related TBIs were more frequent compared to soccer related TBIs. Reports of history of TBI was associated with lower academic performance and more physical injuries. First or only TBI occurring in grades 9-12 (occurring on average between 14 to 19 years of age) had higher significant odds of poorer academic performance than TBIs occurring in earlier grades (younger ages than 14 years old). Students who reported more visits for medical treatment of physical injuries in the past year had higher odds to report a history of TBIs in higher school grades.Adverse physical and academic outcomes among young TBI survivors are associated with the onset and frequency of history of lifetime TBI. Prevention efforts to minimize TBIs during youth is critical."
https://openalex.org/W3010690380,"Ionic liquids are salts used in a variety of industrial processes, and being relatively non-volatile, are proposed as environmentally-friendly replacements for existing volatile liquids. Methylimidazolium ionic liquids resist complete degradation in the environment, likely because the imidazolium moiety does not exist naturally in biological systems. However, there is limited data available regarding their mammalian effects in vivo. This study aimed to examine the effects of exposing mice separately to 2 different methylimidazolium ionic liquids (BMI and M8OI) through their addition to drinking water. Potential effects on key target organs–the liver and kidney–were examined, as well as the gut microbiome. Adult male mice were exposed to drinking water containing ionic liquids at a concentration of 440 mg/L for 18 weeks prior to examination of tissues, serum, urine and the gut microbiome. Histopathology was performed on tissues and clinical chemistry on serum for biomarkers of hepatic and renal injury. Bacterial DNA was isolated from the gut contents and subjected to targeted 16S rRNA sequencing. Mild hepatic and renal effects were limited to glycogen depletion and mild degenerative changes respectively. No hepatic or renal adverse effects were observed. In contrast, ionic liquid exposure altered gut microbial composition but not overall alpha diversity. Proportional abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Clostridia and Coriobacteriaceae spp. were significantly greater in ionic liquid-exposed mice, as were predicted KEGG functional pathways associated with xenobiotic and amino acid metabolism. Exposure to ionic liquids via drinking water therefore resulted in marked changes in the gut microbiome in mice prior to any overt pathological effects in target organs. Ionic liquids may be an emerging risk to health through their potential effects on the gut microbiome, which is implicated in the causes and/or severity of an array of chronic disease in humans."

We aim to evaluate the real world clinical treatment and survival of BCLC stage C patients in an Asian cohort. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study that enrolled 427 consecutive BCLC stage C patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2017 by using the HCC registry data for our hospital. All patients were managed via a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach. Results Hepatitis B surface antigen positive was noted in 50.6% of the patients. The patients were classified as performance status (PS)1 alone (n = 83; 19.4%), PS2 alone (n = 23; 5.4%), or macrovascular invasion (MVI) or extrahepatic spread (EHS) (n = 321; 75.2%). The median overall survival (OS) was 11.0 months in the whole cohort. The most frequent treatments were transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in the PS1 (45.8%) and PS2 patients (52.2%) and sorafenib (32.4%) in the MVI or EHS patients. The independent prognostic factors were the PS, Child-Pugh class, MVI or EHS, alpha fetoprotein levels, and treatment type. Conclusions We reported the real world management in BCLC stage C patients in an Asian cohort through the use of personalized management via a MDT approach."
https://openalex.org/W3011868018,"Treatment options are limited for the approximately 40% of postmenopausal women worldwide who suffer from female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Neural stimulation has shown potential as a treatment for genital arousal FSD, however the mechanisms for its improvement are unknown. One potential cause of some cases of genital arousal FSD are changes to the composition of the vaginal microbiota, which is associated with vulvovaginal atrophy. The primary hypothesis of this study was that neural stimulation may induce healthy changes in the vaginal microbiome, thereby improving genital arousal FSD symptoms. In this study we used healthy rats, which are a common animal model for sexual function, however the rat vaginal microbiome is understudied. Thus this study also sought to examine the composition of the rat vaginal microbiota. Treatment rats (n = 5) received 30 minutes of cutaneous electrical stimulation targeting the genital branch of the pudendal nerve, and Control animals (n = 4) had 30-minute sessions without stimulation. Vaginal lavage samples were taken during a 14-day baseline period including multiple estrous periods and after twice-weekly 30-minute sessions across a six-week trial period. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences was used to characterize the rat vaginal microbiota in baseline samples and determine the effect of stimulation. We found that the rat vaginal microbiota is dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, which changed in relative abundance during the estrous cycle and in relationship to each other. While the overall stimulation effects were unclear in these healthy rats, some Treatment animals had less alteration in microbiota composition between sequential samples than Control animals, suggesting that stimulation may help stabilize the vaginal microbiome. Future studies may consider additional physiological parameters, in addition to the microbiome composition, to further examine vaginal health and the effects of stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W3012311764,"Nowadays, the global energy system is in a transition phase, in which the integration of renewable energy is among the main requirements for attenuating climate change. Wind power is a major alternative to supply clean energy; hence, its widespread penetration is being pursued in all end-use sectors. In particular, it is currently noteworthy to analyze the feasibility of deploying small-scale wind power technology to provide cleaner and cheaper energy in the residential sector. As a first step, a technical assessment must be carried out to provide crucial information to intensive energy consumers, providers of small-scale wind power technology, electric energy distribution utilities, and any other party, to help them decide whether or not to deploy small-scale wind turbines. With this aim, we propose to perform such an analysis using a suitable probabilistic paradigm to solve complex decision-making problems with uncertainty, namely Bayesian Intelligence, since wind resources and energy demands are intermittent variables, properly characterized by probability distribution functions. Then, the problem of determining the technical feasibility can be formulated as an investigation into whether or not small-scale wind turbine technology can produce enough energy to cover the excess demand of intensive energy residential consumers to get off high-priced tariffs. For this purpose, we introduce a novel model based on probabilistic reasoning to assess the suitability of small-scale wind turbine technology to produce the said energy, taking into consideration the availability of wind resources and the energy pricing structure. To demonstrate the usefulness and performance of the proposed model, we consider a case study of deploying 5 and 10 kW wind turbines and analyze the feasibility of their implementation in Mexico, where the energy pricing structure and scattered wind resource availability pose difficult challenges."

https://openalex.org/W3011248190,"To date, no studies have reported the use of text messaging to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to alcohol users with HIV. We developed and evaluated a text messaging-based program to deliver CBT targeting both alcohol use and adherence to antiretroviral (ART) medications for adults with alcohol use disorders and comorbid HIV. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a 12-week CBT-based text messaging intervention (ALC-TXT-CBT) targeting ART adherence and alcohol use (n = 18); or an informational pamphlet (INFO) comprising educational content focused on alcohol use and medication adherence (n = 17). ART adherence and alcohol use were compared for those in ALC-TXT-CBT to INFO across baseline and 12-week (i.e., treatment-end) assessments using mixed model regression analyses and paired t-tests. Relative to those in INFO, ALC-TXT-CBT participants evidenced increases in ART adherence, measured by phone-based unannounced pill counts (β = .16, p = .04), and biochemically by viral load (t = -2.0, p = .04) at treatment-end. ALC-TXT-CBT participation was also associated with reductions in heavy drinking at treatment-end (t = 2.7, p = 0.02), while overall alcohol use frequency did not differ significantly between groups (t = 1.5, p = 0.07).

The objective of our study was to explore the role of common variants in ADCY5 on gestational glycemic traits, including plasma glucose, insulin values, β cell function and insulin resistance in the fasted state as well as plasma glucose 1 hour after a 50-gram glucose challenge test among Chinese Han women. Homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to quantify β cell function (HOMA1-β and HOMA2-β) and insulin resistance (HOMA1-IR and HOMA2-IR). Thirty-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADCY5 were genotyped in 929 unrelated Chinese Han women with singleton pregnancies. Three SNPs (rs6797915, rs9856662 and rs9875803) displayed evidence for association with plasma glucose 1 hour after a 50-gram glucose challenge test (P = 0.042, 0.018 and 0.018, respectively), one (rs6777397) displayed evidence for association with HOMA1-β (P = 0.014), and one (rs6762009) displayed evidence for association with HOMA1-IR (P = 0.033).

https://openalex.org/W3011555384,"Heavy geographic patterning to the 2016 Brexit vote in UK and Trump vote in US has resulted in numerous ecological analyses of variations in area-level voting behaviours. We extend this work by employing modelling approaches that permit regionally-specific associations between outcome and explanatory variables. We do so by generating a large number of regional models using penalised regression for variable selection and coefficient evaluation. The results reinforce those already published in that we find associations in support of a ‘left-behind’ reading. Multivariate models are dominated by a single variable—levels of degree-education. Net of this effect, ‘secondary’ variables help explain the vote, but do so differently for different regions. For Brexit, variables relating to material disadvantage, and to a lesser extent structural-economic circumstances, are more important for regions with a strong industrial history than for regions that do not share such a history. For Trump, increased material disadvantage reduces the vote both in global models and models built mostly for Southern states, thereby undermining the ‘left-behind’ reading. The reverse is nevertheless true for many other states, particularly those in New England and the Mid-Atlantic, where comparatively high levels of disadvantage assist the Trump vote and where model outputs are more consistent with the UK, especially so for regions with closer economic histories. This pattern of associations is exposed via our regional modelling approach, application of penalised regression and use of carefully designed visualization to reason over 100+ model outputs located within their spatial context. Our analysis, documented in an accompanying github repository, is in response to recent calls in empirical Social and Political Science for fuller exploration of subnational contexts that are often controlled out of analyses, for use of modelling techniques more robust to replication and for greater transparency in research design and methodology."
https://openalex.org/W3011628970,"The Caulobacter genus, including the widely-studied model organism Caulobacter crescentus, has been thought to be non-pathogenic and thus proposed as a bioengineering vector for various environmental remediation and medical purposes. However, Caulobacter species have been implicated as the causative agents of several hospital-acquired infections, raising the question of whether these clinical isolates represent an emerging pathogenic species or whether Caulobacters on whole possess previously-unappreciated virulence capability. Given the proposed environmental and medical applications for C. crescentus, understanding the potential pathogenicity of this bacterium is crucial. Consequently, we sequenced a clinical Caulobacter isolate to determine if it has acquired novel virulence determinants. We found that the clinical isolate represents a new species, Caulobacter mirare that, unlike C. crescentus, grows well in standard clinical culture conditions. C. mirare phylogenetically resembles both C. crescentus and the related C. segnis, which was also thought to be non-pathogenic. The similarity to other Caulobacters and lack of obvious pathogenesis markers suggested that C. mirare is not unique amongst Caulobacters and that consequently other Caulobacters may also have the potential to be virulent. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the ability of Caulobacters to infect the model animal host Galleria mellonella. In this context, two different lab strains of C. crescentus proved to be as pathogenic as C. mirare, while lab strains of E. coli were non-pathogenic. Further characterization showed that Caulobacter pathogenesis in the Galleria model is mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and that differences in LPS chemical composition across species could explain their differential toxicity. Taken together, our findings suggest that many Caulobacter species can be virulent in specific contexts and highlight the importance of broadening our methods for identifying and characterizing potential pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3011023788,"Recombinant production of IgM antibodies poses a special challenge due to the complex structure of the proteins and their not yet fully elucidated interactions with the immune effector proteins, especially the complement system. In this study, we present transient expression of IgM antibodies (IgM617, IgM012 and IgM012_GL) in HEK cells and compared it to the well-established stable expression system in CHO cells. The presented workflow investigates quality attributes including productivity, polymer distribution, glycosylation, antibody structure and activation of the classical complement pathway. The HEK293E transient expression system is able to generate comparable amounts and polymer distribution as IgM stably produced in CHO. Although the glycan profile generated by HEK293E cells contained a lower degree of sialylation and a higher portion of oligomannose structures, the potency to activate the complement cascade was maintained. Electron microscopy also confirmed the structural integrity of IgM pentamers produced in HEK293E cells, since the conventional star-shaped structure is observed. From our studies, we conclude that the transient expression system provides an attractive alternative for rapid, efficient and high-throughput production of complex IgM antibodies with slightly altered post-translational modifications, but comparable structure and function."

After a 14-day lead-in on the control food, cats were randomized to one of four foods (control, with 6.9% MCT, with fish oil [FO; 0.14% eicosapentaenoate, 1.0% docosahexaenoate], or with FO+MCT; n = 16 per group) for 28 days. Analysis of plasma metabolites showed that the addition of FO and MCT led to synergistic effects not seen with either alone across a number of lipid classes, including fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and acylated amines including endocannabinoids. Notably, the FO+MCT group had an increase in ketone body production relative to baseline and beyond that seen with MCT alone. N-acyl taurines, the accumulation of which has been implicated in the onset of type 2 diabetes, were significantly decreased in the FO+MCT group. Significant decreases in the gut microbiome-derived postbiotic classes of indoles/indolic sulfates and phenols/phenolic sulfates were observed only the FO+MCT group. Overall, the combination of MCT and FO led to number of changes in plasma metabolites that were not observed with either oil alone, particularly in postbiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3012320552,"Exogenously hypercholesterolemic (ExHC) rats develop diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (DIHC) when fed with dietary cholesterol. Previously, we reported that, under the high-sucrose-diet-feeding condition, a loss-of-function mutation in Smek2 results in low activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) followed by the shortage of hepatic triacylglycerol content in ExHC rats and the onset of DIHC. However, the relationship between the Smek2 mutation and FAS dysfunction is still unclear. Here, we focused on carbohydrate metabolism, which provides substrates for FAS, and analyzed carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms in ExHC rats to clarify how the deficit of Smek2 causes DIHC. Male ExHC and SD rats were fed high-sucrose or high-starch diets containing 1% cholesterol for 2 weeks. Serum cholesterol levels of the ExHC rats were higher, regardless of the dietary carbohydrate. Hepatic triacylglycerol levels were higher in only the SD rats fed the high-sucrose diet. Moreover, the ExHC rats exhibited a diabetes-like status and accumulation of hepatic glycogen and low hepatic mRNA levels of liver-type phosphofructokinase (Pfkl), which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis. These results suggest that the glucose utilization, particularly glycolysis, is impaired in the liver of ExHC rats. To evaluate how the diet with extremely low glucose affect to DIHC, ExHC.BN-Dihc2BN, a congenic strain that does not develop DIHC, and ExHC rats were fed a high-fructose diet containing 1% cholesterol for 2 weeks. The serum cholesterol and hepatic triacylglycerol levels were similar in the strains. Results of water-soluble metabolite analysis with primary hepatocytes, an increase in fructose-6-phosphate and decreases in succinate, malate and aspartate in ExHC rats, support impaired glycolysis in the ExHC rats. Thus, the Smek2 mutation causes abnormal hepatic glucose utilization via downregulation of Pfkl expression. This abnormal glucose metabolism disrupts hepatic fatty acid synthesis and causes DIHC in the ExHC rats."

However, theoretic and empirical studies on the economic effect of water technologies which incorporate water resources into a sustainable economic growth model remain scarce in northwest China. This article attempts to build a water technology endogenous model based on ""learning by doing"" theory to identify the mechanisms of water technologies affect economic growth due to changing water consumption. Considering the case of Northwest China in this empirical research, we apply the stochastic production frontier model by using panel data from 1996 to 2017. The results shows that progress in water technologies has indeed increased GDP growth and the current level of water technologies is not a key factor in eliminating the constraints of water resources. In addition, water scarcity still constrains economic growth in Northwest China and progress in water science and technology is the main power of all water technologies. Finally, the speed of water science and technology slows as the amount of water consumption increase and the impact of water technical efficiency on economic growth depends on water institutions of different areas. This study may enhance the policy relevance of water technological governance and economic growth transformation, which were beneficial for informing policies towards sustainable water resource utilization in northwest China."
https://openalex.org/W3010681570,"We report the synthesis and preliminary characterization of IODVA1, a potent small molecule that is active in xenograft mouse models of Ras-driven lung and breast cancers. In an effort to inhibit oncogenic Ras signaling, we combined in silico screening with inhibition of proliferation and colony formation of Ras-driven cells. NSC124205 fulfilled all criteria. HPLC analysis revealed that NSC124205 was a mixture of at least three compounds, from which IODVA1 was determined to be the active component. IODVA1 decreased 2D and 3D cell proliferation, cell spreading and ruffle and lamellipodia formation through downregulation of Rac activity. IODVA1 significantly impaired xenograft tumor growth of Ras-driven cancer cells with no observable toxicity. Immuno-histochemistry analysis of tumor sections suggests that cell death occurs by increased apoptosis. Our data suggest that IODVA1 targets Rac signaling to induce death of Ras-transformed cells. Therefore, IODVA1 holds promise as an anti-tumor therapeutic agent."

Methods A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted using data from the Hospital Pharmacy of Siena (HPS) and the Regional Administrative Database of Tuscany (RAD). Patients aged ≥18 years with ≥1 rituximab administration recorded between January 2012 and June 2016 were identified in the HPS database. Anonymized patient-level data were linked to RAD. Rituximab utilization during the first year of treatment was described using HPS. Hospital diagnoses of adverse infectious events that occurred during the first year of follow-up and four-year survival were observed using RAD. Results A total of 311 new users of rituximab were identified: 264 patients received rituximab for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 47 were treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Among new users with one complete year of follow-up (n = 203) over 95% received rituximab as the first-line treatment, and approximately 70% of them received 5–8 doses. No patient in the CLL group received >8 administrations. Four-year survival was approximately 70% in both CLL and NHL patients. Sepsis was the most frequent infectious event observed (5.1%). Conclusion HPS and RAD provided complementary information on rituximab utilization, demonstrating their potential for future pharmacoepidemiological studies on antineoplastic medications administered in the Italian hospital setting. Overall, this general description of the real-world utilization of rituximab in patients treated for NHL and CLL at UHS was in line with treatment guidelines and current knowledge on the rituximab safety profile."

Background Research funders use a wide variety of application assessment processes yet there is little evidence on their relative advantages and disadvantages. A broad distinction can be made between processes with a single stage assessment of full proposals and those that first invite an outline, with full proposals invited at a second stage only for those which are shortlisted. This paper examines the effects of changing from a one-stage to a two-stage process within the UK’s National Institute for Health Research’s (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Programme which made this change in 2015. Methods A retrospective comparative design was used to compare eight one-stage funding competitions (912 applications) with eight two-stage funding competitions (1090 applications). Comparisons were made between the number of applications submitted, number of peer and lay reviews required, the duration of the funding round, average external peer review scores, and the total costs involved. Results There was a mean number of 114 applications per funding round for the one-stage process and 136 for the two-stage process. The one-stage process took a mean of 274 days and the two-stage process 348 days to complete, although those who were not funded (i.e. the majority) were informed at a mean of 195 days (mean 79 days earlier) under the two-stage process. The mean peer review score for full applications using the one-stage process was 6.46 and for the two-stage process 6.82 (5.6% difference using a 1–10 scale (with 10 being the highest), but there was no significant difference between the lay reviewer scores. The one-stage process required a mean of 423 peer reviews and 102 lay reviewers and the two-stage process required a mean of 208 peer reviews and 50 lay reviews (mean difference of 215 peer reviews and 52 lay reviews) per funding round. Overall cost per funding round changed from £148,908 for the one-stage process to £105,342 for the two-stage process saving approximately £43,566 per round. Conclusion We conclude that a two-stage application process increases the number of applications submitted to a funding round, is less burdensome and more efficient for all those involved with the process, is cost effective and has a small increase in peer reviewer scores. For the addition of fewer than 11 weeks to the process substantial efficiencies are gained which benefit funders, applicants and science. Funding agencies should consider adopting a two-stage application assessment process."
https://openalex.org/W3011908074,"Knowledge, attitude and willingness of ethnic minorities in China towards cadaver donation programs were assessed. Questionnaire and interviews were conducted to investigate Yi, Bai, Hani, Dai and Han ethnicities. Educational level and per capita income of ethnic minorities were lesser than those of Han ethnicity (p<0.01). Agriculture was the primary occupation and proportions of technical personnel and public officials was lesser among ethnic minorities (p<0.01). Surveyed ethnic minorities universally practice religious traditions, Bai and Dai ethnicities practice Buddhist beliefs also (p<0.01). Knowledge of Yi, Bai, Hani and Dai ethnic respondents was lesser than those of Han ethnicity (p<0.01). Over 83.8% of Yi, Bai, Hani and Dai ethnicity residents were unwilling to register for body donation programs with receiving a driver's license (p<0.01). Less than 46.9% of ethnic minorities supported use of honorary certificates (p<0.01). Ethnic minorities were supportive of financial compensation for body donations and denied that financial compensation led to the commercialization of cadaver donation (p<0.01, p<0.01). Willingness of ethnic minorities to participate in cadaver donation programs was primarily related to religious beliefs (p<0.01), economic status (p<0.01). Knowledge, attitude and willingness of ethnic minorities to participate in cadaver donation programs were markedly different from those of Han ethnicity, and the religious belief and economic status played a decisive role. To increase participation, programs based on respecting religious belief should be developed to support improvements in economy, education, medical care and social security system."
https://openalex.org/W3011127644,"The challenge in the search for relationships between urban space, physical mobility, and health status, is detecting indicators able to link the environment with healthy life habits. Therefore, the objective was to design an urban index for the identification of urban environment propensity for physical activity (PA) and to determine how it relates to lifestyle and anthropometric parametrization of obesity. Participants (N = 318-60.4% women and 39.6% men) were recruited from a mid-sized city with epidemiology and morbidity rates below the average for the mid-west region of Brazil. Body mass index (BMI) was measured and a questionnaire was applied to gather information about PA and life habits. The spatial urban health index (SUHI) was designed in a geographic information system using data from demographic, environmental and urban physical features. The relationship between BMI and PA was verified with multiple linear regression, controlled for SUHI levels. Regarding the BMI of the population, 69.5% were classified in the eutrophic or overweight ranges, with no effect of gender and age. The SUHI classified 63.7% of the urban area favorable to PA. The PA routine was adequate (≥3 sessions with ≥1 h each) for ~80% of the population, as well as healthy habits such as non smoking (~94%) and non alcohol abuse (~55%). The SUHI strengthens the relationships of BMI to weekly frequency (r = -0.68; t = -9.4; p<0.001) and session duration (r = -0.66; t = -2.8; p<0.001) for the whole group by improving the explanatory coefficient in ~25% (R2Adj = 0.61 to R2Adj = 0.85). The SUHI indicated that the urban environment is able to promote healthy life habits by diminishing the ""obesogenic"" features of the city when physical structures are planned to facilitate PA, whatever the gender and age group."
https://openalex.org/W3010801045,"The red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) is an endangered species listed by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) HARRIS J (2013). The largest population of this species is distributed mainly in China and Russia, which is called continental population SU L (2012)-Curt D (1996). This population is migratory, which migrates from its breeding range located in Northeast China and Southern Russia, to the wintering range in the south of China to spend the winter every year. The breeding range of this species is critical for red-crowned crane to survive and maintain its population. Previous studies showed the negative effects of habitat loss and degradation on the breeding area of red-crowned crane Ma Z (1998), Claire M (2019). Climate change may also threat the survival of this endangered species. Previous studies investigated the impacts of climate change on the breeding range or wintering range in China Wu (2012), [1]. However, no study was conducted to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the whole breeding range of this species. Here, we used bioclimatic niche modeling to predict the potential breeding range of red-crowned crane under current climate conditions and project onto future climate change scenarios. Our results show that the breeding range of the continental population of red-crowned crane will shift northward over this century and lose almost all of its current actual breeding range. The climate change will also change the country owning the largest portion of breeding range from China to Russia, suggesting that Russia should take more responsibility to preserve this endangered species in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3011118149,"The relationship between social choice aggregation rules and non-parametric statistical tests has been established for several cases. An outstanding, general question at this intersection is whether there exists a non-parametric test that is consistent upon aggregation of data sets (not subject to Yule-Simpson Aggregation Paradox reversals for any ordinal data). Inconsistency has been shown for several non-parametric tests, where the property bears fundamentally upon robustness (ambiguity) of non-parametric test (social choice) results. Using the binomial(n, p = 0.5) random variable CDF, we prove that aggregation of r(≥2) constituent data sets-each rendering a qualitatively-equivalent sign test for matched pairs result-reinforces and strengthens constituent results (sign test consistency). Further, we prove that magnitude of sign test consistency strengthens in significance-level of constituent results (strong-form consistency). We then find preliminary evidence that sign test consistency is preserved for a generalized form of aggregation. Application data illustrate (in)consistency in non-parametric settings, and links with information aggregation mechanisms (as well as paradoxes thereof) are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3011479047,"The environmental DNA (eDNA) method is being increasingly applied in various environments. Although eDNA undergoes rapid degradation in aqueous environments, it has been detected in streams up to 10 km downstream from its source. As environmental bacteria can uptake free DNA, transfer their genetic traits, and amplify, there is a potential risk that they, rather than a target aquatic species, could become a source of measured eDNA. This study examined whether bacteria with incorporated fish DNA could be such a source by investigating the detectability of fish DNA generated by bacteria inhabiting river water and riverbed sediment. We attempted to detect common carp (Cyprinus carpio) eDNA in stream water and sediment samples and the DNA of common carp produced by bacterial colonies (Escherichia coli, total coliform, and heterotrophic bacteria) cultured from the samples. The eDNA was detected in the environmental samples but the carp DNA from the targeted bacteria was rarely detected in both water and riverbed sediment samples. Our results suggest that the risk of bacterium-induced false positive detection for fish eDNA is negligible."
https://openalex.org/W3012544429,"In glaucoma, depression and disturbed sleep has been associated with degeneration of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, that mediate non-image forming effects of light such as regulation of circadian rhythm, alertness and mood. In this study we assessed associations between seasonal mood and behavior variation and retinal ganglion cell damage in outpatients with glaucoma.The seasonal pattern assessment questionnaire was administered to outpatients with glaucoma. Data on visual field defects identified by autoperimetry and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness visualized by ocular coherence tomography were collected from patient charts. The correlations between seasonality and retinal damage were tested and the adjusted effects of retinal function on seasonality were evaluated in a linear regression model.In total, 113 persons completed the questionnaire. Of these, 4% fulfilled the criteria for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and 8% for subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder (sSAD). Mean global seasonal score was 4.3. There were no significant correlations between seasonality and either visual field or retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. In the adjusted analysis there were trends toward differential effects of visual field on seasonality in subgroups with different sex and type of glaucoma.There were no strong associations between seasonality and visual field or retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Sex, age and glaucoma subtype may modify light effects on complex regulatory systems."
