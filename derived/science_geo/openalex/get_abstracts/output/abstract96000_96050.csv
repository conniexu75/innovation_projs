https://openalex.org/W1543283875,"Human platelets secrete a factor that stimulates cultured human cells to initiate DNA synthesis and to divide. This human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been purified congruent to 100,000-fold into two equally active homogeneous fractions, PDGF I (Mr congruent to 31,000) and PDGF II (Mr congruent to 28,000). The amino acid compositions of each are similar, highly basic, and show 18 half-cystine residues. Both PDGF I and II are glycoproteins, but differ in their carbohydrate compositions. The data suggest that PDGF II may be a proteolytic cleavage product of PDGF I but do not rule out that the proteins may be separate but very similar gene products. Purified PDGF is active in stimulating DNA synthesis at 0.2 ng/ml."
https://openalex.org/W1605149237,"Rat liver cytoplasm (postnuclear supernatant) has a low aerobic glycolytic rate in the presence of added glucose, ATP, ADP, Pi, and NAD+, whereas cytoplasm from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells exhibit a high aerobic glycolytic rate which is typical of rapidly proliferating tumor cells. Tumor mitochondria, unlike liver mitochondria, contain bound hexokinase which constitutes about 70% of the total cellular hexokinase activity. The high aerobic glycolytic rate of Ehrlich tumor cytoplasm is reduced markedly if the mitochondria are removed and can be restored almost completely upon addition of the hexokinase-containing tumor mitochondria to tumor cytosol (postmitochondrial supernatant). Addition of tumor mitochondria to liver cytosol can enhance its glycolytic rate to levels approaching those of tumor cytoplasm, whereas added liver mitochondria are without effect on the already low glycolytic rate of liver cytosol. Addition of tumor mitochondria to tumor cytosol increases its glycolytic rate to the level of tumor cytoplasm, as mentioned above, but liver mitochondria added to tumor cytosol actually depress its glycolytic rate to the level of liver cytosol. The stimulatory effect of tumor mitochondria on liver cytosol can be ascribed to its associated hexokinase activity since hexokinase specifically removed from mitochondria of tumor cells can also enhance the glycolytic rate of liver cytosol. The depressing effect of added liver mitochondria on tumor cytosol glycolysis suggests that liver mitochondria can compete more effectively than tumor mitochondria for a common intermediate and/or cofactor. Examination of 12 different tumor cell lines revealed that only those which reached maximum size in 1 month or less, and which have elevated glycolytic activities, had detectable mitochondrially associated hexokinase activity. The studies reported here describe resolution and reconstitution of tumor cytoplasm, supplementation of cytosol with intact mitochondria or mitochondrial hexokinase, and a survey of mitochondrial hexokinase content in various tumors, and provide strong evidence for the view (Bustamante, E., and Pedersen, P. L. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 3735-3739) that a form of hexokinase with a propensity for mitochondrial binding plays a key role in the high aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1544745708,"Five complexes consisting of one acidic and one basic subunit that were linked via disulfide bonds were purified from unreduced S-alkylated glycinin. The acidic and basic subunits were identified unambiguously using NH2-terminal sequence analysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-electrophoresis, and analytical isoelectric focusing. The subunit pairings are A1aB2, A1bB1b, A2B1a, A3B4, and F2(2)B3. Polypeptide A4 was not linked to a corresponding basic subunit via a disulfide bond. The study shows that pairing between subunits is nonrandom, which is consistent with evidence that glycinin is synthesized as a Mr = 60,000 precursor that undergoes post-translational modification to form the individual linked subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1506971774,"Abstract Removal of the tightly bound Ca2+ ion from bovine alpha-lactalbumin (Hiraoka et al. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 95, 1098-1104) produces a pronounced conformational change, as indicated by fluorescence and absorbance changes. These changes closely resemble the changes that occur on acid denaturation of the protein. The binding of ions to apo-alpha-lactalbumin at pH 7.4 has been examined by monitoring fluorescence changes and by direct binding measurements with 45CaCl2. The results indicate the presence of two Ca2+ binding sites on apo-bovine alpha-lactalbumin, a stronger binding site (Ka of 2.7 X 10(6) M-1) and a weaker site (Ka of 3.1 X 10(4) M-1); the fluorescence changes on Ca2+ rebinding correlate with saturation of the stronger site. Mn2+ can also bind to restore a native structure but with a lower affinity(Ka of 3.5 X 10(5) M-1). Zn2+ and Co2+ do not produce this change, but Zn2+ (1 mM) greatly inhibits the binding of 45Ca2+ in the direct binding assay and produces a time-dependent displacement of Ca2+ from the protein to an apo-protein-like conformation. Co2+ does not produce these effects. Studies with metal-depleted galactosyltransferase activated with Zn2+ or Co2+ and apo-alpha-lactalbumin or Ca2+-saturated alpha-lactalbumin show that the Ca2+, Zn2+, and apo-alpha-lactalbumin are all able to bind with galactosyltransferase to produce an active lactose synthase complex."

https://openalex.org/W1569508388,"The complete amino acid sequence of the gamma-subunit of mouse submaxillary gland 7 S nerve growth factor has been determined from analyses of the peptides generated by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, and chymotrypsin from the naturally occurring fragments. All peptides were sequenced automatically in a spinning-cup sequenator using Polybrene to minimize extractive losses by the solvents employed thoughout the degradation cycles. The gamma-subunit, a serine protease with arginine specificity, contains 233 amino acid residues and shares sequence homology with other proteases of this family. The five disulfide bonds of the gamma-subunit are a subset of the six disulfides present in bovine trypsin, as judged by the location of the half-cystine residues in the primary structure. An N-linked carbohydrate side chain is attached to Asn-78 in at least a majority of tee gamma-molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1574291681,"We have obtained the first deuterium NMR spectra of individual types of aromatic amino acids in a defined membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin, in the photosynthetic purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium R1. Isotopic labeling and high field (8.5 Tesla) operation permitted relatively rapid data acquisition at a variety of temperatures. At the temperature of growth (37 degrees C), we find that all 7 tryptophan residues are rigid on the time scale of the NMR experiment (approximately 10(-5) s), except for likely librational motions of approximately 10 degrees amplitude. By contrast, nearly all (9 +/- 2) of the 11 tyrosines and (13 +/- 2) 13 phenylalanines undergo rapid (greater than 10(5) s-1) 2-fold rotational flips about C gamma-C zeta, causing formation of line shapes dominated by effectively axially asymmetric (asymmetry parameter eta = 0.66) deuteron electric field gradient tensors. On cooling the phenylalanine- and tyrosine-labeled samples to approximately -30 degrees C, all such motions are frozen out, i.e. occur at rates less than 10(4) s-1, and axially symmetric (eta approximately 0.05) line shapes are observed. At T greater than 91 degrees C, phenylalanine-, tyrosine-, and tryptophan-labeled membrane spectra undergo dramatic narrowing to an isotropic line of approximately 4-9 kHz width. This transition is a reflection of the loss of tertiary structure in the membrane protein with resultant fast unrestricted motion of these aromatic side chains, and is only partly reversible. These results, in conjunction with those obtained using [gamma-2H6]valine-labeled bacteriorhodopsin (Kinsey, R. A., Kintanar, A., Tsai, M-D., Smith, R. L., Janes, N., and Oldfield, E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem., 256, 4146-4149) indicate the rather rigid nature of amino acid side chains in the H. halobium purple membrane, the principal fast lage amplitude motions being methyl group rotation and discontinuous benzene ring flipping."

https://openalex.org/W1586590794,"Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) inhibits the reduction of oxidized 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPyAD+) by NADPH catalyzed by purified and bovine heart submitochondrial particle transhydrogenase. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the modification of 1 residue results in complete inactivation. Both transhydrogenase preparations were labeled with [14C]DCCD. Labeling of the purified enzyme was time-dependent and paralleled the extent of inhibition. The incorporation of approximately 1 mol of [14C]DCCD/monomer resulted in complete inactivation of the enzyme. At longer preincubation times or at higher DCCD concentrations, more than 1 mol of DCCD reacted and cross-linked dimers of transhydrogenase were formed. The effect of substrates on DCCD inactivation was investigated. AcPyAD+ provided no protection, and NADH gave partial protection in submitochondrial particles, but not of the purified enzyme. NADPH and NADP+ stimulated inhibition. These results indicate that DCCD modification occurs outside the active site. In experiments with transhydrogenase reconstituted into K+-loaded phosphatidylcholine liposomes, DCCD inhibited the rate of H+ uptake into the vesicles to a significantly greater extent than transhydrogenation. The incorporation of approximately 1 mol of DCCD/mol of transhydrogenase monomer completely inhibited H+ translocation, whereas complete inactivation of hydride ion transfer accompanied the incorporation of approximately 2 mol of DCCD. These results indicate that DCCD modified transhydrogenase outside the active site, possibly in a putative H+-binding domain that functions to translocate protons across the membrane by a pump rather than by a loop mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1577473555,"Incubation of mouse T lymphoma (S-49) cells with the inosinate dehydrogenase inhibitor mycophenolic acid produced a depletion of both GTP and dGTP, and resulted in growth inhibition, partial reduction in RNA synthesis, and drastic inhibition of DNA synthesis. Similar results suggested to others that the depletion of dGTP is primarily responsible for toxicity. However, guanosine was as effective as deoxyguanosine at preventing mycophenolic acid toxicity although deoxyguanosine was more effective at elevating dGTP levels. Moreover, in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient mutants of S-49 (6MPR-3-3) deoxyguanosine was unable to prevent mycophenolic acid toxicity or to re-establish normal DNA synthesis, although it returned cellular dGTP but not GTP levels to normal. No other nucleotide levels changed in a way which could account for the toxicity. Incubation of cells with a combination of deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine produced a selective depletion of dGTP to levels similar to that produced by mycophenolic acid, but did not affect cell growth. Studies with cells synchronized by centrifugal elutriation show that the toxicity of mycophenolic acid is specific to the S-phase of the cell cycle. Addition of actinomycin D at a concentration that inhibited RNA synthesis increased the availability of GTP and re-established normal DNA synthesis in mycophenolic acid-treated S-49 cells. These results suggest that the depletion of GTP rather than that of dGTP produces toxic effects in S-49 cells and that GTP is required for DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1531357502,"Subsynaptic membrane domains from Torpedo californica electroplax contain nicotinic cholinergic receptor molecules at densities as high as 20,000 micrometers-2. Intense homogenization of the electroplax releases membrane fragments enriched in nicotinic receptor from basal lamina and other synaptic cleft and presynaptic elements. Ideally, preparations of membrane fragments, highly enriched in nicotinic receptor, should approach 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin-specific binding activities near the levels observed after receptor dispersal in detergents and subsequent affinity chromatography. We report the application of affinity partitioning, combined with multiple extraction techniques, to yield preparations of virtually homogeneous membranes enriched in nicotinic receptor alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits as well as the 43,000-dalton peripheral protein subunit. The countercurrent distribution technique serves to resolve three populations of receptor-containing membranes. One fraction is refractory to affinity partitioning and may represent aggregates of receptor-rich membranes with fragments derived from nonsynaptic membranes. The second and third fractions contain membrane fragments derived from the subsynaptic membrane and are highly enriched in nicotinic receptor (5.1 to 7.8 nmol of alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites/mg of protein). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of all three fractions indicates that alpha, beta, and gamma subunits are present in stable stoichiometric ratios, while the 43,000-dalton peripheral protein content varies by 33% between the fractions. However, removal of 90% of the 43,000-dalton component by mild alkali treatment does not result in conversion of one fraction into the other. The combination of affinity partitioning and counter-current distribution techniques utilized in this study should prove useful in the resolution of a variety of subcellular particles that contain specific binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W1527015104,"The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular weights of the mature subunit of embryonic chick liver delta-aminolevulinate synthase and of its putative precursor fom. Although an active enzyme with a subunit molecular weight of 51,000 could be purified from the livers of porphyric embryos, it was determined by immunoreplicate electrophoresis analyses of sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized liver homogenates and mitochondria from porphyric embryos that the actual molecular weight of the enzyme's subunit was 65,000 +/- 2,000. These results suggested that the usual procedure for purifying delta-aminolevulinate synthase from chick embryo yielded a partially degraded enzyme. When the products of cell-free translations of mRNA extracted from livers of porphyric embryos were analyzed, they contained a polypeptide of 75,000 +/- 400 daltons which specifically cross-reacted with anti-delta-aminolevulinate synthase. It is concluded that subunit of embryonic chick liver delta-aminolevulinate synthase present in mitochondria has a molecular weight of 65,000 and appears to be synthesized as a precursor of 75,000 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1513137004,"At concentrations of microtubule-associated proteins MAP2 and tau inducing maximal microtubule formation, MAP2 promotes higher rates and higher levels of microtubule nucleation that tau. Microtubules polymerized to steady state by tau show a 2-fold higher rate of tubulin loss compared to microtubules polymerized by MAP2. Microtubules polymerized in the presence of both MAP2 and tau contain lower levels of MAP2 (0.06 mol/mol of tubulin) and tau (0.07 mol/mol of tubulin) than microtubules polymerized in the exclusive presence of MAP2 (0.2 mol/mol of tubulin) or tau (0.25 mol/mol of tubulin). Addition of tau to microtubules polymerized by MAP2 results in incorporation of tau into microtubules (0.047 mol/mol of tubulin) and loss of MAP2 (0.1 mol/mol of tubulin). Similarly, incubation of microtubules polymerized by tau in the presence of MAP2 results in microtubule incorporation of MAP2 (0.1 mol/mol of tubulin) and loss of tau (0.08 mol/mol of tubulin). Microtubules and their ribbon precursor contain comparable levels of MAP2. Cross-sectional views of microtubules show no difference in the number of protofilaments (13 to 15) forming the MAP2 and tau microtubules. Fingerprints of cysteine-labeled tryptic peptides of two tau polypeptides (tau 4 and tau 6) are very similar and differ totally from similar fingerprints of MAP2."
https://openalex.org/W1620274414,"The regulation of the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex was investigated in the isolated, perfused rat liver. The metabolic flux through the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase was monitored by measuring the production of 14CO2 from infused 1-14C-labeled branched chain alpha-keto acid substrates. The rate of decarboxylation of alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate exceeded that of alpha-keto[1-14C]isovalerate at all concentrations of the substrates infused. Coinfusion of either alpha-ketoisovalerate or alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate inhibited the rate of alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate decarboxylation. The rate of alpha-keto[1-14C]isovalerate decarboxylation ws enhanced during coinfusion of L(--)carnitine, while alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate decarboxylation was unaffected. The presence of pyruvate in the perfusion medium resulted in an inhibition of the flux through the branched chain complex with either alpha-ketoisocaproate or alpha-ketoisovalerate as the substrate. DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate infusion inhibited alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate decarboxylation by 18% but resulted in nearly a 100% stimulation of alpha-keto[1-14C]isovalerate decarboxylation. The evidence presented indicates that (alpha) the metabolic flux through the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex can be monitored effectively in a continuous fashion in the perfused liver by following the release of 14CO2 from infused 1-14C-labeled substrates and (b) the changes observed in the metabolic flux through the branched chain complex during coinfusion of alternative substrates and other compounds may be entirely different depending upon which branched chain alpha-keto acid substrate is utilized to monitor this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1599797190,"Biochemical analyses following subcellular fractionation of rat liver indicated that the outer mitochondrial membrane contains a number of membrane-specific proteins of which a 35-kilodalton species (OMM-35) is a prominent component. These results were confirmed and extended by electron microscope immunocytochemical tests based on the protein A-gold technique. OMM-35 is tightly bound to the outer mitochondrial membrane, e.g. it was not released by sonication in the presence of 1.5 M KCl and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. However, it did not react with the photoaffinity probe azidopyrene, which indicates that OM-35 is located peripherally on the membrane rather than buried deep in the lipid bilayer as an intrinsic protein. Since low levels of detergent were required for OMM-35 in intact mitochondria to react with exogenous antibodies, OMM-35 is probably located on the side of the outer membrane which faces the interior of the organelle. When rat liver mRNA was translated in a messenger-dependent cell-free system derived from rabbit reticulocytes, antiserum against OMM-35 precipitated a single polypeptide product which migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with molecular weight characteristics of a protein slightly larger (by Mr = 500) than OMM-35 obtained from isolated outer mitochondrial membrane. The mRNA coding for OMM-35 was recovered exclusively from membrane-free polysomes. Thus, the route followed for synthesis and subsequent insertion of OMM-35 into the outer membrane of mitochondria is the post-translational pathway which has been previously described for proteins destined for the interior compartments of this organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1525898132,"The nature of phospholipid requirement and lipid-protein interactions for the multiple functional forms of monoamine oxidase was investigated by rebinding the purified phospholipid to a lipid-depleted brain mitochondrial preparation. It was found that phosphatidylinositol uniquely stimulated the monoamine oxidase A activity to 80% over that in the original intact mitochondria. Other negatively charged phospholipids, although not as potent, could fully or partially reactivate the A or the B activity. Phosphatidylserine was relatively more effective in restoring the B activity. Phosphatidylcholine, a zwitterionic phospholipid, reconstituted 70% of the A activity but did not influence the B. More importantly, efficiency-gradient analyses indicated a distinct nature in the mechanism of lipid-protein interactions for the negatively charged and the zwitterionic phospholipids. The potency of the negatively charged phospholipid decreased sharply with increasing lipid molecules. No further stimulation could be detected when the lipid to protein ratio reached about 30 molecules of the negatively charged phospholipid for 100,000 daltons of membrane protein. The negatively charged phospholipid appeared to bind directly to the monoamine oxidase protein boundary with a high affinity. Phosphatidylcholine might reassociate as the membrane fluid bilayer, which in turn modulated the monoamine oxidase A activity."
https://openalex.org/W1514785297,"The polypeptide structure of terminal transferase in crude extracts of thymus or cultured cells was examined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, electrophoretic transfer of separated peptides to nitrocellulose, specific labeling with rabbit anti-calf thymus terminal transferase, and visualization with an immunoperoxidase reaction. The major form of terminal transferase detected in crude extracts or enzyme fractions after phosphocellulose chromatography is a single 58,000- to 60,000-dalton peptide for calf thymus, rat thymus, mouse thymus, chicken thymus, cat thymus, human lymphoblastoid cells, and mouse lymphoblastoid cells. Since the anti-calf thymus terminal transferase antibody was prepared against a homogeneous calf thymus enzyme consisting of two polypeptide chains in a hydrodynamic structure of Mr = 32,000, these results suggest that the homogeneous calf thymus enzyme preparation is a proteolytically degraded form of the 58,000-dalton peptide. Terminal transferase peptides from human, bovine, rat, chicken, cat, and mouse are immunologically related and have similar conserved polypeptide structure."
https://openalex.org/W1592319877,"Both diastereoisomers, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 26-tetrol (25S isomer) and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 27-tetrol (25R isomer), were chemically synthesized, and the method to separate these epimers by thin layer chromatography was established. Applying this method, the stereospecificity of cholestanetriol 26-monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.15) was studied as follows. 5 beta-[3H]Cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol was incubated with the reconstituted system of rat liver mitochondria, which consisted of the partially purified cytochrome P-450, bovine NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase, bovine adrenodoxin, and NADPH. The product was identified as 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 27-tetrol (25R isomer). This clearly demonstrates that the partially purified cytochrome P-450 of rat liver mitochondria catalyzes hydroxylation of the 27-methyl group (25-pro-(S) methyl group) of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol."

Ca2+ and K+ ions displayed similar effects at much higher concentrations. These stimulatory effects were more significant at lower temperatures. Regardless of the presence of these activators, the maximal binding of cholesterol was observed between 20 and 30 mol % in dioleoylglycerophosphocholine liposomes. The examination of phospholipid fatty acyl groups on the cholesterol binding revealed that the initial binding rates decreased in the following order: (18c:2) greater than (18c:1) greater than (18c:3) greater than 18t:1) greater than (18c:1, 18:0) in the presence and absence of the lysine polypeptide. When 7 alpha-, 7 beta-, and 25-hydroxycholesterol were used as ligands, the stimulatory effect of the lysine polypeptide was not seen, indicating the specificity for cholesterol. When the cholesterol side chain cleavage activity was determined by the reconstituted system consisting of adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin, and P-450scc, the stimulatory effects by poly(L-lysine) were observed. Polyglycine, poly(L-glutamic acid), putrescine, spermidine, spermine, and L-lysine had no effect, while poly(D-lysine) and poly(L-arginine) had activities much less than the lysine polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1523268419,"A set of high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins makes up 25% by weight of the acid-soluble chromatin proteins in the mature sperm of the winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus). When these proteins first appear in testis cell nuclei in late October they are extensively phosphorylated, with an average phosphate content of 0.15 mg/mg of protein. As a result of this modification the proteins precipitate at pH 7.0. Their serine residues show enhanced susceptibility to beta-elimination, and partial acid hydrolysis of the proteins releases O-phosphoserine. The high serine content of these proteins (22 mol %) is sufficient to accommodate all of the bound phosphate as O-phosphoserine. At this point in spermatogenesis almost half of the histones H2A and H4 are also phosphorylated. As spermatogenesis proceeds there is a wave of dephosphorylation in which phospo-H2A and phospho-H4 disappear and the bulk of the phosphate is removed from the high molecular weight proteins T and H6 are lost. By January the high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins are completely dephosphorylated and differential salt extraction of the sperm chromatin shows that these proteins are more tightly bound than H1 and are eluted with the nucleosomal core histones at a salt concentration of greater 1 M."
https://openalex.org/W1505861053,"Argininosuccinase from normal human liver was purified and characterized. The properties of this enzyme were compared to those of argininosuccinase from bovine liver. The molecular weight of the native human liver enzyme is 200,000 as determined by gel filtration. Polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of the enzyme, dissociated by sodium dodecyl sulfate, indicated that it exists as a tetramer of identical or similar subunits of 50,000 daltons. No evidence of multiple species was found during the purification or subsequent characterization. The enzyme was inactivated in cold and reactivated by thermal incubation. These properties were similar to those observed for bovine liver enzyme. However, unlike bovine liver argininosuccinase, human liver enzyme exhibited normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics both in phosphate and Tris buffers, and the apparent Michaelis constant for L-argininosuccinate ws 0.1 mM.

https://openalex.org/W1503970148,"The rate of CO binding to myoglobin increases 4-fold, from 5 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 to 2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, in going from 0 to 80% glycerol in phosphate buffer at pH 7, 20 degrees C. Under the same conditions, the rate of CO binding to protoheme decreases monotonically from about 1 X 10(8) M-1 s-1 to 2 X 10(7) M-1 s-1. The kinetic behavior of protoheme at neutral pH is that expected for a diffusion-controlled reaction. Increasing solvent viscosity causes a decrease in the observed second order rate constant. In contrast, the behavior of the myoglobin indicates quite clearly that internal, nondiffusive processes are limiting the speed of the reaction. The rate enhancement is due to an increase in the standard chemical potential of the ligand molecule as the polyalcohol concentration is increased. Both types of behavior are observed for ligand binding to protoheme in 0.1 N NaOH; first an increase and then a decrease in rate is observed as the concentration of glycerol is increased. At low glycerol concentrations, the reaction rate is limited by a first order process. At high concentrations, the rate becomes diffusion-controlled and exhibits a dependence on the reciprocal of the solvent viscosity. The data for all these conditions have been analyzed empirically in terms of a single free energy barrier and more specifically in terms of a consecutive reaction scheme."

https://openalex.org/W1601649446,"Allylisopropylacetamide is shown to be a suicide substrate for the phenobarbital-inducible cytochromes P-450. In phenobarbital-induced rat liver microsomes about 70% of the cytochrome P-450-mediated N,N-dimethylaniline N-demethylase activity is sensitive to allylisopropylacetamide inactivation; the residual 30% of the N-demethylase activity is incapable of allylisopropylacetamide turnover and insensitive to allylisopropylacetamide inactivation. The partition number for inactivation of the susceptible population of cytochrome P-450 indicates turnover of 201 molecules of allylisopropylacetamide per molecule of P-450 inactivated. A purified phenobarbital-induced isozyme of cytochrome P-450, when reconstituted with purified rat liver cytochrome P-450 reductase, is also inactivated by allylisopropylacetamide in a suicide fashion with a corrected partition ratio of 184 turnovers of allylisopropylacetamide per inactivation event. This partition number is corrected for the competing O2-dependent autoinactivation of cytochrome P-450 which we have previously shown to occur with the purified isozyme (Loosemore, M., Light, D. R., and W#alsh, C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9017-9020). The 201 product molecules of cytochrome P-450-mediated turnover of allylisopropylacetamide in either the microsomal or purified enzyme system are probably the epoxide, are reactive toward alkylation of cellular nucleophiles, and covalently modify protein and exogenous calf thymus DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1577755435,"The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cultured cell line accumulates the n-9 class of eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 n-9) after becoming confluent when the medium contains 10% fetal bovine serum. Accumulation of 20:3 n-9 also occurred in confluent, nondifferentiating 3T3 cells but not in eight other cultured cell lines that were tested. Radioisotope experiments indicate that confluent 3T3-L1 cells synthesized 20:3 n-9 from [1-14C]oleic acid. 20:3 n-9 comprised 9.8% of the cell phospholipid fatty acids, and its accumulation was associated with a 40% reduction in the phospholipid arachidonic acid content. The highest percentage of 20:3 n-9 was present in the ethanolamine and inositol glycerophospholipid fractions. Eicosatrienoic acid also accumulated in 3T3-L1 cells that were treated with dexamethasone, methylisobutylxanthine, and insulin to achieve adipocyte morphology. Supplementation of the culture medium with 0.03 mumol/ml of either linoleic or arachidonic acid prevented 20:3 n-9 accumulation. Partial reversal of the 20:3 n-9 accumulation occurred when confluent cells were either replated at a low density to initiate logarithmic growth or supplemented with 0.03 mumol/ml of arachidonic acid. The accumulation of 20:3 n-9, a polyunsaturate that ordinarily is found only in essential fatty acid deficiency, may be an important variable in studies involving 3T3-L1 and 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591068148,"Partially purified immunoreactive species extracted from bovine posterior pituitary have been labeled with 125I and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with antineurophysin antibodies followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under denaturing, but nonreducing conditions, a band of Mr = 80,000 was observed. This band corresponded to immunoreactive species detected by radioimmunoassay after chromatography of unlabeled material on a Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration column run in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. Under nondenaturing conditions, this species behaved like molecules with an apparent Mr of 140,000 to 160,000. Electrophoretic analysis of the immunoprecipitated material showed that it contained an immunoreactive, single polypeptide chain of Mr = 80,000. Another immunoreactive species of similar molecular weight was also detected, apparently derived from the first one by peptide bond cleavage yielding two fragments of Mr = 68,000 and 10,000, respectively, held together by disulfide bridges. The Mr = 68,000 fragment had lost immunoprecipitability, although its peptide map was largely homologous to that or Mr = 80,000 polypeptide. The 10,000 piece was shown by radioimmunoassay and peptide analysis to be homologous to neurophysin."

https://openalex.org/W1604536347,"The interactions of rat muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase purified from young and old animals with NADH and with the fluorescent analogue nicotinamide 1,N6-ethenoadenine dinucleotide were investigated. While the spectra of the circular polarization of fluorescence emitted by the ethenoadenine derivative when bound to the two enzyme preparations were identical large differences were revealed between the corresponding spectra in the case of NADH. From these results it was concluded that age-related modifications occur in the nicotinamide binding sites, but not in the adenine binding sites of this enzyme. The circular polarization of fluorescence of the ethenoadenine derivative was found to depend on the stoichiometry of its complexes with the enzyme while the spectra obtained for NADH were independent of the degree of saturation of the coenzyme binding sites. These observations demonstrate that progressive structural changes occur at the adenine site as a function of coenzyme saturation. These changes may be responsible for the strong negative cooperative in coenzyme binding. The finding that only the nicotinamide binding sites are affected by age explains our previous observation that while the affinity toward coenzyme binding which depends on both adenine and nicotinamide moieties is reduced upon aging the negative cooperativity of binding is not significantly changed, since this latter property depends on the state of the adenine site only."
https://openalex.org/W1598614498,"Taurodeoxycholate 7 alpha-monooxygenase was purified from rat liver microsomes of phenobarbital-treated rats. The purification was carried out by solubilization of microsomes by cholate, fractionation with polyethylene glycol, affinity chromatography, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The purified preparation gave a single major band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contained 13.5 nmol of cytochrome P-450/mg of protein, which corresponded to 6.8-fold purification from microsomes on the basis of specific heme content. The specific activity of the enzyme expressed by the enzyme activity per mg of enzyme protein was increased 72-fold from microsomes. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 54,000 from calibrated polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme activity-pH curve gave a broad peak between pH 7.0 and 7.5. The Michaelis constant for taurodeoxycholate of the enzyme was 33 microM. Absorption spectra of the oxidized form of the enzyme showed a Soret band at 518 nm, typical of the low spin state of cytochrome P-450 and alpha and beta band at 571 and 534 nm, respectively. The CO-difference spectrum of the reduced enzyme showed a band at 450 nm characteristic of cytochrome P-450. Taurodeoxycholate 7 alpha-monooxygenase was reconstituted from the purified enzyme, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, dilauroylglyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine, and NADPH. The purified enzyme was free from steroid 12 alpha-hydroxylase, 25-hydroxylase, and 26-hydroxylase activities. The enzyme activity was seriously inhibited by nonionic detergents, but ot by aminoglutethimide or by metapyrone."

https://openalex.org/W2134334223,"Peanut agglutinin (PNA) has been shown to be insoluble at low temperatures. This cryoinsolubility has been studied by means of absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and analytical ultracentrifugation. It was found to be dependent on pH, temperature, and protein concentration. No effects on dimer-tetramer equilibrium could be determined nor any conformational changes provoked by exposure of the PNA preparation to low temperatures. The dimer half-molecule apparently does not precipitate. The cryoinsolubility was partially reversible and totally inhibited in the presence of galactosides, the specific ligands of PNA. Their efficacy as inhibitors of cryoinsolubility was related to their affinity for the lectin. The effects of neutral salts and particularly inhibition of the insolubility by strongly chaotropic salts indicate that charge-charge interactions are of little importance and that hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals interactions are most probably responsible for the formation of the cryoprecipitate."

https://openalex.org/W1574816543,"The electrophoresis of a number of proteins was studied in poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) gels containing entrapped linear copolymers of N,N-dimethylacrylamide with N-alkyl-substituted acrylamides. The mobility of soybean trypsin inhibitor, carbonic anhydrase, ovalbumin, and myoglobin were unaffected by the hydrophobic residues in the gel. The mobilities of bovine serum albumin and beta-lactoglobulin A were sharply reduced, with the effect increasing as the alkyl side chain on the acrylamide residue was extended from dodecyl to octadecyl. The effect of the octadecyl ligand could be further increased by interposing a spacer between it and the polymer chain backbone. The retardation of the mobilities was used to obtain protein association constants with the alkyl residues. Interaction with the hydrophobic ligand produced a separation of beta-lactoglobin A into two fractions."

https://openalex.org/W1583810029,"Haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex has been cross-linked using the bifunctional reagent 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that specific cross-linking was obtained between haptoglobin H chain and a hemoglobin chain. The cross-linked complex was reduced and denatured, and the cross-linked subunits were separated from the unreacted haptoglobin and hemoglobin chains by molecular sieve chromatography. Peptide analysis on the purified cross-linked subunits showed that haptoglobin H chain was cross-linked to hemoglobin beta chain only. This result indicates that the H and beta chains are in close proximity in the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex."
https://openalex.org/W1503868864,"The changes in absorption spectra between 450 and 650 nm during the reduction of methemoglobin A, (alpha 2+ beta 3+)2, and (alpha 3+ beta 2+)2 valency hybrids by the system including ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP reductase were studied under anaerobic conditions. During the reduction of methemoglobin A, the isosbestic points gradually shifted to different positions. These shifts were clearly observed in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, i.e. the isosbestic points were initially observed at 525 and 603 nm, and these shifted to 529 and 599 nm, respectively, suggesting that the intermediate hemoglobins are produced during the process of the reaction. This was confirmed by the isoelectric focusing electrophoresis of the partially reduced methemoglobin solutions with ferredoxin-NADP reductase system on Ampholine-polyacrylamide gel plate. On the other hand, the absorption spectra of alpha 2+ beta 3+)2 and (alpha 3+ beta 2+)2 changed with excellent isosbestic points during th reductive reaction by ferredoxin-NADP reductase system, i.e. (alpha 2+ beta 3+)2 at 526 and 601 nm and (alpha 3+ beta 2+)2 at 529 and 599 nm. From these results, the mechanism of methemoglobin reduction by ferredoxin-NADP reductase system was suggested. 1) There are two pathways for the reduction of methemoglobin including (formula, see text). 2) The beta chains of methemoglobin may be more susceptible to the reduction than the alpha chains in tetrameric methemoglobin, and thereby the (alpha 3+ beta 2+)2 valency hybrid accumulated at the halfway point of the reaction. 3) The shift in isosbestic points of methemoglobin reduction (525 nm leads to 529 nm, 603 nm leads to 599 nm) is due to the accumulation of (alpha 3+ beta 2+)2, whose isosbestic points during the reduction by the ferredoxin-NADP reductase systems were 529 and 599 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1504094863,"The solid state conformational analysis of Ac-D-Ala-D-Ala-OH.H2O, carried out by infrared absorption and X-ray diffraction, has indicated that the molecules are not extended in a regular beta conformation, but rather that they are partially folded, the phi, psi torsional angles of the COOH-terminal residue in particular being in the region of the left-handed alpha helix of the Ramachandran map. The acetylamino and peptide groups ar found in the usual trans conformation, the latter, however, exhibiting a deviation from rigid planarity. Only intermolecular hydrogen bonds occur in the crystal state. The solution conformational analysis, performed by infrared absorption and CD, has revealed that the amount of intramolecular N--H ... O==C hydrogen-bonded folded forms, if any, should be extremely small, even in deuteriochloroform at high dilution. In water, solvated, unordered species largely predominate."
