https://openalex.org/W2046784147,"The arrangement of lipids and some proteins in the erythrocyte membrane has been discussed. The conclusions from this are listed here as a set of general guidelines for the structure of membranes of higher organisms: some of these rules may be wrong. But at this stage it seems useful to sharpen our thoughts in this way and thereby focus attention on various specific points. 1) The basis of a membrane is a lipid bilayer with (i) choline phospholipids and glycolipids in the external half and (ii) amino (and possibly some choline) phospholipids in the cytoplasmic half. There is effectively no lipid exchange across the bilayer (unless enzymatically catalyzed) (68). 2) Some proteins extend across the bilayer. Where this is so, they will in general have carbohydrate on their surface remote from the cytoplasm. This carbohydrate may prevent the protein diffusing out of the membrane into the cytoplasm; it acts as a lock on the protein. 3) Just as lipids do not flip-flop, proteins do not rotate across the membrane. Lateral motion or rotation of lipids and proteins in the plane of the bilayer may be expected. 4) Most membrane protein is associated with the inner, cytoplasmic, urface of the membrane. Proteins are not usually associated exclusively with the outer half of the lipid bilayer. 5) Membrane proteins are a special class of cytoplasmic proteins, not of secreted proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2004183780,Injections of 2-deoxyglucose into the hepatic-portal system of normal rabbits increased eating to a greater extent and with shorter latency than comparable injections of 2-deoxyglucose into the jugular vein or into the hepaticportal circulation of the vagotomized rabbit. These differences suggest the existence of vagally mediated peripheral glucoreceptors important in the initiation of food intake.
https://openalex.org/W2000411341,Human chorionic gonadotropin completely inhibits the response of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin. The effect is both reversible and noncytotoxic. These observations support the theory that the fetus is accepted because human chorionic gonadotropin represents trophoblastic surface antigen and blocks the action of maternal lymphocytes.
https://openalex.org/W2037147947,"Postmortem brain specimens from 18 schizophrenic patients and 12 normal controls were assayed for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme responsible for the final step in norepinephrine biosynthesis. There was a significant reduction in the DBH activity of the schizophrenic group in all brain regions examined. Enzyme deficits in hippocampus and diencephalon were somewhat larger than that in pons-medulla. Since various extraneous factors, such as non-specific deterioration, drug treatment, duration of hospitalization, cause of death, sex, and age could be ruled out, the deficits in DBH mnay be associated with the schizophrenic disease process. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that noradrenergic ""reward"" pathways are damaged in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W1567805507,"Abstract One cytochrome P-450 has been purified from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria to near homogeneity. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol and 20α-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone (side chain cleavage) and shows traces of 11β-hydroxylase activity. The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone occurs without demonstrable accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates, i.e. hydroxylated cholesterols. The kinetic constants for side chain cleavage are as follows: cholesterol: Km, 0.19 mm; and 20α-hydroxycholesterol: Km, 0.012 mm. The P-450 described here shows the following properties: molecular weight, 850,000; s20, w0, 22 x 10-13; partial specific volume, 0.765. The enzyme is isolated in a form which is approximately 50 % high spin and 50 % low spin; it contains eight heme groups per molecule and is stable in 50 % glycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1966122472,"The neural mechanisms involved in learning have always excited great interest, but such are the complexities which surround their study that their analysis seemed virtually impossible. In recent years, however, there has been a great increase in knowledge of the central nervous system (CNS), and many new techniques have become available for its study. These advances have generated an upsurge of research activity into the neural bases of learning, and the field has become one of the most exciting in biology."
https://openalex.org/W1970032219,"After the motor nerve to the rat soleus muscle was blocked reversibly by local anesthesia, individual muscle fibers became innervated by a transplanted motor nerve without losing their original innervation. Such cross-innervation of the denervated soleus muscle by the same foreign nerve was largely reduced by direct electrical stimulation of the muscle. The results demonstrate the importance of muscle activity for synapse formation by a foreign motor nerve."
https://openalex.org/W1570759257,"Abstract There are two distinct kinds of histone phosphorylation in continuously dividing HeLa S-3 cells. Histones f22a1 and f22b (or f22a2, or both) molecules incorporate [32P]orthophosphate throughout the cell cycle at fairly uniform rates which are proportional to the amounts of these polypeptides. These phosphorylations are neither coupled with DNA replication in S phase nor obviously related to increased RNA synthesis in G1 of the cell cycle. The function of this kind of histone phosphorylation is unknown. The second kind of phosphorylation begins in S phase and ultimately converts over 90 % of all histone f1 molecules into one of two principal phosphorylated forms by the end of G2 phase of the cell cycle. After mitosis histone f1 molecules are extensively dephosphorylated during G1 until DNA replication begins, at which time the phosphorylation cycle commences once again. This simultaneous phosphorylation of both old and newly synthesized histone f1 molecules is partially coupled with DNA replication and increases more than 10-fold in rate as the cells proceed from G1 into S phase. Continuous labeling, pulse-chase, and inhibitor experiments indicate that the phosphorylation of histone f1 polypeptides is neither correlated with gene activation (increases in RNA synthesis) nor does it appear to be related to histone transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The results of these experiments do suggest that the phosphorylation of histone f1 molecules may be related to the separation and condensation of sister chromatids prior to and during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1575333718,"Abstract A mouse myeloma tumor was used as a model system to study the biochemical steps involved in the incorporation of mannose into glycoproteins. This tumor, MOPC-46B, synthesizes a k-type immunoglobulin light chain (K-46) which is a glycoprotein with a single oligosaccharide side chain containing mannose as one of its constituent sugars. MOPC-46B microsomal preparations contain enzymes which transfer mannose from the sugar nucleotide, GDP-mannose, to endogenous lipid and protein acceptors. Formation of the mannolipid proceeds by the reversible transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to an endogenous phospholipid. The mannolipid was purified and characterized by chemical methods and mass spectrometry as a mannosyl-monophosphoryl-dihydropolyisoprenol, containing at least 18 isoprene units, one of which is saturated. The mannolipid was implicated as an intermediate in the in vitro mannosylation of endogenous protein acceptors by three kinds of experiments. (a) Incorporation of [14C]mannose into protein was observed after the initial substrate, GDP-mannose, had been destroyed by sugar nucleotide hydrolases associated with the microsomal preparations. The continued increase in radioactivity in the protein fraction occurred concomitantly with a loss of radioactivity from the mannolipid fraction. (b) Incorporation of [14C]mannose into both lipid and protein was inhibited by EDTA added at zero time. However, addition of EDTA after mannolipid synthesis had occurred resulted in cessation of mannolipid formation but continued incorporation of mannose into protein to an extent proportional to the amount of mannolipid originally formed. The increase in radioactivity in protein was again accompanied by a loss of radioactivity from the mannolipid. (c) When microsomes were pulsed briefly with GDP-[14C]mannose, which was then chased by a large excess of unlabeled GDP-mannose, incorporation of [14C]mannose into lipid ceased immediately with the chase, while incorporation into protein continued afterwards to an extent proportional to the amount of mannolipid formed prior to the chase. Evidence that the mannolipid could function as a donor of mannose residues to protein was obtained by demonstrating that microsomes catalyze the transfer of [14C]mannose from exogenously supplied mannolipid to endogenous protein acceptors. The amount of mannose transferred to protein was proportional to both microsomal protein and lipid concentrations. In addition, the amount of mannose transferred to protein from exogenous mannolipid is comparable to that incorporated from an equivalent amount of mannolipid generated endogenously from GDP-mannose. Gel filtration profiles of the [14C]mannose-containing protein formed in this system are essentially identical regardless of whether GDP-mannose or mannolipid is used as substrate. In both cases the radioactive protein fractionates in a manner similar to authentic K-46 (mol wt 24,000). The mannose-containning protein formed from either GDP-mannose or mannolipid was degraded sequentially by Pronase and subtilisin. The products formed from either substrate appeared to be identical and exhibited chromatographic and electrophoretic characteristics of glycopeptides. It was concluded that mammalian microsomal preparations contain an endogenous phospholipid, characterized as a dihydropolyisoprenol-monophosphate, which serves as an acceptor of mannose from GDP-mannose, resulting in the formation of mannosyl-monophosphoryl-dihydropolyisoprenol, and that this mannolipid serves as a glycosyl donor for transfer of mannose residues to endogenous protein acceptors. The evidence indicates that the mannolipid is an essential intermediate in the in vitro transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to protein."
https://openalex.org/W1490224303,"The steroid hormone-binding properties of human breast cyst fluid were investigated and compared to those of female serum. Breast cyst fluid exhibited a high binding affinity for progesterone and pregnenolone, but very little affinity for cortisol, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and deoxycorticosterone. Serum exhibited a high binding affinity for progesterone, and also for cortisol, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and deoxycorticosterone; but only little affinity for pregnenolone. It thus appears that the progesterone-binding component (or components) of breast cyst fluid is unique, since its steroid-binding properties are distinctly different from those of the progesterone-binding component of human serum, i.e. corticosteroid-binding globulin. Breast cyst fluid, in contrast to female serum, exhibited a low binding affinity for 17β-estradiol and testosterone. Column chromatography of breast cyst fluid on hydroxylapatite and DEAE-cellulose afforded considerable purification of the steroid-binding component (or components). Although the progesterone- and pregnenolone-binding component (or components) were eluted simultaneously from the chromatographic columns, identity is not presumed. According to a gel filtration study, the Stokes radius of the steroid-binding component (or components) appears to be about 38 A, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 72,000 for a globular protein. Of more general interest are the other proteins in breast cyst fluid which are present in high concentration, at least one-fourth of that of serum; the proteins of cyst fluid do not, however, resemble those of serum on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1938758335,"Abstract The binding of tritiated prostaglandin E1 ([3H]PGE1) to beef thyroid membranes was investigated by a micro-discontinuous gradient centrifugation method. Two populations of binding sites were found. Binding at pH 7 was found to require Ca2+ (half-maximal concentration 1 mm), was heat-labile, was inhibited by prostaglandins E2 and F1α, arachidonic acid, and 7-oxa-13-prostynoic acid, and was readily reversible. With 5 mm Ca+ at pH 7.0, the affinity constant was 2.6 x 108 m-1. ITP, GTP, and dGTP displaced bound [3H]PGE1 from the membranes at nucleotide concentrations that have been shown to enhance PGE1 activation of adenylate cyclase. Thyrotropin also caused debinding but this effect appears to be nonspecific. The other population of sites was heat-stable, had a pH optimum of 3.6 and a pK of 5.1. Calcium ion, although not required, enhanced the binding of [3H]PGE1 and shifted the optimum pH to 4.5 to 4.7; there were two binding components with apparent affinity constants of 1.6 x 1010 and 1.6 x 108 m-1. These sites had a much lower order of chemical specificity, being less sensitive to prostaglandin analogues or antagonists and insensitive to ITP, GTP, and thyrotropin. On the other hand, binding of [3H]PGE1 at pH 5 was inhibited by C18–24 fatty acids. The degree of inhibition increased with chain length and degree of unsaturation. Thus the binding of [3H]PGE1 was related to both the ionic and lipid properties of PGE1. It is concluded that binding of [3H]PGE1 at pH 7 fulfills the requirements of a physiological binding site whereas binding at pH 5 is nonspecific."

https://openalex.org/W1573463208,"Abstract The organization and mechanism of prostaglandin synthetase in the vesicular gland of sheep was studied by determining the isotope effects in the transformation of [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15]-octadeutero-arachidonic acid into prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 11-dehydro-prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), PGF2α, and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid. The first two products were formed from deuterated arachidonic acid by cleavage of carbon-deuterium bonds at C-9 and C-11, respectively, whereas the last two products were formed without carbon-deuterium cleavage. The ratio (product ratio) between the first and second category of products increased with time (18 to 300 s) in the presence of glutathione and hydroquinone from 1.8 to 3.5. The ratio between deuterated and unlabeled molecules divided by the same ratio of the substrate (relative D:H ratio) was almost constant during the incubation for PGE2 (0.3 to 0.4) and 11-dehydro-PGF2α (0.6 to 0.7), but increased for PGF2α (from 1.9 to 4.0) and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid in parallel with the product ratio. With l-epinephrine as cofactor, the product ratio remained almost constant during the incubation and also in this case the relative D:H ratio of PFG2α was essentially the same as the product ratio. Elimination of the hydrogen (deuterium) at C-9 in the intermediate endoperoxide is the rate-limiting step in the formation of PGE2 from the endoperoxide. The high relative D:H ratio of PGF2α excludes the existence of a separate synthetase for PGF2α and indicates that a common synthetase provides the endoperoxide precursor for both PGE2 and PGF2α."
https://openalex.org/W1601148487,"Abstract A sialyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of mucin from cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid and sialidase-treated sheep submaxillary mucin has been isolated from sheep submaxillary glands. The partially purified transferase incorporated approximately 70% of the sialic acid cleaved from the mucin by sialidase. Kinetic studies showed that the approximate Km values were 1.9 mm for the sialidase-treated mucin (calculated in terms of the concentration of N-acetylgalactosamine acceptor sites), and 0.57 mm for the CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid. No metal ion requirement could be demonstrated for the reaction. The purified enzyme could utilize CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid in place of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid. Active acceptors included polymers containing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residues such as sialidase-treated mucins from the submaxillary glands of sheep, pig, and cow, as well as fetuin, a glycopeptide from milk, and erythrocyte hemagglutination inhibitor. Crude extracts contained an endogenous acceptor for sialic acid, which was separated from the sialyltransferase and partially characterized as an incomplete mucin. A tissue survey showed the presence of the sialyltransferase in extracts of submaxillary glands of sheep, pig, and cow, and each of the extracts was active with the mucins obtained from any of the species. The requirements for acceptor activity are discussed. The ovine submaxillary mucin synthesized by the purified enzyme was purified and characterized, and periodate oxidation studies showed that the sialic acid was linked to the N-acetylgalactosamine residue at C-6."

https://openalex.org/W1521754303,"Abstract A soluble sialyltransferase was partially purified from colostrum (goat, bovine, and human). This enzyme catalyzed the transfer of sialic acid from cytidine monophospho-sialic acid to β-d-galactopyranosides. When N-acetyllactosamine was the acceptor, the products formed by the colostrum transferase contained sialic acid linked only to C-6 of the galactose moiety; with lactose as the acceptor, a small fraction of the sialic acid was linked to C-3 as well. These results distinguish the colostrum enzyme from the previously reported rat mammary gland sialyltransferase, which synthesized only the C-3 isomers of sialyllactose and sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine. In addition, the colostrum enzyme exhibited the following important specificity requirements towards the acceptor: (a) high, rather than low molecular weight substrates were much more effective; (b) the penultimate sugar to which galactose was linked in disaccharides markedly influenced the kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km); and (c) the position of linkage of galactose to the penultimate sugar resulted in 40-fold changes in the rate of the reaction. The most active disaccharide was N-acetyllactosamine (4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-N-acetylglucosamine). This disaccharide is a structural component of many glycoproteins, and it is suggested that the colostrum sialyltransferase catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of the serum-type glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2058618614,Rebinding of carbon monoxide to myoglobin and to cytochrome P-450 after removal by a light flash occurs down to 50 degrees K for myoglobin and 25 degrees K for cytochrome P-450 in glycerol-water solution. Above 240 degrees K the reaction is second order; between 240 degrees and 200 degrees K the rebinding becomes exponential and independent of the carbon monoxide concentration. Below 150 degrees K the reaction follows a power law and is approximately 10(3) times faster for cytochrome P-450 than for myoglobin.

On the second day, they were all retrained for 60 minutes. The greater the chicks' experience on the first day, the lower the rate of incorporation of tritiated uracil into macromolecules in the anterior part of the forebrain roof on the second day. Such effects were not found in other brain regions, nor in any brain region of chicks that received similar treatment on the first day but were not retrained on the second."
https://openalex.org/W2091704269,"The optical reflectivity of several well-characterized lipid bilayer systems has been correlated with calorimetric studies of the membrane components. There is a large increase in mean membrane thickness when a bilayer is cooled below the transition temperature of the membrane lipid. Similar studies on membranes generated from a mixture of two lipids possessing different degrees of unsaturation suggest that between the characteristic transition temperatures of the two lipids, the bilayer contains clusters of gel and liquid crystalline lipid which coexist within the plane of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1568853901,"Abstract A particulate fraction obtained from lactating rat mammary gland catalyzed the transfer of two of the sialic acids (N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid) from their CMP derivatives to lactose and to other β-d-galactopyranosides. The products of the reaction, when lactose and N-acetyllactosamine (β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-N-acetylglucosamine) were used as acceptors, were characterized as sialyl-(2→3)-lactose, and sialyl→N-acetyllactosamine, respectively. Only β-d-galactopyranosides served as acceptors in the enzymatic reaction, and the particulate fraction was active with both short chain oligosaccharides and simple glycosides. Various tissues from the rat were shown to contain sialyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1534704122,"Abstract The NH2-terminal valine residues of both chains of oxyhemoglobin S are carbamylated 50 to 100 times faster at pH 7.4 than the e-NH2 groups of the lysine residues of the protein up to a level of 1 carbamyl group per hemoglobin molecule. The pseudo-first order rate constants for the carbamylation of the NH2-terminal residues of carbonmonoxyhemoglobins A and S are identical for the proteins either in the tetrameric state or as the p-hydroxymercuribenzoate derivatives of the individual chains. The rate constant for the carbamylation of deoxyhemoglobin A is the same as that for deoxyhemoglobin S, and the deoxyhemoglobins are carbamylated about twice as rapidly as the liganded proteins. These results indicate that the pKa values of the NH2-terminal valine residues of hemoglobins A and S are probably identical. Carbon dioxide competes for the site of the carbamylation with deoxyhemoglobin more effectively than it does with carbonmonoxyhemoglobin. Since OCO is known to bind preferentially to deoxyhemoglobin, these data provide experimental support for the suggestion that HNCO, the reactive tautomer of cyanate, is a structural analog of OCO."
https://openalex.org/W1486856038,"Abstract One mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenal cortex is capable of catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (Shikita, M., and Hall, P. F. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5598). This cytochrome (molecular weight, 850,000) was dissociated into subunits of molecular weight 53,000 in 6 m guanidine as demonstrated by sedimentation equilibrium analysis and by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. Sedimentation equilibrium in buffer of high ionic strength (µ = 0.23) revealed dissociation of the cytochrome into subunits of molecular weights of 470,000 and 200,000. It appears that this adrenocortical P-450 is isolated in a form consisting of 16 subunits and can exist in forms of 8 and 4 subunits; more drastic treatments result in the formation of monomer units. Maximal enzymatic activity is observed at an ionic strength (µ = 0.03 to 0.05) at which the enzyme is seen as protein 16 on analytical ultracentrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W2011120745,"When frog sartorius muscles were exposed to diisopropylfluorophosphate, the amplitude and half-decay time of the end-plate current decreased; the half-decay time became almost potential-independent and the equilibrium potential for the end-plate current was more negative than during control conditions. When the excess reagent was removed by washing so that only the phosphorylated acetylcholinesterase remained, the amplitude of the end-plate current was restored, while its half-decay time was markedly increased. These findings reveal that this organophosphate significantly affects the receptor-ionic conductance modulator complex in addition to its well-known anticholinesterase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1603417191,"Abstract Differences in phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1) between sublines of the Balb/c inbred mouse strain were examined. The adrenal glands of the Balb/cJ strain possessed nearly twice as much enzyme activity as the glands of the Balb/cN line. This difference was reflected in the adrenal gland content of the enzyme, since it took nearly twice as much anti-phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase antiserum to precipitate the enzyme from the Balb/cJ line. Analysis of F1 and F2 progeny of the mating between Balb/cJ and Balb/cN lines revealed the enzyme levels to be controlled by a single genetic locus. Turnover studies showed the rates of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase synthesis to be the same in the two mouse sublines, but that the enzyme in the Balb/cN line was degraded at a rate twice that of the enzyme in the Balb/cJ line. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase from both sublines was similar with respect to substrate affinities, thermal stability, tryptic stability, and electrophoretic mobility. On the basis of these studies, it is postulated that a single gene locus has mutated in one of these strains and that this mutation resulted in the altered degradation rate of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W52184915,"Abstract Equilibrium binding studies and iron transport rate studies of the interaction of conalbumin and transferrin with the chick embryo red cell have supported the following conclusions: (a) that the chick embryo red cell is comparable to the rabbit and human reticulocyte systems traditionally used for the study of the physiological function of the metal complexes of siderophilins; (b) that there may be two classes of binding sites on the chick embryo red cell membrane for Fe2conalbumin, one for which conalbumin competes and one for which it does not compete; (c) that the red cell membrane accepts iron from differiconalbumin at twice the rate as from monoferriconalbumins, suggesting that simultaneous transport takes place from the two iron-binding sites on the protein with respect to iron acquisition; and (d) that the substitution of oxalate for carbonate as the obligate anion in the Fe2conalbumin(anion)2 complex decreases the rate of iron uptake by the cell because the cell must release the anion from the protein complex before it is able to sequester the bound iron."
https://openalex.org/W77198882,"Abstract The stability of the catechol-specific β-adrenergic receptor of turkey erythrocytes was tested with certain physical and chemical agents. The receptor for the catechol function was stable at high temperatures or to treatment with ultrasound. Phospholipase, Pronase, trypsin, Triton X-100, sodium lauryl sulfate, or Lubrol-PX destroyed the catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase but not catecholamine-specific binding. Exposure to trypsin or Lubrol-PX released the catechol-specific receptor from the membrane. The solubilized material did not sediment at 100,000 x g and showed properties virtually identical with the receptor on the cell membrane. Association and dissociation rates, stability to physical and chemical agents, and Km for catecholamine binding were all similar for the particulate and the solubilized receptor. It was concluded that the binding material released by trypsin or Lubrol-PX represents the solubilized catechol-specific fraction of the β-adrenergic receptor site."
https://openalex.org/W176161682,"The metal ion-binding site of staphylococcal nuclease has been studied at pH 7.0 by using several lanthanide ions. The binding of Gd(III) or Nd(III) to nuclease was associated with tyrosine perturbations in the ultraviolet spectrum which were shown to include tyrosine-85 and tyrosine-115 by using mononitrotyrosine nuclease derivatives. A binding constant of 9 µ m was estimated by spectrophotometric titration of nitrotyrosine-115-nuclease with Gd(III). The Ca(II) required for the binding of nuclease to deoxythymidine 3′,5′-diphosphate-Sepharose could be replaced by Nd(III). Nd(III) stabilized liganded and unliganded nuclease to trypsin digestion. None of the lanthanide ions replaced Ca(II) in the generation of nuclease activity toward DNA under the conditions employed. Kinetic data compatible with a model of competitive inhibition of Ca(II) by La(III), Pr(III), Nd(III), Gd(III), Dy(III), and Yb(III) yielded inhibition constants of 1 to 2 µ m . These data suggest that the lanthanide ions bind tightly to the Ca(II) binding site of nuclease in the presence or absence of substrate or substrate analogue. As does Ca(II), these ions also enhance the binding of substrate analogue to nuclease."

https://openalex.org/W2000735593,"The proton-decoupled natural abundance carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the canine sciatic nerve is virtually identical to that of canine adipose tissue and markedly similar to that of liquid triolein. No resonances assignable to cholesterol, glycolipids, or sphingolipids are detectable in the sciatic nerve spectrum despite their abundance in the myelin sheath of this nerve. However, many such resonances are observed in lipid extracts of the nerve. Chromatographic analysis of specimens of canine and rabbit sciatic nerve has revealed that these contain sufficient triglyceride to account quantitatively for the observed spectrum. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and spin-labeling results for preparations containing myelin, especially those derived from the peripheral nerve, should be critically examined for experimental artifacts reflecting the triglyceride content."
https://openalex.org/W2412910126,"6β- and 11α-Bromoacetoxyprogesterone were synthesized to further characterize the active site of 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Streptomyces hydrogenans. Both of the affinity-labeling steroids react with cysteine, histidine, methionine, and 2-mercaptoethanol in 0.05 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 25°, and are substrates for the enzyme, with apparent Km values of 2.0 x 10-5 and 2.78 x 10-5 m , respectively. 6β- and 11α-Bromoacetoxyprogesterone inactivate 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.53) in an irreversible and time-dependent manner. Inactivation follows pseudo-first order kinetics with t1/2 values of 22 min and 12 hours, respectively. 6β-[2-3H]Bromoacetoxyprogesterone and 11α-[2-3H]bromoacetoxyprogesterone were synthesized in order to radiolabel the enzyme active site. The amount of radioactivity incorporated during inactivation indicated that each steroid labels a single amino acid. Amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates of the radiolabeled enzyme revealed that 6β-bromoacetoxyprogesterone reacts with a cysteine residue and 11α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone reacts with a methionine residue within the active site. The degree of mobility of a steroidal substrate at the active site is discussed on the basis of our earlier and present affinity-labeling experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2014306374,"Goldfish exhibit cyclic changes with an annual rhythm in their learning and activity patterns. Maximum learning ability and active behavior occurred during the months of January, February, and March. Poor learning was obtained in the summer months, after the onset of the spawning season. The results indicate that the annual periodic changes of the hormonal levels which govern spawning may also influence learning and activity patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2123196927,Vasectomy was performed on 63 rats at age 81 to 105 days. Examination 28 to 58 days later disclosed no significant reductions in testis size with respect to preoperative testis length and to testis length and weight in unoperated controls. The fact that the minimal atrophy observed was primarily left-sided suggested that these effects were artifacts of the procedure or systemic left-right differences in the animals.
https://openalex.org/W2057045038,"The enzyme, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase, catalyzes several reactions, the natural ones being (i) the exchange of hydrogen atoms of the methyl groups of pyruvate with protons of the solvent (C-H synthesis) and (ii) the reversible condensation of pyruvate with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (C-C synthesis). Previous work has provided chemical evidence for the occurrence of a protein-bound carboxylate group adjacent to the Schiff's base-forming lysine in the active site geometry. This carboxylate could provide the basic group postulated to participate in proton activation catalyzed by aldolases. With the use of three-dimensional models, it is shown that simple rotation about a carbon-carbon bond of the side chain will allow the base to assume the two positions necessary for proton activation in either the C-H synthesis or the C-C synthesis catalyzed by KDPG aldolase. This single base hypothesis provides a model wherein all reagents can approach a single face of the active site and is consistent with the stereochemistry thought to occur in the aldolase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2072844850,The isolated toad brain accumulates L-glutamate against strong concentration gradients until a tissue-to-medium concentration ratio of about 3000 : 1 is attained. The accumulated glutamate does not equilibrate with most of the endogenous tissue glutamate but is converted rapidly to glutamine and released into the medium. This mechanism may be involved in the preservation of low extracellular levels of cerebral glutamate.

https://openalex.org/W1490930520,"Abstract The metabolism of exogenous uridine, uridine 5'-monophosphate, and uracil by rat liver slices was studied using in vitro superfusion systems. Mixtures of 3H- and 14C-labeled uridine, uridine 5'-monophosphate, uracil, and orotic acid were superfused at a constant rate until an isotopic steady state was achieved. Isotopic ratios and concentrations of labeled pyrimidines were measured in tissue and perfusate. The results of these experiments indicated marked compartmentalization in the intracellular distribution of uridine 5'-monophosphate, uridine, and uracil. On the basis of a model justified by the experimental findings, rates of metabolism of exogenous pyrimidines in the plasma membrane and rates of passage of these compounds through the membranes were estimated."
https://openalex.org/W2073201747,"The action of progesterone in mediating the synthesis of avidin by the chick oviduct can be simulated by the intraoviductal instillation of nitrocellulose-trapped RNA from hormonally prepared chick or pigeon oviduct. Similarly, the pigeon oviduct synthesizes avidin in response to chick oviduct RNA. Thus, a heterospecific transfer of hormonal stimulation, through the transfer of progesterone-induced RNA, is demonstrated. The biological activity is lost after digestion by pancreatic ribonuclease. The 50-fold purification achieved by nitrocellulose chromatography of the total RNA preparation suggests that the activity resides in a messenger RNA fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1565355876,"Abstract The previously reported results implicating general base catalysis in the deacylation of furoylchymotrypsin have been confirmed with a specific acylenzyme, acetyltyrosylchymotrypsin. For nonaromatic amines extending over a range of basicity of 107·8 the rate varies by a factor of only four; the rate constants for the reaction of these amines are equal to approximately 200 m-1 s-1. Methoxyamine and ammonia are 16- and 10-fold, respectively, less reactive than the other amines. With four para-substituted anilines of pK 2.2 to 6.3 the rate is less than that for nonaromatic amines of equivalent basicity and the Brφnsted slope is equal to 0.52. Some unknown factor apparently prevents effective proton abstraction from attacking anilines. There is a deuterium isotope effect on the rates of reaction of ethylamine, formylhydrazine, and p-chloroaniline with the acetyltyrosylenzyme and this effect is equal to that for hydrolysis of the acylenzyme. The effects of basicity and deuterium oxide are consistent with a mechanism involving concerted (and effective) proton abstraction from the attacking amine. An alternate stepwise mechanism involving a rate-limiting diffusion of protonated His-57 away from an anionic tetrahedral intermediate, which predicts a zero Brφnsted β for basic amines and a β near unity for amines of pK less than 7, is not supported by the results."
https://openalex.org/W1563670095,"Abstract Phascoline and phascolosomine, two new parent mono-substituted guanidino compounds, have been isolated from the sipunculid worms, Phascolion strombi and div. Phascolosoma, respectively. Based on their chemical and spectral properties, the proposed structure of phascoline is N-(3-guanidinopropionyl)-2-hydroxy-n-heptylamine, and that of phascolosomine is N-(3-guanidinoisobutyryl)-2-methyoxy-n-heptylamine. Phascoline and phascolosomine, whose biological significance is under investigation, were found to be mainly localized in the viscera of the worms, at an approximate concentration of 600 to 1100 mg/100 g wet weight. This is 2 to 4 times the average concentration of the total (free and phosphorylated) guanidine bases used as phosphoryl acceptors in the body-wall muscle of these animals, as in most vertebrate and invertebrate muscles."
