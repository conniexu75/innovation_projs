https://openalex.org/W1984767179,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a trophic agent that promotes the outgrowth of nerve fibers from sympathetic and sensory ganglia. The neuronal differentiation stimulated by this hormone was examined in the NGF-responsive cell line PC12. Differential hybridization was used to screen a complementary DNA library constructed from PC12 cells treated with NGF and cycloheximide. One of the complementary DNA clones that was rapidly induced by NGF was found to have a nucleotide sequence that predicts a 54-kilodalton protein with homology to transcriptional regulatory proteins. This clone, NGFI-A, contains three tandemly repeated copies of the 28- to 30-amino acid ""zinc finger"" domain present in Xenopus laevis TFIIIA and other DNA-binding proteins. It also contains another highly conserved unit of eight amino acids that is repeated at least 11 times. The NGFI-A gene is expressed at relatively high levels in the brain, lung, and superior cervical ganglion of the adult rat."

https://openalex.org/W2028905487,"F-actin is the major component of muscle thin filaments and, more generally, of the microfilaments of the dynamic, multifunctional cytoskeletal systems of nonmuscle eukaryotic cells. Polymeric F-actin is formed by reversible noncovalent self-association of monomeric G-actin. To understand the dynamics of microfilament systems in cells, the dynamics of polymerization of pure actin must be understood. The following model has emerged from recent work. During the polymerization process, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) that is bound to G-actin is hydrolyzed to adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) that is bound to F-actin. The hydrolysis reaction occurs on the F-actin subsequent to the polymerization reaction in two steps: cleavage of ATP followed by the slower release of inorganic phosphate (Pi). As a result, at high rates of filament growth a transient cap of ATP-actin subunits exists at the ends of elongating filaments, and at steady state a stabilizing cap of ADP.Pi-actin subunits exists at the barbed ends of filaments. Cleavage of ATP results in a highly stable filament with bound ADP.Pi, and release of Pi destabilizes the filament. Thus these two steps of the hydrolytic reaction provide potential mechanisms for regulating the monomer-polymer transition."

Precise measurements of the time course of attention show that it consists of two partially concurrent processes: a fast, effortless, automatic process that records the cue and its neighboring events; and a slower, effortful, controlled process that records the stimulus to be attended and its neighboring events."

https://openalex.org/W2084990440,"The T cell receptor (TCR) δ protein is expressed as part of a heterodimer with TCR γ, in association with the CD3 polypeptides on a subset of functional peripheral blood T lymphocytes, thymocytes, and certain leukemic T cell lines. A monoclonal antibody directed against TCR δ was produced that binds specifically to the surface of several TCR γδ cell lines and immunoprecipitates the TCR γδ as a heterodimer from Triton X-100 detergent lysates and also immunoprecipitates the TCR δ subunit alone after chain separation. A candidate human TCR δ complementary DNA clone (IDP2 O-240/38), reported in a companion paper, was isolated by the subtractive library approach from a TCR γδ cell line. This complementary DNA clone was used to direct the synthesis of a polypeptide that is specifically recognized by the monoclonal antibody to TCR δ. This complementary DNA clone thus corresponds to the gene that encodes the TCR δ subunit."

https://openalex.org/W4249755205,"Twentieth-century psychologists have been pessimistic about teaching reasoning, prevailing opinion suggesting that people may possess only domain-specific rules, rather than abstract rules; this would mean that training a rule in one domain would not produce generalization to other domains. Alternatively, it was thought that people might possess abstract rules (such as logical ones) but that these are induced developmentally through self-discovery methods and cannot be trained. Research suggests a much more optimistic view: even brief formal training in inferential rules may enhance their use for reasoning about everyday life events. Previous theorists may have been mistaken about trainability, in part because they misidentified the kind of rules that people use naturally."
https://openalex.org/W2080046379,"The c-erbA gene belongs to a multigene family that encodes transcriptional regulatory proteins including the v-erbA oncogene product, steroid hormone receptors, and the vitamin D3 receptor. A v-erbA DNA probe encoding the DNA-binding region of the v-erbA protein was used to screen a human complementary DNA testis library. One of the clones isolated, erbA-T-1, was found to encode a 490-amino acid protein (erbA-T). The erbA-T polypeptide shows high homology with the proteins encoded by both the chicken c-erbA and the human c-erbA-β genes but is most closely related to the chicken gene. The chicken c-erbA and the human c-erbA-β genes encode high-affinity receptors for thyroid hormone, and here it is shown that the erbA-T protein binds specifically to 3,5,3 ′-triiodo-L-thyronine with a dissociation constant of 3.8 ± 0.2 × 10-10 M. These data imply that more than one thyroid hormone receptor exists in humans and that these receptors might have different tissue- and gene-activating specificities."

https://openalex.org/W1726024662,"We have previously reported the cloning of cDNAs coding for two isoforms (termed C alpha and C beta) of the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Uhler, M., Chrivia, J., and McKnight, G. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15360-15363). We have constructed cDNA expression vectors for the C alpha and C beta proteins using the mouse metallothionein promoter so that mRNA transcripts from the expression vectors are inducible with Zn. In stable transformants of NIH 3T3 and AtT-20 cells, the induction of both C alpha and C beta mRNA with Zn increases the cAMP-dependent as well as the cAMP-independent kinase activity. The C alpha and C beta proteins synthesized from these expression vectors can be detected by Western blot analysis and have slightly different molecular weights as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, the levels of RI protein are also shown to increase in cells expressing high levels of the C alpha or C beta subunits although there is no change in RI mRNA. In contrast, the levels of RII protein are not significantly affected by increasing either C alpha or C beta expression in these cell lines. We conclude that cells can compensate for the increased levels of either C alpha or C beta subunits with a corresponding elevation of RI protein implying that both isoforms of C can interact with RI to form a holoenzyme. The relevance of these experimental results to the coordinate regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase subunits is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1982726429,The major late transcription factor (MLTF) is a 46-kilodalton polypeptide that specifically binds to and activates transcription from the major late promoter of adenovirus. The presence of this promoter-specific transcription factor in uninfected HeLa cell extracts suggests that MLTF is also involved in the transcription of cellular genes. This report demonstrates that MLTF specifically stimulates transcription of the rat gamma-fibrinogen gene through a high-affinity binding site. Stimulation of transcription by MLTF was not dependent on the exact position of the MLTF binding site with respect either to the transcription initiation site or to adjacent promoter elements. These results suggest that one of the cellular functions of MLTF is to control gamma-fibrinogen gene expression.
https://openalex.org/W1588265771,"Previous work (Babcock, D. F., Rufo, G. A., and Lardy, H.A. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 1327-1331) established that increased cytosolic pH (pHi) promotes metabolic and swimming activity of bull sperm and that intracellular alkalinization results from elevated extracellular K+, presumably as a consequence of membrane depolarization. The present studies show that a persistent but reversible increase in [Ca2+]i accompanies the increase in pHi that similarly results from treatment of ram sperm with elevated [K+] in alkaline media. Because comparable increases in pHi occur in the presence or absence of external Ca2+ and because [Ca2+]i is unaltered by imposed changes in pHi alone, [Ca2+]i and pHi apparently are neither directly linked by transmembrane Ca2+/H+ exchange nor indirectly linked through Na+/H+ and Na+/Ca2+ exchange under these conditions. Instead, inhibition of K+-induced increases in [Ca2+]i (but not of increases in pHi) by prenylamine, diltiazem, nifedipine, or verapamil (C1/2 = 6, 20, 30, and 60 microM, respectively) indicates that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, distinct from previously described voltage-dependent effectors of pHi, operate in mammalian sperm to control [Ca2+]i. Treatment with Cs+ plus valinomycin (as an alternative method of membrane depolarization) increases pHi much more effectively than it increases [Ca2+]i, and thus also partially supports this contention. In contrast to an apparent insensitivity to pHi, K+-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i are promoted reversibly by elevation of pHo, probably reflecting local surface charge effects on channel activity (as suggested by patch-clamp studies in other systems). A selective increase in membrane permeability to Ca2+ that is induced by 12 mM NaF under nondepolarizing conditions is not a consequence of cellular aggregation, but is attenuated by the chelator deferoxamine, suggesting that GTP-binding protein additionally may couple sperm Ca2+ channels to surface receptors and promote channel opening during sperm capacitation, presumably in response to agonists produced within the mammalian female reproductive tract."

https://openalex.org/W1513548357,"We have isolated, after limited proteolysis of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) of human neutrophils, a 25-kDa fragment that possesses the bactericidal and envelope-altering activities of the 60-kDa parent protein. On a molar basis, the fragment is as potent as holo-human BPI against rough Escherichia coli, is more potent than holo-BPI against more resistant smooth E. coli, and retains the specificity of BPI toward Gram-negative bacteria. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis shows that the fragment is derived from the NH2 terminus of the BPI molecule. These findings suggest that all of the molecular determinants of the antibacterial properties of BPI reside within the NH2-terminal 25-kDa segment, implying a novel structural/functional organization for a cytotoxic protein."

https://openalex.org/W1633178688,"Horseradish peroxidase is inactivated in a time-, H2O2-, and concentration-dependent manner by phenylethyl-, ethyl-, and methylhydrazine. The pseudo- first order kinetic constants for these inactivation reactions at pH 7 are: phenylethyl (KI = 115 microM, kinact = 1.5 min-1, partition ratio = 11), ethyl (KI = 145 microM, kinact = 0.08 min-1, partition ratio = 32), and methyl (KI = 3000 microM, kinact = 0.12 min-1, partition ratio = 80). At pH 5, the constants for the phenylethyl reaction change to KI = 1540 microM and kinact = 0.86 min-1. A transient absorbance at approximately 830 nm, suggestive of an isoporphyrin intermediate, is seen during these reactions. The prosthetic heme is converted by each of the three alkylhydrazines into the corresponding delta-meso-alkylated heme. Complete inactivation of the enzymes by methyl-, ethyl-, and phenylethylhydrazine is associated with alkylation of 60-70, 70, and 90%, respectively, of the prosthetic heme groups. The absence of N-alkylation and the high specificity for the delta-meso position, even with agents as small as methylhydrazine, strengthen the proposal that electron abstraction is mediated by the heme edge rather than the ferryl oxygen of horseradish peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1490745525,"We have investigated the formation of the first phosphodiester bond by RNA polymerase II in vitro. The template was a cloned DNA bearing the adenovirus 2 major late promoter; transcription factors and RNA polymerase II were provided by a HeLa cell nuclear extract. Dinucleotide primers and single nucleoside triphosphates were used as substrates. We found that accurate initiation does occur when only one phosphodiester bond can be formed; however, all of the resulting dinucleotide-primed trimers are abortively initiated. Synthesis of the trimers by RNA polymerase II requires ATP or dATP and is sensitive to low concentrations of alpha-amanitin. Treatments which abolish the ability of the preinitiation complex to synthesize long RNAs also eliminate the ability to abortively initiate. Abortive initiation proceeds for at least one-half h at 25 degrees C, at which point up to 4 mol of transcript/mol of template have been synthesized. The level of abortive initiation (per template molecule) is not significantly reduced by 0.025% Sarkosyl or by 10-fold dilution of the reaction, consistent with the initiation complex remaining intact during abortive initiation."

https://openalex.org/W1534598094,"The kinetics of the activation of Glu- and Lys-plasminogen by single-chain urokinase (sc urokinase) derived from the transformed human kidney cell line TCL-598 have been studied and compared with two-chain urokinase (tc urokinase). Plasminogen activation was determined by the increase in fluorescence polarization of fluorescein-labeled aprotinin, a high affinity inhibitor of plasmin. This methodology allows plasmin generation by sc urokinase to be measured in functional isolation, with no interfering generation of tc urokinase, sc urokinase was found to activate plasminogen to plasmin with apparent Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics. The Km for Glu-plasminogen activation was 47.7 microM, with a catalytic constant of 2.91 min-1. Lys-plasminogen activation by sc urokinase was characterized by a Km of 11.7 microM and a kcat of 5.60 min-1. The Km values for the activation of Glu- and Lys-plasminogen by tc urokinase were found to be similar to those for activation by sc urokinase (36.8 and 9.0 microM, respectively), but the catalytic constants were higher at 36.0 and 118 min-1, respectively. Therefore, on the basis of the catalytic efficiency kcat/Km, sc urokinase seems to have 16-27-fold lower activity than tc urokinase. This activity of sc urokinase is in contrast to its lack of activity against a low molecular weight peptide substrate (less than 0.2% of the activity of sc urokinase). The activation of sc urokinase to tc urokinase by plasmin was also characterized (Km = 3.0 microM, kcat = 105 min-1). Using these data, it was possible to calculate the theoretical rate of plasminogen activation by sc urokinase in the absence of aprotinin, when tc urokinase is generated by the action of plasmin. The calculated rate was in good agreement with that determined experimentally using the chromogenic substrate D-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide. These data demonstrate that sc urokinase has properties which distinguish it from conventional serine protease zymogens. The lack of activity against low molecular weight peptide substrates demonstrates the inaccessibility of the substrate-binding pocket. However, there is a moderate activity against plasminogen, suggesting that plasminogen may be acting as both an effector and a substrate for sc urokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1967163113,"Stimulation of one side of the olfactory system during training with odor-milk pairings in neonatal rats results in their ability to recall an odor memory by using the trained but not the untrained side of the brain. In 12-day-old rats, olfactory learning can be recalled by stimulation of either the trained or untrained side. The development of bilateral recall reflects the maturation of olfactory commissural pathways that provide access to the olfactory memory stored on the contralateral side. Furthermore, the commissural pathways need not be present at the time of memory formation but can establish new and specific access to already existing olfactory memories."

https://openalex.org/W1539597683,"Abstract Interaction between the B-block region of adenovirus VA1 DNA and the human RNA polymerase III transcription factor (TFIII) C2 was analyzed using a gel DNA-binding assay. The retarded band corresponding to the specific complex between TFIIIC2 and the regulatory B-block region was identified by DNase I footprint analysis, competition experiments, and gel shift assays using mutated and truncated virus-associated (VA) 1 DNA probes. The equilibrium constants for the binding reaction with the complete VA1 gene were determined. TFIIIC2 was found to bind to non-specific DNA sequences with a relatively low affinity (equilibrium constant Kn = 6 x 10(4) M-1), and to the B-block sequence with a high affinity (specific constant Ks = 2 x 10(11) M-1). Assuming one site per molecule, the total concentration of binding sites [C0] in the TFIIIC2-containing fractions ranged between 0.6 and 1.6 x 10(-10) M. This corresponded to 1500 TFIIIC2 molecules extracted per 293 cell. Sedimentation analysis of TFIIIC2 on a sucrose gradient showed both VA1 DNA binding activity and in vitro transcription activity cosedimenting with an apparent coefficient of 17-18 S, consistent with a molecular weight of 400-500 kDa. UV cross-linking of a 5-bromo 2'-deoxyuridine-containing, 32P-labeled VA1 probe with the TFIIIC2 fraction, followed by DNase I digestion and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed a single 32P-labeled band migrating as a 250-kDa polypeptide. Compared with the sedimentation data, this result suggests that native TFIIIC2 may be a dimer of the approximately 250-kDa polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1490153447,"Murine L1210 leukemia cells resistant to the antineoplastic agent L-phenylalanine mustard have a 1.5-2.0-fold elevation in their cellular GSH and GSSG content as compared to drug-sensitive cells. Cellular uptake of L-[U-14C]cystine and its incorporation into GSH of the resistant tumor are correspondingly elevated. Synthesis of gamma-glutamylcysteine, GSH, and GSSG is elevated 1.5-2.0-fold in cell-free preparations of the resistant tumor. This increased synthesis of GSH is attributed to increased cellular content (1.6-fold) of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. GSH synthetase activity is equivalent in both drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Investigation into the hydrolysis of selected peptides by cell-free preparations of both sensitive and resistant tumors suggest that aminopeptidase M participates in the formation of L-cysteine from L-Cys-Gly. This is supported by the observation that these preparations readily degrade L-Leu-p-nitroanilide and L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Ala, known substrates for aminopeptidase M, but not dipeptidase. The failure of the tumors to degrade Gly-D-Ala, a dipeptidase substrate, and the marked inhibition of L-Ala-Gly, L-Cys-Gly, and L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Ala hydrolysis by Bestatin further support a role for aminopeptidase M in the generation of L-cysteine from L-Cys-Gly. These results suggest that the drug-resistant tumor cell has developed an efficient mechanism for maintenance of elevated GSH which involves both gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-initiated catabolism of GSH to cysteine and its reutilization by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase."

https://openalex.org/W1542952500,"Thiobacillus ferrooxidans is a chemolithotrophic bacterium capable of fulfilling all of its energy requirements from the oxidation of soluble ferrous sulfate. Rusticyanin is a soluble blue copper protein found in abundance in the periplasmic space of this bacterium. The one-electron transfer reaction between soluble iron and purified rusticyanin has been studied by stopped flow spectrophotometry in acidic solutions containing sulfate. Second order rate constants for the reduction of rusticyanin by Fe2+, FeHSO4+, and FeSO4(0) were 0.022, 0.73, and 2.30 M-1 s-1, respectively. The pseudo-first order rate constant for the reduction of rusticyanin exhibited substrate saturation when the concentration of the total ferrous ion was varied in solutions of limiting sulfate. This saturation behavior was quantitatively described using the values of the second order rate constants listed above and the distribution of the total ferrous ion into its water-, bisulfate-, and sulfate-coordinated forms. Second order rate constants for the oxidation of rusticyanin by Fe3+ and FeSO4+ were 0.73 and 0.26 M-1 s-1, respectively. The electron transfer reactions between iron and rusticyanin monitored in vitro were far too slow to support the hypothesis that rusticyanin is the primary oxidant of ferrous ions in the iron-dependent respiratory electron transport chain of T. ferrooxidans."
https://openalex.org/W1513831681,"The purified type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is a dimeric protein, and the two protomers of the dimer are linked by two interchain disulfide bonds. The disulfide linkages that join these two polypeptide chains have been identified in order to provide a structural basis for the orientation of the two chains in the asymmetric dimer. Disulfide bonds were found to exist exclusively between Cys-16 and Cys-37, and this assignment, thus, establishes a general antiparallel alignment of the two chains. Two other homologous proteins, the type II regulatory subunit and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase also are dimeric proteins. In all three proteins, a relatively small, nonhomologous, amino-terminal segment of the polypeptide chain is essential for maintaining the dimeric aggregation state."
https://openalex.org/W2155285775,"Post-translational processing of Factor IX includes glycosylation, cleavage of the signal peptide and propeptide, vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of specific glutamic acid residues to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, and beta-hydroxylation of aspartic acid at residue 64 to form beta-hydroxyaspartic acid. The human Factor IX cDNA coding sequence was modified in the propeptide region (residue -18 to -1) using oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, and the altered Factor IX cDNA was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The effects of the mutations on proteolytic processing, gamma-carboxylation, and beta-hydroxylation were assessed by direct structural analysis. After purification, the molecular weight of each of the recombinant Factor IX species and its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence were shown to be identical to those of plasma Factor IX. gamma-Carboxyglutamic acid and beta-hydroxyaspartic acid analyses revealed that recombinant wild-type Factor IX contained 9.2 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid and 0.3 beta-hydroxyaspartic acid residues/molecule compared with 11.4 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid and 0.39 beta-hydroxyaspartic acid residues in plasma Factor IX. When the 18-residue propeptide was deleted or when the cells were grown in the presence of sodium warfarin, secreted Factor IX contained no detectable gamma-carboxyglutamic acid but 0.36 and 0.40 residues of beta-hydroxyaspartic acid, respectively. Point mutations leading to substitution of alanine for phenylalanine at residue -16 or glutamic acid for alanine at residue -10 contained 0.2 and 1.7 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, respectively, and 0.2 residues of beta-hydroxyaspartic acid. These data confirm that the propeptide mutations made do not interfere with proteolytic processing and that the Factor IX propeptide contains a recognition site that designates the adjacent glutamic acid-rich domain for gamma-carboxylation. In contrast, beta-hydroxylation of aspartic acid 64 is an independent process which does not require vitamin K and is mediated through a hydroxylation recognition site in the mature Factor IX, not in the propeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1499308279,"A glycoprotein having a subunit weight of approximately 60,000 was isolated from rabbit liver microsomes. It is a predominant component of the hepatic microsomal membrane and reacts rapidly with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP), resulting in the loss of enzymatic activity toward artificial substrates such as acyl esters of o-nitrophenols. Automated Edman degradation of this protein together with sequence analysis of peptides provided the NH2-terminal sequence of some 70 residues as follows: His-Pro-Ser- Ala-Pro-Pro-Val-Val-Asp-Thr-Val-Lys-Gly-Lys-Val- Leu-Gly-Lys-Phe-Val-Ser-Leu-Glu-Gly-Phe-Ala-Gln- Pro-Val-Ala-Val-Phe-Leu-Gly-Val-Pro-Phe-Ala-Lys- Pro-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Arg-Phe-Ala-Pro-Pro-Gln- Pro-Ala-Glu-Ser-Trp-Ser-His-Val-Lys-Asn (CHO)- Thr-Thr-Ser-Tyr-Pro-Pro-Met-Cys-Ser-Ser. A carbohydrate attachment was identified at asparaginyl residue 61. The COOH-terminal peptide of the protein was isolated from two independent enzymatic digests, and its sequence was established as Arg-Glu-Thr-Glu-His-Ile-Glu-Leu. In order to isolate the DFP binding peptide, liver microsomes were labeled with [3H]DFP and the 60-kDa protein containing covalently bound DFP isolated in pure form. Following reduction and carboxymethylation, the DFP-labeled protein was fragmented with trypsin and the digest subjected to gel filtration. Digestion of the labeled peptide preparations with chymotrypsin followed by chromatography of the digest yielded two diisopropylphosphoryl (DIP) peptides. Automated Edman degradation of these peptides provided the following amino acid sequences: Gly-Glu-DIPSer- Ala-Gly-Gly-Gln-Ser-Val-Ser-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser- Pro and Thr-Val-Ile-Gly-Asp-DIPHis-Gly-Asp-Glu-Ile-Phe. The active site serine peptide of the 60-kDa protein shows some 70% similarity to the active center region of choline esterases. While the postulated active histidyl residue in choline esterases has not been identified, it is proposed that the DFP binding histidine of the 60-kDa protein corresponds to His-438/440 of choline esterases."

Binding was dependent on the presence of calcium. Binding of ligand to receptor was minimal at neutral pH and maximal at pH 5.0. Equilibrium binding studies indicated positive cooperativity of binding and a site capacity of about 60 pmol/mg of protein. Competition studies were compatible with a specificity hierarchy of GlcNAc much greater than Gal; no recognition of mannose, fucose, or glucose moieties was noted. The receptor was detergent-solubilized from plasma membrane preparations and on the basis of the defined binding properties, purified by chromatography on a GlcNAc-Sepharose affinity column. The purified GlcNAc thyroid receptor has a subunit molecular size of about 45 kDa and appears to be an oligomer composed of three subunits. The receptor was identified as a component of thyrocytes by in situ cytochemical localization with fluorescent neoglycoproteins. In certain cases it was mainly present on, or near, the apical cell surface. It is suggested that this GlcNAc receptor functions in thyroglobulin metabolism, possibly involved in recycling of internalized thyroglobulin molecules back into the follicular lumen."

https://openalex.org/W1482471379,"When human diploid fibroblasts such as WI-38 cells become crowded, they enter a viable state of quiescence (G0) in which they can remain for prolonged periods of time. These quiescent cells can be induced to re-enter the cell cycle by addition of fresh serum. However, cells held in G0 for long periods before stimulation require more time to enter DNA synthesis as compared to cells held in a quiescent state for short periods. We have used this model system to determine if a close temporal coupling exists between the time of expression of two proto-oncogenes associated with cell growth, c-fos and c-myc, and the time of entry into DNA synthesis. WI-38 cells were stimulated to enter DNA synthesis by the addition of fresh culture medium and serum at various lengths of time after plating, ranging from 7 to 34 days. At hourly intervals thereafter, cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated. These samples were then analyzed by RNase protection assay to determine the levels of c-fos and c-myc mRNA. Our results show that the time and pattern of c-fos and c-myc mRNA accumulation after stimulation is determined only by the time which the cells are treated with serum even when they exhibit a 19-h delay in the entry into DNA synthesis. In all of our experiments, c-fos could be detected 0.5 h after stimulation and remained detectable for approximately 2 h. Likewise, the peak of c-myc accumulation occurred at about 3 h after serum addition, regardless of how long it took to initiate DNA synthesis. These results suggest that the time of c-fos and c-myc induction clearly is not the only factor which determines the length of the prereplicative period and thus the ultimate time of initiation of DNA synthesis."

The relative amounts of cholecystokinin mRNA generally correlated well with the levels of cholecystokinin-immunoreactive peptides in the various regions tested. One clear exception was noted in the cerebellum; in this region, levels of cholecystokinin mRNA were about 20% of the levels in brain cortex (or second highest level in all areas tested) whereas the mature forms of cholecystokinin peptides (cholecystokinin 58, cholecystokinin 8) were undetectable (less than 3 pmol/g). In vitro translation of cerebellar and cortical cholecystokinin mRNA indicated that there was no difference in the efficiency with which these two RNAs were translated into immunoreactive prepro-cholecystokinin. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that a cloned full-length cerebellar cholecystokinin cDNA was indistinguishable from its cortical counterpart and, therefore, must encode an identical prepro-cholecystokinin. We conclude that there are pronounced regional differences in cholecystokinin expression in pig brain. The apparent discrepancy between levels of immunoreactive cholecystokinin peptides and cholecystokinin mRNA in the cerebellum could be explained by a high turnover rate for the peptides, differential processing of the peptides, or tissue-specific inhibition of cholecystokinin mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W1600050836,"The dwarf mutant is an autosomal recessive mutation of the mouse which causes a defective development of those anterior pituitary cells responsible for the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, and prolactin. These mice are thus genetically hypothyroid and provide a model system in which one can investigate the influence of thyroid hormone on the transitions of the myosin heavy chain isoforms. We have carried out a qualitative and quantitative investigation of the myosin heavy chain isoforms present at various developmental stages and following one injection of 1 microgram of thyroxine. Myosin heavy chains were identified by nondissociating gel electrophoresis, localized by indirect immunofluorescence, and quantitated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. We find that in skeletal muscle, the appearance of the adult fast myosin heavy chain is severely retarded, that the neonatal myosin heavy chain is never totally eliminated, and that there is an overall increase in the number of fibers containing slow myosin heavy chain. In cardiac tissue the adult phenotype is never attained and beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain remains the predominant isoform. A single injection of 1 microgram of thyroxine was sufficient to cause a slight acceleration in the appearance of the adult fast myosin heavy chain in skeletal muscle, but only after 6-8 days. However, in the cardiac muscle, one injection of thyroxine resulted in a more rapid but transient expression of the alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain, suggesting that the mechanism of action of thyroid hormone is different in these two tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1562433000,"We report the purification and characterization of proteoliaisin, a protein that participates in the assembly of the sea urchin fertilization envelope. Proteoliaisin was purified from egg cortical granule exudate to greater than 99% homogeneity using chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and on phenyl-Sepharose. Native proteoliaisin is a highly asymmetric protein (f/fo = 2.0) composed of a single Mr approximately 230,000 peptide. Its asymmetry was demonstrated both by analytical ultracentrifugation and by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a novel analysis that detects molecular asymmetry in heterogeneous protein mixtures. Proteoliaisin is enriched in six amino acids: aspartic acid/asparagine, glutamic acid/glutamine, glycine, and cysteine, which account for over 50% of its mass. Nearly all of the cysteine residues are disulfide bonded. The protein contains a small proportion of aromatic amino acids with phenylalanine greater than tyrosine greater than tryptophan. At neutral pH its absorbance maximum is at 274.5 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 0.43 ml mg-1 cm-1. Proteoliaisin forms a 1:1 Ca2+-stabilized complex with ovoperoxidase, another component of the fertilization envelope, with Kd = 1.1 X 10(-6) M. Proteoliaisin, a constituent of the specialized echinoderm extracellular matrix called the fertilization envelope, has certain structural similarities to mammalian extracellular matrix proteins."

Taken the full perspective, the impact of Chernobyl from a radiological aspect depends on two major radiobiological factors. The most significant factor is the determination of the actual radiation dose absorbed into tissues. The second major factor to be considered in the radiation risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W1605037608,"Abstract Variations in the v2 region of the Raman spectra of cryogenically trapped photoproducts of different liganded myoglobins as a function of ligand (CO, O2, and n-butyl isocyanide) and species (whale, tuna, elephant) are reported. These variations are attributed to differences in the population of open (ligand accessible) and closed (ligand inaccessible) conformations of the distal heme pocket. Based on these findings and those derived from other spectroscopies including x-ray crystallography, NMR, IR spectra, and ESR, a working model is presented which accounts for how the conformation of the distal heme pocket, the geometry of the bound ligand, the identity of the ligand, and the dynamics of the dissociated ligand are all interconnected."
https://openalex.org/W1498619978,"The nuclei from different types of dividing cultured cells melted as four thermal transitions: I (60 degrees C), II (76 degrees C), III (88 degrees C), and IV (105 degrees C). The fourth transition was the predominant endotherm in all types of cells examined. In the melting profile of nuclei obtained from nondividing density-inhibited fibroblasts, transition IV remained the major endotherm; however, it was lost in nuclei from differentiated myoblasts and nutrient-depleted cells. In these cells, the loss in transition IV was compensated by a concomitant increase in transition III. In the nutrient-deprived cells the decrease in transition IV was followed by a gradual lowering in its melting temperature. The complete loss of transition IV was correlated with loss of cellular capacity to divide."
https://openalex.org/W1571841818,"A stopped-flow technique was used to study the spectral changes occurring in bilirubin-albumin following a pH jump as well as following binding of bilirubin at 25 degrees C. The changes were studied in two wavelength ranges, 280-310 nm (tyrosine residues) and 400-510 nm (bound bilirubin). The changes were analyzed according to a scheme of consecutive unimolecular reactions. Spectral monitoring of a pH jump from 11.3 to 11.8 reveals that the bilirubin-albumin complex changes its structure in several steps. The UV absorption spectra show that 3.8 tyrosine residues ionize in the first step, 2.5 in the second, none in the third, and 0.8 in the fourth and following steps. The visible absorption spectrum of bound bilirubin changes in the second, third, and fourth steps. The bilirubin spectra of the different bilirubin-albumin complexes occurring in the transition show a common isosbestic point at 445 nm, indicating a change of the dihedral angle between the two bilirubin chromophores in a three-step reaction. It is suggested that 1 tyrosine residue is located close to the bilirubin site and is externalized in the second step. Bilirubin binding to albumin was monitored at two pH values, 11.3 and 11.8. At pH 11.3 the complex changes its structure in a three-step relaxation sequence. A change of the dihedral angle between the bilirubin chromophores can explain the spectral changes observed in the second and third relaxations. Protonation of 0.7 tyrosine residues occurs in the third relaxation, suggesting internalization of a tyrosine residue as a late consequence of bilirubin binding. At pH 11.8 a two-step relaxation sequence follows bilirubin binding. No tyrosine protonation occurs. Bilirubin is probably bound more superficially at pH 11.8 than at pH 11.3."
https://openalex.org/W1589085430,"A stopped-flow technique was used to study the spectral changes occurring in albumin following a pH jump from 11.3 to 11.8 at 25 degrees C. Ultraviolet difference spectra between various albumin species participating in the process are reported. These spectra are similar in shape to the difference spectrum between the phenolate and phenolic form of tyrosine. At pH 11.3 one-third of the 18 tyrosine residues in albumin are deprotonated. At pH 11.8 two-thirds are deprotonated. The total reaction was analyzed as a multistep unimolecular consecutive process completed in four or more steps. Estimates were made of the number of tyrosine residues involved in the individual transitions. The first transition occurs with a rate constant greater than 300 s-1, in which 4.3 tyrosine residues deprotonate. The second transition occurs with a rate constant of 56.6 +/- 5.9 s-1, deprotonating 1.5 tyrosine residues. During the third (3.4 +/- 2.8 s-1) and following transitions (less than 0.3 s-1), which could not be reproducibly separated, 0.7 tyrosine residues deprotonate. The rates of deprotonation are inconsistent with simple diffusional dissociation of protons from the tyrosine residues and reflect exposure of tyrosines through conformational changes of albumin or dissociations of stably hydrogen-bonded tyrosines."
