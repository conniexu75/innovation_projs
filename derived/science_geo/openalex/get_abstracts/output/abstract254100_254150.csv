https://openalex.org/W2073907573,"A preliminary expression profiling analysis of osteoblasts derived from tibia explants of the high bone mass LRP5 G171V transgenic mice demonstrated increased expression of canonical Wnt pathway and Wnt/β-catenin target genes compared with non-transgenic explant derived osteoblasts. Therefore, expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes were monitored after in vivo loading of the tibia of LRP5 G171V transgenic mice compared with non-transgenic mice. Loading resulted in the increased expression of Wnt pathway and Wnt/β-catenin target genes including Wnt10B, SFRP1, cyclin D1, FzD2, WISP2, and connexin 43 in both genotypes; however, there was a further increased in transcriptional response with the LRP5 G171V transgenic mice. Similar increases in the expression of these genes (except cyclin D1) were observed when non-transgenic mice were pharmacologically treated with a canonical Wnt pathway activator, glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor and then subjected to load. These in vivo results were further corroborated by in vitro mechanical loading experiments in which MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were subjected to 3400 microstrain alone for 5 h, which increased the expression of Wnt10B, SFRP1, cyclin D1, FzD2, WISP2, and connexin 43. Furthermore, when MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with either glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor or Wnt3A to activate Wnt signaling and then subjected to load, a synergistic up-regulation of these genes was observed compared with vehicle-treated cells. Collectively, the in vivo and in vitro mechanical loading results support that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a normal physiological response to load and that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway enhances the sensitivity of osteoblasts/osteocytes to mechanical loading."

https://openalex.org/W2082625064,"We examined the osteoblast/osteocyte expression and function of polycystin-1 (PC1), a transmembrane protein that is a component of the polycystin-2 (PC2)-ciliary mechano-sensor complex in renal epithelial cells. We found that MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and MLO-Y4 osteocytes express transcripts for PC1, PC2, and the ciliary proteins Tg737 and Kif3a. Immunohistochemical analysis detected cilia-like structures in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic and MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cell lines as well as primary osteocytes and osteoblasts from calvaria. Pkd1m1Bei mice have inactivating missense mutations of Pkd1 gene that encode PC1. Pkd1m1Bei homozygous mutant mice demonstrated delayed endochondral and intramembranous bone formation, whereas heterozygous Pkd1m1Bei mutant mice had osteopenia caused by reduced osteoblastic function. Heterozygous and homozygous Pkd1m1Bei mutant mice displayed a gene dose-dependent decrease in the expression of Runx2 and osteoblast-related genes. In addition, overexpression of constitutively active PC1 C-terminal constructs in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts resulted in an increase in Runx2 P1 promoter activity and endogenous Runx2 expression as well as an increase in osteoblast differentiation markers. Conversely, osteoblasts derived from Pkd1m1Bei homozygous mutant mice had significant reductions in endogenous Runx2 expression, osteoblastic markers, and differentiation capacity ex vivo. Co-expression of constitutively active PC1 C-terminal construct into Pkd1m1Bei homozygous osteoblasts was sufficient to normalize Runx2 P1 promoter activity. These findings are consistent with a possible functional role of cilia and PC1 in anabolic signaling in osteoblasts/osteocytes."

MDM2 and MDMX are both p53-binding proteins that regulate p53 stability and activity. Recent development of the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin 3 has greatly facilitated functional analysis of MDM2-p53 binding. We found that although MDMX is homologous to MDM2 and binds to the same region on p53 N terminus, Nutlin does not disrupt p53-MDMX interaction. The ability of Nutlin to activate p53 is compromised in tumor cells overexpressing MDMX. Combination of Nutlin with MDMX siRNA resulted in synergistic activation of p53 and growth arrest. These results suggest that MDMX is also a valid target for p53 activation in tumor cells. Development of novel compounds that are MDMX-specific or optimized for dual-inhibition of MDM2 and MDMX are necessary to achieve full activation of p53 in tumor cells.

Development of novel compounds that are MDMX-specific or optimized for dual-inhibition of MDM2 and MDMX are necessary to achieve full activation of p53 in tumor cells. p53 is a transcription factor mutated in ∼50% of human tumors. In unstressed normal cells, p53 is present at very low levels due to rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. MDM2 is an important regulator of p53 turnover by binding p53 and acting as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Overexpression of MDM2 abrogates the ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In about 30% of human osteogenic sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas, MDM2 is overexpressed due to gene amplification. In tumors without MDM2 amplification, hyperactivation of MDM2 due to silencing of ARF expression also leads to p53 inactivation. Therefore, MDM2 is a key factor in tolerance of wild type p53 in nearly 50% of tumors, making it an attractive target for the development of novel anti-tumor agents (1Bond G.L. Hu W. Levine A.J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2005; 5: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).MDMX is a p53-binding protein with significant sequence homology to MDM2 (2Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G.

Unlike MDM2, MDMX does not have intrinsic E3 ligase activity and does not promote p53 degradation. However, MDMX binds to MDM2 through C-terminal RING domain interaction (4Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S.

MDMX-MDM2 interaction can also lead to ubiquitination and degradation of MDMX (8Pan Y. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5113-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 9Kawai H.

MDMX knock-out mice die in utero despite having endogenous MDM2 (11Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This suggests that MDMX has a unique role in regulating p53 during embryonic development. MDMX overexpression has been found in a number of primary tumors or tumor cell lines with wild-type p53 (12Danovi D. Meulmeester E. Pasini D. Migliorini D. Capra M. Frenk R. de Graaf P. Francoz S.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1839-1842PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that MDMX may contribute to p53 inactivation during tumorigenesis.MDM2 and MDMX are both targeted by stress signaling pathways that activate p53. DNA damage by ionizing irradiation induces phosphorylation of MDM2 by ATM and c-Abl kinases and inhibits its ability to ubiquitinate p53. Recent studies showed that DNA damage also induces MDMX phosphorylation at the C-terminal region by ATM (14Pereg Y. Shkedy D. de Graaf P. Meulmeester E. Edelson-Averbukh M. Salek M. Biton S. Teunisse A.F. Lehmann W.D. Jochemsen A.G. Shiloh Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), Chk1 (15Jin Y. Dai M.S. Lu S.Z. Xu Y. Luo Z.

Mitogenic stress also induces MDMX degradation through induction of ARF expression. ARF binding to MDM2 selectively blocks p53-ubiquitination but promotes ubiquitination of MDMX (8Pan Y. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5113-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of MDM2 in complex with an N-terminal peptide of p53 showed that the p53 peptide forms an amphipathic α-helix that interacts with a hydrophobic pocket on MDM2 (21Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). This model suggests that small molecules may be able to specifically compete for MDM2 binding and activate p53. Phage display has been used to identify peptides that can inhibit MDM2 p53 binding with IC50 at the 100 nm level in vitro (22Bottger V. Bottger A. Howard S.F. Picksley S.M. Chene P. Garcia-Echeverria C. Hochkeppel H.K. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2141-2147PubMed Google Scholar). High throughput screening resulted in the recent development of Nutlins, which are cis-imidazoline analogs that can inhibit p53-MDM2 binding with IC50 of 100–300 nm. Nutlin 3 showed the ability to activate p53 in cell culture at a concentration of 5–10 μm and inhibit tumor growth when given orally at 200 mg/kg (23Vassilev L.T. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), confirming the functional importance of MDM2-p53 interaction.Nutlin was identified based on its ability to inhibit MDM2-p53 binding. MDM2 and MDMX showed ∼80% similarity in their p53-binding domains. Previous study using peptide inhibitors suggested that the p53-binding site on MDMX is similar to MDM2 (24Bottger V. Bottger A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Ramos Y.F. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that MDM2 inhibitors should also cross-inhibit MDMX. Alternatively, elevated MDM2 levels following Nutlin treatment may be sufficient to degrade MDMX. Surprisingly, we found that Nutlin 3 is inactive for inhibition of MDMX-p53 binding and failed to induce MDMX degradation in several tumor cell lines. p53 activation by Nutlin 3 is compromised in cells overexpressing MDMX. Simultaneous targeting of MDM2 and MDMX cooperates to activate p53 in tumor cells and induces growth arrest. These results suggest that MDMX is also an important inhibitor of p53 in tumor cells and indicate a need to develop MDMX-specific inhibitors.MATERIALS AND METHODSELISA 2The abbreviations used are: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; siRNA, small interfering; IP, immunoprecipitation; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Assay—GST-MDM2 and GST-MDMX containing full-length human MDM2 and MDMX and His6-tagged human p53 were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity purified by binding to glutathione-agarose and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads under non-denaturing conditions. ELISA plates were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml His6-p53 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 16 h. After washing with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), the plates were blocked with PBS + 5% nonfat dry milk+0.1% Tween 20 (PBSMT) for 0.5 h. Compounds were dissolved in Me2SO. GST-HDM2 and MDMX (5 μg/ml) were mixed with compounds in PBSMT + 10% glycerol + 10 mm dithiothreitol and added to the wells. The plates were washed with PBST after incubating for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with MDM2 antibody 5B10 and MDMX antibody 8C6 in PBSMT for 1 h, followed by washing and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-rabbit-anti-mouse Ig antibody for 1 h. The plates were developed by incubation with TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL) and measured by absorbance at 450 nm.GST Pulldown Assay—[35S]Methionine-labeled MDMX and MDM2 were generated using the TNT in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega). Five microliters of the translation products were mixed and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads loaded with ∼10 μg of E. coli produced GST-p53 mutants in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and bound MDMX and MDM2 were detected by auto fluorography.Western Blot—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and the insoluble debris were discarded. Cell lysate (10–50 μg of protein) was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P filters (Millipore). The following antibodies were used: 3G9 for MDM2; 8C6 for MDMX; DO-1 for p53; p21 antibody (Oncogene Research Products); p53 phospho-Ser-15 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The filter was developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Lines and Reagents—Tumor cell lines A549 (lung), U2OS (bone), SJSA (bone, MDM2 amplification), MCF-7 (breast), JEG3 (placenta), and HCT116-p53+/+ and HCT116-p53–/– (colon) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. All MDMX constructs used in this study were based on human cDNA clones. To inhibit MDMX expression by RNA interference, double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′GATCCCGTGATGATACCGATGTAGATTCAAGAGATCTACATCGGTATCATCACTTTTTTGGAAA, MDMX sequence underlined) was cloned into the pSilencer vector (OligoEngine). Cells were transfected with the MDMX shRNA plasmid and selected with 0.5–1 μg/ml puromycin to obtain the clonal cell line used in Fig. 4a. To transiently inhibit MDMX expression, cells were transfected with 200 nm control siRNA (AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) and MDMX siRNA (AGATTCAGCTGGTTATTAA) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with Nutlin for 16 h and analyzed. Lentivirus vector expressing MDMX was generated using the ViraPower™ T-REx™ system (Invitrogen). Tetracycline-inducible expression of MDMX was achieved by first infecting cells with the T-REX regulator lentivirus and selection with Blasticidin, followed by infection with the MDMX lentivirus and selection with Zeocin. MDMX expression was induced with 0.1–1 μg/ml tetracycline. Nutlin 3 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI).RESULTSNutlin Inhibits the Binding of p53 to MDM2 but Not to MDMX—Nutlin 3 was developed to target MDM2 and appears to activate p53 specifically by disrupting MDM2-p53 binding. It does not cause DNA damage-related stress and phosphorylation of p53 (25Thompson T. Tovar C. Yang H. Carvajal D. Vu B.T. Xu Q. Wahl G.M. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53015-53022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our experiments also confirmed that Nutlin inhibits MDM2-p53 binding in vitro and induces p53 target gene expression and cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent fashion at concentrations of 2–10 μm (Figs. 1a and 2a and data not shown). To determine whether Nutlin also disrupts MDMX-p53 interaction, an ELISA assay was used to detect binding between immobilized His6-p53 and free GST-MDM2 or GST-MDMX. As expected, Nutlin inhibited p53-MDM2 binding with IC50 of ∼800 nm (Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, MDMX-p53 interaction was completely resistant to Nutlin at concentrations up to 30 μm, which is close to its solubility limit in the ELISA assay (Fig. 1b). As a positive control, a previously developed peptide optimized for binding to MDM2 (12/1) inhibited both MDM2 and MDMX (∼4-fold less efficient for MDMX) (24Bottger V. Bottger A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Ramos Y.F. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, MDMX is at least 40-fold less sensitive to inhibition by Nutlin compared with MDM2. To test whether Nutlin can inhibit MDMX-p53 binding in vivo, JEG3 and MCF7 cells expressing high levels of endogenous MDMX were treated with Nutlin or MG132. p53 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and probed with MDM2 or MDMX antibodies. Coprecipitation of MDM2 with p53 was blocked by Nutlin, whereas MDMX-p53 co-IP was completely unaffected (Fig. 1c). Therefore, Nutlin failed to inhibit MDMX-p53 binding in vitro and in vivo.FIGURE 1MDMX-p53 binding is resistant to disruption by Nutlin. a and b, Nutlin and control peptides were tested in an ELISA assay of GST-MDM2 and GST-MDMX binding to immobilized His6-p53. Nutlin blocked MDM2-p53 binding but had no effect on MDMX-p53 interaction. The 12/1 peptide (MPRFMDYWEGLN) is a phage display-selected peptide optimized for binding to MDM2. Mutant control peptide (MPRAMDYAEGAN) contains triple alanine mutations of key hydrophobic residues (underlined). c, cells were treated with Nutlin for 8 h or MG132 for 4 h and analyzed by p53 IP-MDMX/MDM2 Western blot. Nutlin blocks MDM2-p53 co-IP but does not affect MDMX-p53 binding. d, glutathione beads were loaded with GST-p53 N-terminal fusion with point mutations and incubated with a mixture of in vitro translated MDM2 and MDMX. Binding affinity to MDM2 and MDMX was determined after washing, SDS-PAGE fractionation, and autofluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2Nutlin does not induce MDMX degradation. a, HCT116 cells with and without p53 were treated with Nutlin for 8 h and analyzed for expression levels of indicated markers. b, U2OS overexpressing stably transfected MDMX were treated with 8 μm Nutlin for 8 h or irradiated with 10 Gy for 4 h. MDMX was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with 8C6 followed by Western blot with PS342 antibody, which detects Chk2-phosphorylated Ser-342. c and d, cells were pretreated with 5 μm Nutlin for 4 h followed by γ irradiation for 4 h in the presence of Nutlin and analyzed for MDMX level and p53 activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether MDM2 and MDMX interactions with p53 have subtle differences that account for the different sensitivities to Nutlin, a panel of GST-p53 fusion proteins with point mutations and deletions in the transactivation domain were tested for binding to in vitro translated MDM2 and MDMX. MDM2 and MDMX were presented as a mixture to glutathione agarose beads loaded with GST-p53 mutants to compare the capture efficiency under identical binding and washing conditions. The results showed that the different p53 mutations reduced MDM2 and MDMX binding to the same extent (Fig. 1d). Therefore, MDM2 and MDMX interact with the same amino acid residues on p53. However, the ability of Nutlin to block p53 binding is significantly different, presumably due to lower binding affinity of Nutlin to MDMX.MDM2 Induced by Nutlin Does Not Cause MDMX Degradation in Tumor Cells—MDMX can be rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by MDM2 in cotransfection experiments or in cells treated with ionizing irradiation (8Pan Y. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5113-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Nutlin treatment induces MDM2 expression due to activation of p53, which is expected to lead to degradation of MDMX. However, we found that in several cell lines (JEG3, MCF7, HCT116, U2OS) the MDMX level did not decrease despite an increase in MDM2 level (Fig. 2). On the contrary, a moderate increase in MDMX level was often observed after treatment with Nutlin (Fig. 2, c and d). Analysis of MDMX mRNA level by semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed no increase in MDMX transcription level. Furthermore, MDMX half-life analysis by cycloheximide block did not reveal a significant change in protein stability (data not shown). These results ruled out the possibility that increased MDMX transcription compensated for rapid degradation by MDM2.Recent studies showed that efficient degradation of MDMX by MDM2 requires DNA damage induced phosphorylation at multiple serine residues (14Pereg Y. Shkedy D. de Graaf P. Meulmeester E. Edelson-Averbukh M. Salek M. Biton S. Teunisse A.F. Lehmann W.D. Jochemsen A.G. Shiloh Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Chen L. Gilkes D.M. Pan Y. Lane W.S. Chen J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3411-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation-specific antibody against a Chk2 site on MDMX (S342) and ATM site on p53 (S15) did not detect significant increase of phosphorylation on these residues following Nutlin treatment (Fig. 2b). This was consistent with a recent report that Nutlin does not induce DNA damage (25Thompson T. Tovar C. Yang H. Carvajal D. Vu B.T. Xu Q. Wahl G.M. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53015-53022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To test whether MDMX phosphorylation following irradiation was sufficient to sensitize degradation by MDM2 after Nutlin treatment, cells were treated with Nutlin in combination with 1–8 Gy γ irradiation. The results showed that γ irradiation cooperated with Nutlin in the induction of p21 and MDM2 expression. However, MDMX degradation following irradiation and Nutlin treatment was not more efficient than irradiation alone (Fig. 2, c and d). Therefore, MDMX phosphorylation is not the rate-limiting factor that prevents degradation by Nutlin-induced MDM2. These observations suggest the presence of additional unidentified mechanisms that control MDMX degradation by MDM2.The Ability of Nutlin to Activate p53 and Inhibit Proliferation Is Compromised by MDMX—Because Nutlin does not inhibit MDMX-p53 binding or cause significant degradation of MDMX, its ability to activate p53 may be affected by the level of MDMX and MDMX/p53 ratio after stabilization of p53. Previous studies of Nutlin often used the SJSA cell line with amplified MDM2 but a very low levels of MDMX. To determine whether the ability of Nutlin to activate p53 is attenuated by MDMX overexpression, cell lines with different MDMX levels were compared. The results suggested a correlation between high MDMX level and reduced p53 activation and p21WAF1 induction (Fig. 3a). When the ability of Nutlin to induce cell cycle arrest was analyzed by MTT and FACS assays, MDMX-overexpressing cell lines also showed reduced growth arrest (Fig. 3, b and c). In a 7-day colony formation assay, continuous presence of Nutlin failed to inhibit the growth of JEG3 or U2OS cells transfected with MDMX (data not shown). Therefore, Nutlin is less effective against tumor cells overexpressing MDMX.FIGURE 3MDMX overexpression prevents p53 activation by Nutlin. a, cell lines expressing different levels of endogenous MDMX were treated with Nutlin for 8 h and analyzed for p53 activation by Western blot. b, cell lines plated at low density were treated with Nutlin for 48 h, and cell proliferation were determined by MTT assay. c, cells were treated with 5 μm Nutlin for 8 h and analyzed by FACS. The S phase population is shown. d, U2OS cells expressing tetracycline-inducible MDMX were treated with Nutlin and different concentrations of tetracycline for 8 h, and p53 activation markers were analyzed by Western blot. e and f, quantitative sequestration of Nutlin-stabilized p53 by endogenous MDMX in JEG3 cells. Cells were subjected to two consecutive rounds of IP using MDMX or MDM2 antibodies to detect MDMX-bound or MDM2-bound p53, followed by p53 IP to detect free p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further test the effect of MDMX overexpression on p53 activation by Nutlin, U2OS cells expressing tetracycline-inducible MDMX were treated with Nutlin. A physiologically relevant increase in MDMX level (lower than JEG3 cells) resulted in significant reduction of p21 expression after Nutlin treatment (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, MDMX overexpression in U2OS cells by stable transfection (∼30-fold above endogenous level, ∼5-fold above JEG3 level) completely blocked p21 induction by Nutlin (Fig. 4a). These results showed that p53 activation by Nutlin is attenuated by MDMX overexpression, most likely due to inability of Nutlin to inhibit MDMX-p53 binding.MDMX has been shown to cooperate with MDM2 to promote p53 degradation (6Linares L.K. Hengstermann A. Ciechanover A. Muller S. Scheffner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), although its effect on p53 stability is moderate compared with MDM2 (26Francoz S. Froment P. Bogaerts S. De Clercq S. Maetens M. Doumont G. Bellefroid E. Marine J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In our experiments, MDMX overexpression or knockdown also showed a moderate effect on p53 stabilization by Nutlin (Figs. 3d and 4a), suggesting that it also prevents p53 activation by mechanisms unrelated to degradation. To determine the amount of stabilized p53 that was bound to MDMX, JEG3 cells were treated with Nutlin and analyzed by MDMX immunodepletion and p53 Western blot to quantitate the free and MDMX-bound p53. The results showed that ∼30–50% of p53 in JEG3 cells was bound to MDMX, and this ratio was not altered by Nutlin (Fig. 3e). This is likely a conservative estimate of the fraction of MDMX-bound p53, since some of the complexes are expected to dissociate during washing. In contrast, only a negligible fraction of p53 was depleted using MDM2 antibody (Fig. 3f), suggesting that MDM2 mainly acts by degrading p53 in this cell line. Therefore, in MDMX-overexpressing cells, a large fraction of p53 stabilized by Nutlin was stoichiometrically sequestered by MDMX into non-functional complexes. These results suggest that MDMX inactivates p53 by a combination of effects on its stability and activity.MDMX Knockdown Cooperates with Nutlin to Activate p53—Since Nutlin does not inhibit MDMX-p53 binding, we tested whether combining Nutlin with MDMX siRNA results in more efficient activation of p53. A U2OS clonal cell line with stable knockdown of MDMX (∼80% reduction) was generated by stable transfection with an MDMX shRNA plasmid. U2OS cells apparently can tolerate a significant reduction of MDMX and the consequent small increase in p53 and p21 levels in normal cell culture. Additionally, an overexpression cell line (∼30-fold above endogenous level) was created by stable transfection with MDMX cDNA plasmid. These modifications did not lead to significant changes in the rates of cell proliferation.When the modified U2OS cell lines were treated for 24 h with Nutlin, p53 in cells with reduced MDMX level was more efficiently activated by low concentrations of Nutlin, resulting in higher levels of p21 induction and more efficient growth arrest in a 4 day MTT assay (Fig. 4, a and b). Overexpression of MDMX abrogated p21 induction without blocking p53 stabilization by Nutlin. To confirm the results using stable MDMX shRNA, MCF7 and JEG3 cells were also transiently transfected with a synthetic MDMX siRNA followed by treatment with Nutlin. Significantly stronger induction of p21 and Bax expression were observed after transient knockdown of MDMX, whereas Apaf-1 induction was less predictable (Fig. 4, c and d). MDMX knockdown cooperated with Nutlin to induce more efficient growth arrest; no significant increase in apoptosis was observed (Fig. 4e). These results suggested that simultaneous targeting of both MDM2 and MDMX is needed to fully activate p53 in a subset of tumor cells expressing high levels of MDMX. However, the decision between cell cycle arrest or apoptosis after p53 activation is unlikely to be determined by MDMX alone.DISCUSSIONPrevious study using peptides isolated from phage display concluded that MDM2 and MDMX have similar p53-binding sites, since the peptides isolated using MDM2 as a target also inhibits MDMX. Here we show that different point mutations in the p53 N-terminal region have identical effects in disrupting MDM2 and MDMX binding to p53. These observations suggest that the overall p53-binding surface on MDM2 and MDMX are indeed very similar when interacting with long peptide sequences. However, MDM2 and MDMX have surprising differences in the sensitivity to small molecules such as Nutlin. MDMX is also insensitive to a different class of small molecule MDM2 inhibitors that are α-helical mimics based on the terphenyl scaffold (27Chen L. Yin H. Farooqi B. Sebti S. Hamilton A.D. Chen J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 3B. Hu, D. M. Gilkes, B. Farooqi, S. M. Sebti, and J. Chen, unpublished observations. These results suggest that small molecule inhibitors require more precise fit with their targets or demand certain conformational changes to achieve the tight binding through a small contact area. In such cases, minor differences in structure or flexibility of MDM2 and MDMX result in large differences in affinity for Nutlin.The lack of MDMX down-regulation upon MDM2 induction by Nutlin suggests that MDM2 level is not rate-limiting for MDMX degradation in the cell lines tested. Recent studies showed that although MDM2 is necessary for ubiquitination and degradation of MDMX, the efficiency of degradation is under complex control. MDMX phosphorylation, 14-3-3 binding, ARF expression, and interaction with the de-ubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP have all been implicated in promoting MDMX degradation. Abnormalities in these or additional pathways may be responsible for the inability of Nutlin to down-regulate MDMX. Further investigation of these defects will be critical since inability to degrade MDMX will reduce the efficacy of Nutlin as a single agent in therapeutic applications.The critical role of MDMX during mouse embryonic development is well established. However, its function in adult tissue is highly organ-specific (28Xiong S. Van Pelt C.S. Elizondo-Fraire A.C. Liu G. Lozano G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3226-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The significance of MDMX in human cancer development and treatment response is still an area of active investigation.

To determine the role of oxygen tension in chondrocyte differentiation and function, we investigated the influence of oxygen tension in the pluripotent mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 and 14.5E mice embryo forelimb organ culture. 10T1/2 cells and embryo forelimbs were cultured under normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (5% O2) in the presence of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2. To elucidate the mechanism by which oxygen tension influences chondrocyte differentiation, the Smad pathway was examined using Smad6 overexpression adenovirus and Smad6 transgenic mice embryo forelimbs. The p38 MAPK pathway was examined using dominant-negative MKK3 and FR167653, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor. The transcriptional activities of Sox9 and Runx2 were also investigated. Hypoxia promoted bone morphogenetic protein 2-induced glycosaminoglycan production and suppressed alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization of C3H10T1/2. Thus, hypoxia promoted chondrocytic commitment rather than osteoblastic differentiation. In the mice embryo forelimb organ culture, hypoxia increased cartilaginous matrix synthesis. These effects were primarily mediated by p38 MAPK activation, independent of Sox9. Hypoxia inhibited Col10a1 (type X collagen α1) expression via down-regulation of Runx2 activity by Smad suppression and histone deacetylase 4 activation. In conclusion, hypoxia promotes chondrocytic differentiation and cartilage matrix synthesis and suppresses terminal chondrocyte differentiation. These hypoxia-induced phenomena may act on chondrocytes to enhance and preserve their phenotype and function during chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral ossification.

These hypoxia-induced phenomena may act on chondrocytes to enhance and preserve their phenotype and function during chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral ossification. A number of pathophysiological findings suggest that a correlation exists between hypoxia and chondrogenesis. For example, articular cartilage is an avascular tissue that functions at an oxygen tension that is lower than that of most other tissues. Articular cartilage derives both its nutrition and oxygen supply by diffusion from the synovial fluid and the subchondral bone. It has been estimated that articular chondrocytes in the deepest layers may have access to no more than 1-6% O2 (1Falchuk K.H. Goetzl E.J. Kulka J.P. Am. J. Med. 1970; 49: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Olesen L.L. Arthritis Rheum. 1970; 13: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Treuhaft P.S.

Furthermore, although the majority of mammalian cells derive their energy by using oxygen for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (7Lee N.H. Shapiro I.M. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1974; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), few mitochondria are present in articular chondrocytes (8Brighton C.T. Kitajima T. Hunt R.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1984; 27: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate breakdown in articular cartilage is dominated by the conversion of glucose to lactate via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (9Martcus R.E.

J. 1997; 321: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) that consumes no O2. Similarly, during the endochondral ossification processes that occur in the growth plate, chondromodulin-1, an endogenous inhibitor of neovascularization, is highly expressed by chondrocytes. Of note, most of the growth plate is avascular (12Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Iyama K. Kamizono A. Ochiai M. Shukunami C. Iijima S. Suzuki F. Kondo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32419-32426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, in an in vivo experiment, it was found that hypoxia-inducible factor 1, which appears to be one of the major regulators of the hypoxic response, is essential for chondrocyte growth arrest and survival (13Scipani E. Ryan H.E. Didrickson S. Kobayashi T. Knight M. Johnson R.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2865-2876PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, hypoxia is considered to be a key factor for the growth and survival of chondrocytes. Chondrocytes are derived from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that have the potential for multidirectional differentiation (14Johnstone B. Hering T.M. Caplan A.I. Goldberg V.M. Yoo J.U. Exp.

BMP-2 activates Smad1-Smad5-Smad8, which subsequently associates with Smad4, relocates to the nucleus, and regulates the expression of target genes (22Helden C.H. Miyazono K. Dijke P.

However, the influence of oxygen tension on BMP-Smad signaling remains to be elucidated. In addition to the Smad signaling pathway, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) is also activated by BMP-2 (24Iwasaki S. Iguchi M. Watanabe K. Hosono R. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol.

Of particular interest, hypoxia has been found to be one of the stresses that can phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPK (31Zhu Y. Mao X.O. Sun Y. Xia Z. Greenberg D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22909-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although p38 MAPK has been shown to be implicated in the regulation of chondrogenesis (32Watanabe H. Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Lim Y.B. Kang S.S. An W.G. Lee Y.S. Chun J.S. Sonn J.K. J. Cell.

During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy and secrete an extracellular matrix that becomes mineralized and allows vascular invasion and osteoblast differentiation (35Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 36Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). To date, Runx2 and Runx3 (runt-related transcriptional factors 2 and 3) have essential roles in inducing chondrocyte hypertrophy; furthermore, these two interact closely (37Inada M. Yasui T. Nomura S. Miyake S. Deguchi K. Himeno M. Sato M. Yamagiwa H. Kimura T. Yasui N. Ochi T. Endo N. Kitamura Y. Kishimoto T. Komori T. Dev.

Takada K. Ito Y. Komori T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In addition, Runx2 is probably a direct transcriptional activator of chondrocyte maturation. It binds in vivo to multiple recognition sites in the Col10a1 promoter and activates Col10a1 reporter constructs through these elements in vitro (41Zheng Q. Zhou G. Morello R. Chen Y. Garcia-Rojas X. Lee B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Runx2 is also necessary for osteoblast differentiation (42Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K.

Runx2 transcriptional activity has been shown to be positively regulated both by the Smad pathway and by the p38 MAPK pathway (44Leboy P. Grasso-Knight G. D'Angelo M. Volk S.W. Lian J.V. Drissi H.

HDAC4, a member of the class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), is expressed in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes and regulates chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral bone formation by interacting with Runx2. Recently, HDAC4 has been found to inhibit Runx2 expression by repressing its positive feedback mechanism and inhibiting Runx2 activity (47Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E.

Although hypoxia has been shown to down-regulate Runx2 expression in osteoblasts (48Park J.H. Park B.H. Kim H.K. Park T.S. Baek H.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 192: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether Runx2 is involved in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation and function by oxygen tension. In the present study, we assessed the influence of oxygen tension on chondrocytic differentiation and cartilage matrix synthesis in the C3H10T1/2 pluripotent mesenchymal cell line and the N1511 murine chondrocyte cell line. We used the mouse embryo organ culture system with wild type mice and Smad6 transgenic mice that we had previously generated. In this paper, we show that hypoxia promotes chondrocytic commitment and cartilage matrix production via the p38 MAPK pathway but that hypoxia inhibits terminal differentiation via the Smad pathway and HDAC4 activation. Cell Culture and Analysis for Chondrocytic, Osteoblastic, and Adipocytic Differentiation—C3HT101/2 cells were obtained from RIKEN (Saitama, Japan) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Since it has been estimated that articular chondrocytes in the deepest layers may have access to no more than 1-6% O2, we selected 5% O2 as the hypoxic environment for the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 20% O2 (normoxia) or 5% CO2 and 5% O2 (hypoxia) with or without recombinant human BMP-2. BMP-2 stimulation was added at 90% confluence. To evaluate chondrocytic differentiation, C3H10T1/2 cells were fixed with 10% formalin, washed with distilled water and 0.1 n HCl, and then stained with Alcian blue solution, Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma). We also cultured N1511 murine chondrocytes (49Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and stained with Alcian blue. For the quantitative analysis of chondrocytic differentiation, the absorbance of Alcian blue dyes bound to sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) was measured (50Lim Y.B. Kang S.S. Park T.K. Lee Y.S. Chum J.S. Sonn J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate. To determine osteoblastic differentiation, the C3H10T1/2 cells were fixed with 10% formalin, washed with PBS (pH 7.4) twice, and incubated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) substrate solution, 0.1 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX (Sigma), and 0.6 mg/ml fast violet B salt (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The activity of ALP was also measured using an ALP test kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instruction. To evaluate matrix mineralization, the cultures were stained with alizarin red solution (Sigma) (pH 6.0) and incubated in 100 mm cetylpyridinium chloride for 1 h to solubilize and release calcium-bound alizarin red S into solution. The absorbance of the released alizarin red S was measured (51Ratisoontorn C. Seto M.L. Broughton K.M. Cunningham M.L. Bone. 2005; 36: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine adipocytic differentiation, the C3H10T1/2 cells were fixed in 10% formalin, washed with diluted water and 60% isopropyl alcohol, and stained with Oil red O (Sigma) solution. Quantitative analysis for oil droplet was performed as described previously (52Sen A. Lea-Currie Y.R. Sujkowska D. Franklin D.M. Wilkison W.O. Halvorsen Y.D. Gimble J.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 26: 312-319Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To measure the value of absorbance for alcian blue, alizarin red, and oil red O relative to cell density, the absorbance data were normalized by total DNA content. Total DNA content was extracted using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany) and measured. Cell proliferation analysis was also performed. C3H10T1/2 and N1511 cells were cultured in flat bottomed 96-well microplates at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 7 days, cell viability was assessed by cell proliferation assay system kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), using the sulfonated tetrazolium salt 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium (WST-1).

After 5 days, limb explants were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin. Serial 3-μm-thick sections from the wild type mice (n = 6) and the transgenic mice (n = 5) were processed for safranin O staining and in situ hybridization. Briefly, sections were stained with hematoxylin (Sigma) and fast green (Merck) to identify cells and with safranin-O (Sigma) to identify GAGs. Computer-assisted histological analysis for the proportion of the GAG production area per whole radius was performed using a Nikon ECLIPSE E1000 microscope with a Plan Apo objective, combined with a Nikon DXM 1200 Digital Camera (Tokyo, Japan) and WinRoof image processing software (Mitani Corp.) for Windows. Digitized pictures taken for each radius were analyzed to calculate the ratio of the area stained with safranin-O per whole radius. In situ hybridization for Col10a1 was done as described previously (53Horiki M. Imamura T. Okamoto M. Hayashi M. Murai J. Myoui A. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Yoshikawa H. Tsumaki N. J.

The proportional length of the hypertrophic positive signal of Col10a1 with respect to the whole hypertrophic chondrocyte zone along the midline was calculated. The care and handling of the animals and the procedures used in this study were in accordance with the guidelines of and were approved by the Osaka University Medical School Animal Care and Use Committee. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-phospho-Smad 1/5/8 monoclonal antibody, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK polyclonal antibody, and anti-p38 MAPK monoclonal antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-Smad 1/5 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-Sox9 antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-HDAC4, anti-β-actin, and antiproliferating cell nuclear antigen polyclonal or monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Hoechst 33342 solution was purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). Recombinant human BMP-2 and a potent p38 MAPK inhibitor, FR167653, were provided by Astellas Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). DNA Constructs—Wild type Smad6 (WT-Smad6)-expressing adenovirus and the dominant negative form of MKK3 (DN-MKK3) vector were donated by Dr. Riko Nishimura (Department of Biochemistry, Osaka University Graduate School, Faculty of Dentistry). Wild type Runx2-expressing vector was donated by Dr. Toshihisa Komori (Department of Developmental and Reconstructive Medicine, Division of Oral Cytology and Cell Biology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Bio-medical Sciences). Reporter Constructs and Luciferase Reporter Assay—Four tandems of 48-bp chondrocyte-specific enhancer segments of type II collagen α1 (Col2a1) were synthesized as previously reported (58Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhaoping Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the PGL3 promoter vector (Promega), 4Col2E-Luc. Six tandems of the Runx2 binding site were also inserted into the PGL3 promoter vector (Promega), 6Runx2E-Luc. Reporter assays were performed by transient transfection of 0.4 μg of the PGL3-promoter vector (4Col2E-Luc or 6Runx2E-Luc) and 0.01 μg of the TK-Renilla luciferase construct (TK Renilla) (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega) and luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) and normalized by determining the activity of Renilla luciferase. All experiments were performed in triplicate. RNA Interference—RNA interference was done using commercially synthesized siRNA (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany) and used as described in the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Cells were treated with siRNA to a final concentration of 10 μm. The siRNA duplex sequence targeting the HDAC4 protein was aauguacgacgccaaagautt (sense strands), as previously described (59Chauchereau A. Mathieu M. de Saintignon J. Ferreira R. Pritchard L.L. Mishal Z. Dejean A. Harel-Bellan A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8777-8784Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Control siRNA consisted of siRNA targeted against luciferase (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Phosphorylation of Sox9—Serine/threonine phosphorylation of Sox9 was analyzed by affinity chromatography using a phosphoprotein purification kit (Qiagen). Cells were lysed using the lysis buffer provided in the kit. The extracted protein was applied to a phosphorylation purification column, and phosphorylated protein was eluted. Unphosphorylated protein was obtained from the flow-through fraction. These samples were blotted with anti-Sox9 antibody. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed using whole cell lysates. To detect HDAC4 protein, nuclear extracts were obtained as previously reported (60Ito K. Hanazawa T. Tomita K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The MC3T3-E1 cell (mouse osteoblastic cell) was used as a control. The blots were first incubated with appropriate antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse or rabbit IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). For the blots, 20 μg of each sample was applied. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from C3H10T1/2 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The blots were hybridized with probes for Col2a1, Col10a1, Sox9, and Runx2 mRNA. 32P-Radiolabeled DNA probes were synthesized using cDNA obtained from reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification. The following primers were used: Col2a1 (forward primer, 5′-CCTGTCTGCTTCTTGTAAAAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAAAAATACAGAGGTGTTTGACACAGA-3′), Col10a1 (forward primer, 5′-AATCTCATAAATGGGATGGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCTGGGTTAGATGGAAAA-3′), Sox9 (forward primer, 5′-ATGAATCTCCTGGACCCCTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AACTTTGCCAGCTTGCACGT-3′), Runx2 (forward primer, 5′-GCTTGATGACTCTAAACCTA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAAAAGGGCCCAGTTCTGAA-3′). PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis—First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The PCR was performed using Ex Taq (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). The primers for the Runx2 gene were the same as those used for Northern blotting. The GAPDH primers included the forward primer (5′-TGAACGGGAAGCTCACTGG-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—We obtained cDNA by reverse transcription as mentioned above and proceeded with real time PCR using the Roche Applied Science Light Cycler® system. The SYBR® Green assay, in which each cDNA sample was evaluated in triplicate 20-μl reactions, was used for all target transcripts. Expression values were normalized to GAPDH. The primers for the Runx2 and GAPDH genes were the same as above. The Sox9 primers were as follows: forward, 5′-ATGAATCTCCTGGACCCCTT-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGGGGAAGGTGTTCTCCT-3′. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were assessed using Student's t test, and differences among three or more groups were assessed by post hoc testing. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Hypoxia Promotes Chondrocytic Differentiation and GAG Production, whereas It Suppresses Osteoblastic Differentiation and Chondrocyte Terminal Differentiation in C3H10T1/2 Cell Culture—In C3H10T1/2 cell culture, BMP-2 induced GAG production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). At every BMP-2 concentration tested, hypoxia clearly increased GAG content additively with BMP-2. Hypoxia-induced GAG synthesis was also found in the N1511 murine chondrocyte culture (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, low oxygen tension clearly suppressed ALP activity and alizarin red staining of C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that hypoxia suppressed BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Adipocytic differentiation, as identified by oil red O staining, was not affected by oxygen tension (Fig. 1E). After cell density became confluent, there was no difference of the cell proliferation between normoxia and hypoxia at 7 days in C3H10T1/2 cells and N1511 cells (Fig. 1F). The type II collagen α1 (Col2a1) gene, a well characterized, specific marker of commitment to the chondrogenic lineage, was up-regulated by BMP-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1G) as well as by hypoxia at each BMP-2 concentration tested. The mRNA expression of the type X collagen α1 (Col10a1) gene, a well characterized, specific marker for chondrocyte terminal differentiation (61Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9504-9509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 62Gibson G.J. Flint M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), was suppressed by hypoxia (Fig. 1H), in contrast to Col2a1 mRNA expression. Hypoxia-induced GAG Production Is Mediated by the p38 MAPK Pathway rather than the Smad Pathway—To investigate the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms responsible for hypoxia-induced chondrocyte differentiation, we first examined the activities of the Smad and the p38 MAPK pathways. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is up-regulated by hypoxia, whereas phosphorylation of Smad is down-regulated. When Smad signaling was inhibited by the overexpression of WT-Smad6, which inhibits phosphorylation of the Smad1-Smad5-Smad8 complex, BMP-2-induced GAG production was markedly reduced under both oxygen levels. However, hypoxia was still able to promote GAG production despite Smad inhibition (Fig. 2C). In contrast, hypoxia-induced GAG production was abolished by the over-expression of DN-MKK3 that specifically inhibits p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 2D) and also by FR167653, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 2E). When both the Smad and the p38 MAPK pathways were blocked by Smad6 overexpression and FR167653, hypoxia did not influence the GAG production level (Fig. 2F). Regulatory Mechanisms of Col2a1 and Col10a1 Gene Expression by Oxygen Tension—Next, we assessed the role of the p38 MAPK and Smad pathways in the regulation of Col2a1 and Col10a1 gene expression. In the presence of FR167653, hypoxia-induced Col2a1 expression was suppressed (Fig. 2, G-1). However, when WT-Smad6 was overexpressed, although Col2a1 gene expression was suppressed under both oxygen conditions, hypoxia strongly induced the"

This is supported by the potent activation of P53 in tumor cells by Nutlin, a cis-imidazoline that inhibits the Hdm2-P53 interaction. The efficacy of Hdm2·P53 antagonists could be compromised if they do not antagonize Hdmx, an Hdm2 homolog that inhibits P53 transactivation. We evaluated the role of Hdmx expression in sensitivity to Nutlin in a range of cancer cell lines. Nutlin reduced Hdmx levels in normal cells and some cancer cell lines, whereas other cancer cells were refractory to such down-regulation. Strikingly, Nutlin did not disrupt Hdmx·P53 complexes, and in cell lines where no Hdmx degradation occurred, Nutlin failed to induce apoptosis. shRNA-mediated reduction of Hdmx sensitized cells to apoptosis, but caspase-3 was neither required nor sufficient for Hdmx degradation or apoptosis. Our data imply that Hdmx is an important determinant of the outcome of P53 activation. Thus, targeting Hdmx may be a therapeutic strategy that complements drugs such as Nutlin.

Novel tumor regression strategies include those designed to target cancer-specific molecular alterations. Drugs that inhibit pathways involved in proliferation, inhibition of cell death or metastasis are attractive candidates for targeted therapy. Conversely, small molecules that trigger apoptosis in tumor cells also hold great promise as novel chemotherapeutics. The P53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that can induce cell death or growth arrest via induction of numerous target genes (1Hoh J. Jin S. Parrado T. Edington J. Levine A.J. Ott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). The cell cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic functions of P53 are critical for tumor suppression, in part explaining why p53 is mutated in up to 50% of human cancers. However, the frequency at which p53 is mutated varies between tumors of different origins and within tumor types according to clinical stage (3Smith N.D. Rubenstein J.N. Eggener S.E. Kozlowski J.M. J Urol. 2003; 169: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Kmet L.M. Cook L.S. Magliocco A.M. Cancer. 2003; 97: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Ichikawa A. Hotta T. Saito H. Leuk Lymphoma. 1993; 11: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, in a substantial fraction of tumors there is no mutation of p53 itself, and re-activation of P53 function in these cancers represents a viable strategy for inducing tumor regression. Genetic studies indicate that the ubiquitin ligase H/Mdm2 is a major negative regulator of P53 (where H and M denote the human and murine homologs, respectively). Mdm2 knock-out is lethal, and is rescued by concomitant deletion of p53 (6Montes de Oca Lunaqq R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 7Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The two main functions of Hdm2 that attenuate P53 both involve Hdm2 binding to P53. First, Hdm2 can antagonize P53-mediated transactivation by binding the P53 N-terminal transactivation domain (8Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). Second, Hdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets P53 for proteasome-mediated degradation (9Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar, 10Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar), though the mechanisms remain to be elucidated (11Krummel K.A. Lee C.J. Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because the Hdm2 gene is P53-responsive, an autoregulatory loop is set up in which P53 levels are kept low in non-stressed conditions by Hdm2-mediated degradation. The Hdm2-related protein, Hdmx, is also a critical regulator of P53 activation. Like Mdm2 knock-out, Mdmx deficiency is also lethal in a P53-dependent manner (12Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Although Hdmx can bind to both Hdm2 and P53 (13Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), Hdmx is not a ubiquitin ligase, and is not a P53-regulated gene (14Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P.

Therefore, some of the molecular mechanisms by which Hdmx suppresses P53 activity are likely to be distinct from those utilized by Hdm2. Current data indicate that Hdmx can inhibit P53 transcriptional activity in vitro, and recent data from mouse models suggest that Mdmx is a more significant inhibitor of P53 transactivation than Mdm2 in vivo (16Francoz S. Froment P. Bogaerts S. De Clercq S. Maetens M. Doumont G. Bellefroid E. Marine J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Toledo F.

This may occur directly, because of Hdmx binding to the P53 transactivation domain, or indirectly via stimulation of Hdm2-dependent inhibition of P53 (18Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D.

Because both Hdm2 and Hdmx are overexpressed in many tumors that retain wild-type p53, they are appealing targets for therapeutic approaches. Numerous stresses perturb the P53/Hdm2 autoregulatory loop and lead to P53 stabilization, either by physical separation of Hdm2 from P53 or by inhibiting Hdm2-mediated P53 ubiquitination. For example, genotoxic insult activates damage-responsive kinases, such as ataxia telangectasia-mutated (ATM) 5The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia telangectasia-mutated; NCS, neocarzinostatin; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting. protein (reviewed in Ref. 20Lavin M.F. Birrell G. Chen P. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gueven N. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). ATM activates P53 in part by direct phosphorylation of P53 itself and also by destabilization and inhibition of Hdm2 (21Stommel J.M. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). ATM-dependent phosphorylation also triggers degradation of Hdmx in an Hdm2-dependent manner (22Meulmeester E. Maurice M.M.

A. 2005; 102: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, DNA damage potently stimulates P53 activity by eliminating interactions with its two main negative regulators. However, the use of genotoxins in chemotherapy is associated with undesirable side effects including nausea, alopecia and induction of secondary malignancies (24Schwartzberg L. J. Support. Oncol. 2006; 42: 3-8Google Scholar, 25Vega-Stromberg T. J. Infus. Nurs. 2003; 26: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is presumably because of induction of damage, as well as activation or repression of a plethora of other signaling pathways in normal and tumor cells by clastogenic agents. Recently, Vassilev et al. (26Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E.A. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3825) Google Scholar) developed a cis-imidazoline compound, Nutlin-3a, which binds to Hdm2 and inhibits its interaction with P53, resulting in increased P53 levels and transcriptional activity. Importantly, Nutlin-induced P53 activation is not associated with induction of DNA damage or damage-induced modifications of P53 (27Thompson T. Tovar C. Yang H. Carvajal D. Vu B.T. Xu Q. Wahl G.M. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53015-53022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As such, Nutlin represents a lead compound in the search for drugs that can specifically activate the P53 pathway in cancer. Recent findings indicate that Nutlin may be particularly effective in cancers that overexpress Hdm2 (28Tovar C. Rosinski J. Filipovic Z. Higgins B. Kolinsky K. Hilton H. Zhao X. Vu B.T. Qing W.

However, Nutlin is also able to induce apoptosis in myeloma and leukemia cells that do not overexpress Hdm2 (29Kojima K. Konopleva M. Samudio I.J. Shikami M. Cabreira-Hansen M. McQueen T. Ruvolo V. Tsao T. Zeng Z. Vassilev L.T. Andreeff M. Blood. 2005; 106: 3150-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 30Secchiero P. Barbarotto E. Tiribelli M. Zerbinati C. di Iasio M.G. Gonelli A.

The effectors of Nutlin-induced, P53-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis may vary according to cell and tumor type. For example, cell cycle arrest may be induced by p21CIP, a p53-responsive gene commonly up-regulated following Nutlin treatment (26Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z.

Fabius A.W. Mullenders J. Madiredjo M. Velds A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are indications that Nutlin increases levels of p53-responsive pro-apoptotic genes PUMA, PIG3, and bax in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (30Secchiero P. Barbarotto E. Tiribelli M. Zerbinati C. di Iasio M.G. Gonelli A. Cavazzini F. Campioni D. Fanin R. Cuneo A. Zauli G. Blood. 2006; 107: 4122-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 33Coll-Mulet L.

Blood. 2006; 107: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Still, the functional significance of each of these genes in Nutlin-induced apoptosis is unclear. Similarly, very little is known about factors that may be involved in preventing some cancer cells from undergoing Nutlin-induced apoptosis, with the exception of p53 mutation. Here, we show that Hdmx level can determine the biological response to Nutlin treatment. We find that high Hdmx level, or an inability to degrade Hdmx, can contribute to Nutlin resistance. Conversely, reduction of Hdmx can sensitize cells to Nutlin-induced, P53-dependent apoptosis. While Hdmx reduction did significantly increase activation of some P53 target genes, apoptotic genes such as Bax and PUMA were not among them. Additionally, while Hdm2 and Hdmx are structurally related in their P53 binding regions, we also show that Nutlin does not prevent Hdmx from binding to P53. These data indicate that Hdmx level is an important factor for the optimization of genotype-specific tumor therapies, and they suggest that Hdmx may affect the output of the P53 pathway by mechanisms both related to and independent of P53 transactivation.

The following antibodies were used for Western blotting: P53, DO1 (Calbiochem, mouse, 1:1000) or FL393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit, 1: 1500); Phospho-Ser15 P53, phosphospecific antiphospho-Ser15 (Cell Signaling Technology, rabbit, 1:1000); Hdmx, mouse monoclonal 8C6 (1:100 overnight), a kind gift from Jiangdong Chen, or BL1258 (Bethyl Laboratories, 1:10000, overnight); Hdm2, triple mouse monoclonal mixture of IF-2 (Calbiochem), SMP-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 4B2(Calbiochem) (1:500 each, overnight); p21, C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1500); actin, (rabbit, 1:20000, Sigma); full-length caspase-3, (rabbit, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used at 1:10,000 (Jackson Immunochemicals). For P21 immunofluorescence, monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories, KY, was used at 1:400. For immunoprecipitation analyses, cells were harvested on the plate in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl. 0.5% Nonidet P-40, with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor added immediately prior to use). Typically, 500 μg to 2 mg of protein were used for immunoprecipitation. The antibodies used were: DO1 or agarose bead-conjugated FL393 (P53), p55 rabbit polyclonal (for Hdmx, a kind gift of Aart Jochemsen), and IF2 (Hdm2). 2 μg of each antibody per milligram of protein was used, with the exception of p55 where 3 μl of the serum was used. Immobilized recombinant protein A was used for antibody pull-down, and immunoprecipitates were washed and eluted as described (21Stommel J.M. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). SYBR Green Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)—Total RNA was prepared using QiaShredder and RNeasy RNA isolation kits per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). 2 μg of total RNA per sample was used for cDNA synthesis with random hexamer primers, using SuperScriptIII Reverse Transcriptase system (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, using Platinum SYBR SuperMix (Invitrogen) with ROX as an internal standard. Changes in gene expression were normalized to 18 S mRNA. Primer sequences are included in the Supplementary Data. Lentiviral-mediated Hdmx Knockdown—Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) encoding the Hdmx knockdown construct, or a negative control shRNA targeting chicken MKP3 (a kind gift of Yasuhiko Kawakami) were ligated into pSUPER vector (a gift of R. Bernards) and subcloned into pCPPT-GFP vector (34Follenzi A. Ailles L.E. Bakovic S. Geuna M. Naldini L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). shRNA sequences are included in the Supplementary Data. For knockdown in MCF7, we infected parental MCF7 cells with lentivirus expressing shRNA against Hdmx or against MKP3. Lentivirus was produced by Lipofectamine2000 transfection of 293T cells at 90% confluence on 10-cm plates with the following: 10 μg of lentivirus-Hdmx, 5 μg of pMDLg/pRRE, 2.5 μg of RSV-Rev, and 3 μg of MD2.VSVG. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested 48–72 h post-transfection and pooled before filtering through a 0.45-μm filter. Aliquots were made and flash-frozen prior to titration in the target cell line by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells were infected by plating 105 cells in a 6-well plate and performing three rounds of infection in a total volume of 2 ml with 7 μg/ml polybrene. Apoptosis Measurements—Floating and adherent cells were harvested and apoptosis was quantified by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry to detect the sub-G1 population. Images of cells before and after treatments were taken using a Nikon Coolpix camera mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TS100 light microscope. Nutlin Does Not Disrupt Hdmx·P53 Complexes—Nutlin is a potent P53 activator in the cell lines analyzed thus far and was identified based on its ability to inhibit Hdm2-P53 interactions. Because Hdmx and Hdm2 have similar, though not identical, amino acids that interact with P53 (19Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35Bottger V. Bottger A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Ramos Y.F. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it is possible that Nutlin also prevents Hdmx-P53 interaction. We tested this by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in MCF7 cells as they express significant amounts of Hdmx (Fig. 1). In unstressed cells, a small fraction of Hdmx was bound to P53 (lane 4). In order to evaluate the binding of Hdm2 to P53, we used the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to stabilize P53/Hdm2 complexes (lane 6). We next compared the ability of Nutlin to affect the association of Hdmx or Hdm2 with P53. Nutlin treatment stabilized P53 and increased Hdm2 to levels exceeding those achieved by proteasome inhibition (compare lanes 2 and 3, input). Nutlin treatment reduced the amount of Hdm2 co-immunoprecipitated with P53 to 20–30% the level observed in the proteasome-inhibitor treated controls (compare lanes 2 and 5 with lanes 3 and 6). Strikingly, the opposite was observed for the Hdmx-P53 interaction. After Nutlin treatment, more Hdmx was found in complex with P53 compared with cells treated with proteasome inhibitor (compare lanes 2 and 5 with lanes 3 and 6). Reciprocal co-IP using Hdmx antibody confirmed these results (Fig. 1, lanes 7–9). Together these data indicate that Nutlin preferentially disrupts Hdm2·P53 complexes and that disruption of Hdmx·P53 complexes is not required for robust activation of P53 by Nutlin. These in vivo observations are supported by in vitro Biacore binding studies showing that the Kd of Nutlin-3a for Hdm2 is 47 nm, whereas for Hdmx it is greater than 10 μm (data not shown). Hdmx Is Down-regulated by Nutlin in Normal Human Fibroblasts—These data raise the question of whether Nutlin activates P53 maximally, because it cannot antagonize the binding of Hdmx, an important negative regulator of P53 transactivation (16Francoz S. Froment P. Bogaerts S. De Clercq S. Maetens M. Doumont G. Bellefroid E. Marine J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Toledo F.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 750-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recent data show that Hdmx is subject to Hdm2-mediated degradation following DNA damage (37Kawai H. Wiederschain D. Kitao H. Stuart J. Tsai K.K. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45946-45953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is possible that the increases in Hdm2 following Nutlin treatment could similarly lead to Hdmx degradation. In this way, Nutlin induction of Hdm2 would create a positive feedback loop for P53 activation via degradation of Hdmx. We tested this possibility in two normal fibroblast strains, BJ and WS1. As observed previously, P53 activation following DNA damage induced by the radiomimetic agent neocarzinostatin (NCS) was associated with an increase in Hdm2 levels and a decrease in Hdmx (Fig. 2A and Ref. 23Pereg Y. Shkedy D. de Graaf P. Meulmeester E. Edelson-Averbukh M. Salek M. Biton S. Teunisse A.F. Lehmann W.D. Jochemsen A.G. Shiloh Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we observed similar effects when BJ or WS1 normal human fibroblasts were treated with Nutlin (Figs. 2A and 4A); as Hdm2 levels rose with increasing times of Nutlin treatment, Hdmx steady state levels decreased as a consequence of its shorter half-life (Fig. 2B). Hdmx mRNA did not change following Nutlin treatment (data not shown). Consistent with previous reports, Nutlin did not induce DNA damage (supplemental Fig. S1). These data imply that in normal fibroblasts increasing Hdm2 level alone is sufficient to lead to Hdmx degradation and P53 activation.FIGURE 4Comparison of Nutlin-induced P53 activation in WS1 (normal human fibroblasts), MCF7 and U2OS. A, WS1 were treated with 5 or 10 μm Nutlin for 5 and 24 h, and analyzed by Western blot. P21 mRNA was analyzed by Q-PCR. B and C, MCF7 and U2OS cells were treated for 5 h with the indicated dose of Nutlin, and analyzed for expression of Hdmx, Hdm2, P53, and P21 by Western blot or Q-PCR. Note the significantly higher induction of P21 and Hdm2 in MCF7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nutlin-induced Hdmx Degradation Can Be Attenuated in Transformed Cells—We next determined whether the same type of positive feedback loop might occur in tumor cells in which Hdmx levels are higher than normal, or in which the Hdm2:Hdmx ratio is aberrant. Such a mechanism could explain how Nutlin activates P53 in cells with high Hdmx levels, despite its inability to disrupt Hdmx·P53 complexes. We used U2OS and MCF7 cells for these studies as they express more Hdmx than normal cells. Fig. 3 shows that in U2OS and MCF7 cells, Nutlin significantly induced Hdm2, but Hdmx degradation was attenuated. Note also that Nutlin substantially increases P53 level in these cells, consistent with its ability to stabilize P53 by preventing Hdm2-P53 binding. These studies show that the Hdm2 mass-driven degradation of Hdmx observed in normal cells can be attenuated during transformation, but that Nutlin is still able to activate P53 (also see Fig. 4C). The Impact of Hdmx Levels on P53 Activation in Normal and Cancer Cells—We infer that P53 can be activated in cells in which Hdmx is not degraded because Nutlin increases P53 to levels exceeding the Hdmx level available for inhibition. To evaluate the extent to which Hdmx can mitigate Nutlin-induced P53 transactivation, we analyzed induction of the P53 target gene p21. We first evaluated normal human fibroblasts in which Hdmx is degraded in response to Nutlin treatment. Analyses were done at saturating drug doses and times by using 5 and 10 μm Nutlin for either 5 or 24 h. In addition to Western analysis, p53 target gene induction was measured by real time Q-PCR. As Fig. 4A shows, within 5 h of treatment at two Nutlin doses, there was no measurable decrease in Hdmx level, while P53 and Hdm2 were both increased, and P53 transactivation was significantly elevated. By 24 h, Hdmx was undetectable, and P53 transactivation increased a further 2–3-fold. Consistent with recent analyses (16Francoz S. Froment P. Bogaerts S. De Clercq S. Maetens M. Doumont G. Bellefroid E. Marine J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Toledo F. Krummel K.A. Lee C.J. Liu C.W. Rodewald L.W. Tang M. Wahl G.M. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 273-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), these data imply that Hdmx can modulate P53 transcriptional output. However, they also show that reducing Hdmx level is not required for Nutlin-mediated activation of P53. We next analyzed the effects of Nutlin treatment on P53 transactivation in U2OS and MCF7 cells. This experiment analyzed the effects of increasing Nutlin dosage for a fixed time (5 h) corresponding to the onset of P53 transactivation. Fig. 4B shows that whereas the P53 levels resulting from Nutlin treatment are similar, the levels of P53 target genes are profoundly different, with MCF7 cells exhibiting far higher levels of Hdm2 and p21 than U2OS cells. The Q-PCR analysis in Fig. 4C demonstrates that P53 transactivation is at least 10-fold higher in MCF7 than in U2OS, even though the amount of P53 in MCF7 relative to U2OS cells is only 2-fold higher after Nutlin treatment (Fig. 4C). Note also that Hdmx is not degraded at this time point in either cell type (Fig. 4B). These data demonstrate that while Hdmx level is one determinant of P53 activation following Nutlin treatment, there are other factors that profoundly affect P53 transactivation in transformed cells. Hdmx Can Modulate the Biological Response to Nutlin—Nutlin invariably induces P53-dependent cell cycle arrest, whereas the amount of apoptosis depends on the cell type (28Tovar C. Rosinski J.

https://openalex.org/W1994019126,"Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are enzymes that protect organisms against superoxides and reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during their active metabolism. ROS are major mediators of phagocytes microbicidal activity. Here we show that the cytoplasmic Listeria monocytogenes MnSOD is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues and less active when bacteria reach the stationary phase. We also provide evidence that the most active nonphosphorylated form of MnSOD can be secreted via the SecA2 pathway in culture supernatants and in infected cells, where it becomes phosphorylated. A Deltasod deletion mutant is impaired in survival within macrophages and is dramatically attenuated in mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the capacity to counteract ROS is an essential component of L. monocytogenes virulence. This is the first example of a bacterial SOD post-translationally controlled by phosphorylation, suggesting a possible new host innate mechanism to counteract a virulence factor."
https://openalex.org/W1971770037,"Differentiation-inducing factors (DIFs) are well known to modulate formation of distinct communal cell types from identical Dictyostelium discoideum amoebas, but DIF biosynthesis remains obscure. We report complimentary in vivo and in vitro experiments identifying one of two ∼3,000-residue D. discoideum proteins, termed 'steely', as responsible for biosynthesis of the DIF acylphloroglucinol scaffold. Steely proteins possess six catalytic domains homologous to metazoan type I fatty acid synthases (FASs) but feature an iterative type III polyketide synthase (PKS) in place of the expected FAS C-terminal thioesterase used to off load fatty acid products. This new domain arrangement likely facilitates covalent transfer of steely N-terminal acyl products directly to the C-terminal type III PKS active sites, which catalyze both iterative polyketide extension and cyclization. The crystal structure of a steely C-terminal domain confirms conservation of the homodimeric type III PKS fold. These findings suggest new bioengineering strategies for expanding the scope of fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis."

We report MRN deficiency in three of seven colon carcinoma cell lines of the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen. To study the involvement of MRN in replication-mediated DNA double strand breaks, we examined checkpoint responses to camptothecin, which induces replication-mediated DNA double strand breaks after replication forks collide with topoisomerase I cleavage complexes. MRN-deficient cells were deficient for Chk2 activation, whereas Chk1 activation was independent of MRN. Chk2 activation was ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent and associated with phosphorylation of Mre11 and Nbs1. Mre11 complementation in MRN-deficient HCT116 cells restored Chk2 activation as well as Rad50 and Nbs1 levels. Conversely, Mre11 down-regulation by small interference RNA (siRNA) in HT29 cells inhibited Chk2 activation and down-regulated Nbs1 and Rad50. Proteasome inhibition also restored Rad50 and Nbs1 levels in HCT116 cells suggesting that Mre11 stabilizes Rad50 and Nbs1. Chk2 activation was also defective in three of four MRN-proficient colorectal cell lines because of low Chk2 levels. Thus, six of seven colon carcinoma cell lines from the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen are functionally Chk2-deficient in response to replication-mediated DNA double strand breaks. We propose that Mre11 stabilizes Nbs1 and Rad50 and that MRN activates Chk2 downstream from ATM in response to replication-mediated DNA double strand breaks. Chk2 deficiency in HCT116 is associated with defective S-phase checkpoint, prolonged G2 arrest, and hypersensitivity to camptothecin.

Cell cycle checkpoints may also allow the chromatin to switch from a metabolic (replicative) state to a repair state. DSBs can be produced directly by ionizing radiation and certain anticancer drugs that bind to DNA (bleomycin, neocarcinostatin, and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as etoposide or doxorubicin) (see Fig. 1a). DSBs can also result from the conversion of single strand breaks by DNA polymerase collisions or “replication fork collapse” at sites of damaged DNA sites (see Fig. 1b). These replication DSBs occur under routine growth conditions in cancer cells, but their frequency is markedly enhanced by topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors such as the camptothecin derivatives, topotecan and irinotecan (6Holm C.

Top1 cleavage complexes can be stabilized under physiological conditions when a DNA base is damaged at a Top1 cleavage site (by oxidation, alkylation, mismatch, or base loss) or when the DNA contains carcinogenic adducts or is nicked within a few base pairs from the Top1 cleavage site (for review see Refs. 9Pommier Y.

The DNA damage-responsive elements, including the MRN complex (heterotrimer comprised of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1), Chk2, ATM, and histone H2AX, are activated by DSBs and serve both for DNA repair and checkpoint responses as well as for induction of apoptosis (1Zhou B.B.

Mre11 also binds both Nbs1 and Rad50, which can bridge and keep together the broken DNA ends (33Moreno-Herrero F. de Jager M. Dekker N.H. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Dekker C. Nature. 2005; 437: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although Nbs1 regulates checkpoint response by binding to ATM (34Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P.

ATM kinase is itself autophosphorylated on serine 1981 and activated within minutes following DSB (27Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). In turn, ATM activates Chk2 by phosphorylation on threonine 68 (37Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K.

Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 2657-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Chk2 can activate both cell cycle arrest/checkpoint by phosphorylating Cdc25 phosphatases and apoptosis by phosphorylating p53, E2F1, and PML (24Pommier Y. Sordet O. Rao A. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 2855-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Germinal mutations inactivating ATM, Mre11, or Nbs1 give rise to ataxia telangiectasia (AT), ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder, and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), respectively (28Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). These three diseases are clinically related and predispose affected individuals to cancers. CHK2 mutations corresponding to Li-Fraumeni syndromes with normal p53 also increase cancer incidence (25Craig A.L. Hupp T.R.

Defects in the DNA replication machinery itself can also predispose individuals to cancers (43Machida Y.J. Hamlin J.L. Dutta A. Cell. 2005; 123: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For instance, mismatch repair defects cause colon cancers because of the failure to remove nucleotides that are misincorporated in repeated sequences during replication (44Giannini G. Ristori E. Cerignoli F. Rinaldi C. Zani M. Viel A. Ottini L. Crescenzi M. Martinotti S. Bignami M. Frati L. Screpanti I. Gulino A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 15: 248-254Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Bloom syndrome is associated with early onset of carcinomas because of a failure to repair abnormal replication forks (45Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) due to a lack of the BLM helicase. Replication fork abnormalities generated spontaneously or by agents such as hydroxyurea and UV activate the 911-ATRIP-ATR-Chk1 pathways; whereas MRN, ATM, and Chk2 have been implicated primarily in DSBs induced by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs in the non-replicating genome (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar, 39Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used CPT to examine Chk2 activation in response to Rep-DSBs and the role of MRN for this activation. We found rapid activation of Chk2 by ATM in response to Rep-DSBs. MRN appears essential for this activation, although in contrast to earlier reports for DSBs induced by ionizing radiation (34Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), in the case of Rep-DSBs, MRN is not required for ATM activation but is required for Chk2 activation downstream from ATM. We also show that MRN is defective in three of seven colon carcinoma cell lines from the NCI 60 Cell Anticancer Drug Screen, and that in all three cell lines, Chk2 activation is defective in response to Rep-DSBs. Moreover, we found that Chk2 expression is markedly reduced in three of four remaining cell lines with normal MRN. These findings demonstrate rapid Chk2 activation in response to Rep-DSBs indicating cross-talk between the replication and DSB checkpoint pathways. They also demonstrate defects in the MRN-Chk2 pathway in colorectal cancer cells because of either MRN or Chk2 defects.

Cell Culture—Human colon carcinoma HT29, HCT116, HCT15, HCC2998, KM12, COLO205, and SW620 cells were obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI, NIH). The SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line from a NBS homozygous patient was purchased from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. Cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. YZ5 and pEBS7 fibroblast cell lines from an AT homozygous patient were a generous gift from Dr. Yosef Shiloh, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel. They were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cell Cycle Synchronization and Analyses, and CPT Treatments—Exponentially growing cells or synchronized cells were treated with 1 μm CPT as indicated. For cell synchronization, cells were first treated with 1 μm aphidicolin for 17 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in fresh medium for 2 h. Then cells were treated with 1 μm CPT (or solvent for the untreated controls) for 75 min. Following two washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated in culture medium for the designated times. For cell cycle analyses, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol for 30 min at 4 °C. The fixed cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and stained with propidium iodide after treatment with 5 μg/ml RNase A. Cells were analyzed by FAC-Scan (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Protein Extracts and Immunoblotting—Cells were grown to 70-80% confluence when treated with different agents. To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Non-idet P-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was quantified by Bradford method (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cells lysates were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE precast gels (8% gels for Mre11 and Nbs1 and 6% gels for Rad50) and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Super Signal, Pierce) on autoradiographic films. All the presented data were confirmed in at least three different experiments. Confocal microscopy analyses were performed as described previously (47Rao A. Fan A.M. Meng L. Doe C.L. North P.S. Hickson I. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8925-8937Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MRE11 Gene Transfection—The cDNA of Mre11 was obtained by PCR as a template with primers (P1, 5′-AGAGGCCTATGAGTACTGCAGATGCACTTGAT-3′; P2, 5′-GGCTCCGGAGTGCCAGTAAATATATTATCTTC-3′). cDNA was cloned by inserting into a pCR2.1 vector. Cloned cDNA was inserted into a pcDNA3.1 vector. Expression vectors containing of the genes of interest were confirmed by sequencing and transfected into HCT116 cells. For stable transfection Mre11 cDNA-containing cells were selected by culturing cells in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml G418. Mre11 Silencing by RNA Interference—Mre11 expression was knocked down by transfection with an siRNA duplex (Qiagen) against the sequence GATGCCATTGAGGAATTAG of the Mre11 mRNA (48Pichierri P. Rosselli F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1178-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A negative control siRNA duplex from Qiagen (target DNA sequence: TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) was used. The experiments were carried out 72 h after transfection. DNA Synthesis Assays—DNA synthesis assay was performed by thymidine incorporation (49Shao R.-G. Cao C.-X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were prelabeled with 0.0025 μCi/ml of [14C]thymidine (53.6 mCi/mmol) for 48 h at 37 °C. The rate of DNA synthesis was measured by 10-min pulses with 1 μCi/ml of [methyl-3H]thymidine (80.9 Ci/mmol). 3H incorporation was stopped by washing cell cultures twice in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, and then scraping cells into 4 ml of ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. Aliquots (1 ml) were then precipitated after addition of 100 μl of trichloroacetic acid in triplicate. Samples were vortexed, mixed, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The precipitates were then dissolved overnight at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 0.4 m NaOH. Samples were counted by dual label liquid scintillation and 3H values were normalized using 14C counts. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was calculated as the ratio of 3H:14C in the treated samples over the 3H:14C ratio in the untreated control samples. MRN Deficiency in Three of Seven Colon Carcinoma Cell Lines from the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen Panel—Because MRN has emerged as an important component of DNA DSB repair and S-Phase checkpoint (29Stracker T.H.

Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), we tested the expression of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 proteins in the colon carcinoma cell lines of the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen (50Scherf U.

Thus, three of seven colon carcinoma cell lines from the NCI screen are globally deficient for MRN (i.e. all three molecular components are low or absent in HCT116, HCC2998, and KM12 cells), whereas the MRN complex is present in the four other cell lines (HT29, HCT15, COLO205, and SW620). Defective Chk2 Phosphorylation/Activation in MRN-deficient Cells—Previous studies in HT29 and HCT116 cells (as well as the other colon carcinoma cell lines from the NCI Cell Screen) have shown that sensitivity to CPT is dependent on downstream pathways from Top1 cleavage complexes (21Goldwasser F. Bae I.S. Torres K. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2116-2121PubMed Google Scholar, 52Goldwasser F. Shimizu T. Jackman J. Hoki Y. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4430-4437PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, DNA repair and checkpoint activation favor cancer cell survival (9Pommier Y. Redon C. Rao A. Seiler J.A. Sordet O. Takemura H.

Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4430-4437PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, abrogation of the S-phase and G2 checkpoints markedly potentiates the antiproliferative activity of CPT (53Shao R.-G. Cao C.-X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar). Because Chk2 and Chk1 are key effector kinases for the S and G2/M checkpoints, downstream from ATM and ATR, respectively (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar), we compared the activation of Chk2 and Chk1 in HT29 and HCT116 treated with CPT. HT29 and HCT116 were chosen, because HT29 cells have the highest MRN levels, whereas HCT116 are well characterized Mre11-deficient cells (Fig. 1c) (30Furuta T. Takemura H. Liao Z.Y. Aune G.J.

Fig. 2a shows Chk2 phosphorylation (on threonine 68 = PT68-Chk2) in HT29 but not in HCT116 in response to CPT. The HCT116 deficiency is not due to quantitative difference in Chk2 polypeptide, because total Chk2 protein levels are comparable in HT29 and HCT116 (Fig. 2a, second panels from top). Chk2 phosphorylation was confirmed in synchronized HT29 cells treated in S-phase with CPT (Fig. 3b). By contrast, Chk1 was phosphorylated both in HT29 and HCT116 on Ser-317 and Ser-345 (Fig. 2a); of which Ser-345 is regarded as a preferential target for phosphorylation/activation by ATR (54Liu Q.

https://openalex.org/W2087624259,"After signal sequence-dependent targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), prion protein (PrP) undergoes several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, and the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. As a result, multiple isoforms are generated. Because of the intrinsic weakness of the PrP signal sequence, a fraction of newly synthesized molecules fails to translocate and localizes to the cytosol. The physiopathologic role of this cytosolic isoform is still being debated. Here we have shown that, in both cultured cell lines and primary neurons, ER stress conditions weaken PrP co-translational translocation, favoring accumulation of aggregation-prone cytosolic species, which retain the signal sequence but lack N-glycans and disulfides. Inhibition of proteasomes further increases the levels of cytosolic PrP. Overexpression of spliced XBP1 facilitates ER translocation, suggesting that downstream elements of the Ire1-XBP1 pathway are involved in PrP targeting. These studies reveal a link between ER stress and the formation of cytosolic PrP isoforms potentially endowed with novel signaling or cytotoxic functions."

Hepsin overexpression in a mouse prostate cancer model resulted in tumor progression and metastasis, associated with basement membrane disorganization. We investigated whether hepsin enzymatic activity was linked to the basement membrane defects by examining its ability to initiate the plasminogen/plasmin proteolytic pathway. Because plasminogen is not processed by hepsin, we investigated the upstream activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator. Enzymatic assays with a recombinant soluble form of hepsin demonstrated that hepsin did not cleave pro-tissue-type plasminogen activator but efficiently converted pro-uPA into high molecular weight uPA by cleavage at the Lys158-Ile159 (P1-P1′) peptide bond. uPA generated by hepsin displayed enzymatic activity toward small synthetic and macromolecular substrates indistinguishable from uPA produced by plasmin. The catalytic efficiency of pro-uPA activation by hepsin (kcat/Km 4.8 × 105 m–1 s–1) was similar to that of plasmin, which is considered the most potent pro-uPA activator and was about 6-fold higher than that of matriptase. Conversion of pro-uPA was also demonstrated with cell surface-expressed full-length hepsin. A stable hepsinoverexpressing LnCaP cell line converted pro-uPA into high molecular weight uPA at a rate of 6.6 ± 1.9 nm uPA h–1, which was about 3-fold higher than LnCaP cells expressing lower hepsin levels on their surface. In conclusion, the ability of hepsin to efficiently activate pro-uPA suggests that it may initiate plasmin-mediated proteolytic pathways at the tumor/stroma interface that lead to basement membrane disruption and tumor progression.

The studies further showed that hepsin was not essential for liver regeneration and for coagulation-related physiological functions (3Yu I.S. Chen H.J. Lee Y.S. Huang P.H. Lin S.R. Tsai T.W. Lin S.W.

Hepsin RNA levels were found to be low in normal prostate and benign hyperplasia but strongly increased in prostate carcinoma, particularly in advanced stages (8Magee J.A. Araki T. Patil S. Ehrig T.

Hepsin protein staining with a monoclonal anti-hepsin antibody showed that hepsin expression was highest at sites of bone metastasis and in late stage primary tumors (12Xuan J.A. Schneider D. Toy P.

These studies raised the question of whether hepsin is involved in prostate cancer. In vitro studies did not provide clear answers, and depending on the experimental conditions used, hepsin was found to promote, inhibit, or not affect tumor cell growth (12Xuan J.A. Schneider D. Toy P. Lin R. Newton A. Zhu Y. Finster S. Vogel D. Mintzer B. Dinter H. Light D. Parry R. Polokoff M. Whitlow M. Wu Q. Parry G.

Mirosevich J. Roberts R.L. Matusik R.J. Vasioukhin V. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) demonstrating that in a mouse model of non-metastasizing prostate cancer, overexpression of hepsin led to primary tumor progression and metastasis. Intriguingly, hepsin overexpression was associated with basement membrane disruption (16Klezovitch O. Chevillet J. Mirosevich J. Roberts R.L. Matusik R.J. Vasioukhin V. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) pointing toward the possibility that hepsin activity is somehow linked to the degradation of basement membrane components. In vitro, hepsin was able to convert the latent growth factor pro-hepatocyte growth factor (pro-HGF) 2The abbreviations used are: HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; HGFA, HGF activator; KD1, Kunitz domain-1 derived from HAI-1B; pNA, para-nitroanilide; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; pro-uPA, zymogen form of uPA; pro-tPA, zymogen form of tPA; pro-HGF, single chain form of HGF; TAMRA, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. into its active two-chain form (HGF), which induced Met receptor signaling (17Herter S. Piper D.E. Aaron W. Gabriele T. Cutler G. Cao P. Bhatt A.S. Choe Y. Craik C.S. Walker N. Meininger D. Hoey T. Austin R.J. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because the HGF/Met pathway has been implicated in invasive tumor growth and metastasis, it is possible that overexpression of hepsin activates the HGF/Met axis in prostate cancer. Hepsin was also shown to cleave other substrates in vitro, mainly coagulation-related proteins (17Herter S. Piper D.E. Aaron W. Gabriele T. Cutler G. Cao P. Bhatt A.S. Choe Y. Craik C.S. Walker N. Meininger D. Hoey T. Austin R.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Kazama Y. Hamamoto T. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, their role in tumorigenesis is not known. In view of the basement membrane defects that were associated with hepsin overexpression in the mouse prostate, we hypothesized that hepsin might activate protease zymogens that are directly linked to basement membrane degradation. It was known from previous studies that hepsin does not activate plasminogen (17Herter S. Piper D.E. Aaron W. Gabriele T. Cutler G. Cao P. Bhatt A.S. Choe Y. Craik C.S. Walker N. Meininger D. Hoey T. Austin R.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Lipari M.T. Billeci K. Fan B. Moran P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and therefore, we considered the upstream activators of plasminogen, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) as possible candidates. The results of this study show that soluble hepsin is a potent activator of pro-uPA with a catalytic efficiency comparable with that of plasmin. Pro-uPA conversion was also measured by hepsin-expressing LnCaP prostate cancer cells, demonstrating that cellular full-length hepsin recapitulates the function of soluble hepsin. The implications of these findings with respect to the function of hepsin in prostate cancer progression are discussed. Reagents—Lys-plasmin and Lys-plasminogen were from Heamatologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Pro-tPA was from Biodesign International (Saco, ME), uPA (high molecular weight form) was from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), pro-uPA was from Cortex Biochem (San Leandro, CA), and PAI-1 was from Molecular Innovations (Southfield, MI). The chromogenic substrates S2444, S2765, and S2366 were from Diapharma (Westchester, OH). T.in.Pro cells were from Expression System LLC (Woodland, CA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA), and Q-Sepharose and benzamidine-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow was from GE Healthcare. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—A soluble form of hepsin comprising the entire extracellular domain was produced by use of a baculovirus expression system. A secreted His-tagged hepsin cDNA was constructed by fusion of the cDNA coding for the signal sequence of honeybee melittin (Met1-Tyr20) with the cDNA coding for the extracellular domain of human hepsin (Arg45-Leu417). The final cDNA construct was inserted in a baculovirus expression vector under the control of a polyhedrin promoter and expressed in T.in.Pro cells. Hepsin was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography essentially as described (20Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Li W. Stamos J. Eigenbrot C. Kadkhodayan S. Elliott J.M. Corpuz R.T. Lazarus R.A. Moran P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hepsin-containing medium was conditioned with 1 mm sodium azide, 0.3 m NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole and was adjusted to pH 6.5 using NaOH. Precharged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was added to media (4 ml resin/liter medium). Batch absorption was performed by gently stirring at 4 °C for 2 h. After allowing the resin to settle for 1 h, the supernatant was decanted, and the resin was packed into a column. The column was washed with a minimum of 10 column volumes of PBS, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.4, then followed by 10 column volumes of 25 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm sodium azide, pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm sodium azide, pH 8.0. Pooled fractions were purified further using either ion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose FF ion or affinity chromatography on a benzamidine-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column. The matriptase protease domain was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (20Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Li W. Stamos J. Eigenbrot C. Kadkhodayan S. Elliott J.M. Corpuz R.T. Lazarus R.A. Moran P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HGFA and soluble HAI-2 were recombinantly expressed and purified as described (18Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Lipari M.T. Billeci K. Fan B. Moran P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Li W. Stamos J. Eigenbrot C. Kadkhodayan S. Elliott J.M. Corpuz R.T. Lazarus R.A. Moran P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The active site concentration of hepsin, matriptase, and HGFA was determined by using the potent Kunitz domain inhibitor KD1 derived from HAI-1B, which was produced in E. coli as described (21Shia S. Stamos J. Kirchhofer D. Fan B. Wu J. Corpuz R.T. Santell L. Lazarus R.A. Eigenbrot C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1335-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The active site concentrations were used for all enzymatic assays. For plasmin, the concentration provided by the supplier (Hematologic Laboratories, Inc.) was used. Monoclonal Anti-hepsin Antibody—Five Balb/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were hyperimmunized with recombinant soluble hepsin in RIBI adjuvant (Ribi Immunochem Research Inc.). B cells from lymph nodes from five mice were fused with mouse myeloma cells (X63.Ag8.653; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) as previously described (22Hongo J.A. Mora-Worms M. Lucas C. Fendly B.M. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After 10–14 days the supernatants were harvested and screened for antibody production with a hepsin binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The clone 3H10 showed high immunobinding and specificity after the second round of single cell per well cloning (Elite 1 Sorter, Beckman Coulter) and was scaled up for purification in INTEGRA CELLine 1000 (Integra Biosciences). The supernatant was purified by protein A affinity chromatography, sterile-filtered, and stored at 4 °C in PBS. Isotyping with the mono-AB-ID SP Kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) showed that 3H10 is an IgG1κ. Production of Hepsin Overexpressing LnCaP Cells—The human prostate carcinoma cell line, LnCaP-FGC (LnCaP), was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (American Type Culture Collection) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich). A LnCaP clone that stably expressed the firefly luciferase gene (LnCaP-luc) was used for hepsin transfection experiments. To establish the LnCaP-luc cell line, the luciferase gene was subcloned as an EcoRI/XhoI cDNA fragment inserted into the pMSCVneo expression vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Mountain View, CA). LnCaP cells were transfected with the luciferase construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were selected with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), and clones were screened for bioluminescence activity by using the Luclite kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The clone LnCaP-luc, which produced the strongest luminescence signal, was chosen for hepsin transfection experiments. The cDNA of full-length hepsin was inserted into a mammalian expression vector containing the puromycin resistance gene for antibiotic selection (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). The LnCaP-luc clone was transfected with the construct encoding full-length hepsin with a C-terminal FLAG tag, and the cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). The clones were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter for hepsin surface expression using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Adrich). Two clones, the high hepsin expressor LnCaP-34 and the low hepsin expressor LnCaP-17, were selected for further experiments. To measure total hepsin expression (endogenous and transfected) on the cell surface, LnCaP-34 and LnCaP-17 cell suspensions in PBS/1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum were incubated with 10 μg/ml of 3H10 antibody or without antibody (control) for 40 min on ice. The cells were washed twice with PBS before incubation with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum (v/v). After 30 min on ice the cells were washed with PBS, and cell pellets were resuspended in 1% formalin (Richard Allen Scientific). Antibody binding was measured on a FACSscan (BD Biosciences). Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from LnCaP-17 and LnCaP-34 cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gene expression analysis was performed by real-time reverse transcription PCR (TaqMan) on a model 7500 sequence detector (ABI-PerkinElmer, Foster City, CA). To specifically measure endogenous hepsin we used primers recognizing sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of the hepsin gene. To measure total hepsin (endogenous plus transfected hepsin) we used primers recognizing sequences in the open reading frame that is common to both hepsins. The sequences of primers and probes were as follows: endogenous hepsin, forward (5′-CCCTCCAGGGTCCTCTCT-3′), reverse (5′-AGTCCCAGACAGCAGAACAATA-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-CAGCCCCGAGACCACCCAAC-(TAMRA)-3′); total hepsin, forward (5′-GCTGTGTGGCATTGTGAGT-3′), reverse (5′-TGAGTCTTTATGGCCTGGAA-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-AAGCCAGGCGTCTACACCAAAGTCAG-(TAMRA)-3′); matriptase, forward (5′-CTTCGGAGCCTCCTCAGT-3′), reverse (5′-GTCTCAGACCCGTCTGTTTTC-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-CCTCCGAGCCTGGGCTTCCT-(TAMRA)-3′); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward (5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′), reverse (5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-(TAMRA)-3′). The reverse transcription was carried out at 48 °C for 30 min followed by heat activation of AmpliTaq Gold at 95 °C for 10 min. The thermal cycling proceeded with 40 cycles of 95 °C for 0.5 min and 60 °C for 1 min. All samples were run in duplicate. The results were quantified using the standard curve method according to the manufacturer's instruction (ABI-PerkinElmer). All gene expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Enzymatic Assays with HAI-2 and the Small Molecule Inhibitor HI-10331—The reversible active site inhibitor HI-10331 (a gift from Alan Olivero, Genentech, Inc.) or HAI-2 was incubated with 0.5 nm hepsin, 0.5 nm matriptase, and 10 nm uPA for 30 min in Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100) at room temperature. The chromogenic substrates S2366 (for hepsin), S2765 (for matriptase), and S2444 (for uPA) were added at a concentration corresponding to their respective Km values, which were determined in separate experiments. After substrate addition, the linear rates of the increase in absorbance at 405 nm were measured on a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For HI-10331, the inhibitor concentration that gave a 50% inhibition of the enzymatic activity (IC50) was determined by fitting the data to a four-parameter equation (Kaleidagraph Version 3.6, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The Ki values were calculated according to the relationship Ki = IC50/(1 + [S]/Km) (23Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar) using the experimentally determined IC50 and Km values for each enzyme-substrate pair. For HAI-2, the apparent Ki values (Ki*) were determined by fitting the data to the equation for tight binding inhibition (24Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 25Olivero A.G. Eigenbrot C. Goldsmith R. Robarge K. Artis D.R. Flygare J. Rawson T. Sutherlin D.P. Kadkhodayan S. Beresini M.

Pro-uPA Activation by LnCaP Cells—Confluent LnCaP-34 and LnCaP-17 cells were washed with HBSA-glucose buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm glucose), and 0.8 ml of 100 nm pro-uPA in prewarmed HBSA-glucose buffer was added to the cell layers. The inhibitors KD1 or HI-10331 were added to give final concentrations of 1 and 10 μm, respectively. The culture plates were kept at 37 °C, and 50-μl samples were withdrawn at different time points and supplemented with 0.2 ml of 0.625 mm S2444 in Hepes buffer, and the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was measured on a kinetic microplate reader. Cell numbers were determined at the end of the experiments. The concentration of formed uPA in each sample was calculated from a standard curve of enzymatically converted pro-uPA and normalized to 106 cells. After subtracting the background levels of uPA formed in the absence of cell layer, the linear rates of uPA formation/106 cells were determined. The pro-uPA activation was strictly dependent on the presence of the cells, since the samples taken at different time points did not convert any additional pro-uPA. Also, the enzymatic activity toward S2444 of the withdrawn samples was entirely due to uPA activity and not to hepsin or other proteases released from the cell surface, since the chromogenic activity of the samples was not inhibited by the addition of the hepsin inhibitor KD1 but was completely inhibited by the uPA inhibitor PAI-1 (data not shown). For immunoblotting experiments, confluent LnCaP-34 cell layers were washed as above and incubated in HBSA-glucose buffer with 30 nm pro-uPA at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm KD1 or without. After 1, 3, and 5 h, aliquots were taken and immediately added to SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters using the Bio-Rad Semi-Dry Transfer system. Pro-uPA and uPA were visualized by using a rabbit polyclonal anti-uPA antibody (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) and ECL (GE Healthcare) enhancement. Analysis of Pro-uPA and Pro-tPA Activation by SDS-PAGE—Pro-uPA at a concentration of 1.5 μm was incubated with 15 nm hepsin or 15 nm plasmin in Hepes buffer at room temperature. After 4 and 60 min, aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken and added to 6× SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 4–20% gradient gel (Invitrogen). Protein was visualized after staining with SimplyBlue Safe Stain (Invitrogen). Experiments with pro-tPA (1.5 μm) were carried out identically, except that the buffer used was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm arginine, 0.01% Tween 20. Determination of First-order Rate Constants—The Km value for pro-uPA activation by plasmin is in the micromolar range (26Collen D. Zamarron C. Lijnen H.R. Hoylaerts M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1259-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Wolf B.B. Vasudevan J. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16327-16331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with our findings in an attempt to determine Km values for plasmin, hepsin, and matriptase. However, because the pro-uPA stock solution from the supplier (0.8 mg/ml) was not sufficiently high for accurate Km measurements and the calculation of the catalytic efficiencies, we chose to determine the first-order rate constant k as a measure of pro-uPA conversion efficiency. It was ensured that the pro-uPA concentration used (30 nm) was in the range of first-order kinetics for the enzymes tested, i.e. hepsin, plasmin, and matriptase. Pro-uPA (30 nm) was added to the enzymes (3 nm) in Hepes buffer to start the reaction at room temperature. At various time points, 50-μl aliquots were removed and added to 150 μl of 667 nm HAI-2 (final concentration in 250 μl was 400 nm) in Hepes buffer to stop further pro-uPA cleavage. At the concentration used, HAI-2 specifically inhibits plasmin (29Delaria K.A. Muller D.K. Marlor C.W. Brown J.E. Das R.C. Roczniak S.O. Tamburini P.P. J. Biol.

After the addition of 50 μl of 2.5 mm S2444, the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was measured on a kinetic microplate reader. The concentration of uPA in each aliquot was calculated from a standard curve of enzymatically converted pro-uPA. The data were expressed as the decrease in the concentration of pro-uPA (log[pro-uPA]) as function of time. The first-order rate constant k was calculated from the slope using the equation log[S] =–(k/2.3)t + log[S]0, where [S] is the concentration of pro-uPA, and [S]0 is the initial pro-uPA concentration. The catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, was then calculated using the known enzyme concentration [E] and the relationship k = (kcat/Km) [E].

https://openalex.org/W2044866503,"Saposin A (Sap-A) is one of five known sphingolipid activator proteins required for the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids and for the loading of lipid antigens onto antigen-presenting molecules of the CD1 type. Sap-A assists in the degradation of galactosylceramide by galactosylceramide-β-galactosidase in vivo, which takes place at the surface of intraendosomal/intralysosomal vesicles. Sap-A is believed to mediate the interaction between the enzyme and its membrane-bound substrate. Its dysfunction causes a variant form of Krabbe disease. In the present study we prepared glycosylated Sap-A free of other Saps, taking advantage of the Pichia pastoris expression system. Using liposomes and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, we tested the binding and lipid mobilization capacity of Sap-A under different conditions. Along the endocytic pathway, the pH value decreases, and the lipid composition of intraendosomal and intralysosomal membranes changes drastically. In the inner membranes the cholesterol concentration decreases, and that of the anionic phospholipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate increases. Here, we show that Sap-A is able to bind to liposomes and to mobilize lipids out of them at acidic pH values below pH 4.7. Low cholesterol levels and increasing concentrations of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate favor lipid extraction significantly. Galactosylceramide as a bilayer component is not essential for lipid mobilization by Sap-A, which requires intact disulfide bridges for activity. We also show for the first time that glycosylation of Sap-A is essential for its lipid extraction activity. Variant Sap-A proteins, which cause storage of galactosylceramide in humans (Krabbe disease, Spiegel, R., Bach, G., Sury, V., Mengistu, G., Meidan, B., Shalev, S., Shneor, Y., Mandel, H., and Zeigler, M.

The degradation of plasma membrane-derived glycosphingolipids takes place in the acidic compartments of the cell, the endosomes and lysosomes, on the surface of intraendosomal and intralysosomal vesicles with a diameter in the range of 50–100 nm (1Kolter T.

Glycosphingolipid degradation starts with the sequential cleavage of monosaccharide residues from glycoconjugates by the action of lysosomal exohydrolases. In vitro, the enzymatic hydrolysis of most membrane-bound sphingolipids is also stimulated by negatively charged lysosomal lipids (6Wilkening G. Linke T. Uhlhorn-Dierks G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Five sphingolipid activator proteins are known; they are the GM2 activator protein and the four saposins (Sap-A, Sap-B, Sap-C, and Sap-D), which are derived from a common precursor, called Sap-precursor or prosaposin. The deficiency of each has been observed to cause a lysosomal storage disease similar to that produced by the absence of the corresponding enzyme (12Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Harzer K. Scriver C.R.

This is accompanied by the accumulation of several sphingolipids and membrane structures within the acidic compartments of the cell. The saposins A-D (12Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Harzer K. Scriver C.R.

They contain one conserved N-glycosylation site (18Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of Sap-A, which has two, and six highly conserved cysteine residues, which form three disulfide bridges. Although the four Saps share a high degree of homology (19Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and similar properties, they act differently and show different specificities. Sap-A is essential for the degradation of galactosylceramide by galactosylceramide-β-galactosidase in vivo (13Spiegel R. Bach G. Sury V. Mengistu G. Meidan B. Shalev S. Shneor Y. Mandel H. Zeigler M.

Genet. 2001; 10: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inherited deficiency of this lysosomal enzyme causes Krabbe disease, also called globoid cell leukodystrophy. It is a fatal disorder of myelination with blocks in the catabolism of galactosylceramide and galactosylsphingosine. The inherited deficiency of Sap-A causes an infantile disease similar to globoid cell leukodystrophy, as demonstrated in a human patient carrying a mutation in the Sap-A domain of the Sap-precursor (13Spiegel R.

The known mutation is a deletion of three base pairs, which leads to lack of the amino acid 11 (a conserved valine) of Sap-A. In addition, transgenic mice with Sap-A lacking one of the three disulfide bridges develop a phenotype resembling the late-onset form of Krabbe disease (20Matsuda J. Vanier M.T. Saito Y. Tohyama J. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the saposins, Sap-A shows the highest amino acid similarity to Sap-C, which is essential for the in vivo degradation of glucosylceramide by glucosylceramide-β-glucosidase (21Christomanou H. Aignesberger A. Linke R.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Christomanou H. Chabas A. Pampols T. Guardiola A. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In vitro, both activators assist the same enzymes in the same metabolic steps (23Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y.

It has been reported that Sap-A and Sap-C are able to interact directly with the enzymes and to stimulate them (8Berent S.L. Radin N.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Lipids. 2004; 132: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The capacity of Sap-C to interact with lipids is also shown by its ability to load lipid antigens onto the antigen presenting molecules CD1b (34Winau F. Schwierzeck V. Hurwitz R. Remmel N. Sieling P.A. Modlin R.L. Porcelli S.A. Brinkmann V. Sugita M. Sandhoff K. Kaufmann S.H. Schaible U.E. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and CD1d (35Zhou D.

Schrantz N. Kulkarni A.B. Qi X. Mahuran D.J. Morales C.R. Grabowski G.A. Benlagha K. Savage P. Bendelac A. Teyton L. Science. 2004; 303: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). CD1b and CD1d in turn present the lipids to T-lymphocytes on the surface of the cell (1Kolter T. Winau F. Schaible U.E. Leippe M. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41125-41128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). So far Sap-A has not been studied as extensively as Sap-C. Interaction of recombinant nonglycosylated Sap-A with phospholipid membranes has been demonstrated by using fluorescence spectroscopy (31Qi X. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27010-27017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sap-A prepared from spleen of the Gaucher disease patients has also been shown to destabilize anionic phospholipid-containing vesicles at a pH of 4 but less effectively than Sap-C (30Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Barca A. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16862-16867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The destabilizing activity of Sap-A was monitored by the release of a fluorescent dye encapsulated within lipid vesicles. In previous in vitro studies either nonglycosylated recombinant Sap-A or Sap-A preparations partially purified from tissues have been applied. Both sources have severe drawbacks. Nonglycosylated Sap-A is not present in humans, and the absence of the carbohydrate moiety is expected to change the solubility of the protein and to alter its interaction with membranes. Purification of individual saposins from natural sources results in preparations contaminated with other Saps due to the very similar physicochemical properties shared among them. In the present study we take advantage of the Pichia pastoris expression system, which allows the production of glycosylated Sap-A free of other Saps. To explore the conditions under which Sap-A operates optimally, we mimicked intralysosomal vesicles using liposomes in an acidic environment. To monitor the interaction between the protein and the membrane surface, we used surface plasmon resonance and studied the solubilization of radioactively labeled lipids from liposomal membranes. Commercial Products—Cholesterol and galactosylceramide (bovine brain) were purchased from Sigma. Phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk) was from Lipoid. Myristoyl-BMP and oleoyl-BMP were from Avanti Polar Lipids. [14C]Phosphatidylcholine was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, and [14C]cholesterol was from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade. Expression vectors and P. pastoris strains were obtained from Invitrogen. Construction of the Sap-A Expression Vector—The cDNA coding for the Sap-A sequence was generated from pSap-PBHE (37Henseler M. Klein A. Glombitza G.J. Suziki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8416-8423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) by PCR using the specific primers 5′-ATT GAT TAC GTA TCC CTT CCC TGC GAC ATA TGC-3 and 5′-ATC AAT GAA TTC TTA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG CTT CTG GAG AGA CTC GCA-3′. The forward primer contained an SnaBI restriction site, and the reverse primer incorporated a C-terminal His6 tag, a stop codon, and an EcoRI restriction site. The PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into the pCR-Skript SK(+) vector (Stratagene) using the pCR-Script cloning kit (Stratagene). The resulting PCR-script-Sap-A vector as well as the expression vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen) were digested with the restriction enzymes SnaBI and EcoRI. After gel purification of both expression vector and Sap-A insert, they were ligated. The resulting plasmid pPIC9K-Sap-A was transformed into competent Escherichia coli DH5α (Promega, Madison, WI), which were cultured in LB-Amp medium (Luria-Bertani medium, 100 μg/liter Ampicillin). The sequence identity and orientation of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. Construction of the Sap-A Mutant Expression Vectors—Using the site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and the pPIC9K-Sap-A vector as a template, four mutants were constructed. The numbering of the substituted or deleted amino acids on the Sap-A protein corresponds to their positions on the Sap precursor protein. Sap-A mutant 1 (which corresponds to a variant Sap-A protein carrying the amino acid substitution C106F) was generated using the primers 5′-CCG AAC ATG TCT GCT TCA TTC AAG GAG ATA GTG GAC TCC-3′ and 5′-GGA GTC CAC TAT CTC CTT GAA TGA AGC AGA CAT GTT CGG-3′. Sap-A mutant 2 (which corresponds to a variant Sap-A protein carrying the amino acid substitution C132F) was generated using the primers 5′-CGT CCT GGG GAG GTG TTC TCT GCT CTC AAC CTC TGC-3′ and 5′-GCA GAG GTT GAG AGC AGA GAA CAC CTC CCC AGG ACG-3′. Sap-A mutant 3 (which corresponds to a variant Sap-A protein carrying the amino acid substitution C132A on the Sap-A protein) was generated using the primers 5′-CGT CCT GGG GAG GTG GCC TCT GCT CTC AAC CTC TGC-3′ and 5′-GCA GAG GTT GAG AGC AGA GGC CAC CTC CCC AGG ACG-3′. Sap-A mutant 4 (which corresponds to the variant Sap-A protein carrying the deletion ΔV70, present in the human patient) was generated using the primers 5′-GAC ATA TGC AAA GAC GTT ACC GCA GCT GGT GAT ATG-3′ and 5′-CAT ATC ACC AGC TGC GGT AAC GTC TTT GCA TAT GTC-3′. The sequence identity of the four mutants was confirmed by sequencing. Construction of the Expression Vector for Sap-A without Hexahistidine Tag—The cDNA coding for the Sap-A sequence was generated from the pPIC9K-Sap-A vector by PCR using the specific primers 5′-CTC TCG AGA AAA GAG AGG CTG AAG CTT CCC TTC CCT GCG ACA TAT GC-3′ and 5′-GCT CTT AAC CTT TGC GAG TCT CTT CAG TAG GAA TTC GC-3′. The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI and EcoRI and cloned into the vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen). After digestion with the restriction enzymes SacI and SalI, the resulting fragment was ligated with the vector pPIC9K digested with the same enzymes. The sequence identity and orientation of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. Transformation in P. pastoris Strains and Selection for Multicopy Inserts—Linearized pPIC9K-Sap-A plasmids with and without hexahistidine tag and pPIC9K-Sap-A mutant plasmids were used to transform P. pastoris GS115 strain. The transformation was performed by electroporation (Cellject Electroporation System, Eurogentec) applying an electric pulse of 1500 V, 282 ohms, and 40 microfarads according to the Invitrogen manual. Transformants were selected on minimal dextrose (1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate, 4 × 10–5 % biotin, 1% dextrose). Screening for multiple copy inserts was done on YPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 1.5% agar) containing increasing amounts of G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen) up to 4 mg/ml medium. Genomic DNA of transformed yeasts was isolated using the Easy-DNA™ Kit (Invitrogen), and PCR analysis was performed using AOX5′ and AOX3′ primers (Invitrogen). In addition, cells were cultured on minimal dextrose and on minimal methanol (MM; 0.5% methanol instead of dextrose) plates. Using both techniques, the phenotype of most clones producing wild type Sap-A were determined to be Mut+ (regular methanol utilization), whereas clones producing mutant Sap-A proteins were MutS (methanol utilization slow). Expression and Purification of Sap-A and Variant Proteins— A small culture of a single Mut+ (regular methanol utilization) colony was used to inoculate 50–100 ml of buffered glycerolcomplex medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10–5% biotin, 1% glycerol). The cultures were grown at 30 °C in a shaking incubator (210 rpm) for 16 h until log phase (A600 = 2–6) and harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3000 × g, 4 °C). Secretory expression of the recombinant protein was induced by resuspending the cell pellet in 500 ml of buffered methanol-complex medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10–5% biotin, 0.5% methanol) and maintained by the addition of 0.5% methanol every 24 h for 4–5 days. MutS (methanol utilization slow) clones were grown in 2 liters of buffered glycerol-complex medium at 30 °C in a shaking incubator (210 rpm) for 16 h until log phase (A600 = 2–6) and harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3000 × g, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of buffered methanol-complex medium and maintained by the addition of 0.5% methanol every 24 h for 6–7 days. After centrifugation (10 min, 3000 × g, 4 °C), sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 0.02%, the pH was adjusted to 7.5, and the supernatant was clarified by filtration or centrifugation (30 min, 8000 × g, 4 °C). The solution was then applied to an affinity column (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Qiagen). After two wash steps (with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7 and 6), the bound protein was eluted using the same buffer system by decreasing the pH to 4.2. Sap-A-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 75 16/60 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). The running buffer was 150 mm sodium phosphate, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 6.8. When fractions containing both glycosylated and nonglycosylated protein were present, a concanavalin A column (Sigma) was used to separate these forms. After equilibration of the material with binding buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m sodium chloride, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7) and loading of the protein sample, the column was washed (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1.5 m sodium chloride, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7), and glycosylated protein was eluted (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m sodium chloride, 0.75 m α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7). Expression and Purification of Sap-A without the His6 Tag— For secretory expression of the protein, minimal medium WM VIII (38Lang C. Looman A.C. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 44: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was used. For purification, cells were pelleted (10 min, 4000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant containing the recombinant protein was cleared by centrifugation (30 min, 11000 × g, 4 °C), and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 4.0. The filtrated solution was then applied to a HS Macro Prep column (BioRad), washed with sodium citrate buffer (20 mm, pH 4.0), and eluted using a sodium chloride gradient (to a final concentration of 1 m sodium chloride in the same citrate buffer). Sap-A-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 75 16/60 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). The running buffer was 10 mm sodium citrate, 300 mm sodium chloride, pH 4.2. Characterization of Proteins—The purity and identity of nonglycosylated proteins was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and Western blot analysis (using a rabbit anti Sap-A antibody (37Henseler M. Klein A. Glombitza G.J. Suziki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8416-8423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) and wild type protein by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (matrix, 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid; TOF-Spec E, Micromass). The glycoform of the proteins was deglycosylated by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs). Samples of protein before and after deglycosylation were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining or Western blot analysis. Preparation of Liposomes—Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared as described previously (39MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). During preparation the temperature never exceeded 37 °C. Lipid stock solutions of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, BMP, and galactosylceramide were obtained by dissolving them in organic solvents. Appropriate aliquots of lipid stock solutions were mixed. After evaporation of solvents under nitrogen, dried lipids were hydrated to a concentration of 0.5 mm PBS buffer. The suspension was freeze-thawed 8 times in liquid nitrogen, sonicated for 30 s, and passed 21 times through 2 polycarbonate membranes in tandem (pore diameter 100 nm, Avanti Polar Lipids) in a mini-extruder (Liposofast, Avestin). The final concentration of the liposomal suspension was of 0.4 mm (see below). Determination of the Lipid Content of Liposomes and Final Concentration of the Liposomal Suspension—Aliquots of the stock solution and liposomes before and after passing through the membranes in the mini-extruder were evaporated in a stream of nitrogen. The lipids were resolved in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and sonicated for 1 min, and insoluble salts were pelletized. For separation of lipids, thin layer chromatograms were developed with chloroform/methanol/water (60:25:4, v/v/v). After development, plates were air-dried, sprayed with 8% (w/v) H3PO4 containing 10% (w/v) copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate, and charred at 180 °C for 10 min, and lipids were quantitated by photo densitometry (Shimadzu) at λ = 595 nm. Each kind of liposome was determined in triplicate. The indicated lipid mol % in the figures and in the text corresponds to the content after preparation of liposomes. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Spectroscopy—Real-time lipid-protein interaction analysis was performed at 25 °C in a Biacore® 3000 instrument. Liposomes were immobilized on a Pioneer® L1 sensor chip (Biacore), which provides a preimmobilized surface with lipophilic anchors attached to a dextran matrix. For immobilization of liposomes, 60 μl of a liposome solution (0.4 mm in PBS) were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Unbound liposomes were removed by washing with 10 μl of sodium hydroxide (25 mm) at the same flow rate. To assure complete saturation of the surface, 40 μl of the liposomes solution were newly injected, and the surface was washed with 10 μl of sodium hydroxide (50 mm) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min to remove multilamellar structures and to stabilize the base line, as recommended by the manufacturer instructions (Biacore). After immobilization of liposomes, a signal increase of 5000–8000 response units was achieved. For measurement of the"
https://openalex.org/W2170770817,"During infection of mammalian hosts, facultative intracellular pathogens have to adjust rapidly to different environmental conditions encountered during passage through the gastroin-testinal tract and following uptake into epithelial cells and macrophages. Successful establishment within the host therefore requires the coordinated expression of a large number of virulence genes necessary for the adaptation between the extracellular and intracellular phases of infection. In this study we show that the bacterial signal molecule, ppGpp, plays a major role in mediating the environmental signals involved in the regulation of both the extracellular and intracellular virulence gene programs. Under oxygen limiting conditions, we observed a strong ppGpp dependence for invasion gene expression, the result of severe reductions in expression of the Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) 1 transcriptional regulator genes hilA , C , and D and invF . Overexpression of the non-SPI1-encoded regulator RtsA restored hilA expression in the absence of ppGpp. SPI2-encoded genes, required for intracellular proliferation in macrophages, were activated in the wild type strain under aerobic, late log phase growth conditions. The expression of SPI2 genes was also shown to be ppGpp-dependent under these conditions. The results from this study suggest a mechanism for the alternate regulation of the opposing extracellular and intracellular virulence gene programs and indicate a remarkable specificity for ppGpp in the regulation of genes involved in virulence compared with the rest of the genome. This is the first demonstration that this highly conserved regulatory system is involved in bacterial virulence gene expression on a global scale."

Blocking separase-Cdk1 complex formation by microinjection of anti-separase antibodies prevents polar-body extrusion in vertebrate oocytes. Importantly, proper meiotic maturation is rescued by chemical inhibition of Cdk1 or expression of Cdk1-binding separase fragments lacking cohesin-cleaving activity."
https://openalex.org/W2163777386,"A promising target on tumor vasculature is phosphatidylserine (PS), an anionic phospholipid that resides exclusively on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of resting mammalian cells. We have shown previously that PS becomes exposed on the surface of endothelial cells (EC) in solid tumors. To target PS on tumor vasculature, the murine monoclonal antibody 3G4 was developed. 3G4 localizes to tumor vasculature, inhibits tumor growth, and enhances anti-tumor chemotherapies without toxicity in mice. A chimeric version of 3G4 is in clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the basis for the interaction between 3G4 and EC with surface-exposed PS. We demonstrate that antibody binding to PS is dependent on plasma protein β-2-glycoprotein 1 (β2GP1). β2GP1 is a 50-kDa glycoprotein that binds weakly to anionic phospholipids under physiological conditions. We show that 3G4 enhances binding of β2GP1 to EC induced to expose PS. We also show that divalent 3G4-β2GP1 complexes are required for enhanced binding, since 3G4 Fab′ fragments do not bind EC with exposed PS. Finally, we demonstrate that an artificial dimeric β2GP1 construct binds to EC with exposed PS in the absence of 3G4, confirming that antibody binding is mediated by dimerization of β2GP1. Together, these data indicate that 3G4 targets tumor EC by increasing the avidity of β2GP1 for anionic phospholipids through formation of multivalent 3G4-β2GP1 complexes.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4408-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most abundant anionic phospholipid of the plasma membrane and is considered the primary target of 3G4. It is well established that PS is actively confined to the internal leaflet of the plasma membrane under normal conditions in most cell types (3Daleke D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). PS asymmetry is maintained by an ATP-dependent aminophospholipid translocase that catalyzes the transport of aminophospholipids from the external leaflet to the internal leaflet of the plasma membrane (4Devaux P.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Loss of PS asymmetry results from outward movement of aminophospholipids in response to increased Ca2+ fluxes. This leads to inhibition of the translocase (5Bitbol M. Fellmann P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 268-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and/or activation of an exporter of PS that transports PS to the outer membrane surface (6Zhou Q.

Loss of asymmetry is observed under several physiological and pathological conditions, including apoptosis (7Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3062-3066PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions in the tumor microenvironment contain a number of factors that may activate and/or injure tumor EC as follows: (a) tumor-derived interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α activate the endothelium and induce expression of cell adhesion molecules (11Shaughnessy S.G. Buchanan M.R. Turple S. Richardson M. Orr F.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 787-796PubMed Google Scholar, 12Orr F.W. Wang H.H. Lafrenie R.M. Scherbarth S. Nance D.M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 310-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); (b) reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by leukocytes that adhere to the tumor endothelium (12Orr F.W. Wang H.H. Lafrenie R.M. Scherbarth S. Nance D.M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 310-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); and (c) ROS generated by tumor cells as a by-product of metabolism (11Shaughnessy S.G. Buchanan M.R. Turple S. Richardson M.

Investig. 1994; 71: 480-489PubMed Google Scholar) or as a result of exposure to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation (14Zulueta J.J. Yu F.S. Hertig I.A. Thannickal V.J. Hassoun P.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines, acidity, thrombin, hypoxia/reoxygenation, and ROS all induce PS exposure on EC in vitro (15Ran S. Downes A. Thorpe P.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6132-6140PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that 3G4 and other anti-PS monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) localize to tumor vessels following intravenous injection into mice bearing various types of primary and metastatic tumors (1Ran S. He J. Huang X. Soares M. Scothorn D. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Huang X. Bennett M. Thorpe P.E.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4646-4653PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of these anti-PS mAbs was indistinguishable from that of annexin A5, which also binds PS (16Ran S. Thorpe P.E. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2002; 54: 1479-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Importantly, these antibodies did not localize to vascular endothelium in non-tumor tissues. Phosphatidylserine-expressing EC in tumor vessels lack markers of apoptosis (active caspase-3, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling), are morphologically intact and metabolically active, and are able to transport blood and solutes (16Ran S. Thorpe P.E. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2002; 54: 1479-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, PS is a highly specific marker of functional, viable tumor endothelium. 3G4 treatment inhibits the growth of and metastatic spread of murine tumor allografts and human tumor xenografts (1Ran S. He J. Huang X. Soares M. Scothorn D. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), including orthotopic human breast tumors (2Huang X. Bennett M. Thorpe P.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4408-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and orthotopic human pancreatic tumors (18Beck A.W. Luster T.A. Miller A.F. Holloway S.E. Conner C.R. Barnett C.C. Thorpe P.E. Fleming J.B. Brekken R.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 118: 2639-2643Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When used in combination, 3G4 enhances the therapeutic efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drugs docetaxel and gemcitabine for treatment of breast and pancreatic tumors, respectively (2Huang X. Bennett M. Thorpe P.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4408-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Beck A.W. Luster T.A. Miller A.F. Holloway S.E. Conner C.R. Barnett C.C. Thorpe P.E. Fleming J.B. Brekken R.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 118: 2639-2643Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Histological evaluation of 3G4-treated tumors shows increased infiltration of host immune effector cells (primarily macrophages), along with disintegrated vessels, reduced vascularization, and increased central tumor necrosis. None of these phenomena is observed in control tumors, or normal organs taken from 3G4-treated mice. No toxicity has been observed in 3G4-treated animals as judged by extensive physiological, hematological, and histological examination, even at doses 10-fold higher than the therapeutic dose (1Ran S. He J. Huang X. Soares M. Scothorn D. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A human chimeric version of 3G4 is currently in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of patients with solid tumor malignancies. We reported previously that interaction between 3G4 and PS is dependent upon the plasma protein β-2-glycoprotein 1 (β2GP1) (1Ran S. He J. Huang X. Soares M. Scothorn D. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). β2GP1 is a member of the complement control protein family (19Steinkasserer A. Estaller C. Weiss E.H. Sim R.B. Day A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), consisting of five complement control protein repeats (also known as Sushi domains) in which the first four domains are regular repeats consisting of ∼60 amino acids. The fifth domain differs from the other four domains as it consists of 82 amino acids, including a conserved cluster of positively charged amino acids (282–287) and a conserved hydrophobic region (amino acids 311–317) responsible for binding of β2GP1 to anionic phospholipids (20Steinkasserer A.

Here we demonstrate that binding of 3G4 to EC with exposed PS is β2GP1-dependent, and we characterize the interaction required between 3G4 and β2GP1 for binding to EC with exposed PS.

Huang X. Soares M. Scothorn D. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 3G4 was produced originally in hybridoma supernatant but was subsequently converted to a mouse IgG2a isotype and is now produced in the NS0 mouse myeloma cell line. NS0 cells were cultured in serum-free Hybridoma Media with Synthechol NS0 supplement. A human IgG1 chimeric version of 3G4 (ch3G4) has also been generated and is produced under serum-free conditions by Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Tustin, CA). The mouse anti-human β2GP1 (anti-β2GP1) mAb was obtained from USBiological (Swampscott, MA). A hybridoma secreting C44, a colchicine-specific mouse IgG2a mAb, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and used as a control for 3G4 and anti-β2GP1. Rituximab (human IgG1 chimeric mAb) was obtained from the University of Texas Southwestern pharmacy and used as a control for ch3G4. All antibodies produced in culture supernatants were purified as described previously (24Ran S. Huang X. Downes A. Thorpe P.E. Neoplasia (Bratisl.). 2003; 5: 297-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). 3G4 F(ab′)2 was generated by incubation with pepsin. 3G4 Fab′ and control Fab′ 7H11 (anti-adenovirus) were generated by reduction of F(ab′)2 counterparts. All antibody cleavage products were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography and verified by SDS-PAGE. β2GP1 was purified from human plasma essentially as described previously (25Polz E. Wurm H. Kostner G.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1980; 11: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Wurm H. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, perchloric acid (70%) was added to pooled plasma to a final concentration of 1.57% (v/v). The precipitate was discarded, and the supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.5 with saturated Na2CO3, followed by extensive dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. This material was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to remove contaminants. The DEAE column flow-through was then applied to a heparin-Sepharose affinity column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and bound proteins were eluted using 1.0 m NaCl. Finally, the β2GP1 preparation was dialyzed against PBS and purified further by protein A/G to remove contaminating IgG. The final preparation yielded a homogeneous 50-kDa protein, as shown by nonreduced SDS/PAGE and Coomassie staining. Strategy—To generate pure recombinant full-length and deleted forms of hβ2GP1, the yeast shuttle expression vector pPIC6αA (Invitrogen) and host strain Mut+X-33 (Invitrogen) were used. The expression vector contains the 5′ promoter and the 3′ transcription termination sequences of the alcohol (methanol) oxidase gene (AOX1). The vector also has a yeast α-mating factor signal sequence downstream of the AOX1 promoter to which foreign cDNA can be fused for secretion of recombinant heterologous protein into the culture medium. Expression in Pichia pastoris provides glycosylation and disulfide bond formation similar to that in mammalian cells. Generation of Expression Constructs—The following five expression constructs were made using hβ2GP1 cDNA: 1) the entire coding region of hβ2GP1 cDNA without its cognate signal peptide (domain 1–5, 5′ primer used, 5′-GGAATTCGGACGGACCTGTCCCAAGC-3′); 2) domain 1 deleted (domain 2–5, 5′ primer used, 5′-GGAATTCGTATGTCCTTTTGC-3′); 3) domain 1 and 2 deleted (domain 3–5, 5′ primer used, 5′-GGAATTCGCTCCCATCATCTGC-3′); 4) domain 1–3 deleted (domain 4–5, 5′ primer used, 5′-GGAATTCGTAAAATGCCCATTC-3′); and 5) domain 5 only (5′ primer used; 5′-GGAATTCGCATCTTGTAAAGTAC-3′). A common 3′ primer, 5′-TTCTAGATTAGCATGGCTTTAC-3′, was used for PCR of all fragments. PCR-amplified fragments were inserted in-frame between the EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites of pPICαA, directly downstream from the α-mating factor signal sequence. A stop codon was introduced at the end of each fragment to prevent fusion of the recombinant proteins to a c-Myc epitope or a His tag at the C terminus. Plasmid constructs were propagated in Escherichia coli in the presence of 100 μg/ml blasticidin and verified by restriction analysis and nucleotide sequencing. Recombinant proteins expressed by constructs 1–5 encoded proteins of ∼36, 29, 24, 16, and 9 kDa, respectively, before glycosylation. Transformation and Screening of Expression Clones—The recombinant plasmid constructs were linearized with restriction enzyme SacI and purified, and 10 μg was used to transform host strain X-33 by the spheroplasts method (Invitrogen). Transformants for each of these constructs were selected on YPD (yeast extract peptone dextrose medium) plates containing 400 μg/ml blasticidin for 4 days. Several clones for each of these constructs were restreaked on YPD plates with 400 μg/ml blasticidin to determine the true integrants. Ten clones of each construct were then streaked on Minimal Dextrose (MD) and Minimal Methanol (MM) plates. Five clones of each construct, growing equally well on both MD and MM plates, were then grown in liquid MD and MM medium for 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. Supernatants and pellets for each clone at each time point were analyzed by Western blot using anti-hβ2GP1 polyclonal antibody. Clones that showed highest expression of the protein in supernatant were further used for large scale preparation. Large Scale Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant proteins were produced using culture conditions recommended by Invitrogen. A starter culture of each clone was cultured in 5 ml of buffered minimal glycerol-complex medium (BMGY) at 30 °C with vigorous shaking overnight. Cells were collected, used to inoculate 25 ml of BMGY, and grown for 2 days. Cells from the 25-ml culture were then used to inoculate 1 liter of buffered minimal methanol-complex (BMMY) medium (1.0% methanol). Culture was continued for 4 days at 30 °C with vigorous shaking, and 100% methanol was added every 24 h (final concentration of 1.0%) to maintain protein expression. Culture medium was clarified by centrifugation (4000 × g, 15 min), and supernatant was dialyzed for 2 days at 4°C in 50 mm Tris buffer before being applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris buffer. Flow-through solution was collected and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column. β2GP1 was eluted from heparin-Sepharose column with 1 m NaCl, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris buffer, concentrated using Amicon concentrator, and analyzed by Western blot. The N terminus of each protein was sequenced to confirm cleavage of the α-factor leader sequence. Protein yields varied from 10 mg/liter (full-length β2GP1) to 25 mg/liter (β2GP1 domain V). Nicked hβ2GP1 was prepared from intact β2GP1 purified from human plasma as described above. hβ2GP1 was incubated with plasmin-coated beads at 37 °C for 17 h. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the cleaved protein was recovered. Western blotting of the purified product indicated the nicked β2GP1 preparations were plasmin-free and did not contain plasmin autoproteolytic products (no reactivity with anti-plasmin or anti-angiostatin antibodies). N-terminal sequence analysis revealed two N termini that corresponded to the N terminus of β2GP1, and a new sequence was generated at the Lys-317/Thr-318 cleavage site. The assay was performed as described previously (1Ran S. He J. Huang X. Soares M. Scothorn D. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. PS-coated Immunlon 1B microtiter plates were blocked overnight in 1% OVA (w/v). The following day, serial 2-fold dilutions of 3G4 were prepared from an initial concentration of 13.33 nm. Dilutions were performed in 1% OVA or 10% nonheat-inactivated sera from cow, human, rat, or mouse. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and binding of 3G4 was detected as described previously (1Ran S. He J. Huang X. Soares M. Scothorn D. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All ELISA experiments were performed at least three times, and representative figures are shown. The assay was performed as described above with the following modifications. hβ2GP1, nicked hβ2GP1, or recombinant hβ2GP1 were coated on 96-well Immunlon 2HB microtiter plates overnight at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Plates were then blocked in 1% OVA for 1 h at room temperature. 3G4, ch3G4, or anti-β2GP1 were diluted in 1% OVA to an initial concentration of 13.33 nm, and serial 2-fold dilutions were prepared. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and antibody binding was detected as described previously (1Ran S. He J. Huang X. Soares M. Scothorn D. Thorpe P.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All ELISA experiments were performed at least three times, and representative figures are shown. Protein samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min in nonreducing SDS sample buffer. The samples were then loaded onto a 4–15% Tris-HCl gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated using a Mini Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked overnight in 3% BSA (w/v). Membranes were probed with anti-β2GP1, 3G4, or control mouse IgG diluted to 1 μg/ml in 3% BSA, washed thoroughly, and incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Finally, membranes were developed using an Opti-4CN substrate kit. Detection with Antibodies—Adult bovine aortic endothelial (ABAE) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mm l-glutamine. ABAE cells were removed from subconfluent cultures by brief exposure to 0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, and 8-well chamber slides were seeded with 2 × 104 cells/well. Following overnight culture, cells were washed gently with PBS and treated with 200 μm LPC to induce PS exposure. LPC treatment was performed in the presence of 3G4, ch3G4, or control IgG (all at 2 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in either 10% FBS or 10% normal mouse serum. When LPC treatment was performed in 10% mouse serum, hβ2GP1 was added as a co-factor because 3G4/ch3G4 does not bind PS in mouse serum (see “Results”). Binding of antibodies to cells with exposed PS was determined by immunofluorescence staining. Cells were washed thoroughly in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v), and incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Next, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) to detect antibody binding. Finally, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and counterstained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes). Images were captured at a magnification of ×200 using a Coolsnap digital camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and analyzed with MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Detection with Artificial Dimeric hβ2GP1 Constructs—Dimeric hβ2GP1 constructs apple4-C321S-β2GP1 (hβ2GP1 dimer) and apple4-C321S-β2GP1-W316S (mutant hβ2GP1 dimer) were generated as described previously (27Lutters B.C.

ABAE cells were induced to exposed PS as described above. LPC treatment was performed in the presence of monomeric purified plasma hβ2GP1, hβ2GP1 dimer, or mutant hβ2GP1 dimer (all at 2 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in 10% FBS. Cells were then washed thoroughly with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v). Binding of the hβ2GP1 constructs to cells with exposed PS was detected with anti-β2GP1, followed by staining with appropriate immunofluorescent secondary detection reagents as described above. The area of antibody binding was determined using MetaVue image analysis software, which is able to quantify the number of illuminated pixels in an image. Images of FITC fluorescence were used to quantify antibody binding. Corresponding images of DAPI fluorescence were used to normalize the FITC images for the number of cells present in the field. A small FITC/DAPI ratio indicates a small antibody binding area, whereas a large FITC/DAPI ratio indicates a large binding area. The FITC/DAPI ratios were used to determine increases or decreases in antibody binding area relative to a basal amount of antibody binding under the selected conditions. Five images at ×200 magnification were used for each analysis. Data are presented as average relative FITC/DAPI ratios with error bars representing the standard deviation. 3G4 Binds Serum Glycoprotein β2GP1—3G4 bound to PS-coated microtiter plates when serial dilutions were performed in 10% bovine serum (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no 3G4 binding occurred when serial dilutions were performed in 1% OVA. This finding suggests that a factor present in bovine serum mediates the interaction between 3G4 and PS. To determine whether sera from other mammalian species can mediate the interaction between 3G4 and PS, serial dilutions of 3G4 were also performed in 10% mouse, rat, or human serum. 3G4 bound PS in the presence of rat and human serum but not in the presence of mouse serum (Fig. 1A). 3G4 also bound PS in the presence of hamster, ferret, guinea pig, rabbit, and monkey serum (data not shown). Therefore, with the exception of mouse, the serum protein epitope recognized by 3G4 seems to be conserved among mammalian species. Because 3G4 was raised against EC induced to expose PS, it is possible that the reactivity of 3G4 is directed against serum proteins that bind PS. To test this possibility, microtiter plates were coated with a panel of known PS-binding proteins, and the reactivity of 3G4 against these proteins was determined. 3G4 bound only to β2GP1 (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). To determine which domain of β2GP1 is recognized by 3G4, five recombinant hβ2GP1 proteins were generated. These proteins lack various N-terminal domains because of serial truncations from the N terminus. Each protein was coated on a microtiter plate and incubated with a serial dilution of 3G4. Only proteins containing domain II of hβ2GP1 were detected by 3G4 (Fig. 1C). To determine whether β2GP1 is the only serum protein recognized by 3G4, purified hβ2GP1 and 10% human serum were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a membrane support for immunoblot. 3G4 detected the 50-kDa purified hβ2GP1 and a single band of similar size in human serum (Fig. 1D). Importantly, the 3G4 immunoblot is virtually identical to a blot generated using an anti-β2GP1 antibody. A control mIgG antibody did not detect any protein. Together, these data demonstrate that 3G4 binds β2GP1, and binding is dependent upon domain II.TABLE 1Screening 3G4 for reactivity with serum proteins known to interact with phospholipidsSerum protein3G4 reactivityaEqual amounts of indicated protein were coated on microtiter plates, blocked in 1% OVA, and incubated with 3G4 at 1 μg/ml.

https://openalex.org/W2171805258,"We have obtained evidence for conformational communication between ubiquinol oxidation (center P) and ubiquinone reduction (center N) sites of the yeast bc1 complex dimer by analyzing antimycin binding and heme bH reduction at center N in the presence of different center P inhibitors. When stigmatellin was occupying center P, concentration-dependent binding of antimycin occurred only to half of the center N sites. The remaining half of the bc1 complex bound antimycin with a slower rate that was independent of inhibitor concentration, indicating that a slow conformational change needed to occur before half of the enzyme could bind antimycin. In contrast, under conditions where the Rieske protein was not fixed proximal to heme bL at center P, all center N sites bound antimycin with fast and concentration-dependent kinetics. Additionally, the extent of fast cytochrome b reduction by menaquinol through center N in the presence of stigmatellin was approximately half of that observed when myxothiazol was bound at center P. The reduction kinetics of the bH heme by decylubiquinol in the presence of stigmatellin or myxothiazol were also consistent with a model in which fixation of the Rieske protein close to heme bL in both monomers allows rapid binding of ligands only to one center N. Decylubiquinol at high concentrations was able to abolish the biphasic binding of antimycin in the presence of stigmatellin but did not slow down antimycin binding rates. These results are discussed in terms of half-of-the-sites activity of the dimeric bc1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2012518259,"Abstract Aspartokinase III (AKIII) from Escherichia coli catalyzes an initial commitment step of the aspartate pathway, giving biosynthesis of certain amino acids including lysine. We report crystal structures of AKIII in the inactive T-state with bound feedback allosteric inhibitor lysine and in the R-state with aspartate and ADP. The structures reveal an unusual configuration for the regulatory ACT domains, in which ACT2 is inserted into ACT1 rather than the expected tandem repeat. Comparison of R- and T-state AKIII indicates that binding of lysine to the regulatory ACT1 domain in R-state AKIII instigates a series of changes that release a “latch”, the β15-αK loop, from the catalytic domain, which in turn undergoes large rotational rearrangements, promoting tetramer formation and completion of the transition to the T-state. Lysine-induced allosteric transition in AKIII involves both destabilizing the R-state and stabilizing the T-state tetramer. Rearrangement of the catalytic domain blocks the ATP-binding site, which is therefore the structural basis for allosteric inhibition of AKIII by lysine."
https://openalex.org/W1971054014,"The spectral and kinetic characteristics of two oxidized states of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) have been compared. The first is the oxidized state of enzyme isolated in the fast form (O) and the second is the form that is obtained immediately after oxidation of fully reduced CcO with O2 (OH). No observable differences were found between O and OH states in: (i) the rate of anaerobic reduction of heme a3 for both the detergent-solubilized enzyme and for enzyme embedded in its natural membraneous environment, (ii) the one-electron distribution between heme a3 and CuB in the course of the full anaerobic reduction, (iii) the optical and (iv) EPR spectra. Within experimental error of these characteristics both forms are identical. Based on these observations it is concluded that the reduction potentials and the ligation states of heme a3 and CuB are the same for CcO in the O and OH states.

The reduction of O2 to water is associated with the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient. Two processes contribute to the development of this gradient. The first is the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c from the cytosolic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane coupled to proton consumption for water formation from the matrix compartment of mitochondria. The second process is proton pumping during which protons are translocated from the matrix space to the cytosolic side of the membrane (1Wikström M. Nature. 1977; 266: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar).In CcO four redox centers participate in electron transfer (ET) and reduction of O2 to H2O. Three of these centers, heme a, heme a3, and copper ion, called CuB, are in subunit I and a dinuclear copper center CuA, is located in subunit II (2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). CuA serves as the acceptor of electrons either from ferrocytochrome c or from artificial electron donors (3Pan L.P. Hibdon S. Liu R.-Q. Durham B. Millet F.

ET continues further to the catalytic center composed of heme a3 and CuB where O2 is reduced to water.The part of the catalytic cycle during which electrons are delivered to CcO, prior to reaction with O2, is usually referred to as the reductive phase. In the subsequent oxidative phase the reduced enzyme reacts with O2. It was proposed (11Michel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15129-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and demonstrated later that proton pumping takes place in both the reductive and oxidative phases (12Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Ruitenberg M. Kannt A. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Michel H.

A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Two protons are pumped in the oxidative phase when fully reduced CcO is oxidized by oxygen (12Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Subsequently, if this freshly oxidized enzyme is reduced by two electrons two additional protons are translocated across the membrane (12Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).However, proton translocation in the reductive phase is only observed with freshly oxidized enzyme. This reoxidized enzyme appears to be in a metastable state, which relaxes relatively slowly in the absence of electron donors to the stable oxidized form on a time scale of seconds. These two forms of oxidized enzyme, CcO as it exists immediately after oxidation and the subsequent relaxed form, are designated as the OH and the O states, respectively (12Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).It has been concluded that the free energy needed for proton pumping in the reductive phase is transiently conserved in the high-energy OH state of the enzyme. After the enzyme has relaxed from OH to O, this stored energy dissipated, and the reduction proceeds without associated proton translocation (12Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consequently it was anticipated that there would be differences in the reduction potentials and coordination of one or both metals in the heme a3-CuB site between the OH and O forms (14Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Reaction 1 summarizes a current view on the steps in which proton pumping occurs. The reduction of oxidized CcO as isolated (O) by four electrons produces the fully reduced enzyme (FR). When fully reduced enzyme reacts with O2 two protons are pumped and the metastable oxidized OH state is formed. Transfer of two electrons to OH is associated with the translocation of two additional protons and generation of partially reduced enzyme (PR).This reaction scheme with its two states for oxidized enzyme does not take into account that there are altogether six forms of oxidized oxidase described in the literature: “resting” (15Antonini E.

The term resting is used for oxidase that shows low catalytic activity because of slow internal ET from CuA-heme a to the catalytic site (15Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Greenwood C. Wilson M.T.

Chem. 1979; 254: 10769-10775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This form of enzyme can be activated when fully reduced resting enzyme is reacted with oxygen. The activated state, which exhibits rapid internal ET, was called pulsed enzyme (15Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Greenwood C. Wilson M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1979; 254: 10769-10775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This state is, however, not stable and in the absence of electron flux through oxidase the pulsed CcO relaxes to the resting state (15Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Greenwood C. Wilson M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 78: 3128-3132Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Brunori M. Colosimo A. Rainoni G. Wilson M.T. Antonini E. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that both the resting and pulsed forms constitute an important regulatory mechanism in mitochondrial respiration (15Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Greenwood C. Wilson M.T.

Acta. 1996; 1276: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The recognition of this inhomogeneity led to the development of purification protocols that produce enzyme with a homogenous catalytic site (18Baker G.M.

This form was called the fast enzyme (18Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Moody A.J. Cooper C.E. Rich P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to reflect the more rapid binding of cyanide relative to the slow form. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that fast CcO is equivalent to enzyme in mitochondria (18Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is already in the active state (22Brandt U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was suggested later that fast CcO is a native state of oxidase (21Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The term “the O state” belongs to oxidase as isolated (14Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Unfortunately this assignment is not unambiguous because the isolated enzyme can be in either the fast or the resting form. It means that the O state can represent either the native enzyme or enzyme with the modified catalytic center.The OH state is attributed to the enzyme formed immediately after reoxidation and consequently corresponds to pulsed oxidase. OH is a metastable form that relaxes to the O state (12Verkhovsky M.I. Jasaitis A. Verkhovskaya M.L. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Nature. 1999; 400: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, the rates of relaxation of OH and the pulsed enzyme are different. It has been estimated that the lifetime of OH is about several seconds (14Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast the transition of the pulsed to the resting or slow forms occurs on the time scale of minutes (24Shaw R.W. Hansen R.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6637-6640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Beinert H. Shaw R.W. Hansen R.E. King T.E. Mason H.S. Morrison M Oxidases and Related Redox Systems.

Thus it seems that the energy stored in the OH state dissipates more rapidly than the enzyme relaxes from the pulsed to resting state.In our recent study on ET to the catalytic site of CcO we have established that the rates of internal ET to heme a3 during the anaerobic reduction of the fast CcO in either the O or OH states are practically the same (27Antalik M. Jancura D. Palmer G. Fabian M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14881-14889Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This kinetic equivalence indicated that the redox properties of heme a3 are identical in these two forms. In the present work the kinetic and spectral characteristics of the fast enzyme in both O and OH states are compared more extensively. We employed both the detergent-solubilized CcO as well as CcO in electron transport particles, where it is embedded in its natural membraneous environment. The optical and EPR spectra together with the kinetics of reduction of heme a3 and CuB in the reductive phase for these two forms were found to be the same. The results imply that the properties of catalytic sites of fast or native CcO in O and OH states are equivalent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Hepes and Mes buffers, horse heart cytochrome c (prepared without trichloroacetic acid), glass beads size 16, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide reduced form (apNADH), phenazine methosulfate, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, cholic acid, and valinomycin were from Sigma. Hexaamineruthenium (III) chloride and sodium hydrosulfite (dithionite) were from Aldrich, peroxide-free Triton X-100 was from Roche Diagnostics, and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) from Anatrace.Preparation of Enzyme and Electron Transport Particles—Bovine heart CcO was isolated from mitochondria by the modified method of Soulimane and Buse (23Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) into DM. Two modifications were introduced into this protocol. First, instead of using KCl in all purification steps we employed K2SO4. Replacing KCl by K2SO4 was necessary to avoid the binding of Cl– to the catalytic site of CcO (28Fabian M. Skultety L. Brunel C. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6061-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, gel filtration chromatography was introduced as the last step of purification. The application of gel filtration is a consequence of our observation that extended exposure of CcO to the anion exchanger Sepharose Q modifies the enzyme surface sites for anion binding (29Fabian M. Jancura D. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16170-16177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore we shortened the time that CcO was exposed to Sepharose Q. As this led to incomplete purification an additional step was required. Briefly, mitochondria are subjected to protein extraction twice with Triton X-100. EDTA (1 mm) and histidine (1 mm) supplemented the original buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose) to minimize binding of transition metals; the EDTA was omitted in the second extraction. The second extract, containing solubilized CcO, was further purified in two chromatographic steps during which the detergent Triton X-100 is exchanged to DM. The CcO bound to the Sepharose Q fast flow column was washed with 700 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% DM and then by 500 ml of the same buffer containing 70 mm K2SO4. The CcO was eluted from the column with 200 mm K2SO4 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% DM. The eluted CcO was concentrated and further purified on a Sephacryl S300HR column using 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm K2SO4, and 0.1% DM as buffer. During this chromatography CcO separates into two fractions. The first fraction contains a small amount of CcO contaminated with other proteins. The second, major fraction, containing the purified CcO and used in this study was analyzed for its subunit composition and shown to contain all 13 subunits (data were obtained in collaboration with Dr. A. Musatov, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Enzyme concentration was determined from the optical spectra of oxidized CcO using an extinction coefficient at A424 of 156 mm–1 cm–1 (30Liao G.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).CcO as isolated by this method is in the fast form and is considered to be the native form of the enzyme (21Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The key factor that controls the state of purified enzyme is pH. It has been demonstrated that the catalytic site of CcO is highly sensitive to pH and can be easily modified during purification, if the pH is not kept at or slightly above pH 8.0 (18Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it appears to us that the presence of cholate, a detergent often used for enzyme purification, is also one of the critical factors controlling the conversion of the native enzyme to the resting form. We believe that the combination of low pH plus cholate modifies the catalytic site of oxidase.For comparison of the kinetic properties of fast and resting CcO we have also prepared the resting enzyme. This form was made by incubation of the isolated fast form (217 μm) for 6 h at pH 7.0 and 23 °C in 10 mm Hepes, 50 mm K2SO4, 0.1% DM, and 0.05% sodium cholate. During this process the catalytic site was modified and the most obvious change is observed in the position of the Soret band maximum. The optical spectra collected at pH 8.0 showed that this shifted from 424 to 421 nm.Mitochondria, the starting material for CcO purification, were also used for isolation of electron transport particles (ETP). The isolated mitochondria were washed twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose. Then cytochrome c was depleted from the washed mitochondria (31Jacobs E.E. Sanadi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 531-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lenaz G. MacLennan D. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 499-504Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To extract cytochrome c, the mitochondria were diluted to a protein concentration of about 3.3 mg/ml with cold 10 mm K2SO4, stirred at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 30 min. Cytochrome c was extracted by suspension of the sediment in cold solution of 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm K2SO4, and 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6. This suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 25 min. To ensure that extraction of cytochrome c is complete, this step was repeated twice using the same buffer with ferricyanide omitted and twice with 200 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm K2SO4. These mitochondria were mechanically disrupted by mixing with glass beads and buffer (200 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 30 mm K2SO4) in a vortex mixer for about 1 min at 4 °C. Typically for the mixing we used 1 volume of sedimented mitochondria, 2 volumes of buffer, and 1 volume of glass beads. The disrupted mitochondria were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant fraction containing ETP was collected. The CcO concentration in ETP was established from the difference optical spectrum of fully reduced minus oxidized CcO using an extinction coefficient at ΔA605–613 of 23.2 mm–1 cm–1 (30Liao G.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The concentration of CcO in ETP was about 1.2 μm.Stopped-flow Measurements—The kinetics of reduction of oxidized CcO as isolated (O) by hexaamineruthenium were measured under anaerobic conditions in an argon atmosphere using a stopped-flow apparatus. An anaerobic solution of O was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the mixture of hexaamineruthenium and sodium dithionite. Unless noted otherwise, all kinetics of internal ET to heme a3 were obtained with CcO in the O state in the presence of 3 mm hexaamineruthenium and 5 mm dithionite (final concentrations). All rate constants for ET are averages of at least three measurements.For the measurement of ET in the OH state anaerobic, fully reduced CcO in the presence of 6 mm hexaamineruthenium and 10 mm dithionite was mixed in the stopped flow with air-saturated buffers. In the ∼3-ms dead time of the apparatus, the enzyme is oxidized and any oxygen consumed by dithionite, both CuA and heme a are reduced by the excess reductant, and only the re-reduction of heme a3 is available for monitoring.The kinetics of O and OH reduction by hexaamineruthenium were determined under anaerobic conditions in an argon atmosphere using the OLIS RSM-1000 stopped-flow apparatus collecting 1000 spectra per second; the light path was 20 mm. The solutions were made anaerobic following a published procedure (27Antalik M. Jancura D. Palmer G. Fabian M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14881-14889Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).To remove oxygen from the stopped-flow instrument the whole flow system was filled with a buffered solution of 5 mm dithionite for about 4 h prior to measurements. The driving syringes were submerged in water that was continually purged with nitrogen. The temperature was 23 °C.Rapid Freezing and EPR Measurements—For preparation of rapid-freeze samples a System 1000 chemical/freeze quench apparatus was employed (Update Instrument Inc., Madison, WI). In this apparatus O form at CcO (100 μm) was mixed with 5 μm ferrocytochrome c and 10 mm dithionite at 23 °C, and the samples were rapidly frozen at selected times in a bath of isopentane precooled to 125–130 K. The samples for OH were made by mixing reduced CcO in the presence of 5 μm ferrocytochrome c and 10 mm dithionite with air-saturated buffer. EPR spectra of samples prepared by the rapid-freeze method were recorded with a Varian E-6 or Bruker EMX spectrometer. The conditions for EPR measurements were as follows: frequency, 9.26 GHz in the Varian spectrometer, and 9.6 GHz in Bruker instrument; power, 10 or 30 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 10 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; and temperature, 4.2 K. In the Bruker spectrometer the frequency was continually monitored during the EPR scan with the built in frequency counter. In the Varian spectrometer the Hewlett-Packard 5342A Microwave frequency counter was used. The reading of frequency was accurate to 10–4 GHz. The accuracy of the magnetic field was ±1.1 G as established by using the pitch standard.To make samples of OH for EPR measurement without excess reductant O was fully reduced by a stoichiometric amount of apNADH in the presence of a catalytic concentration of phenazine methosulfate in the absence of oxygen. This reduced enzyme was then oxidized by air and frozen in a dry ice/methanol bath within 25 s of reoxidation.The high-spin signal at g = 6 of heme a3 was quantified by double integration with the lower integration limit taken below the low-field end of the spectrum, and the upper limit at a field corresponding to a g value of 4.67 (33Aasa R. Albracht S.P.J. Falk K.-E. Lanne B. Vänngård T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This integrated intensity was compared with the signal of a standard high-spin complex of met-myoglobin fluoride.The standard errors in the measurements of g = 6 EPR signals of CcO in the rapid freeze quench samples were estimated from the reaction of oxymyoglobin (Mb-O2) with NO (data obtained in collaboration with Dr. C. Rogge, University of Texas Medical School, Houston, TX). The reaction of Mb-O2 with a stoichiometric amount of NO quantitatively produces the high-spin signal in the dead time of the rapid-freeze quench apparatus. From EPR measurement on four samples the variation in both the height of the high-spin signal and the integrated intensity were calculated. The variation in height was found to be ±19% with ±22% variation in the integrated intensity. The major contribution to this deviation comes from packing the samples. Nevertheless, this uncertainty does not lead to a large scatter of data points as is documented by the time dependence of the g = 6 signal (Fig. 2).Fitting Model and Estimation of Reduction Potentials for Heme a3 and CuB—In the"

Whether these two pathways are connected or operate independently of each other in T-cells has been unclear. Here, we report that anti-CD3 and anti-CD3/CD28 can induce PKB and GSK-3α phosphorylation in the Vav-1–/– Jurkat cell line J. Vav.1 and in primary CD4-positive Vav-1–/– T-cells. Reduced GSK-3α phosphorylation was observed in Vav-1,2,3–/– T-cells together with a complete loss of FOXO1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, PKB and GSK-3 phosphorylation was unperturbed in the presence of GEF-inactive Vav-1 that inhibited interleukin-2 gene activation and a form of Src homology 2 domain-containing lymphocytic protein of 76-kDa (SLP-76) that is defective in binding to Vav-1. The pathway also was intact under conditions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibition and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D. Both events are down-stream targets of Vav-1. Overall, our findings indicate that the TcR and TcR-CD28 driven PKB-GSK-3 pathway can operate independently of Vav-1 in T-cells.

Overall, our findings indicate that the TcR and TcR-CD28 driven PKB-GSK-3 pathway can operate independently of Vav-1 in T-cells. T-cell activation is induced by ligation of the antigen-receptor (TcRζ/CD3) as well as co-receptors such as CD28. TcRζ/CD3 and CD4/CD8-lck initiate tyrosine phosphorylation, while TcRζ/CD3 and CD28 induce the production of D-3 lipids (1Rudd C.E. Schneider H. Nat. Rev.

Primary responses exhibit more of a dependence on CD28 than do secondary responses, and the co-receptor can influence the differentiation of T helper 2 (Th2) versus T helper 1 (Th1) cell, increase cell survival, and prevent the induction of T-cell anergy (3Bluestone J.A.

The molecular basis of TcRζ/CD3 and CD28 signaling in T-cells has been the subject of much investigation.

In addition to activating the PI3K pathway, TcRζ/CD3 and CD28 signaling is dependent on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav-1. It has a calponin homology domain, an acidic motif, a zinc finger-like region, two SH3 domains, and a SH2 domain (31Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell.

These residues each reside within a YESP motif, both of which are phosphorylated upon receptor ligation. The Dbl homology (DH) domain has GEF activity for the activation of the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (37Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S.

Furthermore, co-expression can drive NFAT translocation into the nucleus of COS cells in response to CD28 ligation (36Raab M. Pfister S. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 2001; 15: 921-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, CD28 engagement can activate IκB kinase (IKK) complex and NF-κB activation in a Vav-1 dependent fashion (42Piccolella E. Spadaro F. Ramoni C. Marinari B. Costanzo A. Levrero M. Thomson L. Abraham R.T. Tuosto L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In keeping this, confocal microscopy has shown that endogenous VAV-1 and IKKα co-localize in response to CD28 stimulation (42Piccolella E. Spadaro F. Ramoni C. Marinari B. Costanzo A. Levrero M.

Vav-1 has been reported to cooperate with protein kinase C theta to activate c-Jun kinase (JNK) (43Moller A. Dienz O. Hefner S.P. Groge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol.

Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Given that TcR and TcR-CD28 generate signals that depend on Vav-1 and PI3K, an important question is whether these pathways are interconnected or operate independently of each other. Observations have been mixed in other systems. Vav-1 GEF activity has been reported to be dependent on inositol lipids due to pleckstrin homology domain binding and localization (45Han J. Luby-Phillips K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Murali-Krisha=na U. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). By contrast, inhibition of PI3K does not inhibit Vav-3 phosphorylation in Vav-3-deficient cells (46Inabe K. Ishiai M. Scherenburg A.M. Freshney N. Downward J. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Other studies have reported a partial or full role for Vav-1 in activating PI3K (47Manetz T.S. Gonzalez-Espinosa C.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that anti-CD3 and anti-CD3/CD28 can induce PKB and GSK-3 phosphorylation in the Vav-1–/– Jurkat cell line J.Vav.1 and in primary CD4-positive Vav-1–/– T-cells. Reduced but significant GSK-3 phosphorylation was also observed in Vav-1,2,3–/– T-cells, despite a complete loss of FOXO1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, PKB and GSK-3 phosphorylation was unperturbed in the presence of a GEF-inactive form of Vav-1, a mutant that markedly inhibits IL-2 gene activation. Wild-type levels of phosphorylation were also observed in the presence of a form of SLP-76 that is defective in Vav-1 binding and in cells treated with cytochalasin D to disrupt the cytoskeleton. These findings indicate that TcR and TcR-CD28 can induce PKB/GSK-3 signaling independently of Vav-1 in T-cells. Cells and Reagents—The Jurkat T-cell line was maintained using standard cell culture techniques. The J.Vav1 Jurkat cell line (clone 15–11 (Vav-1+/+) and clone 14-9 (Vav-1–/–)) were a kind gift from Dr. Robert Abraham, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA. WT and Vav-1–/– BALB/c mice were a kind gift from Dr. Victor Tybulewicz, National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK. Vav-1,2,3–/– B10.BR mice were kindly provided by Dr. Martin Turner, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK. CD4+ T-cells were purified from splenocytes freshly isolated from WT and Vav-1–/– BALB/c mice using Mouse CD4 (L3T4) Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, UK). This technique resulted in the purification of a population of T-cells that were greater than 95% positive for CD4 as determined by FACS staining. Splenocytes were used for the analysis of the Vav-1,2,3–/– mice. Cytochalasin D was purchased from Calbiochem (UK); SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) was purchased from Tocris (UK). Antibodies anti-human CD3 (OKT3) (American Type Culture Collection hybridoma) (2 μg/ml) and anti-human CD28 (9.3) (Bristol Meyers Squibb) (8 μg/ml) were cross-linked with rabbit anti-mouse (RαM) antibody (Southern Biotechnology), at concentrations that were half the sum of total primary stimulatory antibodies. For control RαM-only stimulations, 5 μg/ml was used. Anti-mouse CD3 (2C11) (2 μg/ml) and anti-mouse CD28 (PV-1) (8 μg/ml) from BioExpress were cross-linked with rabbit anti-hamster (RαH) antibody (Sigma, UK), at concentrations that were half the sum of total primary stimulatory antibodies or 5 μg/ml for the RαH-only control stimulations. Plasmids—pCMV3-myc-hVav (WT) and pCMV3-hVav-L213Q (GEF-inactive) (Martin Turner, Babraham Institute), 3×NFAT-AP1-Luc reporter construct (Steve Burakoff, Dana-Faber Institute of Cancer, Boston, MA), wild-type SLP-76 and Y113F (Paul Findell, Roche Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) were cloned into SRα. Transfection—For transfections, 50 × 106 Jurkat cells were co-transfected with 50 μg of the indicated constructs and 25 μg of 3xNFAT-AP1-Luc reporter, using a BTX PrecisionPulse electroporator (250 V, 800 μF, and 200 Ω). Cells were incubated for 18 h in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, prior to stimulation. Luciferase Assay—For the luciferase assays, 0.5 × 106 Jurkat cells were incubated in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum plus the appropriate antibodies for 6 h at 37 °C in a 96-well plate. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using a Luminat LB9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) and the luciferase assay system protocol from Promega. Analysis of GSK-3 and PKB Phosphorylation—1 × 106 Jurkat cells (standard or the J.Vav1 Jurkat cell line) or 3 × 106 CD4+ T-cells purified from spleens of WT or Vav-1–/– BALB/c mice were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated on a rotor with the appropriate primary stimulatory antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min and then incubated with cross-linking antibody (RαMorRαH) at 37 °C for the indicated times. Stimulations were terminated by addition of cold RPMI 1640 medium. Whole cells were pelleted, boiled in 3× SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The following antibodies were used in immunoblotting: anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β (serines 21/9) (Cell Signaling Technology) (1:1000), anti-GSK-3α/β (BIOSOURCE) (1:1000), anti-Vav-1 (Upstate Biotechnologies) (1:1000), anti-SLP-76 (hybridoma from American Type Culture Collection) (1:1000), anti-phospho-PKB (Thr-308) (Cell Signaling Technology) (1:1000), anti-PKB (Cell Signaling Technology) (1:1000), anti-phospho-FOXO1 (Cell Signaling Technology) (1:1000), and anti-mouse/rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) (1:5000). Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of GSK-3α- and PKB phosphorylation was done using ImageJ (NIH) densitometry software. Readings were expressed as a percent of the phosphorylated band of maximum intensity. Phosphorylation levels were normalized to total protein expression levels by plotting the ratio (percent phosphorylation)/(% total) × 100. Anti-CD3 Surface Clustering—Jurkat cells were either untreated or preincubated with the indicated concentration of cytochalasin D for 1 h. Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml cold FACS buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0) and incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-CD3 (OKT3) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with cold (0 h samples) or prewarmed (1-h samples) FACS buffer and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was added, followed by incubation immediately on ice or at 37 °C for 1 h. Cold FACS buffer was added to terminate the stimulations, and cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then mounted on coverslips. TcR distribution was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. At least 200 T-cells were counted for TcR cap formation in each experiment. F-actin Content—Jurkat cells were treated as above except RαM was used to cross-link anti-CD3 (OKT3) for 1 h at 37°C. Cold medium was added to terminate the stimulations, and paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.03% saponin/FACS buffer followed by 0.3% saponin/FACS buffer. F-actin content was quantified by staining with FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) and analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). To investigate the relationship between the PI3K and Vav-1 pathways in response to TcR and TcR-CD28 ligation, we initially wanted to confirm that anti-CD3 and anti-CD3/CD28 induced PKB and GSK-3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies were used for cross-linking of receptors on Jurkat cells for various times at 37 °C. This was followed by immunoblotting of cell lysates with a monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated Thr-308 of PKB (upper panels) or to phosphorylated Ser-21 and Ser-9 sites on GSK-3α and -β, respectively (middle panels). Anti-CD3 increased PKB phosphorylation by 5 min relative to the RαM control (Fig. 1, upper panel, lane 2 versus lane 1). Phosphorylation was enhanced with anti-CD28 co-ligation (lane 4 versus lane 2). Anti-CD28 alone also induced PKB phosphorylation to levels as high or higher than observed with anti-CD3 (lane 3 versus lane 2). Blotting with an antibody to non-phosphorylated PKB confirmed equal levels of protein expression (lower upper panel, lanes 1–16). In terms of the kinetics, phosphorylation was rapid with the majority of phosphorylation having occurred by 5min (lanes 2–4 versus lanes 5–16). The RαM control lane at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min was indicative of phosphorylation levels at time 0. Similar results were obtained with anti-GSK-3α/β blotting (Fig. 1, middle panels). Of the two GSK-3 isoforms, GSK-3α was preferentially phosphorylated relative to the GSK-3β isoform in T-cells. As with PKB phosphorylation, anti-CD3 increased GSK-3α phosphorylation relative to the RαM control (middle panel, lane 2 versus lane 1). This phosphorylation was increased with anti-CD28 co-ligation (lane 4 versus lane 2). Anti-CD28 also induced GSK-3α phosphorylation (lane 3). Blotting using an antibody against non-phosphorylated GSK-3α/β showed the level of protein expression (lanes 1–16). The observations confirm that anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-CD3/CD28 induce rapid phosphorylation of PKB and GSK-3α in T-cells. To assess whether Vav-1 expression was required for PKB and GSK-3α phosphorylation, blotting was conducted in the Vav-1-deficient Jurkat cell line J.Vav.1 (Fig. 1) (44Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Anti-CD3, -CD28, and -CD3/CD28 induced levels of PKB or GSK-3α phosphorylation in Vav-1–/– cells that were comparable with that observed in WT cells (upper and middle panels, lanes 17–32 versus lanes 1–16). Densitometric readings of the phosphorylated bands documented similar levels of increased phosphorylation (histograms in the lower panels). The absence of Vav-1 was confirmed by anti-Vav-1 blotting (lowest panel, lanes 17–32 versus 1–16). These data show that anti-CD3 and anti-CD3/CD28 induction of PKB and GSK-3α phosphorylation in T-cells can occur independently of Vav-1 expression. The independence of PKB/GSK-3 phosphorylation on Vav-1 expression contrasts with the previously reported defects in Ca2+ and JNK signaling in the same cells (44Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To assess whether this pathway was intact in freshly isolated primary Vav-1–/– T-cells, we also assessed PKB and GSK-3 phosphorylation in CD4+ T-cells purified from spleens of WT or Vav-1–/– BALB/c mice. Cells were stimulated for 30 min with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 followed by measurement of PKB (Fig. 2, upper panels, lanes 1–4 versus lanes 5–8) and GSK-3α phosphorylation (middle panels, lanes 1–4 versus lanes 5–8). The absence of Vav-1 was confirmed by blotting (lowest panel, lanes 5–8 versus lanes 1–4). The experiments showed no difference in the levels of phosphorylation. Occasionally, an experiment showed a slight reduction in PKB and GSK-3 phosphorylation in Vav-1–/– T-cells; however, the reduction was never more than 10% less compared with WT cells. By contrast, Vav-1,2,3-deficient T-cells showed a consistent partial loss of GSK-3 phosphorylation (lower panels). A 40–50% reduction in phosphorylation was generally observed. This indicates that GSK-3 phosphorylation is partially dependent on Vav family members and that there is a second pathway that is Vav independent. Interestingly, this partial effect contrasted with the transcription factor FOXO1 where phosphorylation was completely lost (lower panel). These observations indicate that anti-CD3 and anti-CD3-CD28 induction of PKB-GSK-3 phosphorylation can occur normally in the absence of Vav-1 expression and is partially reduced with the loss of Vav-1,2,3. To examine further the relationship between Vav-1 and the PKB-GSK-3α phosphorylation, we next assessed whether Vav-1 lacking a functional DH domain (L213Q) could interfere with PKB and GSK-3α phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Mutation of lysine 213 inactivates the GEF activity of the DH domain. Jurkat cells were transfected with empty vector, wild-type Vav-1 (WT), or the L213Q mutant. Anti-CD3 induced phosphorylation of PKB and GSK-3α in cells transfected with WT or L213Q (Fig. 3A, upper and middle panels, lanes 3, 8, and 12 versus lanes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 11). Anti-CD3/CD28 also induced similar levels of phosphorylation in vector, WT, and L213Q transfected cells (upper and middle panels, lanes 5, 10, and 14). Vav-1 expression was evident with anti-Vav-1 blotting (lowest panel, lanes 6–14 versus lanes 1–5). The expression level of total PKB and GSK-3α/β was confirmed by blotting with the respective antibodies (upper lower panel and middle lower panels, lanes 1–14). GSK-3α and PKB phosphorylation levels were quantified by densitometry (see lower histograms). Despite the absence of an effect on the PKB-GSK-3 pathway, as described by others (31Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 38Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Shall S. Mee P.J. Duddy L.P. Rajewsky K. Tybulewicz V.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), expression of L213Q completely inhibited anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-CD3/anti-CD28-induced IL-2 transcription (Fig. 3B). This confirmed the inhibitory effect of the mutant on T-cell function. These observations indicate that the TcR and TcR-CD28-PKB-GSK-3 pathway is intact in the presence of a Vav-1 DH domain mutant that can potently inhibit IL-2 transcription in T-cells. This indicates that the inhibitory effect of the DH domain mutant on IL-2 transcription occurs independently of the PKB-GSK-3 pathway. Vav-1 has also been shown to interact with the adaptor protein SLP-76 (50Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A.

Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Vav-1 and SLP-76 can cooperate in the induction of IL-2 transcription, an effect that is lost with substitution of the YESP sites (Y113F) (50Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 51Onodera H. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol.

We therefore next assessed whether PKB and GSK-3 phosphorylation could operate independently of the Vav-1 binding to SLP-76. Neither WT SLP-76 nor DN Y113F SLP-76 had an effect on anti-CD3, anti-CD28, or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 induced phosphorylation of PKB and GSKα (Fig. 4A, upper and middle panels, lanes 2–4 versus lanes 6–8 versus lanes 10–12).

https://openalex.org/W1973330845,"Pyrin domain (PYD)-containing proteins are key components of pathways that regulate inflammation, apoptosis, and cytokine processing. Their importance is further evidenced by the consequences of mutations in these proteins that give rise to autoimmune and hyperinflammatory syndromes. PYDs, like other members of the death domain (DD) superfamily, are postulated to mediate homotypic interactions that assemble and regulate the activity of signaling complexes. However, PYDs are presently the least well characterized of all four DD subfamilies. Here we report the three-dimensional structure and dynamic properties of ASC2, a PYD-only protein that functions as a modulator of multidomain PYD-containing proteins involved in NF-kappaB and caspase-1 activation. ASC2 adopts a six-helix bundle structure with a prominent loop, comprising 13 amino acid residues, between helices two and three. This loop represents a divergent feature of PYDs from other domains with the DD fold. Detailed analysis of backbone 15N NMR relaxation data using both the Lipari-Szabo model-free and reduced spectral density function formalisms revealed no evidence of contiguous stretches of polypeptide chain with dramatically increased internal motion, except at the extreme N and C termini. Some mobility in the fast, picosecond to nanosecond timescale, was seen in helix 3 and the preceding alpha2-alpha3 loop, in stark contrast to the complete disorder seen in the corresponding region of the NALP1 PYD. Our results suggest that extensive conformational flexibility in helix 3 and the alpha2-alpha3 loop is not a general feature of pyrin domains. Further, a transition from complete disorder to order of the alpha2-alpha3 loop upon binding, as suggested for NALP1, is unlikely to be a common attribute of pyrin domain interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2070798665,"CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) plays a role in the development of immune and central nervous systems as well as in cancer growth and metastasis. CXCR4-initiated signaling cascades leading to cell proliferation and chemotaxis are critical for these functions. The present study demonstrated that stimulation of CXCR4 by its ligand, CXCL12, induced transient translocation of cortactin from endosomal compartments to the cell periphery where it colocalized with CXCR4 followed by internalization of CXCR4 together with cortactin into endosomes. Cortactin was co-immunoprecipitated with CXCR4 in response to CXCL12 treatment in a time-dependent manner. Ligand stimulation induced phosphorylation of cortactin at tyrosine 421, and the phosphorylation was both c-Src- and dynamin-dependent. Cortactin overexpression promoted CXCR4 internalization and recycling. However, overexpression of a cortactin mutant in which tyrosine 421 was replaced with alanine (cortactin-Y421A) or knockdown of cortactin with RNA interference (RNAi) reduced CXCR4 internalization in response to CXCL12. CXCR4-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 was significantly prolonged by overexpression of wild-type cortactin but not by the cortactin-Y421A mutant and was inhibited by cortactin knockdown with RNAi. Moreover, CXCL12-induced chemotaxis was enhanced by cortactin overexpression, reduced by overexpression of the cortactin-Y421A mutant, and blocked by cortactin knockdown with RNAi. These data provide strong evidence for an important role of cortactin in CXCR4 signaling and trafficking as well in the receptor-mediated cell migration.

The CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) 3The abbreviations used are: CXCR4, CXC chemokine receptor 4; HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; ERK1 and -2, extracellular signalregulated kinases 1 and 2; siRNA, short interference RNA; SH3, Src homolog three; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; HA, hemagglutinin. 3The abbreviations used are: CXCR4, CXC chemokine receptor 4; HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; ERK1 and -2, extracellular signalregulated kinases 1 and 2; siRNA, short interference RNA; SH3, Src homolog three; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; HA, hemagglutinin. is a G proteincoupled seven-transmembrane receptor that plays a role in recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and to secondary lymphoid organs (1Aiuti A.

Its ligand, the stromal cell-derived factor 1, also named CXCL12, is a highly efficient chemotactic factor for T cells, monocytes, pre-B cells, dendritic cells, and hematopoietic progenitor cells (4Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 also plays a part in the development of the central nervous system (5Tran P.B. Miller R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For example, mice that lack either the CXCR4 receptor or CXCL12 show abnormal development of both the internal granule layer of the cerebellum (6Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (7Bagri A. Gurney T. He X. Zou Y.R. Littman D.R. Tessier-Lavigne M.

In addition, CXCR4 is expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines and tissues and is implicated in cancer growth and metastasis (9Burger J.A. Kipps T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In all of these cases CXCL12-induced signaling cascades leading to cell proliferation and chemotaxis play important roles in these functions. Although ligand binding to CXCR4 triggers various signaling cascades including activation of G proteins, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the Rho-p160 ROCK axis, focal adhesion kinase, and the extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (10Vila-Coro A.J.

Increasing lines of evidence support the postulate that CXCR4 internalization, a process that occurs through clathrin-coated pits (14Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), plays a role of receptor internalization in chemotaxis (15Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol.

Studies from our group or others demonstrated that inhibition of chemokine receptor internalization resulted in reduction of chemotaxis (15Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), suggesting that membrane trafficking and chemotaxis are somehow connected. This interpretation is also supported by the recent findings that clathrin-dependent endocytosis is a process linking actin dynamics (20Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and several actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins, such as cortactin, are involved in this process (21Orth J.D. McNiven M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22McNiven M.A. Kim L. Krueger E.W. Orth J.D. Cao H. Wong T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Cortactin, an 80- and 85-kDa protein, is a widely expressed actin-binding protein. Cortactin contains 6.5 37-amino acid repeats, of which the 4th is required for filamentous actin binding activity (23Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cortactin also harbors an N-terminal acidic domain, and it binds through a conserved DDW motif, the Arp2/3 complex, and activates it in conjunction with the filamentous actin binding repeat region (23Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 24Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R.

Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cortactin plays an important role in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. The role of cortactin in linking actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis was first recognized in an experiment showing that cortactin directly associates with dynamin, a large GTPase that is involved in the liberation of clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane via its Src homolog 3 (SH3) domain and proline-rich domain, respectively (22McNiven M.A. Kim L. Krueger E.W. Orth J.D. Cao H. Wong T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy revealed that cortactin associated with endosomes along with the Arp2/3 complex (26Kaksonen M. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4421-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown that cortactin is distributed over the surface or base of clathrin lattices as well as actin filaments associated with the clathrincoated pits (27Cao H. Orth J.D. Chen J. Weller S.G. Heuser J.E. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of microinjection of anticortactin antibody or transfection of a plasmid encoding the cortactin SH3 domain on endocytosis further supports the role of cortactin in receptor-mediated endocytosis (27Cao H. Orth J.D. Chen J. Weller S.G. Heuser J.E. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cortactin, originally identified as a substrate for Src kinase (28Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), is directly phosphorylated by Src on three tyrosine residues, tyrosine 421, tyrosine 466, and tyrosine 482 (29Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of each of these phosphorylations in cortactin functions. In this study we demonstrated that CXCL12 activation of CXCR4 leads to cortactin translocation from endosomes to the cell periphery. Ligand stimulation also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in a Src- and dynamin-dependent manner. Overexpression of wild-type cortactin, but not the phosphorylation-deficient cortactin mutant, resulted in enhanced CXCR4 recycling, prolonged ERK1/2 activation, and enhanced CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. In contrast, RNA interference of cortactin significantly inhibited CXCR4 internalization and reduced CXCR4-mediated ERK1/2 activation and chemotaxis. These data indicate that cortactin plays important roles in CXCR4 signaling and trafficking as well in the receptor-mediated chemotaxis. Plasmids and Short Interference RNAs—The plasmids encoding HA-CXCR4 and Myc-CXCR4 were obtained from Dr. Gang Pei (Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences). The wild-type and dominant negative mutant forms of c-Src and dynamin constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Mark Caron (Duke University). For the construction of cortactin in pcDNA3.1, the full-length cDNAs were amplified by using a reverse transcriptase-PCR. Oligonucleotide primers specific for cortactin were designed according to cortactin cDNA sequence from GenBank™ (accession number AF054619). The PCR fragments were inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis of specific cortactin tyrosine 421 to alanine (Y421A) was conducted by using of the Gene-Editor site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The fulllength cortactin cDNAs in pcDNA3.1 were used as the template for the mutagenesis. The cortactin-specific short interference RNA (siRNA) (sc-35093) that specifically knocks down cortactin gene expression and control siRNA (sc-37007) that consists of a scrambled sequence that will not lead to the specific degradation of any cellular message were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. CXCR2 construct in pRC/CMV vector was constructed as described previously (17Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells or HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were cultured in P-100 dishes or on 22 × 22-mm glass coverslips for transfections and immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells stably expressing CXCR4 or CXCR2 were selected with 560 μg/ml Geneticin and evaluated for receptor expression by radioligand binding assay using 125I-labeled CXCL12 or 125I-labeled CXCL8 (Amersham Biosciences). Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips for 1 or 2 days were prepared as described previously (31Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Sai J. Richmond A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2456-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 were treated with carrier buffer or CXCL12 for various time intervals and fixed with methanol. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with an antibody mixture containing a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a rabbit polyclonal cortactin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. Cells were washed and incubated with a antibody mixture containing a CY3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) and a fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. HeLa cells transfected with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-Rab5 were treated with CXCL12 for 5 or 30 min before being fixed in methanol. Cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal cortactin antibody for 30 min followed by a CY3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed on an LSM-510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion lens using dual excitation (488 nm for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or EGFP, 568 nm for Cy3) and emission (515-540 nm for FITC or EGFP, 590-610 nm for Cy3) filter sets. All digital images were captured at the same settings to allow direct quantitative comparison of staining patterns. Final images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Confocal colocalization between two fluorescent staining was quantified using Optimas 5.2 image analysis software. Briefly, matching green and red images of individual cells were opened sequentially. Fluorescence thresholds were applied to each image to exclude diffuse labeling in the cytoplasm. Punctate sites of positive staining were identified, and each image was converted to binary form. Matching binary images derived from CXCR4, and cortactin images were then subjected to an “and” operation, resulting in the identification of sites containing both CXCR4 and cortactin staining. The following equation was used to determine percentage colocalization per cell: % colocalization = (no. of punctate sites containing both CXCR4 and cortactin) × 100/(no. punctate of sites containing CXCR4). Means ± S.E. were determined and plotted using SigmaPlot software. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—For the co-immunoprecipitation of CXCR4 and cortactin, HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 were treated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for various time intervals, washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0), 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.01% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. After removing the protein A/G-agarose by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 1 min), the cleared supernatant was collected, and 10 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for overnight precipitation at 4 °C. Protein A/G (40 μl) was then added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein A/G-antibody-antigen complex was collected by washing three times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 50 °C for 10 min. Forty microliters of this preparation was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The co-immunoprecipitated cortactin was detected by Western blotting using a rabbit anti-cortactin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cortactin Phosphorylation Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 were grown in 6-well plates. Cells were treated with CXCL12 for different time intervals before being lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated cortactin was detected by Western blot analysis with phosphospecific cortactin antibodies against tyrosine 421, tyrosine 466, and tyrosine 482 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 and transiently transfected with vector or cortactin plasmids were grown in 6-well plates. Agonist-treated cells were lysed by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected by a phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Densitometry Analysis of Western Blots—The relative amount of the Western blot bands was measured by densitometry analysis using NIH Image software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). The relative density of the protein bands was calculated in the area encompassing the immunoreactive protein band and subtracting the background of an adjacent nonreactive area in the same lane of the protein of interest. Chemotaxis Assay—A 96-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD) was used for chemotaxis assays, and the lower compartment of the chamber was loaded with 400-μl aliquots of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin/Dulbecco's modified essential medium (chemotaxis buffer) or CXCL12 diluted in the chemotaxis buffer (0.001-10 nm). Polycarbonate membranes (10-μm pore size) were coated on both sides with 20 μg/μl human collagen type IV, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and then stored at 4 °C overnight. To prepare HEK293 cells for chemotaxis assay, cells were removed from the culture dish by trypsinization, washed with Hanks' solution, and incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified essential medium for 2 h at 37 °C to allow time for restoration of receptors. Cells (5 × 105 in 100 μl) were loaded into the top of each well of a 96-well chemotaxis chamber. The bottom of each well contained 600 μl of prewarmed chemotaxis buffer with different concentrations of ligand. The plate was then incubated for 240 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, and cells migrating to the lower chamber were counted after being stained with a Diff-Quik kit. Cell chemotaxis was quantified by counting the number of migrating cells present in 10 microscope fields (20× objective). Internalization and Recycling Assays—HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-CXCR4 and transiently transfected with vector or cortactin plasmids were grown in 24-well plates that were precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma, Mr 30,000-70,000). For the internalization assay cells were incubated at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 125I-labeled CXCL12 (75 nCi/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h with or without excess unlabeled CXCL12 for the determination of nonspecific binding. After removing unbound ligand, the cells were shifted to 37 °C. At each time point, the medium was removed, and the cell surface 125I-labeled CXCL12 was removed by incubating with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl for 6 min. Internalized CXCL12 (acid-resistant, cell-associated cpm) was determined with a γ-counter. For the recycling assay cells were incubated with unlabeled CXCL12 (10 nm) for 1 h at 4°C. After removing unbound ligand, cells were shifted to 37 °C. At each time point, residual bound CXCL12 was removed by acid wash, and surface receptor levels were assessed by binding of 125I-labeled CXCL12. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 were transfected with vector (control), cortactin plasmids, control siRNA, or cortactin specific siRNA. Cells were incubated with a monoclonal phycoerythrin-conjugated CXCR4 antibody (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) at 4 °C for 60 min. In a parallel experiment, parental HEK293 cells were incubated with the phycoerythrin-conjugated CXCR4 antibody as a control. Cells were washed and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline and analyzed in a FACScan equipped with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Intracellular Calcium Mobilization Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 were transfected with vector (control), cortactin plasmids, control siRNA, or cortactin specific siRNA. Cells were released by shaking, collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, and washed with incubation buffer (Hanks' buffer containing 5 mm HEPES). Cells were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with 2.5 μm Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation the cells were washed once with the incubation buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2. The cells were finally adjusted to 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were stimulated with CXCL12 (10 nm), and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization experiments were performed as described previously (17Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The time taken to recover 80% of the mobilized Ca2+ (t0.80) was used as a measure of Ca2+ removal. Previous studies have shown that cortactin is located in endosomal compartments (26Kaksonen M. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4421-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that it can be translocated from the cytoplasm to the periphery after growth factor signaling, integrin activation, and bacteria entry (32Cantarelli V.V. Takahashi A. Akeda Y. Nagayama K. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Tilghman R.W. Hoover R.L. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1257-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether stimulation of CXCR4 induces cortactin translocation, HeLa cells, which endogenously express CXCR4 (35de Parseval A. Elder J.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4528-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were transfected with EGFP-Rab5, an early endosomal marker (36Fan G.H. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. Blood. 2003; 101: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for different time intervals, and confocal microscopy was performed to visualize the subcellular localization of cortactin and EGFP-Rab5. Before ligand stimulation, cortactin was localized predominantly in cytoplasmic punctate structures and co-localized in part with the EGFP-Rab5, suggesting its early endosomal localization, which also occurs after growth factor signaling (26Kaksonen M. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4421-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells for 5 min with CXCL12, however, induced a quick translocation of cortactin to the cell surface. The plasma membrane translocation of cortactin appeared to be transient, since after 30 min of ligand treatment most cortactin proteins returned to the Rab5-positive endosomes (Fig. 1). Cortactin is known to associate with clathrin-coated pits (27Cao H. Orth J.D. Chen J. Weller S.G. Heuser J.E. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) through which chemokine receptors undergo internalization. The translocation of cortactin to the surface membrane encouraged us to determine whether cortactin colocalizes with CXCR4 in response to CXCL12 treatment. To visualize CXCR4 we used HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4. Cells were treated with CXCL12 for different time intervals, and subcellular localization of cortactin and CXCR4 was observed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, CXCR4 receptors were exclusively localized on the cell surface, whereas cortactin was predominantly in the cytoplasm before CXCL12 stimulation. Ligand stimulation for 5 min, however, resulted in translocation of cortactin to the cell surface, where it appeared to co-localize with CXCR4. After ligand treatment for 30 min, a large proportion of CXCR4 receptors were internalized, and the internalized receptors co-localized with cortactin in the cytoplasm. Because our findings demonstrate that cortactin localizes in Rab5-positive endosomes, as shown previously in studies of growth factor signaling (37Zhang Y. Foudi A. Geay J.F. Berthebaud M. Buet D. Jarrier P. Jalil A. Vainchenker W. Louache F. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the internalized CXCR4 colocalized with cortactin in early endosomes. The ligand-dependent colocalization of CXCR4 with cortactin suggests that these two proteins may interact with each other. To assess this probable interaction, we treated HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR4 with CXCL12 (10 nm) for different time intervals, immunoprecipitated CXCR4 from the cell lysate, and assessed the presence of cortactin by Western blot. We observed a basal association of CXCR4 with cortactin before ligand treatment that increased significantly in a time-dependent fashion, peaking at 5 min and lasting for ∼60 min (Fig. 3). By comparing the density of the immunoblots for cortactin coprecipitated with CXCR4 from 1 ml of cell lysate and the immunoblots of cortactin in 40 μl of cell lysate, we estimated that maximally 10% cortactin proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with CXCR4. Because glutathione S-transferase-CXCR4 did not pull down cortactin in the in vitro binding assay (data not shown), we propose that cortactin may interact with CXCR4 indirectly via association with other proteins in a CXCL12-modulated CXCR4 signaling complex. Based on the previous findings that CXCR4 signaling involves Src (38Cabioglu N. Summy J. Miller C. Parikh N.U. Sahin A.A. Tuzlali S. Pumiglia K. Gallick G.E. Price J.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6493-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which directly phosphorylates cortactin at tyrosine residues (tyrosine 421, tyrosine 466, and tyrosine 482) (29Huang C.

https://openalex.org/W1974094806,"Activation of calpain has been shown to occur in some contexts of cell injury and to be essential for loss of cell viability. Part of this may be mediated at the mitochondrial level. It has been demonstrated that calpain activity is necessary for the complete discharge of apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and can cause the cleavage of full-length Bid to a more potent truncated form (Polster, B. M., Basanez, G., Etxebarria, A., Hardwick, J. M., and Nicholls, D. G. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 6447-6454). In this study, we identify acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) as playing a critical role in the activation of calpain upon exposure of mitochondria to both full-length Bid and truncated Bid (t-Bid). Suppression of ACBP levels by small interfering RNA inhibited the t-Bid-induced activation of mitochondrial μ-calpain and release of apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the cleavage of full-length Bid to t-Bid. Moreover, ACBP required the presence of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (for which ACBP is a ligand) to be retained at the mitochondria, to activate μ-calpain, and to amplify Bid-induced mitochondrial damage.

Mitochondria are central integrators of the cell death process. The Bcl-2 family proteins have emerged as critical components that regulate mitochondrial alterations elicited when cells undergo apoptosis or necrosis (2Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S.

Bid is capable of mobilizing proteins sequestered in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and unleashing them into the cytosol, where they provoke the requisite alterations in cellular activity necessary for the consummation of cell death. In particular, Bid is capable of mediating the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Cytochrome c can trigger the caspase cascade, whereas AIF autonomously possesses proteolytic activity and can cause DNA fragmentation by itself (7Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. Penninger J. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Calpains are calcium-dependent cysteine proteases and have been implicated in performing a role in apoptosis and necrosis (8Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol.

In particular, calpain can cleave Bid, leading to enhancement of its ability to cause mitochondrial outer membrane disruption (6Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30724-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Calpain can also cleave AIF, resulting in its full release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol (1Polster B.M. Basanez G. Etxebarria A. Hardwick J.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6447-6454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The two most plentiful calpains require micromolar or millimolar concentrations of calcium for maximal activity and are known as μ- and m-calpains, respectively (8Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). Calpain activity is regulated by calpastatin, which is an inhibitor of calpain activity. In contrast, acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) has been identified as an activator of μ- and m-calpains, lowering their requirement for calcium by 6- and 50-fold, respectively (12Melloni E. Averna M. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 82-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ACBP is found in the cytosol and nucleus and has also been localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it is released when the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane is compromised (13Van Loo G. Demol H. van Gurp M. Hoorelbeke B. Schotte P. Beyaert R. Zhivotovsky B. Gevaert K. Declercq W. Vandekerckhove J. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify ACBP as capable of augmenting Bid-induced mitochondrial injury by a 2-fold process. First, ACBP is necessary for activation of μ-calpain activity associated with the mitochondrial fraction when mitochondria are treated with truncated Bid (t-Bid) or full-length Bid. In turn, calpain activation by ACBP promotes the release of AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the cleavage of full-length Bid to its truncated and more potent form. The importance of ACBP in activating calpain and augmenting mitochondrial injury is demonstrated by the ability of ACBP suppression to ameliorate the cell killing brought about by t-Bid expression and treatment with Fas ligand. Notably, the ability of ACBP to promote the activation of μ-calpain requires its localization to the mitochondria after its release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space through interaction with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Materials—Recombinant human full-length Bid and t-Bid were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Calpeptin was from Calbiochem. Percoll™ was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Calpain activity in mitochondrial lysates following exposure to various conditions was measured using a calpain activity assay kit from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). The fluorometric assay is based on the detection of cleavage of the calpain substrate Ac-LLY-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. Ac-LLY-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin emits blue light, but upon cleavage of the substrate by calpain, free 7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin emits a yellow-green fluorescence that can be quantified using a fluorescence plate reader. Tissue Culture—HeLa cells (ATCC-CC-1, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in 25-cm2 flasks (Corning Costar Corp., Oneonta, NY) with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, all incubated under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using Trans-IT transfection reagent (PanVera) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies of 50-60% were routinely obtained as assessed by β-galactosidase staining. For experiments, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA-LacZ in combination with pcDNA-t-Bid. In all cases, the plasmid concentrations were kept to a total of 1.5 μg. The cells staining positive for β-galactosidase were assessed for signs of cell death with propidium iodide. Measurements of Viability—HeLa cells were incubated in 500 μl of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 1.88-cm2 wells of a 24-well plate at a final cell density of 1.0 × 105 cells/well. Prior to treatment with 100 ng/ml Fas ligand, HeLa cells were washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, after which 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum was added to the wells. Cell viability was determined by the ability of the cells to exclude trypan blue. 10 μl of a 0.5% solution of trypan blue was added to the wells. Both viable and nonviable cells were counted for each data point in a total of eight microscopic fields. Cell viability was also measured using the plasma membrane-impermeable dimeric cyanine dye YOYO-1. YOYO-1 fluoresces brightly only when bound to nucleic acids. Cells are incubated with YOYO-1 before and after the addition of digitonin. Fluorescence before digitonin addition originates from dying cells that have lost plasma membrane integrity and take up YOYO-1. HeLa cells were exposed to various conditions in 24-well plates. YOYO-1 was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. At various time points, the fluorescence of the wells was measured on a BioTek microplate reader at 485 nm excitation and 538 nm emission. At the end of the experiments, digitonin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, which permeabilizes 100% of the cells as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Viability was calculated as V = 100 - (100 × (Fb - Fo)/(Fa - Fo)), where V is the percentage of viable cells in the well, Fa is the fluorescence after the addition of digitonin, Fb is the fluorescence before digitonin, and Fo is the fluorescence of YOYO-1 in medium alone. The YOYO-1 fluorescence measurement of cell viability gave results similar to those of trypan blue dye exclusion. Please note that both of these assays measure only cell viability and are not intended to differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis. RNA Interference—The Dharmacon SMART selection and SMART pooling technologies were utilized for the RNA interference studies. SMART selection uses an algorithm composed of 33 criteria and parameters that attempt to limit nonfunctional small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). SMART pooling combines four SMART-selected siRNA duplexes in a single pool to increase the probability of reducing mRNA levels by at least 75%. In addition, the siRNA duplexes composing the pool were tested individually for their effect on ACBP expression and phenotype of the cells. siRNA-1, siRNA-2, and siRNA-3 all decreased ACBP expression, with siRNA-3 giving the most consistent results. Therefore, siRNA-3 was used in subsequent experiments to assess the effects of decreasing ACBP levels on the sensitivity of mitochondria to Bid. Similarly, preliminary experiments were carried out on suppression of the PBR by siRNA. The expression of the catalytic 80-kDa subunits of μ- and m-calpains was targeted by specific siRNAs, and suppression of the 28-kDa regulatory subunit, which is common to both isoforms, was also suppressed by a specific siRNA against it. A non-targeting siRNA with no known homology to any gene was utilized as a control. The siRNAs were delivered by a lipid-based method (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.) at a final siRNA concentration of 100 nm. After formation of the siRNA-liposome complexes, the mixture was added to the HeLa cells in serum-free medium for 4 h. Afterward, the medium was aspirated, and complete medium was added back. Transfection of the HeLa cells with Cy3-labeled siRNA verified that transfection efficiencies of 90-95% were routinely obtained. This high efficiency of transfection was due to the small size of the siRNA oligonucleotides (21-mers). Isolation of the Cytosol and Mitochondrially Enriched Fractions—HeLa cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks and used at a final density of 1.35 × 106 cells/flask. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 3 volumes of isolation buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm aprotinin) in 250 mm sucrose. After chilling on ice for 3 min, the cells were disrupted by 40 strokes of a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 1500 × g at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The mitochondrially enriched fraction (heavy membrane fraction) was then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The endoplasmic reticulum contained in the top fluffy layer was removed from the high speed pellet. Mitochondrial integrity was determined by the respiratory control ratio as oxygen consumption in states 3 and 4 of respiration using a Clark-type oxygen electrode with glutamate and malate (Sigma) as respiratory substrates. Treatment of the Mitochondrially Enriched Fraction—The mitochondrially enriched fraction (at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in a volume of 250 μl) was incubated in a KCl-based respiratory buffer (150 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 3mm KH2PO4, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). Notably, the incubation buffer was treated with Chelex to remove any endogenous calcium. Following this, calcium was added back to give a final free calcium concentration of 250 nm as measured by Fura2. Glutamate and malate (1 mm) were added as respiratory substrates. Following a 15-min preincubation, the mitochondrially enriched fraction was either left untreated or treated with full-length Bid or t-Bid at a final concentration of 100 or 10 nm, respectively. For the determination of cytochrome c and AIF release, the mitochondrially enriched fraction was first pelleted at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and filtered through a 0.2-μm and then a 0.1-μm Ultrafree-MC filter (Millipore Corp.). HeLa cells or mitochondria were pretreated for 30 min with the membrane-permeable calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) at a concentration of 50 μm. After the 30-min preincubation, the remaining BAPTA-AM was removed by washing the cells or mitochondria and adding fresh medium. Western Blot Analysis—Mitochondrial pellets or supernatants were normalized for protein content (25 μg/lane). Samples were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Mouse anti-cytochrome c primary monoclonal antibody (clone 7H8.2C12) was from Pharmingen and was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Rabbit anti-AIF primary polyclonal antibody (catalog no. AB16501) was from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Full-length Bid and t-Bid were detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE) that recognizes both at a dilution of 1:1000. ACBP was detected with a monoclonal antibody (Abcam) at a dilution of 1:2000. A polyclonal antibody to the PBR (Trevigen, Inc.) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. The 80-kDa subunits of μ- and m-calpains were detected with antibodies (ABR-Affinity BioReagents) at a dilution of 1:1000. In each case, the relevant protein was visualized by staining with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:10,000) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Preparation of Recombinant ACBP—The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 with cDNA encoding ACBP was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. After 48 h, the cells were harvested. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with a nickel-chelating resin. The bound ACBP was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. The released ACBP was further purified on a Mono Q column, and detergent was removed using Extracti-Gel D detergent-removing gel (Pierce). The resulting eluate was concentrated in a Microcon concentrator with a molecular mass cutoff of 30 kDa. Bid Induces Calpain-dependent Release of AIF from the Mitochondrial Intermembrane Space—Mitochondria were isolated from HeLa cells and incubated with 10 nm t-Bid in respiratory buffer. As shown in Fig. 1A (upper panel), t-Bid induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria over a 20-min time course with a resultant accumulation in the supernatant. Incubation with t-Bid also induced the release of AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Fig. 1A, lower panel). As has been reported (1Polster B.M. Basanez G. Etxebarria A. Hardwick J.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6447-6454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the ability of t-Bid to liberate AIF from the mitochondria was dependent on calpain activity. The addition of the calpain inhibitor calpeptin at 25 μm prevented the release of AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space brought about by t-Bid, but had no effect on the release of cytochrome c (Fig. 1A, upper and lower panels, fifth lanes). Bad, a pro-apoptotic protein that binds to Bcl-xL and inhibits its anti-apoptotic activity but does not directly permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane, did not bring about the release of either AIF or cytochrome c when incubated with mitochondria. The calpain activity necessary for the release of AIF was triggered in the mitochondrial fraction when it was exposed to t-Bid. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of mitochondria with t-Bid led to a progressive increase in calpain activity over a 20-min time course. ACBP Is Necessary for the t-Bid-induced Activation of Calpain and Release of AIF from the Mitochondrial Intermembrane Space—HeLa cells were transfected with 100 nm non-targeting siRNA with no homology to any known gene or 100 nm siRNA targeting ACBP. As shown in Fig. 2A, suppression of ACBP levels precluded the t-Bid-induced release of AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space without affecting the release of cytochrome c. Notably, transfection with a non-targeting control siRNA did not prevent the t-Bid-induced release of AIF. The inability of t-Bid to release AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space when ACBP levels were suppressed was accompanied by inhibition of the activation of calpain induced by t-Bid. As shown in Fig. 2B, t-Bid treatment of mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells transfected with the non-targeting siRNA brought about calpain activation, with the activity reaching a maximum of 2.5-fold above basal levels at 20 min. In contrast, the t-Bid-induced activation of calpain was severely inhibited in mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells transfected with the siRNA targeting ACBP, with little increase in activity at 20 min post-treatment (Fig. 2B). ACBP is found in the cytosol, but has also been localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, from where it is released when the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane is compromised (13Van Loo G. Demol H. van Gurp M. Hoorelbeke B. Schotte P. Beyaert R. Zhivotovsky B. Gevaert K. Declercq W. Vandekerckhove J. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C (upper panel), exposure of mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells transfected with the non-targeting siRNA to t-Bid resulted in the release of ACBP from the mitochondrial fraction to the supernatant, which occurred over a time course identical to that of cytochrome c and AIF release. In contrast, mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells transfected with the siRNA targeting ACBP possessed very low levels of ACBP, with the result that little was released into the supernatant upon treatment with t-Bid (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Notably, as shown in Fig. 2D, the non-targeting control siRNA did not affect the expression of ACBP, AIF, or μ-calpain. In contrast, the siRNA targeting ACBP effectively suppressed ACBP expression, with little to no effect on AIF or μ-calpain expression. If the release of ACBP sequestered in the mitochondrial intermembrane space is responsible for activating calpain, then the addition of exogenous ACBP to the mitochondrial fraction isolated from cells in which ACBP expression is suppressed should restore the ability of t-Bid to release AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and to activate calpain. Therefore, mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells in which ACBP levels were suppressed were incubated with t-Bid in the presence of increasing concentrations of exogenously added recombinant ACBP. As shown in Fig. 3A (first lane), incubation of mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells transfected with the siRNA targeting ACBP was refractory to a t-Bid (10 nm)-induced release of AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space even after 20 min of exposure. Recombinant ACBP at increasing concentrations was then added in combination with t-Bid. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A (second through fifth lanes), the addition of recombinant ACBP restored the ability of t-Bid to release AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space in a concentration-dependent manner, with 100 nm ACBP in combination with 10 nm t-Bid causing the release of most of the AIF from the mitochondria. The restoration of AIF release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space by the addition of exogenous ACBP was accompanied by the re-establishment of calpain activation by t-Bid. As demonstrated in Fig. 3B, 100 nm ACBP fully restored the ability of t-Bid to activate calpain in mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells when ACBP levels were suppressed. As shown in Fig. 1, mitochondria in which ACBP levels were suppressed were resistant to the t-Bid-induced activation of calpain. However, when the mitochondria were exposed to t-Bid in the presence of exogenous ACBP, the calpain activity reached 2.4-fold above the basal level during a 20-min time course, an increase comparable with that induced by t-Bid in control mitochondria. Full-length Bid is capable of provoking mitochondrial damage, albeit not as potently as t-Bid (27Tafani M. Karpinich N.O. Hurster K.A. Pastorino J.G. Schneider T. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10073-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Like caspase-8, calpain is able to cleave Bid to a more active form. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether ACBP and the resultant activation of calpain could cause Bid to be cleaved to the more potent truncated form. As shown in Fig. 3C (first lane), incubation of full-length Bid (100 nm) with mitochondria isolated from non-targeting siRNA-transfected cells resulted in the appearance of t-Bid after 20 min. In contrast, there was no t-Bid formed when full-length Bid was incubated with mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells in which ACBP levels were suppressed (Fig. 3C, second lane). However, as with AIF release and calpain activation, the addition of exogenous ACBP (100 nm) in combination with full-length Bid restored the appearance of t-Bid upon incubation with mitochondria in which ACBP levels were suppressed (Fig. 3C, third lane). Notably, the formation of t-Bid in the presence of ACBP was prevented by the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (Fig. 3C, fourth lane). The PBR Is Required for the t-Bid-induced Activation of Calpain in the Presence of ACBP—ACBP is a ligand of the PBR, which is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane (14Papadopoulos V. Amri H. Boujrad N. Cascio C. Culty M. Garnier M. Hardwick M. Li H. Vidic B. Brown A.S. Reversa J.L. Bernassau J.M. Drieu K. Steroids. 1997; 62: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection of HeLa cells with the siRNA targeting the PBR resulted in suppression of PBR levels in isolated mitochondria without a concomitant reduction of ACBP expression. Notably, the siRNA targeting ACBP had no effect on the expression of the PBR. Similarly, the siRNAs against ACBP and the PBR had no influence on the expression of μ-calpain or AIF; and conversely, the siRNA targeting the 80-kDa subunit of μ-calpain did not affect the expression of the PBR, ACBP, or AIF. As shown in Fig. 4B (upper panel, first lane), suppression of the PBR resulted in inhibition of the ability of t-Bid to induce the release of AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, a result identical to that seen in mitochondria in which ACBP levels were suppressed (Fig. 4B, lower panel, first lane). However, unlike the case with ACBP, mitochondria in which PBR levels were suppressed remained refractory to the t-Bid-induced release of AIF, even in the presence of exogenous ACBP (Fig. 4B, compare upper and lower panels, third lanes). Moreover, the inability of t-Bid to release AIF from mitochondria not expressing the PBR was accompanied by inhibition of the t-Bid activation of calpain. As shown in Fig. 4C, unlike the case when ACBP levels were suppressed (Fig. 3B), the addition of exogenous ACBP did not restore the ability of t-Bid to activate calpain in mitochondria in which PBR expression was prevented. The inability of exogenous ACBP to restore the sensitivity of mitochondria not expressing the PBR to the t-Bid-induced release of AIF and activation of calpain implies that the PBR may be necessary to localize ACBP released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the mitochondrial outer membrane. In Fig. 5A (first and second panels), mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells transfected with the non-targeting siRNA were treated with t-Bid and again displayed a release of ACBP into the supernatant over a 20-min time course. Notably, despite the accumulation of ACBP in the supernatant, the mitochondrial fraction was found to retain a significant proportion of ACBP (Fig. 5A, first panel). However, as shown in Fig. 5A (third and fourth panels), in mitochondria in which PBR expression was inhibited, there was a greater accumulation of ACBP in the supernatant, and no ACBP remained associated with the mitochondria following treatment with t-Bid. Such results imply that ACBP released from the intermembrane space by t-Bid requires the PBR, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, to remain associated with the mitochondria and causes the activation of calpain and the release of AIF. μ-Calpain Activity Associated with the Mitochondria Is Required for Release of AIF Induced by t-Bid and Promotes Cell Death—As shown in Fig. 5B (upper and lower panels, first lanes), suppressing the levels of the 80-kDa catalytic subunit of μ-calpain by siRNA inhibited the t-Bid-induced release of AIF from the mitochondria, but did not prevent cytochrome c release. In contrast, suppression of the 80-kDa catalytic subunit of m-calpain did not prevent induction of AIF release triggered by t-Bid (Fig. 5B, upper panel, fourth lane). Calpains require calcium for activity. To test the calcium dependence of μ-calpain associated with the mitochondria, BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable calcium chelator, was incubated with the mitochondria prior to t-Bid addition. As shown in Fig. 5B (upper and lower panels, second lanes), preincubation of the mitochondria for 30 min with BAPTA-AM prevented the t-Bid-induced release of AIF from the mitochondria, yet exerted no influence on cytochrome c release. Fig. 5C (second and fourth panels, second lanes) demonstrates that the siRNA targeting the 80-kDa catalytic subunit of μ-calpain suppressed the expression of μ-calpain in whole cell lysates and isolated mitochondria. In contrast, the siRNA targeting the 80-kDa catalytic subunit of m-calpain caused a decrease in the expression of m-calpain associated with the whole cell lysate, but did not affect the expression of μ-calpain in whole cell lysates and mitochondria (Fig. 5C, first, second, and fourth panels, first lanes). In contrast, the siRNA targeting the 28-kDa regulatory subunit common to both μ- and m-calpains caused a decrease in the levels of the 80-kDa catalytic subunits of μ- and m-calpains. Such an observation is consistent with the common 28-kDa regulatory subunit being required for stabilization and inhibiting the degradation of the 80-kDa catalytic subunits (15Tan Y. Dourdin N. Wu C.

Second, the Golgi export of several marker proteins including VSV envelope G glycoprotein is greatly reduced but not the retrograde protein import into the Golgi complex. We further establish that Crn7 co-precipitates with clathrin adaptor AP-1 but is not required for AP-1 targeting to Golgi membranes. We identify tyrosine 288-based motif as part of a canonical YXXΦ sorting signal and a major μ1-adaptin binding site in vitro.

This study provides the first insight into the function of mammalian Crn7 protein in the Golgi complex. The Golgi complex is a stack of flattened membrane cisternae acting as a central sorting organelle that functionally connects the endoplasmic reticulum with other membrane compartments and the plasma membrane. The total protein output from the ER reaches the Golgi complex at its cis-pole. Protein sorting in the Golgi requires constant cargo progression across the ribbon from its cis- to trans-pole and is accompanied by sequential modification of the cargo. Export from the Golgi complex is based on the interaction of the cytosolic tails of cargo molecules (or cargo receptors for luminal cargo) with elements of the cytosolic sorting machinery such as μ-subunits of adaptor protein complexes. Golgi export in the direction of endosomes and lysosomes requires the binding of cargo to adaptor molecules and adaptor interaction with clathrin (1Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In the case of plasma membrane-directed transport, no adaptors have yet been characterized, and the mechanism of cargo selection remains largely unknown. The coronin family comprises two groups of evolutionary conserved WD-repeat proteins (2de Hostos E.L.

BioEssays. 2005; 27: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Short coronins are actin-binding proteins playing accessory roles in the regulation of the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Several of these protein have been shown to interact with Arp2/3 complex and help regulate the nucleation dynamics of actin filaments (reviewed in Ref. 3Rybakin V. Clemen C.S. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

Two of the known long coronin proteins, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila POD-1s, bind to actin as well (10Rappleye C.A. Paredez A.R. Smith C.W. McDonald K.L. Aroian R.V.

Absence of the worm POD-1 protein leads to accumulation of large cytoplasmic membrane structures along with defects in eggshell formation indirectly suggesting an exocytosis-related function. In Drosophila dpod-1-mutant flies axonal pathfinding is severely impaired (11Rothenberg M.E. Rogers S.L. Vale R.D. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 2003; 39: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have previously identified mammalian Crn7 as a novel coronin family member and POD-1 homologue and demonstrated that it is abundantly expressed in most mouse tissues, is developmentally regulated and distributed between the cytosol and the Golgi (see also Fig. 1A), but is not associated with actin filaments (12Rybakin V. Stumpf M. Schulze A. Majoul I.V. Noegel A.A. Hasse A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Crn7 sequence analysis revealed two WD-repeat blocks characteristic for longer coronins, two copies of the coronin signature motif and the lack of coiled coil regions. The protein lacks predicted signal sequence or a signal sequence cleavage site, as well as transmembrane domains (12Rybakin V. Stumpf M. Schulze A. Majoul I.V. Noegel A.A. Hasse A.

Lower indices indicate the starting positions of corresponding sequences in the Crn7 mRNA; oligonucleotides 2 and 7 targeted fragments of the 3′-region of Crn7 mRNA starting 520 and 60 bases after the last coding base, respectively. COG3 siRNA was from Dr. Anna Shestakova. “Fast forward” transfection of HeLa using HiPerFect reagent (Qiagen) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. For plasmid transfections, we used the Lipofectamin Plus system (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturers' guidelines. The following synthetic peptides, high performance liquid chromatography-purified, were used: CON (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) was from Jena Biosciences, Jena, Germany and YEVV (GKGERQLYCYEVVPQ), AEVA (GKGERQLYCAEVAPQ), YELL (GKGDTRVFLYELLPE), and AELA (GKGDTRVFLAELAPE) were all from JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH, Berlin, Germany. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—HeLa and Vero cells were from ATCC. Cells were grown according to standard procedures (12Rybakin V. Stumpf M. Schulze A. Majoul I.V. Noegel A.A. Hasse A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips to approximately 50% confluence, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, rinsed twice with 20 mm glycine, blocked with 0.045% fish gelatin in the presence of 0.2% saponin, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. 0.02% saponin was present at all washing steps. Primary antibodies were detected using Cy3-, Alexa-568-, or Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma and Molecular Probes). For immunofluorescence, siRNA was used to transfect 50% confluent cells on 12-mm (5 nm RNA) or 25-mm (30 nm RNA) coverslips in all experiments. For electron microscopy, 3 nm siRNAs were used to transfect 90% confluent HeLa cells on 12-mm coverslips. For Western blotting, fresh cells were plated onto 6-well plates at 50% confluence and analyzed 48 and 72 h after transfection with siRNA. As controls, mock-transfected and scrambled RNA-transfected cells were used. Electron Microscopy—Mock- and siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 100 mm phosphate buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4 °C in phosphate buffer containing 1% paraformaldehyde until further use. Cells were osmicated, dehydrated, and embedded as described above. Ultrathin sections were cut and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures. Anti-Crn7 antibody (hybridoma supernatant) was used at 1:5 and mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma) at 1:20,000. Immunoprecipitation using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was performed essentially as described (15Neubrand V.E. Will R.D. Mobius W. Poustka A. Wiemann S. Schu P. Dotti C.G. Pepperkok R. Simpson J.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1122-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were incubated with protein cross-linker DSS (2 mm, Pierce) for 30 min at 20 °C prior to lysis. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of AP μ-Chains—The coding sequences of truncated versions of μ1 (residues 158-423), μ2 (residues 158-435), and μ3 (residues 166-418) containing 5′ NdeI and 3′ EcoRI restriction sites were generated by PCR and cloned in frame into the vector pET28b to create a C-terminal fusion with a hexahistidine (His6) tag. The recombinant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21, and protein production was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The purification of μ-chain proteins was performed according to a standard protocol (Qiagen) using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as an affinity matrix. The purity of the μ-chain proteins, which were stored in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was controlled by SDS-PAGE, analytical gel filtration chromatography, and CD spectroscopy. Before any BIAcore experiment, the proteins were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to ensure the removal of any possible protein aggregates. Surface Plasmon Resonance-based in Vitro Binding Assays—The binding of recombinant His-tagged AP complex medium chains (μ1, μ2, μ3) to the putative Crn7 sorting signal-containing peptides and mutants thereof (see above) was measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor. All peptides were synthesized as 15-mers harboring a typical YXXΦ motif close to their carboxyl terminus. In the mutant peptides, the critical tyrosine residue and the hydrophobic residue in the +3 position were substituted for alanine (for sequences see “Reagents”). Throughout the manuscript the peptides are named by their original or mutated tyrosine sorting motif. The peptides were immobilized via amino coupling onto carboxymethylated dextran (CM5) sensor surfaces according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize mass transfer effects, the amount of immobilized peptide was kept low (∼200 resonance unit). After the peptide immobilization, the surface was regenerated with a pulse injection of 50 mm NaOH to remove non-covalently bound peptide. The AP complex μ-chains were injected in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Polysorbate 20; from BIAcore) followed by regeneration. The obtained sensorgrams were used to calculate the kinetic rate constants for association (Ka), dissociation (Kd), and the equilibrium rate constants (KD). μ-Chain binding to Crn7 peptides could be best modeled assuming a 1:1 interaction which is consistant with the structural information on peptide binding to AP μ-chains (16Heldwein E.E.

VSV Envelope G Glycoprotein (VSVG) and CTxB Trafficking Assays—Trafficking assays were performed essentially as described (20Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E.D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1485-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 21Majoul I.V. Bastiaens P.I. Soling H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In brief, for the VSVG trafficking assay, HeLa or Vero cells were co-transfected with GFP-VSVG-tsO45 and CFP-GalT plasmids, kept at 37 °C for 2 h, and at 40 °C for 16 h. Cells were then shifted to 32 °C in the presence of 150 μg ml-1 cycloheximide in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose medium supplemented with 10% serum and 20 mm HEPES to allow the synchronous export of VSVG from the ER. Where indicated, cells were transfected with siRNA 16 h prior to transfection with VSVG. For the CTxB trafficking assay, Alexa-633-labeled CTxB (500 ng ml-1) was added to the cell culture medium for 3 min at room temperature, followed by washing, internalization at 37 °C, fixation, and immunolabeling. Crn7 RNAi Affects the Golgi Architecture—In mammalian cells, Crn7 is present on Golgi membranes and in the cytosol (Ref. 12Rybakin V. Stumpf M. Schulze A. Majoul I.V. Noegel A.A. Hasse A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 1A). To reveal the in vivo function of Crn7 in the Golgi, we used the siRNA methodology using eight different siRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B, see “Materials and Methods”). 48 and 72 h after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. Although all tested siRNA constructs were capable of down-regulating Crn7 protein (Fig. 1B), the construct siRNA(8)2454 consistently showed the highest degree of down-regulation and was used in further experiments. None of the tested siRNAs affected the level of coronin 3 protein (Fig. 1B), which is an important proof of the specificity of siRNA as Crn7 and Crn3 have several highly similar sequence features (see Ref. 3Rybakin V. Clemen C.S. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Western blot with actin antibody was used as loading control. The effect of Crn7 knockdown on the architecture of the Golgi complex was evaluated using electron microscopy studies on Crn7 knockdown (KD) cells. Mock-transfected cells displayed a characteristic Golgi morphology with several flat cisternae surrounded by transport intermediates (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Crn7 siRNA HeLa cells were characterized by the loss of Golgi integrity and exhibited significant scattering of Golgi membranes. In most cells, the Golgi was present as a dense accumulation of vesicles still containing one or several cisternae-like structures. In the most extreme cases, no cisternae were observed, and the density of Golgi remnant compartments decreased (Fig. 1C). To better understand the effect of Crn7 knockdown on Golgi architecture, we studied the distribution of cis- and trans-Golgi markers in fixed mock- and Crn7 siRNA-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1D). In Crn7 KD cells, the Golgi ribbon disappeared, and smaller Golgi fragments were scattered in the perinuclear area. The trans-Golgi protein TGN38 and the cis-Golgi marker GM130 were both still detectable in predominantly non-overlapping domains localized close to each other, some of them being organized in ministacks (Fig. 1D). Defects in Anterograde Transport in Crn7 KD Cells—The dramatic defects we observed in Crn7 knockdown cells prompted us to address the question whether these defects correlate with impairment of Golgi transport. We monitored the Golgi export of the VSVG, known to hijack the anterograde transport system to reach the cell surface after proceeding through the ER and the Golgi. The experiments were performed with a mutant VSVG (VSVG-tsO45) carrying a single point mutation F204S (22Gallione C.J. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 374-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which renders it temperature-sensitive with regard to its intracellular trafficking. The mutant protein accumulates in the ER at 39.5 °C and is released to the Golgi complex upon a temperature switch to 32 °C (see “Materials and Methods”). This mutant is widely used to study the dynamics of protein trafficking along the biosynthetic pathway (20Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E.D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1485-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 23Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In mock-transfected HeLa cells, VSVG-tsO45-GFP gradually accumulated in the Golgi complex upon shifting the temperature to 32 °C (data not shown). Starting at 10 min after the shift, formation of characteristic tubular compartments originating from the Golgi was observed. These intermediates, morphologically similar to Golgi-to-plasma (GPC) membrane carrier precursors described previously (24Polishchuk E.V. Di Pentima A. Luini A. Polishchuk R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4470-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), released vesicles targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). Apart from vesicles derived from GPC precursor-like tubules, we observed direct formation of vesicular transport intermediates leaving the Golgi in the direction toward the plasma membrane. Cells treated with Crn7 RNAi and recognized as Crn7 knock-down by their scattered CFP-GalT (Golgi galactosyltransferase) pattern were imaged under the same conditions and demon-strated a similar rate of accumulation of VSVG in the Golgi apparatus (data not shown). However, we did not observe any release of VSVG in GPC precursor-like tubules or vesicles from the Golgi even 120 min after the temperature shift. At all times, the VSVG GFP signal was present in the scattered Golgi remnants (Fig. 2B). We further quantified the VSVG GFP signal intensity at the plasma membrane in 100 images spanning 30 min of time in mock-transfected and Crn7 RNAi cells using MetaMorph image analysis software. In control cells, the GFP fluorescence intensity gradually increased to nearly double the initial value, reflecting the delivery of VSVG from the Golgi complex, whereas in RNAi cells, the GFP fluorescence signal at the plasma membrane remains at basic threshold level, which is approximately 50% of that of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2E). To confirm our data on VSVG export defect, we assessed VSVG trafficking in Crn7 KD Vero cells, a primate kidney cell line. We did not observe any GPC-like structures in either control or KD Vero cells (Fig. 2, C and D). However, vesicular transport of VSVG from the Golgi to cell surface was greatly reduced in Crn7 KD cells as compared with the control (Fig. 2D, see also supplemental Movies 1 and 2). Note that in Vero cells, Crn7 knockdown led to the formation of significantly larger, compacted Golgi remnants than in HeLa cells (compare Fig. 2, B and D). Quantification of cell surface VSVG further confirmed the defect in VSVG delivery to cell surface comparable with that in HeLa cells (data not shown). The Golgi does not only export trafficking intermediates but also receives material by retrograde trafficking. To test whether the retrograde transport to the Golgi requires Crn7, we studied the intracellular dynamics of CTxB, the non-toxic B-subunit of the AB5 toxin, cholera toxin (25Lauvrak S.U. Torgersen M.L. Sandvig K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2321-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In control cells, Alexa-633-labeled CTxB (CTxB-633) was internalized by cells and reached the Golgi complex approximately 30 min after its addition to the cells (Fig. 2G), which is in good agreement with data from the literature (13Majoul I. Sohn K. Wieland F.T. Pepperkok R. Pizza M. Hillemann J. Soling H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Majoul I.V. Bastiaens P.I. Soling H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In Crn7 RNAi cells (asterisk in Fig. 2, F and G), CTxB-633 reached the scattered perinuclear Golgi remnants present in these cells with kinetics indistinguishable from those observed for its arrival in the Golgi complex in control cells (Fig. 2G). Thus, the protein import into the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is Crn7-independent. The Golgi export block that we detected in Crn7 siRNA cells can be due to numerous reasons, such as defects in proper cargo protein modification and/or machinery for protein sorting and recruitment. To experimentally assess the possibility of interplay of Crn7 with cargo glycosylation, we used LAMP2, a cargo protein destined to late endosomes and lysosomes, in Crn7 siRNA and control cells. In Crn7 KD cells, the fully glycosylated form of LAMP2 appeared at approximately 110 kDa, and a band of similar size was detected in control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2H). As a positive control, we used siRNA directed against the COG3 protein, a part of the multisubunit Golgi protein complex acting at several stages of glycoprotein and glycolipid metabolism (Ref. 26Shestakova A. Zolov S. Lupashin V.V. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1-14Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar and references therein). COG3 knock-down is correlates with a massive defect in Golgi glycosylation (26Shestakova A. Zolov S. Lupashin V.V. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1-14Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In accordance with literature data, immature LAMP2 migrated as a protein of lower molecular mass at approx. 80 kDa in COG3 RNAi but not Crn7 RNAi cells. Thus, Crn7 knockdown influences the Golgi export of cargoes but not cargo glycosylation. Interaction of Crn7 with the Clathrin Adaptor AP-1—We further wanted to test whether Crn7 knockdown affects cargo selection and export vesicle formation. Adaptor proteins such as monomeric GGAs and heterotetrameric adaptor complexes (AP) are the key factors for the incorporation of cargo membrane proteins into nascent coated vesicles (1Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 27Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). AP complex subunits are called adaptins. Binding of the membrane proteins to adaptor proteins is mediated by small peptide sequences (sorting signals), localized in the cytosolic portions of the proteins, such as tyrosine-based signals of the YXXΦ type (X, any residue; Φ, a bulky hydrophobic residue). The μ-subunits of AP complex tetramers interact with YXXΦ motifs of cargo proteins, while β-subunits interact with clathrin (1Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). There are four AP complexes in mammalian cells (AP-1 to AP-4), all of them functioning in the same way but at distinct cellular sites. While AP-2 is restricted to the plasma membrane and is involved in clathrin-coated vesicle formation during endocytosis, AP-1 has the same function in the TGN and most likely in endosomes. The functions of AP-3 and AP-4 are less well understood (1Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Crn7 harbors two sequences matching a classical YXXΦ motif localized directly downstream of each coronin core domain (Fig. 3A). We tested whether these motifs of Crn7 can bind to purified μ-subunits of the AP-1,-2, and-3 adaptor complexes. 15-mer synthetic peptides harboring each of the YXXΦ motifs close to their carboxyl terminus were used along with mutant peptides where the tyrosines and the hydrophobic (Φ) amino acids in the +3 positions were replaced by alanine residues. The peptides were covalently coupled via their amino terminus to a CM5 surface of a BIAcore 3000 biosensor. Sub-sequently, purified recombinant μ1, μ2, or μ3 subunits were injected at different concentrations. The peptide comprising Tyr288 bound with high affinity to μ1 and μ2 but not to μ3 (Fig. 3B, YEVV). Binding was specific as indicated by the low degree of background binding observed for the mutant peptide. The second more distal Crn7 peptide containing Tyr758 also bound to μ1 and μ2 but only at a very low level (Fig. 3B, YELL). Although the evaluation of the data for the Tyr288 peptide binding to μ1 and μ2 did not perfectly match the expected model for a one-to-one type of interaction, we could estimate the in vitro equilibrium binding rate constant KD at ∼150 nm, which fits well to published data on signal binding to μ-chains (28Grass I. Thiel S. Honing S. Haucke V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54872-54880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Binding of both μ1 and μ2 subunits was concentration-dependent and reversible, with minimal re-binding during the dissociation phase (Fig. 3, C and D). Fig. 3E shows the purity of μ-subunit preparations. To ascertain that the Crn7 binding to AP-1 and AP-2 is significant in vivo, we tested whether Crn7 can be co-immunoprecipitated with AP complexes. As the YEVV motif was shown to interact with μ1 and μ2 in vitro, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies recognizing the complexspecific subunits of AP-1,-2, and-3. Crn7 was detectable in AP-1 pull-down, but not AP-2 or AP-3 pull-downs (Fig. 4A), inferring an in vivo interaction of Crn7 with AP-1 but not with AP-2 or -3. This observation was confirmed by reverse immunoprecipitation of AP-1 together with Crn7 from cell lysate derived from HeLa cells treated with protein cross-linker DSS (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Crn7 co-localizes with AP-1 on the Golgi but not on AP-1-positive endosomes (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the interaction of Crn7 and AP-1 takes place at Golgi membranes. Taken together, our in vitro binding and immunoprecipitation data suggest that Crn7 interacts with AP-1. While the AP-2 interaction appears biochemically possible (see Fig. 3B), the Crn7 and AP-2 proteins are localized in very different cellular compartments and are unlikely to interact in vivo due to spatial restrictions. AP-3 like AP-1 is present at the Golgi but does not interact with any YXXΦ motif of Crn7 as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance experiments, and it does not co-immunoprecipitate with Crn7 (Fig. 4A). This important observation strongly infers that the presence of a putative sorting signal in the protein sequence is not sufficient for the interaction with any given sorting machinery. Specificity of such interaction may be regulated by amino acid composition in the vicinity of the sorting signal or by additional protein factors. Localization of AP-1 and AP-1-dependent Cargo in Crn7 KD Cells—Next, we were interested to know whether Crn7 acts upstream or downstream of AP-1 in the Golgi export pathway and whether Crn7 is required for the targeting of AP-1 to the Golgi. Subcellular distribution of AP-1 in control and Crn7 KD cells was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-body specific to γ-adaptin (Fig. 4C, upper panel). In both control and RNAi cells, AP-1 was detectable on Golgi membranes and endosomes. Crn7 KD cells, however, displayed marked increase of γ-adaptin on the scattered Golgi. Thus, Crn7 knock-down appears not to interfere with the ability of AP-1 to be recruited to the cargo, and Crn7 possibly acts downstream of AP-1 recruitment. VSVG export from the Golgi has never been demonstrated to depend on AP-1. As we have established the interaction of Crn7 with AP-1 in vivo and in vitro, we were interested whether bona fide AP-1 cargoes require Crn7 to be exported from the Golgi complex. To this end, we studied the distribution of 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor MPR46 in HeLa cells treated with Crn7 siRNA. In Crn7 KD cells, MPR46 was retained and markedly accumulated in the scattered Golgi (Fig. 4C, lower panel). A lysosomal marker protein LAMP2 showed similar behavior (data not shown). Coronins constitute a phylogenetically conserved group of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Rybakin V. Clemen C.S. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). According to their structure and function, coronin proteins can be subdivided into two subfamilies. The first group comprises shorter, approximately 45-50-kDa coronins are abundant actin-binding proteins implicated, among other function, in nucleation of actin filaments. The second group consists of just two highly homologous POD-1 proteins from C. elegans and Drosophila, along with their mammalian counterpart coro-nin-7. A fourth subfamily member has been recently discovered in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. 4A. A. Noegel, unpublished data. POD-1 proteins and Crn7 are characterized by a high degree of homology in their core WD-repeat-containing domains and a far lesser similarity in flanking sequences. Crn7 is the first coronin found to be localized to the Golgi and to directly execute a membrane trafficking-related function. Although mutant phenotypes of both worm and fly homologues (see Introduction) may be explained by defects in Golgi function and anterograde trafficking, we do not envision the same function for Crn7 and either of the two POD-1 proteins. We have no data implying any interaction of Crn7 with the cytoskeleton, while there is no indication for the Golgi localization of any of the POD-1 proteins. We anticipate the Golgi localization and Golgi-related function to be unique for vertebrate or mammalian POD-1 homologues. This consideration is in line with the fact that Tyr288 and Tyr758, parts of the two putative tyrosine-based sorting signals in Crn7, are not present in the C. elegans POD-1 protein, while in Drosophila, a tyrosine residue is present in a vicinity of Tyr288 position, but its amino acid environment is very different, and so is the predicted tertiary structure in this area. 5V. Rybakin, unpublished data. We suggest that the specificity of functions of POD-1/Crn7 subfamily of proteins is specified by unique non-core subdomains rather than conserved WD-repeat-containing core regions. Here, we provide detailed characterization of the function of Crn7, a novel mammalian Golgi protein belonging to the coronin family. We establish that Crn7 is a protein indispensable for the maintenance of both Golgi architecture and function. Crn7 knockdown leads to a breakdown of the Golgi structure and to a disruption of anterograde Golgi-to-plasma membrane transport. Crn7 binds to AP-1 in vivo and in vitro via the interaction of its Tyr288-based sorting signal with μ1-adaptin but does not bind to AP-2 or AP-3. The protein is not required for targeting AP-1 to Golgi membranes, as the amount of AP-1 on Golgi in Crn7 KD cells is enriched rather than down-regulated. Most probably, the accumulation of AP-1 on Golgi membranes reflects the fact that the cargo stuck in the compartment is already primed for export, e.g. the complex between cargo and AP-1 has already formed, but the formation of transport intermediates is impaired. The marked accumulation of AP-1 on the Golgi together with accumulated cargo would suggest that the role of Crn7 in the Golgi export may be confined to the events downstream of the cargo-adaptor interaction. Such events include the generation of membrane curvature followed by membrane fission. Another such event may be interaction with (hypothetical) non-clathrin, non-COPI/II coat proteins. Several proteins have been implicated in the membrane fission reaction in the TGN. One of the most intriguing is protein kinase D (PKD), an enzyme localizing to the TGN by means of interaction with diacylglycerol and required for the formation of post-Golgi transport intermediates (29Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V. Cell. 2001; 104: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 30Maeda Y. Beznoussenko G.V. Van Lint J. Mironov A.A.

The role of PKD can be precisely attributed to membrane fission as the overexpression of kinase-inactive PKD leads to the formation of long TGN-derived tubes containing cargo but not resident enzymes or coat proteins (29Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V. Cell. 2001; 104: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 32Yeaman C. Ayala M.I. Wright J.R. Bard F. Bossard C. Ang A. Maeda Y. Seufferlein T. Mellman I. Nelson W.J. Malhotra V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Our data allow us to speculate that Crn7 acts upstream of PKD in the secretory pathway as Crn7 KD does not result in the formation of stabile cargo-containing tubules arrested in fission. It remains to be established how exactly Crn7 is targeted to the Golgi, what other proteins it interacts with, and what the role of the cytosolic pool may be. Another important question arises from our earlier observation that Crn7 is tyrosine-phosphorylated on membranes (12Rybakin V. Stumpf M. Schulze A. Majoul I.V. Noegel A.A. Hasse A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but not in the cytosol. Further studies will be required to find out whether phosphorylation is required for Crn7 targeting to Golgi membranes or for its function and what kinase(s) participate in this event. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2044821615,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced Ca2+ signaling in fibroblasts is constrained by focal adhesions. This process involves the proteintyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which is critical for IL-1-induced phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1, thereby enhancing IL-1-induced Ca2+ release and ERK activation. Currently, the mechanisms by which SHP-2 modulates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum are not defined. We used immunoprecipitation and fluorescence protein-tagged SHP-2 or endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-protein expression vectors, and an ER-specific calcium indicator, to examine the functional relationships between SHP-2, focal adhesions, and IL-1-induced Ca2+ release from the ER. By total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to image subplasma membrane compartments, SHP-2 co-localized with the ER-associated proteins calnexin and calreticulin at sites of focal adhesion formation in fibroblasts. IL-1β promoted time-dependent recruitment of SHP-2 and ER proteins to focal adhesions; this process was blocked in cells treated with small interfering RNA for SHP-2 and in cells expressing a Y542F SHP-2 mutant. IL-1 stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER subjacent to the plasma membrane that was tightly localized around fibronectin-coated beads and was reduced 4-fold in cells expressing Tyr-542 SHP-2 mutant. In subcellular fractions enriched for ER proteins, immunoprecipitation demonstrated that IL-1-enhanced association of SHP-2 with the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor was dependent on Tyr-542 of SHP-2. We conclude that Tyr-542 of SHP-2 modulates IL-1-induced Ca2+ signals and association of the ER with focal adhesions.

IL-1 enhances destruction of extracellular matrices by promoting increased expression of proteases from tissue macrophages and fibroblasts. The expression of matrix-degrading genes in these cells is regulated by the amplitude and duration of IL-1-induced signals (5Boyle D.L. Han Z. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Firestein G.S.

Cell Res. 2000; 258: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Hakkinen L. Holmstrom T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In cultured fibroblasts IL-1-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK is dependent on maturation of focal adhesions (9Lo Y.Y. Luo L. McCulloch C.A. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Conceivably, focal adhesion-associated proteins such as integrins and the focal adhesion kinase (10Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) may modulate the generation of IL-1-induced signals. Although IL-1 type 1 (signaling) receptors are restricted largely to focal adhesions in cultured fibroblasts (10Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Luo L. Cruz T. McCulloch C. Biochem.

Chem. 1988; 263: 8261-8269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus may account for the dependence of IL-1 signaling on these adhesive domains, other proteins associated with focal adhesions that are post-translationally modified may also contribute to this phenomenon. Many signaling systems in cells utilize protein phosphorylation, a post-translational modification that is controlled in turn by the net relative activities of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Although protein-tyrosine phosphatases can terminate various receptor tyrosine kinases-induced signals, they can also activate signaling cascades. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-2 form part of the signaling cascade triggered in various protein kinase-linked receptors that lead to ERK activation. For example, SHP-2 helps to sustain ERK activity in response to platelet-derived growth factor (13Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), possibly by modulating signals arising from integrin-associated proteins (14Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). SHP-2 can also enhance IL-1-induced ERK activation; this process is tightly linked to integrin clustering in focal adhesions (15MacGillivray M. Herrera-Abreu M.T. Chow C.W. Shek C. Wang Q. Vachon E.

Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), or by interaction of SHP-2 with focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin and Gab1 (16Herrera Abreu M.T.

Further, SHP-2 regulates cell spreading on fibronectin, focal adhesion formation (17Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and RhoA activity (18Schoenwaelder S.M. Petch L.A. Williamson D. Shen R. Feng G.S. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1523-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Currently, the mechanisms and the protein-protein interactions that are required for integrins and SHP-2 to mediate IL-1 activation of ERK are not defined. SHP-2 regulates the activity of Src family kinases, and ultimately the activation of ERK, by controlling the recruitment of Csk (14Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The activation of ERK through Src family kinases is thought to involve phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1, a step in the signaling pathway that is required for calcium release from internal stores and the subsequent activation of the Ras-Raf-Mek-ERK cascade (14Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Ras activation may in turn rely on its anchorage to ER membranes (19Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson 2nd, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) as well as recruitment of SHP-2 to plasma and ER membranes (14Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Currently, the mechanisms by which the various participants in this signaling pathway are marshaled to specific sites within the cell are not known. For many complex signaling systems, including IL-1, anchorage of signaling proteins to specific organelles or organellar membranes is required for effective signal transduction (20Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 283-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Because IL-1-induced ERK activation requires the release of Ca2+ from the ER (21Wang Q. Downey G.P. Choi C. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. Faseb J. 2003; 17: 1898-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we considered that focal adhesions and the ER may provide spatially discrete staging sites (22Cohen P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E127-E130Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), enabling SHP-2-dependent activation of ERK by IL-1. Notably, the ER proteins kinectin (23Tran H. Pankov R. Tran S.D. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the IP3 receptor (24Sugiyama T. Matsuda Y. Mikoshiba K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) co-localize with focal adhesions. We have shown earlier that the ER-associated protein calnexin co-localizes with focal adhesions (25Wang Q. Downey G.P. Herrera-Abreu M.T. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8397-8406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that SHP-2 is critical for IL-1-induced focal adhesion maturation (16Herrera Abreu M.T. Wang Q.

Accordingly, we sought to determine what molecular determinants of SHP-2 are responsible for mediating IL-1 promotion of interactions between focal adhesions and the ER.

Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-SHP-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to phospho-SHP-2 (tyrosine 542) was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-calnexin and anti-Bip/GRP78 were obtained from BD Biosciences (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Rabbit anti-calnexin was obtained from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Rabbit polyclonal anti-IP3R-1 was obtained from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Goat antiintegrin α5β1 was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Acidified bovine type I collagen (Invitrogen) was purchased from Cohesion Technologies Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant human IL-1β was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Fluo-4/AM and mag-fluo-4/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 2-APB, xestospongin C, and swinholide A were obtained from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Bead Preparations—Human gingival fibroblasts were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (SHP-2-reconstituted murine embryonic fibroblasts and SHP-2 542 tyrosine-phenylalanine mutant (SHP-2 Y542F) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 μg/ml puromycin). Cells were used between the 5th and 12th passages as previously described (25Wang Q. Downey G.P. Herrera-Abreu M.T. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol.

For collagen coating, 3 mg/ml acidified, pepsin-digested bovine type I collagen (Celltrix, Palo Alto, CA) was used. NaOH was added to the solution to a final concentration of 0.1 m to equilibrate the pH to 7.4 and thereby facilitate collagen fibril assembly on the beads. Bead suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Beads were washed three times, re-suspended in PBS, and sonicated for 10 s (output setting 3 and power 15%, Branson). Isolation of Focal Adhesions—Cells were grown to 80-90% confluence on 60-mm tissue culture dishes and cooled to 4 °C prior to the addition of collagen-, BSA-, or anti-integrin α5β1-coated magnetite beads. Focal adhesion complexes were isolated from cells after specific incubation time periods as described previously (27Plopper G. Ingber D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound beads and scraped into ice-cold cytoskeleton extraction buffer (CKSB, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8). The cell-bead suspension was sonicated for 10 s (output setting 3 and power 15%, Branson), and the beads were isolated from the lysate using a magnetic separation stand. The left lysates were used for non-focal adhesion fraction. The beads were re-suspended in fresh ice-cold CKSB, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), and re-isolated magnetically. The beads were washed in CSKB, sedimented with a microcentrifuge, re-suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min to allow the collagen-associated complexes to dissociate from the beads. The beads were sedimented, and lysates were collected for analysis. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were harvested, resuspended in an isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm CaCl2, 200 mm sucrose), and disrupted by Dounce homogenization followed by 20 strokes. The homogenate was spun at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered and further centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged for 1.5 h at 28,000 × g. The resulting pellet constituted the microsomal ER fraction (28Oakes S.A. Scorrano L. Opferman J.T. Bassik M.C. Nishino M. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The authenticity of the ER fraction was confirmed by immunoblotting for the ER-specific protein calnexin. Immunoblotting—The protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% acrylamide), resolved by electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline solution with 5% milk or 0.2% BSA to block nonspecific binding sites. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. Horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk or 0.2% BSA. Labeled proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cells at 80-90% confluence on 100-mm tissue culture dishes in normal growth medium were treated with IL-1 and washed three times in ice-cold PBS. Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 1 mm Na3VO4) was added to each well. The cell lysates were scraped into a microcentrifuge tube and rotated for 20 min at 4 °C. Pansorbin A was used to block nonspecific binding in the lysates (1 h at 4 °C) and after centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The lysates were incubated with 50 μl agarose-conjugated rabbit polyclonal SHP-2 (5 μl of antibody/50 μl of agarose beads) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The pellet of beads was washed three times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer, re-suspended in 2× SDSPAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Equal amounts of the eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Before immunoprecipitation, ER fractions were solubilized in 1% CHAPS-containing buffer (5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and incubated with anti-SHP-2 antibody bound to protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed for the indicated proteins. Transfection—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105/well 24 h before transfection to yield a 30-40% confluent culture on the day of transfection. Transient transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were incubated with DNA-FuGENE 6 reagent (1:3) complexes for 5-7 h. Within 48 h after transfection, cells were subjected to further experiments. Short Interfering RNA—Specific inhibition of SHP2 was conducted with siRNA (sequence: ag-cccaaaaagaguuacauugcc-dtt (1080-1100 of the SHP-2 sequence). Rat2 cells grown in 6-plate wells were transfected with SHP-2-siRNA or GFP-siRNA (control) using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Measurement of the gene-knockdown was preformed in 24-72 h. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed with SDS-lysis buffer. Lysates were collected for immunoblotting. Fluorescence Microscopy—Chamber slides (2- and 4-well, Lab-Tek) were coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml in PBS) and fibronectin- or BSA-coated latex microbeads. Cells were plated for 3-4 h at 37 °C. Prior to immunostaining, cell were stimulated with IL-1 (20 ng/ml for 20 min), fixed (4.0% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature), blocked, and permeabilized in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Antibodies were diluted in PBS with 1% BSA. Immunofluorescence staining was performed with rabbit anti-SHP-2 antibody (1:100) and mouse anti-calnexin (1:150) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS, incubated with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody or goat anti-mouse Texas Red conjugate antibody for 1 h, washed, and sealed with coverslips. The slides were viewed by total internal reflection microscopy. Total Internal Reflection Microscopy—We examined the spatial relationships between SHP-2, the ER, and focal adhesions following IL-1 treatment using green or yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SHP-2 and ER-protein expression vectors combined with total internal reflection microscopy (also called evanescent wave microscopy). TIRF generates fluorescence excitation within a narrow zone (100-150 nm) from the coverslip, which excites fluorescent proteins only on the ventral cell surface and immediately below the plasma membrane. Light from an argon laser (488/543 nm) was introduced into an inverted microscope through a single mode fiber and two illumination lenses (Nikon). The light was focused at the back focal plane of a high aperture objective lens (×60, numerical aperture 1.65, oil immersion). To observe green fluorescent protein fluorescence, we used a 488 nm laser line for excitation and a 515/15 nm bandpass filter. For fluorescence from orange/yellow fluorescent proteins (YFP), we used 543 nm excitation and a long-pass 590 nm filter. Comparisons of GFP- and YFP-transfected cells showed very low levels of cross-over emission into the yellow and green channels, respectively. To monitor the localization of the single SHP-2 molecular or ER organelle, the GFP-tagged SHP-2 (GFP-SHP-2) or ER-specific protein (YFP-calnexin, GFP-calreticulin, and YFP-KDEL/calreticulin)-transfected cells were cultured in chamber slides previously coated with poly-l-lysine and fibronectin or BSA beads. Cells were incubated for 3-4 h at 37 °C in normal medium and then stimulated with IL-1. Nikon immersion oil (refractive index = 1.515) was used to establish optical contact between the objective lens and the coverslip. Using fluorescence calibration beads, the measured penetration depth of excitation light was ∼150 nm. Electron Microscopy—Rat2 cells plated on poly-l-lysine (200 ng/ml)-coated coverslips for 3-4 h were incubated with fibronectin-coated latex microbeads for 1 h and then treated with IL-1 (20 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were fixed with in 2% glutaraldehyde, 1% tannic acid, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 7.4 for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, and then post-fixed in 1% OsO4 at room temperature in the same buffer. All samples were washed and dehydrated by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of ethanol (25, 50, 75, 95, and 100%, v/v) before embedding in Spurrs resin. Sections (80 nm thick) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E microtome and stained with uranyl acetate and sodium bismuth. The sections were examined with a Hitachi 7000 scanning transmission electron microscope. Electron micrographs are representative of data obtained in two experiments. Imaging of Ca2+ in Sub-membrane Cytosolic and ER Stores—Cells were incubated with 3-4 μm fluo-4/AM and 0.01% pluronic acid for 30-40 min, or 4-5 μm mag-fluo-4/AM, and 0.01% pluronic acid for 30-40 min at 37 °C. The nominally calcium-free buffer consisted of a bicarbonate-free medium containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm d-glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 with an osmolarity of 291 mosm. For experiments requiring external Ca2+, 2 mm CaC12 was added to the buffer; for experiments requiring chelation of external Ca2+, 1 mm EGTA was added. Imaging and fluorescence intensity of sub-membrane cytosolic and ER calcium were obtained with TIRF microscopy using C·IMAGING SYSTEMS-Simple PCI software (Compix, Inc., Cranberry Twp., PA) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission bandpass filter of 515/15 nm. Data Analysis—Means ± S.E. were calculated for calcium measurements, including baseline fluo-4/mag-fluo-4 fluorescence intensity and the net change of fluorescence intensity above baseline. For all continuous variables, means ± S.E. were computed and, when appropriate, comparisons between two groups were made with the unpaired Student's t test or, for multiple samples, with analysis of variance. Post hoc testing was done with Tukey's test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. For all experiments, n ≥ 3 independent cultures were used. For calcium measurements, only a single cell in each culture was measured. Sub-membrane Co-localization of SHP-2 to Focal Adhesions and the ER—To examine the spatial relationships between SHP2, focal adhesions, and the ER, Rat2 fibroblasts were cotransfected with one of either GFP-SHP2, YFP-calnexin, GFP-calreticulin, or YFP-calreticulin fusions. Transfected cells were re-plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips on which either fibronectin or BSA-coated microbeads had been previously attached. Cells were incubated with IL-1 or vehicle. TIRF imaging was used to assess protein recruitment into nascent focal adhesion-like structures that were induced by the matrix ligand-coated beads attached to the coverslip (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, SHP-2, calnexin, and calreticulin co-localized with fibronectin-coated but not with BSA-coated beads. Staining intensity around fibronectin bead-associated focal adhesions for each of these proteins was further enhanced by IL-1 treatment. Fluorescence microscopic studies of transfected proteins were complemented by examination of endogenous focal adhesion and ER proteins that were associated with collagen-coated beads (Fig. 1B). In these experiments collagen magnetite beads were bound to the dorsal surfaces of cells as previously described (29Arora P.D. Fan L. Sodek J. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 286: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and, following IL-1 or vehicle control treatments, the bead-associated proteins were assessed by immunoblot analysis. For the focal adhesion protein vinculin, as well as SHP-2 and the ER-associated proteins calnexin and BiP, IL-1 treatment increased the relative abundance of proteins associated with collagen-coated beads but not with BSA-coated beads. For those proteins that remained in the lysis buffer after preparation of focal adhesions (i.e. the non-focal adhesion fraction), there was no IL-1-induced enhancement of vinculin, SHP-2, calnexin, or BiP. For all experiments, equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane. GAPDH, a control, non-ER and non-focal adhesion cytoplasmic protein did not associate with beads, and its relative abundance in focal adhesion preparations was not enhanced by IL-1 treatment. In cells treated with swinholide, an actin severing toxin that disrupts focal adhesions (30MacGillivray M.K. Cruz T.F. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23509-23515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), there were no significant amounts of ER or focal adhesion proteins detected in the pool of bead-associated proteins. We next sought to determine if beads coated with antibody to the fibronectin receptor could induce focal adhesions and if focal adhesion proteins were recruited by IL-1. Magnetite or latex beads were coated with antibody to α5β1 integrin and then incubated with cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Under these conditions, IL-1 did not induce recruitment of vinculin, SHP-2, calnexin, or BiP to beads indicating that clustering of integrins without concomitant activation was not sufficient to induce mature focal adhesions. As analyses of bead-associated proteins indicated associations between focal adhesions around beads and the endoplasmic reticulum, we incubated fibronectin-coated beads with cells and examined them by electron microscopy (Fig. 1D). This analysis showed that, in beads attached to cells, endoplasmic reticulum cisternae were immediately subjacent to beads while in cells without contacting beads, there was no obvious recruitment of endoplasmic reticulu"

Almost all the K+-independent pyruvate kinases have Lys at position 117, instead of the Glu present in the K+-dependent muscle enzyme. Mutagenesis studies show that the internal positive charge substitutes for the K+ requirement (Laughlin, L. T. & Reed, G. H. (1997) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 348, 262–267). In this work a phylogenetic analysis of pyruvate kinase was performed to ascertain the abundance of K+ -independent activities and to explore whether the K+ activating effect is related to the evolutionary history of the enzyme. Of the 230 studied sequences, 46% have Lys at position 117, and the rest have Glu. Pyruvate kinases with Lys117 and Glu117 are separated in two clusters. All of the enzymes of the Glu117 cluster that have been characterized are K+-dependent, whereas those of the Lys117 cluster are K+-independent. Thus, there is a strict correlation between the dichotomy of the tree and the dependence of activity on K+. 77% of the pyruvate kinases that possess Lys117 have Lys113/Gln114; they also have Ile, Val, or Leu at position 120. These residues are replaced by Glu117 and Thr113/Lys114/Thr120 in 80% of K+-dependent pyruvate kinases. Structural analysis indicates that these residues are in a hinge region involved in the acquisition of the catalytic conformation of the enzyme.

The route of conversion from K+-independent to K+-dependent pyruvate kinases is described. A plausible explanation of how enzymes developed K+ dependence is put forth. The dependence of enzyme activity on monovalent cations is widespread. Indeed more than 100 enzymes exhibit structural and catalytic requirement for either K+ or Na+ (1Suelter C.H.

In some enzymes, the monovalent cations participate in the formation of a ternary complex of enzymes and substrates, whereas in other, cations act allosterically or stabilize the protein structure (3Di Cera E.

Structural information on the molecular origin of these effects has begun to emerge; however, there are still many questions that remain to be solved. Pyruvate kinase, the first enzyme in which an absolute requirement for K+ has been documented (8Kachmar J.F. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 200: 669-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is an excellent model enzyme for studying the effect of monovalent cations particularly because in the rabbit muscle enzyme the activating effect of K+ is about 10,000-fold (9Kayne F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Ramírez-Silva L. Oria J. Gómez-Puyou A. Tuena de Gómez-Puyou M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which, to our knowledge, is the highest reported thus far. In regard to the mechanism of action of K+, it is known that this cation changes the ultraviolet and fluorescence spectra of pyruvate kinase (11Suelter C.H. Melander W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: PC4108-PC4109Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 12Kayne F.J. Suelter C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Suelter C.H. Singleton Jr., R. Kayne F.J. Arrington S. Glass J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as well as its immunoelectrophoretic pattern (14Sorger G.J. Ford R.E. Evans H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). K+ also changes the structure of the active site (15Mildvan A.S. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1178-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kayne F.J. Reuben J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 220-222Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Nowak T. Mildvan A.S.

In this respect, NMR studies of Tl+ bound to pyruvate kinase show that the alkali metal ion binds within 0.8 nm of the Mn2+-binding site (16Kayne F.J. Reuben J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 220-222Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that this distance shifts to 0.49 nm upon binding of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (19Reuben J. Kayne F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6227-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that K+ changes the kinetic mechanism of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and is involved in the acquisition of the active conformation of the enzyme (20Oria-Hernandez J. Cabrera N. Perez-Montfort R. Ramirez-Silva L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37924-37929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The K+-binding site is highly conserved in all crystallographic structures reported to date. K+ is coordinated by O-δ1 of Asn74, O-γ of Ser76, O-δ2 of Asp112, the carbonyl oxygen of Thr113 (21Larsen T.M. Laughlin L.T. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), a water molecule, and a phosphate oxygen of phosphoenolpyruvate analogs (22Larsen T.M. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G.E.

However, as the number of characterized enzymes increased, it became apparent that the activity of several pyruvate kinases was K+-independent, for example those from Escherichia coli (Type II) (39Malcovati M.

To explore the molecular basis of this different behavior, Laughlin and Reed (46Laughlin L.T. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Byophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) compared the amino acid sequence of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase with those of E. coli type II and of C. glutamicum and found that Glu117 of the rabbit enzyme, which is close to the K+-binding site, is a Lys in the bacterial enzymes. The authors constructed the E117K mutant of the rabbit enzyme and found that the mutant is >200-fold more active than the wild type in the absence of K+ and exhibits no stimulation by monovalent cations. They also constructed two other mutants, E117A and E117D; these enzymes were activated by K+. The data clearly indicate that the positive charge of Lys mimics the action of K+ (46Laughlin L.T. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Byophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mimicry of monovalent cation activation by a Lys has also been reported in chaperon HSC70 (47Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B.

Byophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the sequences of five of the characterized K+-independent enzymes also contain Lys in position 117 (39Malcovati M. Valentini G.

These observations thus indicate that the expression of K+-independent activity is not completely explained by the charge of residue 117 and that other residues in the vicinity of the active site may be involved in conversion of the K+-independent to K+-dependent pyruvate kinase. In this work we performed an extensive phylogenetic study of the pyruvate kinase family. The purpose of the study was to ascertain the abundance of K+-independent activities and to explore whether the K+ activating effect is related to the evolutionary history of the enzyme. Phylogenetic analyses of pyruvate kinase family have been reported previously (43Schramm A. Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J.

Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The latter studies were an attempt to correlate the major subfamilies or clusters to the type of allosteric effector of the enzymes. According to Schramm et al. (43Schramm A. Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), cluster I mostly includes enzymes activated by sugar phosphates, whereas cluster II comprises enzymes regulated by nucleotides. Given that some enzymes of cluster I are regulated by effectors of cluster II and vice versa and some even lack heterotropic allosteric regulation, a classification based on allosteric effectors of the enzymes may be more complex. Our phylogenetic data show that there are numerous enzymes that have Lys at position 117 (the numbering used is that of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase). Because pyruvate kinases that contain Lys117 and the E117K mutant of the rabbit enzyme are K+-independent, it may be safely assumed that K+-independent pyruvate kinases are broadly present in nature (106 sequences from 230 have Lys). In accordance with Schramm et al. (43Schramm A. Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we found a dichotomic topology of the pyruvate kinase phylogenetic tree. However, in our case, cluster I groups sequences that include Glu117 correspond to K+-dependent enzymes, whereas cluster II comprise sequences that have Lys117 and are therefore K+-independent enzymes. In addition, we found that changes in the residue at position 117 are consistently accompanied by conservative changes in residues 113, 114, and 120. In all likelihood these residues are mechanistically important, because they localize in a hinge bending region that participates in the acquisition of the active catalytic conformation of the enzyme. The search for pyruvate kinase sequences was performed at the World Wide Web site of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (52Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J.

Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) using maximum parsimony, minimum evolution, and neighbor-joining methods with the aid of the empirical Jones-Taylor-Thornton amino acid substitution model. Differences between amino acid sequences were corrected for multiple substitutions assuming gamma distribution for rate variations among sites. The gamma-shaped parameter (a = 1.0) was estimated with the Whelan-Goldman matrix of substitutions and the eight-category discrete-gamma model using TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 (57Schmidt H.A. Strimmer K. Vingron M. von Haeseler A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar). Confidence limits of branch points were estimated by 500 bootstrap replications. Structural analysis of domain movements and hinge bending regions of pyruvate kinase were performed with DynDom software. DynDom is a program that determines dynamic protein domains, hinge axes, and amino acid residues involved in hinge bending (58Qi G. Lee R. Hayward S.

Position 117 is occupied by Glu in 121 sequences and by Lys, Ser, and Arg in 106, 2, and 1 sequence, respectively.

The activities of eight pyruvate kinases that do not have Glu at that position have been characterized; in all cases the activity is K+-independent. Therefore, there is an excellent correlation between the dependence of activity on K+ and the existence of Glu at position 117. About half of all the sequences analyzed (46%) have Lys117; thus, the K+-independent activity is as frequent as the K+-dependent activity. Our phylogenetic analysis shows a dichotomic tree structure (Fig. 1) that, similar to a previous phylogenetic study (43Schramm A. Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), does not coincide with the universal tree topology (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) (50Doolittle W.F. Brown J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6721-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 51Walsh D.A. Doolittle W.F. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R237-R240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As discussed by Schramm et al. (43Schramm A. Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), this unusual topology may be caused by an early gene duplication event. However, a remarkable feature of our phylogenetic data is the high correlation between the dichotomic nature of the tree and the dependence on K+. As shown in Fig. 2, the red branch corresponds to the enzymes that contain Glu117, which include the 21 experimentally characterized K+-dependent enzymes. The only exception found in this branch is pyruvate kinase from the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens, (GenBank™ accession number Q46289) that has Lys at position 117. To gain insight into the peculiar position of pyruvate kinase of C. perfringens, we examined the sequences that had been deposited (in GenBank™) in the last year. We found four new sequences belonging to the genus Clostridium. One of these sequences corresponds to a pyruvate kinase of C. perfringens that surprisingly has Glu in position 117. We also found that Clostridium acetobutylicum has K117 pyruvate kinase, in addition to the E117 enzyme included in the phylogenetic tree. This property is also shared by Clostridium beijerinckii where both Glu117 and Lys117 pyruvate kinases were found. The data on the Clostridium genus are highly suggestive that the two enzymes resulted from recent gene duplication. In fact, the identity between the Glu and Lys enzymes of C. perfringens is 52.6%, whereas identity between early duplicated pyruvate kinases of E. coli in cluster I and cluster II is 36.5%. The blue branch (Fig. 1) contains enzymes with Lys117 that comprise the eight experimentally studied K+-independent enzymes; it also includes the K+-independent enzymes with Ser and Arg at position 117 (indicated in black) and three archaeal enzymes that contain Glu117. Thus the branching of the phylogenetic tree concurs with the residue at position 117. Accordingly, the existing pyruvate kinases may be divided into two groups: group I is formed by the K+-dependent enzymes and Group II by the K+-independent enzymes. As this classification is based on an all-or-none property, i.e. K+-independent or -dependent activities, it has advantages over classification based on allosteric effectors (43Schramm A. Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 45Johnsen U. Hansen T. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25417-25427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is relevant to acknowledge that K+ dependence has been used as a criterion to explain the dichotomic topology of the phylogenetic tree of the H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase family (48Belogurov G.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49651-49654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However the lack of structural information available on these enzymes does not allow the establishment of structural correlations between amino acid substitutions and the K+-binding site. Co-evolving Amino Acids with Residue 117—The phylogenetic analysis also shows that there is a correlation between the residue that exists at position 117 and some of its neighboring residues (Table 1). When Glu is in position 117, in 99% of the cases the residue in position 113 is Thr. Likewise, when Lys is in position 117, position 113 is occupied by Leu in 98% of the enzymes. A similar, but slightly less strict pattern was observed between residue 117 and those at positions 114 and 120. The data show that: 1) pyruvate kinases that have Glu117 have Lys114 in 94% of the cases; 2) when Lys is in position 117, position 114 is occupied by Gln in 83% of the enzymes; 3) enzymes with Glu in position 117 have Thr in position 120 in 83% of the cases; 4) enzymes with Lys117 have a hydrophobic residue in position 120 (Leu, Val, or Ile) in 93% of the cases.TABLE 1Co-evolving residues of consensus sequences in clusters I and IICluster I K+-dependent enzymesCluster II K+-independent enzymesResidues co-evolving with Glu117%Residues co-evolving with Lys117%Thr11399Leu11398Lys11494Gln11483Thr12083(Val-Ile-Leu)12093Thr113/Lys11490Leu113/Gln11482Thr113/Thr12080Leu113/(Val-Ile-Leu)12093Lys114/Thr12081Gln114/(Val-Ile-Leu)12078Thr113/Lys114/Thr12080Leu113/Gln114/(Val-Ile-Leu)12077 Open table in a new tab The main chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr113 participates in K+ binding. As shown in Table 1, this residue is almost invariably present when Glu is in position 117 (cluster I). It is likely that the conservation of Thr113 is the result of the evolutionary pressure to keep the integrity of the K+-binding site intact. In the K+-independent enzymes (cluster II), Leu113 is practically invariable (98%). This is rather atypical because there is no obvious evolutionary benefit for the conservation of this residue. Leu113 is associated to a positive charged residue in position 117 (Lys, Arg) or to serine. The constancy of Leu113 in the enzymes of cluster II suggests that it is involved in the expression of the K+-independent activity. It is also noteworthy that in the K+-independent activity cluster, aside from the enzymes that contain Ser117, three archa"
https://openalex.org/W1963769216,"Twisted gastrulation (TSG) is an extracellular modulator of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activity and regulates dorsoventral axis formation in early Drosophila and Xenopus development. Studies on tsg-deficient mice also indicated a role of this protein in skeletal growth, but the mechanism of TSG activity in this process has not yet been investigated. Here we show for the first time by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry that TSG is strongly expressed in bovine and mouse growth plate cartilage as well as in fetal ribs, vertebral cartilage, and cartilage anlagen of the skull. Furthermore we provide evidence that TSG is directly involved in BMP-regulated chondrocyte differentiation and maturation. In vitro, TSG impaired the dose-dependent BMP-2 stimulation of collagen II and X expression in cultures of MC615 chondrocytes and primary mouse chondrocytes. In the presence of chordin, a BMP antagonist, the inhibitory effect of TSG was further enhanced. TSG also inhibited BMP-2-stimulated phosphorylation of Smad factors in chondrocytes, confirming the role of TSG as a modulator of BMP signaling. For analysis of TSG functions in cartilage development in vivo, the gene was overexpressed in transgenic mice under the control of the cartilage-specific Col2a1 promoter. As a result, Col10a1 expression was significantly reduced in the growth plates of transgenic embryos and newborns in comparison with wild type littermates as shown by in situ hybridization and by real time PCR analysis. The data suggest that TSG is an important modulator of BMP-regulated cartilage development and chondrocyte differentiation."

The multiorgan involvement and wide spectrum of associated phenotypes highlights the complex pathogenesis underlying Marfan syndrome. To elucidate the genotype to phenotype correlations, we engineered four Marfan syndrome causing mutations into a fibrillin-1 fragment encoded by exons 18-25, a region known to interact with tropoelastin. Biophysical and biochemical approaches, including small angle x-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and circular dichroism, were used to study the impact of these mutations upon the structure and function of the protein. Mutations G880S, C862R, and C908R, situated within the second hybrid domain, disrupted the ratio of alpha-helix to beta-sheet leading to a more compact conformation. These data clearly demonstrate the importance of the previously uncharacterized hybrid domain in fibrillin-1 structure. In contrast, mutation K1023N situated within the linker region between the third eight cysteine motif and cbEGF 11 markedly extended the length of the fragment. However, none of the mutations affected tropoelastin binding. The profound effects of all four mutations on fragment conformation suggest that they contribute to the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome by disrupting protein folding and its assembly into fibrillin-rich microfibrils."

In contrast to murine SOUL, which binds one heme per subunit via coordination of the Fe(III)-heme to a histidine, murine p22HBP binds one heme molecule per subunit with no specific axial ligand coordination of the Fe(III)-heme. Using intrinsic protein fluorescence quenching, the values for the dissociation constants of p22HBP for hemin and protoporphyrin-IX were determined to be in the low nanomolar range. The three-dimensional structure of murine p22HBP, the first for a protein from the SOUL/HBP family, was determined by NMR methods to consist of a 9-stranded distorted β-barrel flanked by two long α-helices. Although homologous domains have been found in three bacterial proteins, two of which are transcription factors, the fold determined for p22HBP corresponds to a novel α plus β fold in a eukaryotic protein. Chemical shift mapping localized the tetrapyrrole binding site to a hydrophobic cleft formed by residues from helix αA and an extended loop. In an attempt to assess the structural basis for tetrapyrrole binding in the SOUL/HBP family, models for the p22HBP-protoporphyrin-IX complex and the SOUL protein were generated by manual docking and automated methods."
https://openalex.org/W2088654699,"In macrophages, Nramp1 (Slc11a1) is expressed in lysosomes and restricts replication of intracellular pathogens by removing divalent metals (Mn2+ and Fe2+) from the phagolysosome. Nramp2 (DMT1, Slc11a2) is expressed both at the duodenal brush border where it mediates uptake of dietary iron and ubiquitously at the plasma membrane/recycling endosomes of many cell types where it transports transferrin-associated iron across the endosomal membrane. In Nramp2, a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic motif ((555)YLLNT(559)) is critical for internalization and recycling of the transporter from the plasma membrane. Here we studied the subcellular trafficking properties of Nramp1 and investigated the cis-acting sequences responsible for targeting to lysosomes. For this, we constructed and studied Nramp1/Nramp2 chimeric proteins where homologous domains of each protein were exchanged. Chimeras exchanging the amino-(upstream TM1) and carboxyl-terminal (downstream TM12) cytoplasmic segments of both transporters were stably expressed in porcine LLC-PK1 kidney cells and were studied with respect to expression, maturation, stability, cell surface targeting, transport activity, and subcellular localization. An Nramp2 isoform II chimera bearing the amino terminus of Nramp1 was not expressed at the cell surface but was targeted to lysosomes. This lysosomal targeting was abolished by single alanine substitutions at Tyr15 and Ile18 of a (15)YGSI(18) motif present in the amino terminus of Nramp1. These results identify YGSI as a tyrosine-based sorting signal responsible for lysosomal targeting of Nramp1."

Recently, several therapeutic strategies have been developed based on this interaction, and some include Fcϵ-containing moieties. Unlike well characterized IgG therapeutics, the stability and folding properties of IgE are not well understood. Here, we present comparative biophysical analyses of the pH stability and thermostability of Fcϵ and IgG1-Fc (Fcγ). Fcϵ was found to be significantly less stable than Fcγ under all pH and NaCl conditions tested. Additionally, the Cϵ3Cϵ4 domains of Fcϵ were shown to become intrinsically unfolded at pH values below 5.0.

Under neutral pH conditions, the apparent affinity of Fcϵ for the dimeric fusion protein was extremely high compared with published values for the monomeric receptor (KD < 10-12 m). Titration to pH 6.0 did not significantly change the binding affinity, and titration to pH 5.5 only modestly attenuated affinity. At pH values below 5.0, the receptor binding domains of Fcϵ unfolded, and interaction of Fcϵ with the Fcγ-FcϵRIα fusion protein was abrogated.

The unusual pH sensitivity of Fcϵ may play a role in antigen-dependent regulation of receptor-bound, non-circulating IgE. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is important for host defense against parasites and for protective inflammation. Yet, IgE-mediated signaling through its receptors is also a focal point of inflammatory allergic disease (1Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Beavil A.J. Beavil R.L. McCloskey N. Coker H.A. Fear D. Smurthwaite L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 579-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The constant domain of IgE (Fcϵ) is responsible for binding to its two receptors, FcϵRI and CD23 (also known as FcϵRII). FcϵRI is expressed on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and some antigen presenting cells in humans (2MacGlashan D. Clin. Rev.

Cross-linking of cell surface IgE·FcϵRI complexes with multivalent antigens or anti-IgE antibodies leads to receptor signaling and cellular degranulation, the release of preformed secretory granules containing histamine, serotonin, various lipids, proteases, and other acute inflammatory agents, and the expression and release of inflammatory cytokines (1Gould H.J.

Receptor cross-linking also leads to endocytosis of aggregated IgE·FcϵRI complexes and exposure to endosomes and lysosomes. Endocytosis is a potentially important pathway for IgE regulation and FcϵRI turnover during an antigen-mediated allergic response (8Furuichi K. Rivera J. Buonocore L.M. Isersky C. J.

This implies that high affinity between IgE and FcϵRI translates into an incredibly long in vivo half-life of the complex on the surface of mast cells and basophils. The Fcϵ/FcϵRIα interaction occurs in a structurally homologous manner to what has been observed for IgG1 constant domain (Fcγ) binding to FcγRI-III (13Sondermann P. Oosthuizen V. Immunol.

Domain 2 of the FcϵRIα subunit interacts with the homodimeric interface of the Cϵ3 domains of Fcϵ.Cϵ4ofFcϵ does not participate directly in the binding but is crucial for maintaining high affinity (16Henry A.J.

The Cϵ2 domain, which is unique to IgE and virtually replaces the hinge found in IgG, is much less involved in binding but plays an important role in controlling the proper IgE/FcϵRIα stoichiometry and binding kinetics (17Hunt J.

The production and purification of IgGs, particularly human IgG1, for diagnostic or therapeutic applications is now fairly routine. IgE-based therapeutics, however, have only recently begun to build some momentum (20Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang M. Zhang K. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang K. Terada T. Yamada T. Saxon A. Nat.

Unlike IgG therapeutics, standard methods for producing, handling, and formulating IgE or Fcϵ, particularly at an industrial scale, have not been established. In particular, it is not known whether Fcϵ is similar to Fcγ in terms of its thermostability and pH sensitivity. Exposure to destabilizing conditions could lead to denaturation or aggregation. Even low levels of Fcϵ dimer or higher order aggregates could have profound effects on cellular or in vivo functional assays by inadvertently cross-linking FcϵRI in the absence of antigen (5Kalesnikoff J.

Our initial studies revealed an unusual sensitivity of Fcϵ to various buffer and pH conditions. This led us to characterize in detail the biophysical properties of Fcϵ important for maintaining IgE-FcϵRI interactions and for IgE half-life. Here we describe detailed biophysical analyses of Fcϵ focused on deriving domain-specific unfolding information for Fcϵ and how buffer conditions, particularly pH, affect FcϵRIα binding. Using circular dichroism (CD) 3The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism; Fcγ, IgG constant domain fragment; IgG, immunoglobulin G; Cϵ2, Cϵ3, and Cϵ4, second, third, and fourth constant region domains of the IgE heavy chain, respectively; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; Cγ2 and Cγ3, second and third heavy chain constant domains of IgG, respectively; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ΔH0A(T), molar enthalpy of association; ΔC0P, molar heat capacity of association; TM, midpoint of thermal unfolding transition; ΔS0A(T), molar entropy of association. and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we demonstrate that Fcϵ is much less thermostable than Fcγ. The native structure of Fcϵ is also highly sensitive to intermediate pH levels (5.0 and below) and high ionic strength. Binding of Fcϵ to an Fcγ-FcϵRIα fusion protein is extremely high affinity at all pH values where Fcϵ remains folded. Unfolding of the Cϵ3 and Cϵ4 domains below pH 5.0 abolishes Fcϵ binding to the Fcγ-FcϵRIα fusion. This pH-dependent unfolding property of Fcϵ may be important for providing a mechanism of IgE release from its high affinity receptor inside the cell and may help define a unique pathway for the regulation of receptor-bound IgE in vivo. Subcloning of Fcϵ, Fcγ, Fcγ-Cϵ2, Fcγ-Cϵ2Cϵ3, and Fcγ-FcϵRIα-Fcϵ was subcloned from mRNA extracted from human blood B cells (CD20+ and CD20+ IgM-). Complementary DNA primers, GTCACTATGCCACCATCAGCTTG and TTTACCGGGATTTACAGACACCGC, which amplify from the C terminus of the Cϵ1 domain to the C terminus of the Cϵ4 domain, were used to create an Fcϵ vector insert via PCR. The resulting insert was cloned into a TA vector (TOPO TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). The modified TA vector was used as template for PCR using primers GCGGCCGCCTCACCATGGGCTGGAGCCTGATCCTGCTGTTCCTGGTGGCCGTGGCCACCCGCGTGCTGAGCTTCACCCCGCCCACCGTGAA and CGTCGTTTAATTAATCATTTACCGGGATTTACAG. The resulting PCR product was also introduced into the TA vector. After sequencing the 2nd generation TA vector, a fragment was digested from the vector using the enzymes NotI and PacI and ligated into the expression vector PV-90 (Biogen Idec). The theoretical subcloned sequence following signal processing was (in Kabat numbering) 248FTPP... PGK610 (23Kabat E. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). The plasmid was introduced into CHO cells by electroporation. Clones were selected with geneticin (Invitrogen). An N-terminal signal sequence, MGWSLILLFLVAVATRVLS, was built-in to the expression vector for secretion into the media and was included for the majority of the protein constructs described here (24Nakamura T. Kloetzer W.S. Brams P. Hariharan K. Chamat S. Cao X. LaBarre M.J. Chinn P.C. Morena R.A. Shestowsky W.S. Li Y.P. Chen A. Reff M.E. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 14 days at 28 °C, 5% CO2 humidified air, in BCM16 serum-free media. A secreted, dimeric protein of the expected molecular mass, ∼71.3 kDa (as per SDS-PAGE and static light scattering analysis), was found in the media following culture. The Fcϵ protein identity was also confirmed by Edman degradation and intact mass analysis. An in-house vector containing the constant region of human IgG1 was used as template for PCR amplification of human Fcγ using primers GCGGCCGCCTCACCATGGGCTGGAGCCTGATCCTGCTGTTCCTGGTGGCCGTGGCCACCCGCGTGCTGAGCGAGCCCAAATCTTGTGACAA and TTAATTAATCATTTACCCGGAGACAGG. The PCR product was cloned into the TA vector and sequenced in-house. The remaining plasmid manipulations, transfections, and cell culture were performed as described above for Fcϵ. The mature sequence of the Fcγ protein was predicted to be 226EPK... PGK478. The secreted, dimeric protein was found to have an average mass ∼56.4 kDa by SDS-PAGE and static light scattering analyses. Mass analysis with the purified protein reduced with dithiothreitol and treated with PNGase F yielded a dominant ion at 25,964 kDa corresponding to mature Fcγ with the C-terminal lysine cleaved at >90%. Cys230 (residue 5 in the mature protein) forms a disulfide bond with light chain in full-length IgG1. No nonnative inter- or intra-molecular disulfides were detected following long term (i.e. several months) incubation at 4 °C. The chimeric protein, Fcγ-FcϵRIα, containing human Fcγ connected at its C terminus (Nterm-226EPK...SPG477-Cterm) by a 9-amino acid linker, SRENLYFQG, to the N terminus of human FcϵRIα (starting with -VPQ...), was created for enhanced receptor expression. The human FcϵRIα DNA insert encoding the extracellular domain without its signal peptide (Val26 to Tyr202, residue numbering includes signal peptide) was obtained by PCR from IMAGE clone 4294467 (ATCC) using the primers GCGGCGTCTAGAGAGAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGCGTCCCTCAGAAACCTAAGGTC and GCGGCGGTCGACGAATTCTTAGTACTTCTCACGCGGAGCTT. The PCR product was subsequently digested with XbaI and SalI and subcloned into a modified INPEP4-Fc vector containing a signal peptide of the mouse κ-light chain fused to the human immunoglobulin heavy chain IgG1 constant region (Fc) (Kabat number 226-477). The Fcγ portion contained a T318A (EU299) mutation that abolishes glycosylation at Asn314 (EU297). The C-terminal Lys on Fcγ was not included because this residue was cleaved at >90% within the cell culture for Fcγ (see above). The plasmid was transfected into dihydrofolate reductase-CHO DG44 cells using electroporation (25Urlaub G. McDowell J. Chasin L.A. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1985; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and cloned in medium containing CHO-S-SFMII (Invitrogen) supplemented with HT (Invitrogen) in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) using the limiting dilution method. Cell culture was performed using the same protocols as used for the Fcϵ producing CHO cells. The chimeric proteins, Fcγ-Cϵ2 and Fcγ-Cϵ2Cϵ3, were prepared by linking the Cϵ2orCϵ2Cϵ3 domains of IgE to the C terminus of Fcγ via a 15-amino acid linker GSGGS(GGGGS)2. The C-terminal Lys on Fcγ was also not included here. The sequences of the Fcγ-Cϵ2 and Fcγ-Cϵ2Cϵ3 protein domains began at the same N terminus as the above Fcϵ construct and contained the following C termini:... SNP364 for Fcγ-Cϵ2 and... GPR499 for Fcγ-Cϵ2Cϵ3. CHO cell lines producing high titers of Fcγ-Cϵ2 and Fcγ-Cϵ2Cϵ3 were subcloned from the bulk transformants using the method of Brezinsky et al. (26Brezinsky S.C. Chiang G.G. Szilvasi A. Mohan S. Shapiro R.I. MacLean A. Sisk W. Thill G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 277: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and cultured using the same protocol as described for the Fcϵ CHO clone. Protein Purification—Purifications were performed using an AKTA Explorer (GE-Healthcare). CHO cell media containing Fcϵ was titrated to pH 9.0 using 1 m Tris base, diluted 10 times with distilled deionized H2O, and loaded on a Q Sepharose column equilibrated in 20 mm, Tris, pH 9.0, at 10 ml/min. The column was washed with running buffer, and Fcϵ was eluted using a linear gradient to 200 mm NaCl. Fcϵ eluted between 110 and 170 mm. To concentrate the protein, the eluant was diluted 10 times, passed over a 60-ml Q Sepharose column, washed, and eluted in a single step using 20 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, pH 9.0. The concentrated eluant was titrated to pH 8.0 using 2 m NaCH3COO, pH 5.0, and further concentrated using an Amicon stir unit with a 10,000 Mr cut-off YM10 membrane, and passed over a 350-ml Superdex 200 column equilibrated with PBS to remove aggregates, multimers, and remaining contaminants. Purified Fcϵ was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device, 10,000 Mr (Millipore). Protein concentration was measured by AU280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.4 ml mg-1 cm-1. CHO supernatants containing recombinant Fcγ, Fcγ-FcϵRIα, or Fcγ-Cϵ2 were loaded onto a Protein A-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl buffer at pH 7.5. The column was washed and protein was eluted using a step gradient to 100% 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0. Protein-containing fractions were titrated to about pH 7.0 using 1 m Tris base, pooled, and dialyzed against PBS. The Fcγ-FcϵRIα fusion protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as described above for Fcϵ. Purified Fcγ, Fcγ-FcϵRIα, and Fcγ-Cϵ2 were concentrated in the same manner as Fcϵ.Fcγ and Fcγ-FcϵRIα concentrations were determined by AU280 nm using extinction coefficients of 1.4 and 1.9 ml mg-1 cm-1, respectively. Fcγ-Cϵ2 concentration was determined using the modified Lowry method and bovine IgG as the standard. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography with In-line Static Light Scattering—Various pH samples of Fcϵ and Fcγ were prepared by dilution of 1.8 and 4.0 mg/ml stocks, respectively, into 25 mm phosphate, 25 mm citrate, 150 mm NaCl buffers at pH 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5.0, 5.3, 5.7, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. Final protein concentrations were 320 μg/ml. Additional samples were prepared by diluting the Fcϵ and Fcγ stocks into 25 mm phosphate, 25 mm citrate, 750 mm NaCl at pH 4, 5, and 6. The stock solutions were in PBS (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mm salt). All samples were incubated for 3 or more hours at room temperature before analysis. Eighty μl of each sample was injected onto a TSKgel G3000SW XL, 5 mm, 250-Å Analytical SEC column (Tosoh Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide at pH 7.2 using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Whereas injection of the various pH samples onto the SEC column using a similar running buffer may result in some protein refolding or re-equilibration, the running buffer was amenable for the column and allowed for uniform comparison of elution times via the use of a single running buffer. Light scattering data for material eluting from the SEC column were collected using a miniDAWN static light scattering detector coupled to an in-line refractive index meter (Wyatt Technologies). Light scattering data were analyzed using the ASTRA V software provided by the manufacturer. ANS Binding—The fluorescence of 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS, Sigma) was measured using a Victor3 multilabel fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a 360 ± 20 nm excitation cutoff filter and a 460 ± 20 nm emission cutoff filter. All fluorescence measurements were made using 96-well fluorescence plates (NUNC MaxisorbF) with 150 μl/well and a 0.1-s sample averaging period per well. ANS (20 μm) was incubated with 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 μg/ml bovine α-lactalbumin (Sigma) at pH 2.0 and 7.0 to establish appropriate protein concentrations to obtain adequate signal to noise. At 80 μg/ml α-lactalbumin at pH 2.0, the ANS fluorescence signal was ∼20-fold higher than the noise; therefore, 80 μg/ml protein concentrations were utilized for the Fcϵ and Fcγ measurements. To study ANS binding to Fcϵ or Fcγ, each protein was diluted into a 25 mm phosphate, 25 mm citrate, 150 mm NaCl buffer series at pH 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5.0, 5.3, 5.7, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0 and incubated with the fluorescent dye. Additional Fcϵ and Fcγ samples were prepared in 25 mm phosphate, 25 mm citrate, 750 mm NaCl at pH 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0. CD Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric Peltier device for temperature control and an external water bath as a heat sink. Fcϵ, Fcγ, and Fcγ-FcϵRIα spectra (195-260 nm) were taken using the continuous scan mode at 100 nm/min. Bandwidth was set to 1 nm and data pitch to 0.2 nm. The response time of the instrument was set to 1 s. Five spectra were averaged for increased signal to noise. All spectra were taken at 25 °C. Fcϵ, Fcγ, and Fcγ-FcϵRIα samples were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm NaCl at pH 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0. Additional Fcϵ, Fcγ, and Fcγ-FcϵRIα samples at pH 7.4 were prepared by dialysis against PBS. To map the apparent unfolding transition of Fcϵ in detail, additional Fcϵ samples were prepared by dialysis against the same citrate buffer at pH 4.8 and 5.2. Background buffer scans at pH 5.0, 6.0, and 7.4 were virtually identical; therefore, all background subtractions were performed using the pH 5.0 background spectrum. All CD spectra were obtained using 3.75 μm protein with the dimer molecular mass (71.8 kDa) used for Fcϵ and the monomer molecular mass used for Fcγ (24.7 kDa) and the divalent Fcγ-FcϵRIα fusion protein (49.8 kDa). Thermal melts of Fcϵ were performed in the cuvette by heating the samples at 5 °C intervals at a rate of 1 °C/min. Between each 5 °C heating interval, three replicate scans were performed using the parameters described above. Limited Proteolysis and LC/MS—Fcϵ was digested by trypsin and Glu-C at pH 4.5, where significant protein structural changes away from the natively folded material occurred. Five samples were prepared by diluting 1 mg of Fcϵ into 0.4 ml of 70 mm sodium acetate solutions at pH 4.5. The pH of the acetate solution was unperturbed subsequent to the addition of Fcϵ in PBS. Various concentrations of trypsin (30, 300, and 3000 units, Sigma T-1426) and endoproteinase Glu-C (10 and 100 units, Sigma P-2922) were added to individual pH 4.5 Fcϵ samples. Digestions were incubated at 37 °C. Time points (100 μl) were taken for LC/MS analysis after 0, 2, 10, 60, and 300 min and after overnight incubation. Proteolysis was halted by the addition of 50 mm EDTA and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Dithiothreitol was then added to >10 mm for disulfide reduction, and each time point was subsequently frozen at -80 °C. Reagent blanks containing trypsin or Glu-C but excluding Fcϵ were also prepared for identifying non-Fcϵ peaks in the LC chromatograms. Based on the level of proteolysis observed by SDS-PAGE analysis, the 30-unit trypsin and 100-unit Glu-C samples were chosen for LC/MS peptide mass mapping. All time points were analyzed by HPLC MS as described previously (27Glaser S.M. Hughes I.E. Hopp J.R. Hathaway K. Perret D. Reff M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41494-41503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Total ion chromatograms were analyzed using the Agilent Deconvolution and Peptide Tools software programs. DSC—DSC scans were performed using an automated capillary DSC (capDSC, MicroCal, LLC). Protein and reference solutions were sampled automatically from 96-well plates using the robotic attachment. Prior to each protein scan, two buffer scans were performed to define the baseline for subtraction. All 96-well plates containing protein were stored within the instrument at 6 °C. For the Fcϵ and Fcγ pH titrations (Figs. 3, B and C, and 4, A and B), three separate pH panels were created with 15, 150, or 750 mm NaCl. The buffers included 70 mm glycine at pH 2.8, 3.3, and 3.5; 70 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.0, 4.5, 4.8, 5.0, and 5.2; 35 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5; and 35 mm Tris at pH 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. Stock solutions of Fcϵ and Fcγ at 1.8 and 4.0 mg/ml, respectively, in PBS were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in each buffer solution. Identical PBS dilutions into all members of the buffer panel were made for baseline measurements, and it was confirmed that the pH of each sample was not altered by the residual PBS. Scans were performed from 10 to 90 °C at 1 °C/min using the medium feedback mode for enhanced peak resolution. Additionally, the Fcϵ and Fcγ-Cϵ2 proteins were co-dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, 15 mm NaCl, pH 2.5, diluted to 1 mg/ml with dialysate, and scanned under identical conditions as described for the buffer panel.FIGURE 4pH dependence of the Fcϵ and Fcγ domain thermostabilities as represented by their TM values.

Using the dimeric molecular weight for apo- and holo-Fcϵ and the monomeric molecular weight for apo- and holo-Fcγ-FcϵRIα, 2.5 μm protein solutions were prepared using matched dialysates for dilution and incubated for at least 2 h at 4°C prior to DSC analysis. Dialysates were used within the reference cell of the calorimeter to define the baseline of each protein scan. Additional baseline corrections were performed by scanning with dialysate in both the reference and sample cells. For the binding experiments, scans were performed from 20 to 95 °C using a scan rate of 4.0 °C/min and the low feedback mode. Scans were analyzed using the Origin software supplied by the manufacturer. Subsequent to the subtraction of reference baseline scans, non-zero protein scan baselines were corrected using a third order polynomial. The unfolding parameters for the multidomain unfolding profiles of Fcϵ, Fcγ, Fcγ-FcϵRIα, and Fcϵ/Fcγ-FcϵRIα were deconvoluted using the multipeak fitting routine within the software. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Fcϵ and Fcγ-FcϵRIα were dialyzed against 10 mm citrate, 10 mm NaCl at pH 5.5 and 6.0 as described above for the CD experiments. Additional samples were also prepared by dialyzing Fcϵ and Fcγ-FcϵRIα against 1× PBS. Fcϵ stock solutions were concentrated to ∼100 μm using 6 ml of Vivaspin MW5000 centrifugal concentration units (VivaSciences). ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, LLC). Aliquots of 70 μm Fcϵ (15 μl) were injected into the reaction cell containing 5 μm solutions of Fcγ-FcϵRIα to obtain a final Fcϵ/Fcγ-FcϵRIα ratio of ∼2:1. Dialysates were used in the reference cell. A 4-min equilibration period was used between all Fcϵ injections with an initial delay of 60 s. All samples were degassed for ∼10 min prior to each experiment. The ITC internal sample jacket was set 10 °C below the constant temperature within the reaction and reference cells, except for the 10 °C titrations where the bath was set to 1 °C. Numerical integration of the data were performed using the ITC data analysis software supplied by MicroCal (Origin). ΔHA0 (T) values were calculated based on the difference between the average heat liberated/absorbed during the binding phase of the injections and the average heat of dilution found once the receptor, Fc-FcϵRIα, was saturated with Fcϵ.

Two Smad4 genes (α and β/10, or smad4 and smad4.2) have been isolated from Xenopus, and conflicting data are reported for Smad4β/10 actions in mesodermal and neural induction. To further understand the functions of the Smad4s in early frog development, we analyzed their activities in detail. We report that Smad10 is a mutant form of Smad4β that harbors a missense mutation of a conserved arginine to histidine in the MH1 domain. The mutation results in enhanced association of Smad10 with the nuclear transcription corepressor Ski and leads to its neural inducing activity through inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. In contrast to Smad10, both Smad4α and Smad4β enhanced BMP signals in ectodermal explants. Using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) to knockdown endogenous Smad4 protein levels, we discovered that Smad4β was required for both activin- and BMP-mediated mesodermal induction in animal caps, whereas Smad4α affected only the BMP signals. Neither Smad4 was involved directly in neural induction. Expression of Smad4β-MO in early frog embryos resulted in reduction of mesodermal markers and defects in axial structures, which were rescued by either Smad4α or Smad4β. Smad4α-MO induced only minor deficiency at late stages. As Smad4β, but not Smad4α, is expressed at high levels maternally and during early gastrulation, our data suggest that although Smad4α and Smad4β may have similar activities, they are differentially utilized during frog embryogenesis, with only Smad4β being essential for mesoderm induction.

Genesis. 2003; 35: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Two branches of the growth factor family function differently in various processes. TGFβ/activin/nodal-like molecules are involved in induction and patterning of early mesendoderm and left-right axis specification, whereas bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) control early dorsoventral patterning in all germ layers and subsequently modulate the formation of multiple organ systems. In adults, one predominant function of the TGFβ signals is to regulate cell proliferation, and mutations in many signaling components of this pathway are associated with tumor formation (6Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar, 7Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). TGFβ signals are transmitted through two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. In the ligand-induced receptor complex, the type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates Smad proteins, the cytoplasmic signal transducers. Growth factors from the TGFβ/activin/nodal subfamily act through their specific type I receptors (ALK4, -5, and -7) to activate Smad2 and -3, whereas BMPs stimulate Smad1, -5, and -8/9 through ALK2, -3, and -6. These receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads) show similar organization of their sequences, which contain the conserved N-terminal MH1 and the C-terminal MH2 domains. R-Smads from both classes interact with a common partner, the co-Smad Smad4, to regulate downstream gene expression. Smad4 also has the MH1 and MH2 domains, but it lacks the C-terminal SSXS motif to be phosphorylated by the type I receptors. Smad4 responds to TGFβ signals by forming a hetero-oligomer complex with activated R-Smads, translocating into the nucleus and binding to DNA elements, frequently with other sequence-specific transcription factors and co-factors to influence expression of target genes. This canonical TGFβ signal transduction model thus places Smad4 as an important component for signals from all TGFβ family members (8Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4865) Google Scholar). Although studies with dominant negative Smad4 support a pivotal role of Smad4 in both TGFβ/activin/nodal- and BMP-mediated processes (9Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massgue J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), recent evidence from Smad4-deficient mouse embryos and cells indicate that certain responses to TGFβ signals may occur in the absence of Smad4. Thus chimeric mouse embryos, containing Smad4-null epiblast cells, form patterned mesoderm that gives rise to the heart, trunk somites, and lateral plate mesoderm, a phenotype different from that expected if both nodal and BMP signals are impaired (10Chu G.C. Dunn N.R. Anderson D.C. Oxburgh L. Robertson E.J. Development. 2004; 131: 3501-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Murine fibroblast cells deficient in Smad4 still respond to TGFβ/activin-mediated growth inhibition and induction of extracellular matrix genes (11Sirard C. Kim S. Mirtsos C. Tadich P. Hoodless P.A. Itie A. Maxson R. Wrana J.L. Mak T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Human cell lines with depleted Smad4 only lose a subset of TGFβ responsive gene expression and can undergo TGFβ-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (12Levy L. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8108-8125Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in Medea, the Drosophila Smad4 homolog, lead to defective regulation of a subset of the processes affected by mutations in Mad (13Wisotzkey R.G. Mehra A. Sutherland D.J. Dobens L.L. Liu X. Dohrmann C. Attisano L. Raftery L.A. Development. 1998; 125: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results imply that Smad4 may not be an obligatory component of all TGFβ signals and may be dispensable in particular TGFβ-responsive processes. Currently, it is unclear what determines a process or a target gene to be Smad4-dependent or Smad4-independent. In Xenopus, two Smad4 genes have been identified (14LeSueur J.A. Graff J.M. Development. 1999; 126: 137-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 214: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). They show 92 and 90% identity in the MH1 and MH2 domains, respectively. However, the linker region between the two MH domains is divergent in the two genes. Smad4α is closely related to the mammalian Smad4, whereas Smad4β/10 has a linker sequence that is only 34% identical to that of the human Smad4 (15Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Howell M. Itoh F. Pierreux C.E. Valgeirsdottir S. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Characterization of the activities of the two Smad4 proteins by different groups has led to conflicting conclusions. On one hand, both Smad4s have been shown to form hetero-oligomer complex with Smad1 and Smad2 in response to BMP and activin signals, respectively, and overexpression of either gene enhances both Smad1- and Smad2-dependent mesoderm induction in ectodermal explants. Both Smad4s therefore act similarly to the conventional mammalian Smad4 as co-Smads (15Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Howell M. Itoh F. Pierreux C.E. Valgeirsdottir S. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the divergent Smad4, Smad4β/10, is found to induce neural markers directly without the presence of mesoderm in animal cap explants (14LeSueur J.A. Graff J.M. Development. 1999; 126: 137-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other direct neural inducers that induce neural tissues via inhibition of ectodermal BMP signals in Xenopus (17Harland R.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18Khokha M.K. Yeh J. Grammer T.C. Harland R.M. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), Smad4β/10 has been claimed to act independently of BMP signals. Furthermore, using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) to knockdown endogenous expression, Smad4β/10 was shown to be required for neural but not mesodermal tissue formation in early Xenopus embryos and had no effect on Smad1- and Smad2-mediated mesoderm induction in animal caps (19LeSueur J.A. Fortuno III, E.S. McKay R.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 771-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The sequence responsible for the neural inducing activity of Smad4β/10 was further mapped not to the divergent linker region but to the conserved MH1 and MH2 domains. Based on these results, it was claimed that Smad4β/10 does not act in the TGFβ pathway, but has a novel neuralizing function in the Spemann organizer, separate from the dorsalizing and neuralizing effect of the BMP antagonists (14LeSueur J.A. Graff J.M. Development. 1999; 126: 137-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19LeSueur J.A. Fortuno III, E.S. McKay R.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 771-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whereas the studies on Xenopus Smad4 genes are intriguing, the questions of how Smad4β/10 might transduce signals and what pathway(s) it may be involved in are open. It is also unknown whether Smad4α has a distinct function from Smad4β/10 in terms of mesodermal and neural induction, and what are the in vivo activities of the two Smad4s. To resolve the outstanding questions on the function of the two Smad4 proteins in early frog development, we undertook biological and biochemical analyses of their roles in TGFβ-dependent processes. We have addressed: 1) whether Smad4β/10 induces neural tissues without affecting TGFβ signaling; 2) what may be the mechanism underlying the activities of Smad4β/10; and 3) what in vivo roles the two Smad4 proteins play during frog embryogenesis. Our data reveal that Smad10 is a mutant Smad4β that induces neural markers through interaction with Ski and inhibition of BMPs; and that although Smad4α and -4β may have analogous activities, they play different roles in mesodermal formation due to their differential expression during early developmental stages. Plasmid Construction, RNA Synthesis, and Antisense Morpholino Oligonucleotides—The Smad10 construct was obtained from Dr. Graff (University of Texas, Southwestern, GenBank™ accession number AF104232), and Smad4α and Smad4β plasmids were provided by Dr. Nishida (Kyoto University, GenBank accession numbers AB022721 and AB022722, respectively). The mutant Smad4β(R132H), the hemagglutinin-tagged Smad4s, and the FLAG-tagged Ski were all constructed by a PCR-based cloning strategy and inserted into the vector pCS105. The plasmids were linearized with AscI, and RNA was synthesized using the in vitro mMessage mMachine transcription kit from Ambion. The Smad4β antisense MO is as described (19LeSueur J.A. Fortuno III, E.S. McKay R.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 771-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and Smad4α-MO is as the following: 5′-TGTTTGTGATGGACATATTGTCGGT-3′. A standard control MO from Gene Tools was also used in this study. Protein Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—RNAs encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Smad4s and FLAG-tagged Ski were injected into the animal poles of two-cell stage embryos. Protein extract was made from gastrula embryos and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described (20Yeo C. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 21Harms P.W. Chang C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2624-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization and Whole Mount Immunohistochemistry—Embryos were stained by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry as described (22Harland R.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chang C. Wilson P.W. Mathews L.S. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 12/101 antibody was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNAs were injected into animal poles of two-cell stage embryos. Animal caps were dissected at blastula stage 9 and harvested at gastrula or tadpole stages. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described (23Chang C. Wilson P.W. Mathews L.S. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with 25 cycles of PCR at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. Smad10 Induces Neural Markers via Inhibition of BMP Signals—Smad4β and Smad10 cDNAs have been isolated by different groups, and the injected mRNA was reported either to enhance Smad1-dependent mesoderm induction or to promote neural tissue formation independent of BMP/Smad1 inhibition (14LeSueur J.A. Graff J.M. Development. 1999; 126: 137-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Howell M. Itoh F. Pierreux C.E. Valgeirsdottir S. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To examine whether Smad4β and Smad10 indeed have different activities, we analyzed the activity of the original Smad4β and Smad10 cDNA clones. Overexpression of Smad10 mRNA induced neural markers in the absence of mesoderm in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To address whether Smad10 neuralizes by BMP inhibition, we first tested whether Smad10 blocked BMP activity in an independent assay. Indeed, Smad10 inhibited induction of globin expression by BMP2 at similar doses to those required for neural induction (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, neural markers were suppressed when Smad10 was coexpressed with BMP2 (Fig. 1B), supporting the notion that Smad10 inhibits BMP signals. A Smad4β isoform lacking the N-terminal 32-amino acid extension was previously used to demonstrate that Smad4β enhanced Smad1 activities (15Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), so we sought to examine whether the discrepancy on Smad4β/10 function might be due to the presence or absence of this N-terminal region. A short form of Smad10 (Smad10ΔN) with its N-terminal 32 amino acids removed had the same activities as the full-length Smad10 in animal caps, and could also induce neural markers through inhibition of BMPs (Fig. 1). Our results confirm that overexpression of Smad10 at high levels can indeed induce neural markers; but contrary to the previous report, we find that induction of neural tissues is associated with inhibition of BMP signaling. Smad4α and Smad4β Have Different Activities from Smad10, and a Point Mutation in Smad4β Converts It to Smad10—Smad10 is nearly identical to Smad4β (Fig. 2A), but Smad4β has been reported to have a different activity (15Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Howell M. Itoh F. Pierreux C.E. Valgeirsdottir S. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To understand the potential differences between the two molecules, we overexpressed Smad4β and Smad10 in animal caps and compared their function side by side. Unlike Smad10, Smad4β did not induce neural markers, but instead stimulated the expression of globin (Fig. 2B). When coexpressed with activin, Smad4β ventralized the mesodermal induction at high doses, although at low doses it enhanced the marker induction by activin (Fig. 2C and data not shown). The behavior of Smad4β is similar to that of Smad4α in regulation of TGFβ signals (Fig. 2). This agrees with previous reports (15Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Howell M. Itoh F. Pierreux C.E. Valgeirsdottir S. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and suggests that although these two Smad4s have divergent linker regions, they have comparable functions. In contrast to Smad4α and -4β, Smad10 blocked both activin- and BMP-dependent mesodermal induction when expressed at high levels (Fig. 2C). Our data demonstrate that despite the nearly identical sequences of Smad10 and Smad4β, they have different activities in modulation of TGFβ signaling. Sequence comparison between Smad10 and Smad4β reveals that they differ at amino acid 132 in the MH1 domain, with Smad10 encoding histidine and Smad4β encoding arginine at this position (Fig. 2A). All mammalian Smad4s as well as Xenopus Smad4α encode arginine at the corresponding position, and mutation of this conserved arginine is found in human cancer patients (24Schutte M. Hruban R.H. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Nadasdy G.M. Weinstein C.L. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Cairns P. Nawroz H. Sidransky D. Casero Jr., R.A. Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E.

Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the possibility that the change of this residue in Smad10 was responsible for its distinct activity. We introduced the same point mutation into Smad4β and analyzed the function of the resulting mutant Smad4β(R132H). As shown in Fig. 2, alteration of the single amino acid reversed the action of Smad4β(R132H), so that it inhibited BMP signaling and induced neural markers. The behavior of Smad4β(R132H) mimicked that of Smad10, suggesting that the missense mutation in Smad10 changed it from a cytoplasmic transducer to an inhibitor of TGFβ signals. To further investigate whether Smad10 might be a natural allele of Smad4β that is expressed during early frog development, we PCR cloned the corresponding fragment of Smad4β from both maternal (stage 2) and gastrula (stage 10) stage embryos. Sequence analyses of randomly picked clones revealed that all eight maternal and 12 out of 13 gastrula Smad4β clones encoded arginine at the relevant position, with only one sequence from gastrula Smad4β clones encoded histidine. We also examined both Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis EST databases and found that all 33 overlapping Smad4β EST sequences contained the codon for arginine at the pertinent position. We thus conclude that Smad10 may not be present abundantly to influence mesoderm induction and patterning during early frog embryogenesis. Enhanced Interaction of Smad10 with the Ski Transcription Corepressor—To understand how Smad10 may differ from Smad4α and -4β in regulation of TGFβ signals, we performed biochemical studies. As Smad10 blocked both activin and BMPs at high doses, we reasoned that it might interact with transcriptional repressors to suppress TGFβ target genes. A possible candidate is the nuclear oncoprotein Ski, which has previously been demonstrated to bind to the mammalian Smad4 and act as a corepressor to inhibit both TGFβ and BMP signals (28Akiyoshi S.

A. 2000; 97: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We thus constructed epitope-tagged Smad4, Smad10, and Ski and examined whether these Smads had differential abilities to bind to Ski in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 3, neither Smad4α nor Smad4β associated with Ski in the absence of the TGFβ signals, whereas Smad10 interacted with Ski strongly (Fig. 3, compare lanes 6 and 7 with lane 8). Activation of the TGFβ pathway by activin or BMP4 did not significantly alter the interaction of Smad10 with Ski (not shown). Our results indicate that the point mutation in Smad10 leads to enhanced binding of Smad10 to the transcriptional corepressor Ski, and that this interaction may contribute to its ability to repress activin and BMP signals when expressed at high levels in early frog embryos. Differential Requirement for Smad4α and Smad4β in Activin-and BMP-stimulated Mesodermal Induction—Overexpression experiments show that the two Xenopus Smad4s may have analogous activities in mediating signals from TGFβ ligands. The requirement for endogenous Smad4s in TGFβ-regulated processes, however, is unknown. To address this issue, we performed loss-of-function studies, using antisense MOs to knockdown the endogenous Smad4 protein levels. In vitro translation assays showed that both Smad4α-MO and Smad4β-MO specifically reduced protein synthesis from their respective RNA templates that contained the corresponding 5′-untranslated region (UTR), but they did not block protein synthesis from the templates that contained modified upstream sequences, nor did they inhibit protein translation from the other Smad4 gene (Fig. 4A). When coexpressed with activin, Smad4α-MO did not block mesodermal induction in animal caps (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 4), but Smad4β-MO dramatically inhibited activin-induced marker expression (Fig. 4, B and C, compare lanes 2 and 3). The result demonstrates that Smad4β is required for activin-mediated mesoderm induction in animal caps. We next coexpressed the MOs with BMP4 and discovered that both Smad4α-MO and Smad4β-MO blocked the induction of globin by BMP4 (Fig. 4C, lanes 5-7). The data implies that Smad4α and Smad4β are differentially utilized in activin- and BMP-dependent mesodermal induction. The Smad4β-MO, which is the same as the Smad10-MO, has previously been used to demonstrate that Smad10 is essential for neural induction in both animal caps and early frog embryos (19LeSueur J.A. Fortuno III, E.S. McKay R.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 771-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test whether this is the case and whether Smad4α is also critical for neural induction, we coexpressed the Smad4 MOs with the neural inducer noggin and assayed for neural markers in animal caps by reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, noggin induced the anterior neural marker Otx2 and the pan-neural marker NRP-1; coexpression with Smad4 MOs did not significantly alter the induction of these genes. Our results thus indicate that neither Smad4 protein is involved directly in the neural induction process. To examine whether MO-mediated inhibition of mesodermal induction by activin and BMPs can be rescued with Smad4s, we coexpressed Smad4 MOs with the 5′-UTR-modified Smad4α or Smad4β RNAs. At high doses (above 0.5 ng), both Smad4α and -4β rescued ventral markers without restoration of dorsal transcripts in activin-induced mesodermal formation (not shown); this result is consistent with our finding that overexpression of Smad4α and -4β ventralizes mesoderm induction by activin (Fig. 2). At low doses (50-100 pg) these Smad4s rescued expression of both dorsal (chordin at gastrula stages, type II collagen and muscle actin at tadpole stages) and ventral (XWnt8 and globin at gastrula and tadpole stages, respectively) markers, although the efficiency of rescue of these regional markers by the two Smad4s varied slightly in different experiments (Fig. 4D, left panel, and data not shown). The result indicates that although depletion of Smad4α does not affect activin activities, elevation of Smad4α protein levels can compensate for the loss of Smad4β in restoring activin response in animal caps. Rescue of MO-inhibited BMP function with the two Smad4s showed that both genes rescued the ventral mesodermal markers induced by BMP4 (Fig. 4D, right panel). Our data suggest that the two Smad4s may function similarly when overexpressed, but due to their different endogenous expression patterns and levels they may preferentially participate in signal transduction of different TGFβ ligands. Smad4β Is Required for Mesoderm Formation in Early Frog Embryos—Our data from the in vitro explant assays demonstrate that Smad4β is required for mesoderm induction by both activin and BMP4, whereas Smad4α may have more limited influence on mesoderm formation (Fig. 4). To address the in vivo functions of these Smad4s, we next injected the MOs into early frog embryos and observed the morphology of and marker gene expression in the resulting embryos. When injected into the animal poles of two-cell stage embryos, Smad4β-MO induced head defects with missing eyes in most embryos, and the tails of the injected embryos were often short and bent. In contrast, embryos injected with Smad4α-MO showed relatively normal axis formation, although the dorsal fin was expanded. A control MO injected in parallel did not cause any obvious defects in the embryos (Fig. 5A). To further assess the activities of endogenous Smad4s, we also injected the MOs into the marginal zone regions of two-cell stage embryos at 20-40-ng doses. As shown in Fig. 5B, whereas neither the control MO nor the Smad4α-MO induced dramatic defects, Smad4β-MO caused severe malformation of the body axis. Gastrulation was delayed, and open blastopore was observed in late stage embryos. The head and tail of the morphant embryos were reduced or missing, and the body axis was shortened (Fig. 5B). When the two Smad4 MOs were coinjected into early embryos, the resulting morphants showed the phenotypes similar to that when Smad4β-MO was injected alone, although more embryos displayed gastrulation defects and shortened body axis (not shown). The phenotype of the MO-injected embryos indicates that Smad4β plays an important role in body axis formation during early frog development. To examine how the mesodermal and neural transcripts are affected when the embryos are depleted of endogenous Smad4s, we assayed for expression of marker genes by in situ hybridization.

https://openalex.org/W2086884934,"Bacterial 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which belongs to a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family and forms a dimer composed of two 26-kDa subunits, catalyzes the oxidoreduction of hydroxysteroids in a coenzyme-dependent manner. This enzyme also catalyzes the oxidoreduction of nonsteroid compounds that play an important role in xenobiotic metabolism of bacteria. We performed an x-ray analysis on the crystal of Ps3alphaHSD, the enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. B-0831 complexed with NADH. The resulting crystal structure at 1.8A resolution showed that Ps3alphaHSD exists as a structural heterodimer composed of apo- and holo-subunits. A distinct structural difference between them was found in the 185-207-amino acid region, where the structure in the apo-subunit is disordered whereas that in the holo-subunit consists of two alpha-helices. This fact proved that the NADH binding allows the helical structures to form the substrate binding pocket even in the absence of the substrate, although the region corresponds to the so-called substrate-binding loop. The induction of alpha-helices in solution by the coenzyme binding was also confirmed by the CD experiment. In addition, the CD experiment revealed that the helix-inducing ability of NADH is stronger than that of NAD. We discuss the negative cooperativity for the coenzyme binding, which is caused by the effect of the structural change transferred between the subunits of the heterodimer."
