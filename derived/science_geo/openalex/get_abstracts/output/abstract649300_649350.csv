https://openalex.org/W3012041454,"The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major barrier to immunotherapy. Within solid tumors, why monocytes preferentially differentiate into immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) rather than immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DCs) remains unclear. Using multiple murine sarcoma models, we find that the TME induces tumor cells to produce retinoic acid (RA), which polarizes intratumoral monocyte differentiation toward TAMs and away from DCs via suppression of DC-promoting transcription factor Irf4. Genetic inhibition of RA production in tumor cells or pharmacologic inhibition of RA signaling within TME increases stimulatory monocyte-derived cells, enhances T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity, and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, an RA-responsive gene signature in human monocytes correlates with an immunosuppressive TME in multiple human tumors. RA has been considered as an anti-cancer agent, whereas our work demonstrates its tumorigenic capability via myeloid-mediated immune suppression and provides proof of concept for targeting this pathway for tumor immunotherapy."

Here, we introduce a high-throughput mouse reporter assay for assessing the pathogenic potential of human enhancer variants in vivo and examine nearly a thousand variants in an enhancer repeatedly linked to polydactyly. We show that 71% of all rare non-coding variants previously proposed as causal lead to reporter gene expression in a pattern consistent with their pathogenic role. Variants observed to alter enhancer activity were further confirmed to cause polydactyly in knockin mice. We also used combinatorial and single-nucleotide mutagenesis to evaluate the in vivo impact of mutations affecting all positions of the enhancer and identified additional functional substitutions, including potentially pathogenic variants hitherto not observed in humans. Our results uncover the functional consequences of hundreds of mutations in a phenotype-associated enhancer and establish a widely applicable strategy for systematic in vivo evaluation of human enhancer variants."

In this study, Davidia involucrata was cultivated in soil with different concentrations of Pb and Cd and sampled after 90 days. We used ANOVA to analyse the photosynthesis of D. involucrata and the ability of Pb and Cd to enrich and migrate in roots, stems and leaves. Various results are described here. 1) Under individual and combined Pb and Cd stress, the accumulation factors in the roots were greater than 1, which was significantly greater than those in the stems and leaves (P < 0.05), and the translocation factors both were less than 1. The Pb and Cd enrichment ability of D. involucrata roots was significantly higher than that of stems and leaves, and the migration ability of the two heavy metals in D. involucrata was weak. 2) The Mg-dechelatase activities of chlorophyll degradation products increased under stress due to high concentrations of Pb and Cd. However, chlorophyllase activity was higher at relatively low concentrations of the two heavy metals (P < 0.05). δ-Aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen of chlorophyll synthesis products are easily converted to uroporphyrinogen III under low concentrations of Cd, which promotes the synthesis of chlorophyll. 3) The effect of Cd stress alone on the chlorophyll concentration was not significant. Under combined stress, concentrations of Pb and Cd in the range of 400~800 mg·kg-1 and 5~20 mg·kg-1 significantly promoted an increase in photosynthetic pigments (P < 0.05). 4) Inhibition of the net photosynthetic rate increased with increasing Pb and Cd concentrations under both individual and combined stress. In addition, the root of D. involucrata had a strong absorption and fixation effect on heavy metals, thereby reducing metal toxicity and improving the tolerance of D. involucrata to heavy metals."

However, this mutation causes increased levels of ACOX1 protein and function resulting in elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in glia in flies and murine Schwann cells. <i>ACOX1</i> (p.N237S) patients exhibit a severe loss of Schwann cells and neurons. However, treatment of flies and primary Schwann cells with an antioxidant suppressed the p.N237S-induced neurodegeneration.

Chloroplasts of higher plants are essential for photosynthesis and also play critical roles in other important physiological processes, such as lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, cell signaling, and host defense (Schleiff and Becker, 2011Schleiff E.

Plant Biol. 2019; 70: 51-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts contain ∼3,000 proteins, and only a small fraction of these proteins are encoded by the chloroplast genome. Most of the nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as precursors with an N-terminal targeting signal called transit peptide and are subsequently translocated into chloroplasts (Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013Jarvis P.

Hwang I. Sorting of nuclear-encoded chloroplast membrane proteins.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2017; 40: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, one of the remarkable features of chloroplasts is their highly complex structure, with multiple suborganellar membranes (outer envelope, inner envelope, and thylakoid membranes), which thus delineate three separate compartments (intermembrane space, stroma, and lumen). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms of chloroplast protein targeting and sorting is highly challenging. Nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are imported across the chloroplast envelope into the stroma by a common import apparatus, namely the Toc/Tic (translocon at the outer/inner envelope of chloroplasts) complex (Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013Jarvis P.

Once a preprotein reaches the stromal side of the chloroplast envelope and its transit peptide has been cleaved off by the stromal processing peptidase, in many cases, the protein is further targeted to its correct sub-compartment within the chloroplast (Schleiff and Becker, 2011Schleiff E. Becker T. Common ground for protein translocation: access control for mitochondria and chloroplasts.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For example, some proteins are reinserted into the inner envelope membrane after being released into the stroma (Viana et al., 2010Viana A.A. Li M. Schnell D.J.

Tic40 is important for reinsertion of proteins from the chloroplast stroma into the inner membrane.Plant J. 2008; 56: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Other imported proteins, mainly those involved in the photosynthetic functions, are targeted via different pathways to the thylakoid membranes (Cline and Dabney-Smith, 2008Cline K. Dabney-Smith C.

Protein transport into chloroplasts.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 157-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membrane proteins may be inserted spontaneously or use one of the aforementioned pathways, or engage in the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) pathway that is employed predominantly by light harvesting proteins (Schuenemann et al., 1998Schuenemann D.

USA. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thylakoid lumen proteins usually carry further targeting information at their N-terminal end, which guides them via the chloroplast secretory (cpSec) or the chloroplast twin arginine translocation (cpTat) pathways (Yuan et al., 1994Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. SecA homolog in protein transport within chloroplasts: evidence for endosymbiont-derived sorting.Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Settles et al., 1997Settles A.M.

The cpSec pathway requires an ATPase, cpSecA, and the translocation channel consisting of cpSecY and cpSecE, and is involved in the transport of several lumenal proteins including plastocyanin and the 33-kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex (OE33) (Schleiff and Becker, 2011Schleiff E. Becker T. Common ground for protein translocation: access control for mitochondria and chloroplasts.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The cpTat machinery consists of the membrane proteins Tha4, Hcf106, and cpTatC. Hcf106 and cpTatC have been shown to form a large 700 kDa receptor complex in thylakoids and provide the initial binding site for substrates, and Tha4 exists as a separate complex that interacts with the receptor complex during protein transport (Ma and Cline, 2010Ma X. Cline K. Multiple precursor proteins bind individual Tat receptor complexes and are collectively transported.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In general, substrate targeting to different pathways depends on the specific signal in the substrate protein itself (Cline and Dabney-Smith, 2008Cline K. Dabney-Smith C. Plastid protein import and sorting: different paths to the same compartments.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2008; 11: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2017Lee D.W. Lee J. Hwang I. Sorting of nuclear-encoded chloroplast membrane proteins.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2017; 40: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, how the targeting signals are recognized and the mechanisms by which the imported proteins are directed across the crowded stromal environment to the different thylakoid receptors are still largely unknown. In this study, we identify and characterize two ankyrin proteins, STT1 and STT2 that form a hetero-complex to selectively direct cpTat proteins to their thylakoid translocon through a liquid-liquid phase separation mechanism. Our study further demonstrates that weak multivalent interactions between STT complex and cpTat signal peptide are critical for phase separation. Thus, this work provides insights into both protein sorting mechanisms and liquid-like biological systems. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying protein sorting to the cpTat translocon, we screened for proteins that interact with the Arabidopsis cpTat pathway substrate OE23. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that an ankyrin protein EMB506 strongly interacted with OE23 (Figure 1A). EMB506 was previously identified as a chloroplast protein that participates in plastid differentiation and plant development in Arabidopsis (Albert et al., 1999Albert S. Després B. Guilleminot J. Bechtold N. Pelletier G. Delseny M. Devic M. The EMB 506 gene encodes a novel ankyrin repeat containing protein that is essential for the normal development of Arabidopsis embryos.Plant J. 1999; 17: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that EMB506 also interacts with other substrates of the cpTat pathway, including OE17 and PsaN but not with the substrates of the cpSec pathway like OE33 (Figure 1A). To investigate whether EMB506 functions in cpTat substrate protein targeting, we first checked the ability of the EMB506 to target cpTat substrates to their translocon on the thylakoid membrane. To rule out the effect of membrane-attached stroma proteins in the transport process, thylakoid membranes were additionally treated with NaBr to remove all EMB506 proteins but not cpTat components (Frielingsdorf et al., 2008Frielingsdorf S. Jakob M. Klösgen R.B. A stromal pool of TatA promotes Tat-dependent protein transport across the thylakoid membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33838-33845Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C and 1D). As shown in Figure 1E, only a small amount of radiolabeled iOE23 was detected in thylakoid membranes after NaBr treatment. However, addition of EMB506 did not significantly increase the binding efficiency of the cpTat substrate to thylakoid membranes. These results indicate that other stromal factors are also needed for the cpTat substrate targeting process. Sequence similarity analysis revealed another chloroplast ankyrin-repeat protein AKRP with high sequence identity to EMB506, and our yeast two-hybrid results showed that AKRP also specifically interacts with cpTat substrates (Figure 1B). The interactions between these two ankyrin proteins and cpTat substrates were further confirmed by pull-down experiments (Figures 1A and 1B). Similar to EMB506, AKRP alone did not significantly increase the binding efficiency of iOE23 to thylakoid membranes. In contrast, there was a marked increase of iOE23 bound to thylakoid membranes when both EMB506 and AKRP were added (Figure 1E). These results suggest that EMB506 and AKRP together could facilitate substrate binding to thylakoid membranes. Therefore, we renamed EMB506 and AKRP proteins STT1 and STT2, respectively, as they are specifically involved in sorting of cpTat substrates to thylakoid membranes. We next investigated whether the membrane-bound iOE23 was competent for translocation across the cpTat translocation channel into the lumen. As shown in Figure 1F, few mature OE23 (mOE23) was detected when in vitro synthetized iOE23 was incubated with NaBr-treated thylakoid membranes. However, addition of both STT1 and STT2 significantly increased the import efficiency, and most of iOE23 could be processed to the mature form in 20 min. As expected, translocation of iOE23 was blocked when either STT1 or STT2 was absent. These results indicate that STT1 and STT2 may function in a coordinated manner to facilitate substrate targeting to the cpTat receptor complex. Inactivation of STT1 or STT2 results in embryo lethality, consistent with above results that they are not functionally redundant (Garcion et al., 2006Garcion C. Guilleminot J. Kroj T. Parcy F. Giraudat J. Devic M. AKRP and EMB506 are two ankyrin repeat proteins essential for plastid differentiation and plant development in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2006; 48: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To further dissect the roles of the STT proteins, RNAi transgenic lines were generated for the STT1 and STT2 genes. As shown in Figures S1A and S1B, downregulation of STT1 or STT2 led to retarded growth, pale green leaves, as well as to reduced chlorophyll levels and abnormal plastids that lack stacked thylakoid membranes (Figure S1C). These results suggest that STT1 and STT2 play important roles in thylakoid membrane biogenesis during plastid development. To further explore the molecular functions of the STT proteins, we examined the effect of STT1 and STT2 depletion on the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins. Immunoblot analysis showed that cpTat pathway substrates including OE23, OE17, PsaN, and PsbT were most significantly compromised, whereas cpSec pathway substrate OE33, cpSRP pathway substrates Lhcb1 and Lhca3, and spontaneous pathway substrate CF0II were only moderately affected in both RNAi transgenic plants (Figure S1D), indicating that STT1 and STT2 are both critical for the accumulation of the cpTat pathway substrates. In addition, components of the protein import machinery, such as Tic20, and the cpTat translocon, including Hcf106, Tha4, and cpTatC as well as chaperones like Hsp70, were not or only marginally affected in transgenic plants (Figure S1D), ruling out the possibility that the reduction of cpTat pathway substrates was due to impairment of STT1 and STT2 translocation into chloroplasts. We also found that PsaA/B and D1 protein showed remarkable reduction in both RNAi lines. This is consistent with previous reports that deficiencies of cpTat pathway substrates lead to reduced accumulation of photosystem core proteins (Settles et al., 1997Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Sec-independent protein translocation by the maize Hcf106 protein.Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, Motohashi et al., 2001Motohashi R. Nagata N. Ito T. Takahashi S. Hobo T. Yoshida S. Shinozaki K. An essential role of a TatC homologue of a Delta pH- dependent protein transporter in thylakoid membrane formation during chloroplast development in Arabidopsis thaliana.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 10499-10504Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that STT1 and STT2 play critical roles in the stable assembly of cpTat pathway substrates. To further investigate the function of STTs, STT1-STT2 interaction was tested using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in Arabidopsis protoplasts. BiFC assay confirmed a direct interaction between STT1 and STT2 (Figure 2A). Sucrose density gradient sedimentation assays with stromal extracts further suggested the existence of a STT1-STT2 complex in planta (Figure 2B). Taken together, these results led us to explore if STT1 and STT2 could form a ternary complex with substrate for targeting. Signals of radioactive-labeled pOE23 were visualized as a sharp band when in vitro translated radio-labeled precursor OE23 (pOE23) was incubated with the purified STT complex, suggesting that the STT complex could bind to pOE23 in vitro. The same results were obtained when purified proteins were replaced with chloroplast stroma isolated from Arabidopsis (Figure 2C). However, pOE23 was not detected with stroma extract pre-treated with antibodies against STT1 or STT2 (Figure 2C). Taken together, these results indicate that STT1 and STT2 form a complex that facilitates the binding of cpTat pathway substrates in vitro and in vivo. We next examined whether the STT complex recognizes specific regions within cpTat substrates. Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that both STT1 and STT2 harbor an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a C-terminal domain with five ankyrin repeats (Figure S2A). BiFC assays demonstrated that deletion of the ankyrin domain of STT1 and STT2 abolished the interaction between STT1 and STT2, indicating that the ankyrin domain is critical for the STT complex formation (Figure 2A). Moreover, deletion of IDRs of either STT1 or STT2 substantially impacts binding of OE23 to the STT complex as revealed by pull-down assays (Figure 2D). On the other hand, deletion analysis of OE23 revealed that the cpTat transit peptide (TP, residues 1–77) is important for interaction with the STT complex (Figure 2E). In summary, our results suggest that the IDRs of STT1 and STT2 associate with the transit peptide of the cpTat pathway substrates. Binding of the OE23 transit peptide by the STT complex was also investigated by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Because of its hydrophobicity, the OE23 transit peptide was solubilized in the detergent lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG). As shown in Figure 2G, the STT complex was able to bind the LMNG-solubilized synthetic transit peptide of OE23 (KD = 8 μM) at an approximately 1:1 protein: peptide ratio. CpTat pathway substrates possess transit peptides that contain a stromal (STP) and a lumenal targeting peptide (LTP) (Figure 2F). To further dissect the transit peptide recognition activity, several OE23 transit peptide deletions were used for ITC analysis. As shown in Figure 2G, deletion of the STP domain slightly reduces the binding affinity to the STT complex (KD = 10 μM). However, substitution of the RR motif or the hydrophobic residues of the H domain to alanines substantially impacts the binding to the STT complex, with a ∼20-fold and ∼10-fold higher KD, respectively (Figure 2G). Thus, both the RR motif and the H domain in LTP are required for binding to the STT complex. However, the interaction between the LTP of cpSec substrate OE33 and STT complex was not detected (Figure 2G), which highlights the specificity of substrate recognition by STT complex. To understand the molecular basis of STT1 and STT2 action in cpTat substrate recognition and targeting, we undertook a structural analysis of Arabidopsis STT1 and STT2. When STT1 or STT2 are expressed individually, they tend to form heterogeneous aggregates in vitro (Figure S2B). Analysis by gel filtration chromatography revealed that STT1 and STT2 could form a hetero-dimer in the presence of 200 mM NaCl, but tend to form higher-order oligomers in the presence of 50 mM NaCl (Figure 3C). We next crystallized the heteromeric complex in buffer containing 200 mM NaCl. The crystal structure of the STT hetero-dimer complex from Arabidopsis was determined at 2.2 Å resolution (Table S1). Because the IDRs of STT1 and STT2 are highly mobile, residues 40–112 of STT1 and residues 37–231 of STT2 could not be accurately modeled into the electron density. Both the monomer structures of STT1 and STT2 were further characterized as two N-terminal helices (α1 and α2, residues 114–150 in STT1, residues 232–258 in STT2) and five ankyrin repeats (Ank1 to 5, residues 151–311 in STT1; Ank1 to 5, residues 259–419 in STT2) that showed the typical fold of ankyrin repeats with a helix-turn-helix motif. STT1 and STT2 interact with each other in an antiparallel configuration through the N-terminal helices and the ankyrin repeats (Figures 3A and 3B). The STT hetero-dimer is primarily formed by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Overall, the two N-terminal helices and Ank1 repeats of one STT form a unique concave surface that lock Ank4-5 of the other STT, and Ank1-3 from STT1 interact with Ank3-1 of STT2 further strengthening the dimeric organization of the STT complex to form an ellipsoidal core structure (Figures 3A and 3B). An electrostatic surface potential map shows two large electropositive regions within the ellipsoidal structure, one is along the edge of STT1; the other is along the edge of STT2 (Figures 3A and 3B). These charged residues within the electropositive regions are highly conserved in higher plants (Figure S2C). Substitution of the conserved positively charged residues with alanines (SCPCA) did not affect transit peptide binding (Figure S3), but severely prevented STT oligomerization in the low salt buffer (Figure 3C). Moreover, these changes within the ellipsoidal structure severely compromised overall cpTat substrate targeting to receptor complex (Figure 3D). These results indicate that the conserved positively charged residues within the ankyrin domain are critical for STT oligomerization as well as for cpTat substrate targeting. There is no obvious, clearly defined peptide binding cleft on the surface of the ellipsoidal structure (Figures 3A and 3B); indeed, ITC-based titration assays also demonstrated that deletion of the IDRs of either STT1 or STT2 substantially impaired binding of cpTat transit peptide to the STT complex, showing an ∼20-fold and ∼10-fold higher KD, respectively (Figure S3). These results are consistent with the pull-down assay indicating that the binding of the cpTat transit peptide to the STT complex depends on their IDRs. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals several conserved motifs rich in negatively charged and hydrophobic residues within the IDRs of the STTs, including WEEPD (residues 71–85) in STT1 and LVP-W (residues 105–126) in STT2 (Figure S2C). Substitution of the negatively charged residues of WEEPD motif in STT1 or the hydrophobic residues of LVP-W motif in STT2 with alanines remarkably reduced the binding affinity between STT complex and LTP, indicating that these two conserved motifs are essential for binding (Figure S3). Consistent with the ITC assay, substitution mutations within these two motifs also displayed significantly reduced substrate targeting activity (Figure 3D). During the sample preparation for ITC experiments, we found that upon mixing STT complex and LTP of OE23 above certain concentrations, the solution becomes very rapidly opalescent. This observation is indicative of liquid-liquid phase separation, a characteristic of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions and the capacity for multivalence (Han et al., 2012Han T.W.

To test this further, we examined the STT complex and OE23 LTP mixture with 1:1 ratio by light microscopy and observed numerous small spherical droplets with various diameters shortly after mixing, a phenomenon characteristic of a liquid-to-liquid phase separation (Figure 4A). In addition, this induced phase separation of the STT complex was sharply concentration-dependent and occurred when the concentration of STT and LTP reaches 2.5 μM (Figure 4A). Previous studies together with our data have shown that Tat translocon components including TorD, NapD, DmsD, cpTatC/Hcf106, and STTs may bind the Tat substrate with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Maillard et al., 2007Maillard J.

Considering that the concentration of substrate transported in vivo may be lower than that of the STTs, we also checked whether low concentrations of cpTat substrate could induce the phase separation of STTs. Our results showed that 0.5 μM in vitro-translated OE23 precursor could also induce the STTs (2.5 μM) phase separation (Figure 4B). In contrast, when the STT complex was mixed with the LTP of the cpSec substrate OE33 at 50 μM, the solution remained clear (Figure 4A). These results suggest that the cpTat signal peptide may specifically induce a phase separation of the STT complex in vitro. To analyze the molecular composition of the condensed liquid phase, we mixed labeled STT complex tagged with a fluorescent label (STT1-GFP and STT2-mCherry) with OE23 LTP. We found that STT1-GFP and STT2-mCherry were located within the same droplets (Figure 4C). Next, we performed a sedimentation assay to separate the condensed liquid phase from the bulk aqueous solutions by centrifugation and assessed protein components in each fraction (Figure 4D). For the 1:1 molar ratio of STT complex and OE23 transit peptide at 20 μM concentration, approximately half of STT1-GFP, STT2-mCherry, and OE23 LTP were recovered in the condensed liquid phase, indicating that the drops contain STT1, STT2, and OE23 LTP (Figure 4D). Furthermore, STT1-GFP, STT2-mCherry, and OE23 LTP containing small liquid droplets were able to fuse into larger ones (Figure 4C). Moreover, experiments of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) showed that the fluorescence was efficiently recovered in a few minutes when bleaching was performed after the initiation of phase separation (Figure 4E). Thus, STT complex and OE23 LTP are mobile within the liquid droplets and constantly exchange between droplets and the surrounding aqueous solution. Next, we examined the role of the STT1, STT2, and LTP of OE23 interactions in the phase transition of the complex. First, although the IDRs itself is a low-complexity region, incubation of STT1 or STT2 individually with LTP did not form spherical droplets, but produced only irregular aggregates, indicating that the prerequisite for the occurrence of liquid-liquid phase separation is the formation of STT oligomers (Figure S4A). Moreover, when the residues of electropositive regions within the ellipsoidal structure of individual STT1 or STT2 were changed to alanines to inhibit the formation of STT oligomers, the resulting STT mutant complex could only form smaller droplets with LTP peptide. When all the conserved positive residues of the STT electropositive regions were mutated, the resulting STT mutant complex could not induce phase transition after mixing with LTP (Figure S4A), consistent with the implication that formation of"

Upon fertilization, this process is potently reversed, which is essential for parental genome reprogramming and subsequent activation; however, it remains poorly understood how this fundamental process is initiated and regulated. Here, we report that the previously characterized splicing kinase SRPK1 initiates this life-beginning event by catalyzing site-specific phosphorylation of protamine, thereby triggering protamine-to-histone exchange in the fertilized oocyte. Interestingly, protamine undergoes a DNA-dependent phase transition to gel-like condensates and SRPK1-mediated phosphorylation likely helps open up such structures to enhance protamine dismissal by nucleoplasmin (NPM2) and enable the recruitment of HIRA for H3.3 deposition. Remarkably, genome-wide assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis reveals that selective chromatin accessibility in both sperm and MII oocytes is largely erased in early pronuclei in a protamine phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting that SRPK1-catalyzed phosphorylation initiates a highly synchronized reorganization program in both parental genomes."

Rational behavior often requires predicting latent states from sensory observations. Since latent variables cannot be directly observed, and since the utility of actions depends on the status of latent variables in the future, we must use statistical regularities in space and in time to predict them. There is a large body of studies that not only demonstrate that humans exploit regularities in feature space (Knill and Pouget, 2004Knill D.C. Pouget A.

In contrast, we know relatively little about how physical laws that govern the temporal dynamics of inputs are internalized and used to guide time-evolving beliefs in the absence of reliable observations (Lee et al., 2014Lee D.D.

We refer to these subjective beliefs about time-varying latent states as belief dynamics. The reasons for limited progress in understanding belief dynamics are twofold. First, psychophysics continues to be dominated by experimental paradigms in which actions are discrete (e.g., binary choice) and sporadic (e.g., at the end of the trial). In contrast, continuous tasks (Bonnen et al., 2015Bonnen K. Burge J. Yates J. Pillow J. Cormack L.K. Continuous psychophysics: target-tracking to measure visual sensitivity.J. Vis. 2015; 15: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, Huk et al., 2018Huk A. Bonnen K. He B.J.

Second, although theoretical techniques to infer latent beliefs from actions are slowly becoming available (Kumar et al., 2019Kumar A. Wu Z. Pitkow X. Schrater P. Belief dynamics extraction.arXiv. 2019; (1902.00673)https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00673Google Scholar, Reddy et al., 2018Reddy S. Dragan A.D. Levine S. Where do you think you’re going?

Rational thoughts in neural codes.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/765867Crossref Google Scholar), they have yet to be successfully applied to settings in which state and action spaces are both continuous. Consequently, principled ways to reliably uncover subjects’ belief dynamics from natural behavior are still lacking. Meanwhile, a practical way to overcome this hurdle would be by covertly “measuring” those beliefs. One candidate tool to accomplish this is eye tracking (Spivey, 2007Spivey M. The Continuity of Mind. Oxford University Press, 2007Google Scholar). Saccadic eye movements have previously been used to understand mental processes underlying a wide variety of abstract tasks such as language comprehension (Tanenhaus et al., 1995Tanenhaus M.K.

Representation of a perceptual decision in developing oculomotor commands.Nature. 2000; 404: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), visual search (Zhang et al., 2018Zhang M. Feng J. Lim J.H. Zhao Q. Kreiman G. What am I searching for?.arXiv. 2018; (1807.11926)https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11926Google Scholar), and even random number generation (Loetscher et al., 2010Loetscher T.

Furthermore, it has recently been argued that smooth-pursuit eye movements may be influenced by short-term memory (Deravet et al., 2018Deravet N. Blohm G. de Xivry J.O. Lefèvre P. Weighted integration of short-term memory and sensory signals in the oculomotor system.J. Vis. 2018; 18: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, Orban de Xivry et al., 2013Orban de Xivry J.-J. Coppe S. Blohm G. Lefèvre P. Kalman filtering naturally accounts for visually guided and predictive smooth pursuit dynamics.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 17301-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By formulating oculomotor pursuit to transiently occluded moving targets as an active inference process, these eye movements have been used to infer subjects’ internal beliefs (Adams et al., 2015Adams R.A. Aponte E. Marshall L. Friston K.J. Active inference and oculomotor pursuit: the dynamic causal modelling of eye movements.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2015; 242: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We wanted to know whether eye movements also reflect belief dynamics for extended periods of time under more naturalistic conditions. To test this, we created a virtual environment with an unstructured ground plane on which subjects steered to a transiently cued target location. To successfully perform the task, subjects had to first infer their own movements based on the sparse optic flow cues generated while steering and then integrate them over time to estimate the relative target location. Although the target appears briefly at the beginning of the trial, the location of the target relative to the subject becomes latent as soon as they start steering, because thereafter, the relative location is not directly observed, only inferred by discounting one’s own displacements. This task differs from traditional paradigms used to study latent state inference in two important ways that make it both challenging and better suited to understanding belief dynamics in the real world. First, in contrast to tasks in which latent states remain unchanged throughout the trial, such as right or left in a random-dot motion (Britten et al., 1992Britten K.H. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Movshon J.A. The analysis of visual motion: a comparison of neuronal and psychophysical performance.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4745-4765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or heading-discrimination task (Britten, 2008Britten K.H. Mechanisms of self-motion perception.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 389-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), here, the latent state dynamically varies over the course of each trial, under the subject’s control. Second, unlike tasks that use pulsatile evidence and discrete numbers of latent states, such as an auditory-clicks (Brunton et al., 2013Brunton B.W. Botvinick M.M. Brody C.D. Rats and humans can optimally accumulate evidence for decision-making.Science. 2013; 340: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) or accumulating-towers task (Pinto et al., 2018Pinto L. Koay S.A. Engelhard B. Yoon A.M. Deverett B. Thiberge S.Y. Witten I.B. Tank D.W. Brody C.D. An accumulation-of-evidence task using visual pulses for mice navigating in virtual reality.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2018; 12: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), both the sensory input (self-motion) and latent states (relative target position) are continuous valued. To test whether eye movements were informative regarding subjective beliefs about those time-varying, continuous-valued latent states, we recorded the gaze behavior of humans and rhesus macaques while they performed this task. Parallel experiments in the two species allowed us to test whether the eye movements were evolutionarily conserved. We found that both humans and monkeys tend to follow the location of the unseen target with their gaze until they reach it, and their success in tracking the target over time predicted their final behavioral accuracy. These findings suggest that gaze dynamics reflect internal beliefs and could help shed light on the computations that transform visual perception to action in naturalistic settings. Monkeys and humans performed a visual navigation task in which they used a joystick to steer to a transiently cued target location in a three-dimensional virtual reality (VR) environment without allocentric reference cues (i.e., stable landmarks) (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Individual visual elements comprising the ground plane were transient and could not be used as landmarks. At the beginning of each trial, a circular target blinked briefly at a random location within the field of view on the ground plane and then disappeared. The joystick controlled forward and angular velocities, allowing subjects to steer freely in two dimensions (Figure 1B). The subjects’ goal was to steer toward the target and stop when they believed their position fell within a circular reward zone centered on the target. They received feedback about their performance at the end of each trial. Monkeys were first trained extensively using a staircase procedure (see STAR Methods) until their performance stopped improving. Here, we will focus only on their post-training behavior. At this point, the radius of the reward zone was fixed across trials (see STAR Methods) and they received juice reward at the end of the trial for correctly stopping within this zone (Figure 1C). In contrast, human subjects received no prior training on this task. Instead, we used an adaptive feedback scheme in which the radius of the reward zone was dynamically scaled using a staircase procedure to match individual subjects’ abilities (Figure S1A; see STAR Methods). In practice, it took less than 50 trials for the performance of humans to stabilize (Figure S1B). Therefore, we ignored the first 50 trials collected from human subjects and focused our analyses on the remaining data. Target locations were uniformly distributed at random over the ground plane area within the subject’s field of view (Figure 1D, left). The stimulus was nearly identical for both species except for minor details such as the range of target distances and the duration for which the target was visible (see STAR Methods). All subjects were head-fixed, and we recorded each subject’s movement trajectory (Figure 1D, middle) as well as eye position (Figure 1D, right) throughout each trial. Figure 1E shows the performance of the monkeys in this task. Both radial distance (Figure 1E, left) and angular eccentricity (Figure 1E, right) of the monkeys’ responses (stopping location) were highly correlated with the target location across trials (n=3 monkeys, Pearson’s r± standard deviation, radial distance: 0.72±0.1, angle: 0.84±0.1), suggesting that their behavior was appropriate for the task. To test whether their performance was accurate, we regressed their responses against target locations. The slope of the regression was close to unity both for radial distance (mean ± standard deviation =0.92±0.06) and angle (0.98±0.1), suggesting that the monkeys were nearly unbiased (Figure 1F, green). We did notice modest undershooting for distant targets, an effect that is likely due to growing position uncertainty described in previous work (Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2018aLakshminarasimhan K.J. Petsalis M. Park H. DeAngelis G.C. Pitkow X. Angelaki D.E. A dynamic bayesian observer model reveals origins of bias in visual path integration.Neuron. 2018; 99: 194-206.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We showed previously that humans are systematically biased when performing this task without feedback (Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2018aLakshminarasimhan K.J. Petsalis M. Park H. DeAngelis G.C. Pitkow X. Angelaki D.E. A dynamic bayesian observer model reveals origins of bias in visual path integration.Neuron. 2018; 99: 194-206.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Consistent with those findings, human subjects overshot the target in an initial block of trials in which no feedback was provided (Figure S1C; n=5, mean slope ±standard deviation, radial distance: 1.21±0.2, angle: 1.78±0.3) to a degree that was proportional to target distance. With feedback, however, the same subjects quickly adapted their responses to produce nearly unbiased performance (Figure 1F, purple; see Figure S1D for individual trials; mean slope ± standard deviation, radial distance: 0.95±0.1, angle: 1.15±0.2). Notably, this improvement in performance was maintained in a final block of trials in which feedback was withheld (Figures S1E and S1F; radial distance: 1.03±0.15, angle: 1.2±0.2), suggesting that learning of this task was stable. To be consistent with monkey data, we only consider human subjects’ data collected during the block of trials with feedback in the remainder of this work. We wanted to know whether humans and monkeys had comparable accuracies. Because we used a slightly larger range of target distances for humans (see STAR Methods), travel durations were longer (median travel time ± interquartile range [IQR]: monkeys: 1.9±0.8s, humans: 2.7±0.6s). Consequently, we could not directly compare the mean error magnitude of the subjects as it ignores differences in task difficulty. Instead, we used an approach that is conceptually similar to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to objectively compare the performance of monkeys and human subjects on a common scale. For each subject, we constructed a “psychometric function” by computing reward probability as a function of hypothetical reward window size (Figure 1G; see STAR Methods). By plotting the true psychometric function against one obtained by shuffling target locations across trials, we obtain the subject’s ROC curve. Chance-level performance would correspond to an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.5, while perfectly accurate responses (zero error) will yield an AUC of one. The AUCs for both monkey and human subjects were quite large and statistically indistinguishable (mean ± standard deviation, monkeys: 0.85±0.03, humans: 0.84±0.05; t test: p=0.41), suggesting that they performed comparably. Although it is possible, in principle, to avoid integrating optic flow by learning the precise sensorimotor transformation implemented by the joystick controller, we previously showed that the variability of human subjects is greatly affected by removing optic flow cues (Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2018aLakshminarasimhan K.J. Petsalis M. Park H. DeAngelis G.C. Pitkow X. Angelaki D.E. A dynamic bayesian observer model reveals origins of bias in visual path integration.Neuron. 2018; 99: 194-206.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Figure S1G). Likewise, monkeys rapidly adapt their actions in response to gain changes of the joystick controller (Figure S1H). This suggests that both monkeys and humans use optic flow to perform this task. To understand the role of eye movements, we recorded the position of the subjects’ eyes while they performed the task. Figure 2A shows the vertical and horizontal eye positions of one monkey during an example trial. On this trial, we noticed saccades (eye movements exceeding 200°/s) before the target was turned off (henceforth called start of the trial) and around the time when the monkey stopped moving (end of steering), but not in between. This pattern was evident across trials, as seen in the trial-averaged density of saccades (Figure 2B). Across all datasets from monkeys, the average frequency of saccades during the trial was significantly smaller than that during the inter-trial interval (mean saccade rate ± standard deviation, during trials: 0.5±0.3 Hz, between trials: 0.9±0.5 Hz; paired t test: p=0.02). We noticed a similar tendency among human subjects, although the comparison was not statistically significant (Figure S2A; during trials: 0.8±0.5 Hz, between trials: 1.4±1 Hz; p=0.11). Moreover, the velocity of eye movements during steering was generally low, with magnitudes well below 20°/s both in monkeys (Figure 2C; mean ± standard deviation: 16.2 ± 2.1°/s) and in humans (Figure S2B; 11.4 ± 3.2°/s). Because saccades were mostly confined to periods when the animal was not actively steering and subjects appeared to make slowly varying eye movements while steering, we asked whether they may be continuously “tracking” the (invisible) target with their eyes while they navigated to it. Note that as one steers toward the target location, the target becomes progressively less eccentric and moves downward in the visual field. Therefore, if subjects’ eyes were to track the target, the magnitude of lateral version would tend toward zero and the eye elevation would become more negative with time (Figure S2C). To quantitatively test whether subjects tracked the target, we first generated ground truth theoretical predictions for the binocular position of their eyes during each trial, assuming that they maintained fixation at the center of the target throughout the trial (Figure S2D; STAR Methods, (1.1), (1.2)). Note that at each moment in time, the predicted eye position depends only the relative target position at that moment regardless of whether the subject accurately stopped on target, but we will examine the relationship to the latter in the next section. We then compared this prediction against the observed eye position of the subject by expressing both quantities in terms of three standard components: lateral version, elevation, and vergence (Figure S2E; see STAR Methods). We expect subjects’ eyes to be drawn to the target when it appears on the screen. Indeed, the model predictions were highly correlated with the measured values of lateral version (Figure 2D, left; and Figure S3A, left; Pearson’s r± standard deviation, monkeys: 0.91±0.1, humans: 0.85±0.1) as well as elevation (Figure 2D, right; and Figure S3A, right; monkeys: 0.60±0.2, humans:0.42±0.2) at the beginning of the trial. The somewhat lower correlations for the latter are understandable, because it is difficult to precisely fixate at the elevations for distant targets since they subtend a smaller visual angle. Next, we examined the time course of eye movements during the trial and found a striking qualitative correspondence to the predicted dynamics (Figure 2E and S3B); as the trial progressed, lateral version became increasingly more concentrated around zero (Figure S3C, left) while eye elevation was significantly lower (Figure S3C, right). The correlation between predicted and observed values remained significantly greater than zero throughout the trial for both components (Figure S3D). This is quite remarkable, because the target appeared only transiently at the beginning of the trial. On the other hand, the correspondence between predicted and observed vergence was less clear. Performing this comparison for our task was challenging, because ∼90% of the full range of vergence angles is known to occur within gaze distances <1 m (Howard, 2012Howard I.P. Vergence eye movements.in: Perceiving in Depth. Oxford University Press, 2012: 475-548Crossref Google Scholar), and the predicted change in vergence is negligible for gaze distances >2 m (Figure S2E, bottom right). Only two of the monkeys exhibited vergence values that weakly correlated with the predictions at trial onset (Figure S3A) and a tendency to make convergent eye movements as they approached the target (Figure S3B), an effect that was also absent in human subjects (Figures S3B–S3D). It is possible that this inconsistency is due to the previously documented difficulty in executing voluntary vergence movements to imagined moving targets (Erkelens et al., 1989Erkelens C.J. Van der Steen J. Steinman R.M. Collewijn H. Ocular vergence under natural conditions. I. Continuous changes of target distance along the median plane.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1989; 236: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This difficulty is likely exacerbated in VR, where vergence eye movements must be executed without changing accommodation to maintain a clear retinal image of onscreen objects (Hoffman et al., 2008Hoffman D.M. Girshick A.R. Akeley K. Banks M.S. Vergence-accommodation conflicts hinder visual performance and cause visual fatigue.J. Vis. 2008; 8: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, Shibata et al., 2011Shibata T. Kim J. Hoffman D.M. Banks M.S. The zone of comfort: predicting visual discomfort with stereo displays.J. Vis. 2011; 11: 11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we did not consider the vergence component for further analyses. To quantify how well subject’s eyes tracked the target, we expressed the eye position as a two-dimensional vector comprised of lateral version and elevation and computed a target-tracking index. Specifically, this quantity was given by the square root of the fraction of variance in the observed eye position that was explained by the prediction (STAR Methods, Equation 2). An index of one implies that the subject consistently looked at the center of the (invisible) target while steering toward it, while zero denotes lack of correspondence between target and gaze locations. The target-tracking index was quite high at trial onset (during the first 500 ms) when the target had just disappeared (Figure 2F; mean ± standard deviation, monkeys: 0.73±0.05, humans: 0.71±0.05). Although this slowly dropped during the trial, the index at the end of the trial (during the last 500 ms) remained well above zero (Figure 2G; mean ± standard deviation, monkeys: 0.35±0.1, humans: 0.18±0.05), implying that subjects tend to maintain gaze at the target location while they steer toward it. To estimate this timescale of the correlation between gaze and target location, we analyzed the cross-correlogram between them and found that subjects’ eye positions did not systematically lead or lag the predictions based on the relative target location (Figure S4A). This suggests that eye movements reflect the current relative target position rather than predict its future value (although the computations used to estimate it could still be predictive). The tracking index quantifies how subjects’ dynamical state (relative target position) is encoded in their continuous-valued eye position while they navigate toward the target. However, recent work has highlighted the importance of discrete saccadic eye movements in mediating flow-tracking behavior of humans and primates (Knöll et al., 2018Knöll J. Pillow J.W. Huk A.C. Lawful tracking of visual motion in humans, macaques, and marmosets in a naturalistic, continuous, and untrained behavioral context.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115: E10486-E10494Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to know whether saccades aided the target-tracking behavior of our subjects. To test this, we first compared the distribution of saccade amplitudes during three non-overlapping epochs of the experiment: inter-trial periods when saccades tend to be exploratory, target-presentation phase when saccades are guided by the external stimulus, and the ensuing task phase when subjects steered using optic flow (Figure 3A). We found that across monkeys, the amplitude of saccades was much lower during the task phase than during other epochs (Figure 3B; mean ± SE: inter-trial, 10.2 ± 1.6°; target-presentation, 14.4 ± 2.2°; task phase, 7.1 ± 1.2°), suggesting that saccades made while steering were qualitatively different from saccades made at other times. To directly test whether those saccades served to correct errors in target tracking, we computed a saccade-triggered average of the target-tracking error and found that this error dropped significantly (peak decrease of 2.4 ± 0.4°; p < 10−10, t test) shortly after saccade onset (Figure 3C). Following Knöll et al., 2018Knöll J. Pillow J.W. Huk A.C. Lawful tracking of visual motion in humans, macaques, and marmosets in a naturalistic, continuous, and untrained behavioral context.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115: E10486-E10494Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, we used lagged regression analysis to determine the precise relationship between saccade amplitude and the dynamics of target-tracking error (STAR Methods). The amplitude of both vertical and horizontal components of the saccade were influenced by tracking error during the previous 200 ms, suggesting that these saccades were indeed made toward the target (Figure 3D). Moreover, the regression kernels were biphasic, implying that the saccades overcompensated for the tracking errors. Finally, if these saccades were corrective, they should depend on the subjects’ internal estimate of the target location, making them increasingly unreliable over time due to the buildup of uncertainty. Indeed, the strength of the regression kernel was weaker for later saccades (Figure 3E; peak-to-peak difference in weights for vertical component: first saccade, 0.44±0.1; third, 0.20±0.15; horizontal component: first saccade, 1.5±0.4; third, 0.15±0.2), thereby signaling a drop in saccadic precision over time. This suggests that these saccades were not stereotyped reflexive responses but were dynamically modulated by ongoing cognitive computations analogous to “catch-up” saccades observed during smooth pursuit of visible targets (Daye et al., 2014Daye P.M.

https://openalex.org/W2773088207,"Cellular bioenergetic failure caused by mitochondrial dysfunction is a key process of alveolar epithelial injury during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) act as cellular oxygen sensors, and their inhibition activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), resulting in enhanced cellular glycolytic activity, which could compensate for impaired mitochondrial function and protect alveolar epithelial cells from ARDS. Here, we evaluated the effects of pharmacological PHD inhibition with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on alveolar epithelial cell injury using in vitro and in vivo ARDS models. We established an in vitro model of alveolar epithelial injury mimicking ARDS by adding isolated neutrophils and LPS to cultured MLE12 alveolar epithelial cells. DMOG treatment protected MLE12 cells from neutrophil-LPS-induced ATP decline and cell death. Knockdown of HIF-1α or inhibition of glycolysis abolished the protective effect of DMOG, suggesting that it was exerted by HIF-1-dependent enhancement of glycolysis. Additionally, intratracheal DMOG administration to mice protected the alveolar epithelial barrier and improved arterial oxygenation, preventing ATP decline during LPS-induced lung injury. In summary, enhancement of glycolysis by PHD inhibition is a potential therapeutic approach for ARDS, protecting alveolar epithelial cells from bioenergetic failure and cell death.— Tojo, K., Tamada, N., Nagamine, Y., Yazawa, T., Ota, S., Goto, T.

https://openalex.org/W3012461324,"Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms, including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single mRNA transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work, we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during its biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results indicate that cotranslational folding of this viral protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent polypeptide chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding or binding events may also stimulate PRF."
https://openalex.org/W3011255699,"Rice production in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam (MRD) is endangered by sea-level rise and an associated increase in the incidence of salinity intrusion. This paper examines the diffusion of salt tolerant rice varieties in the MRD that were promoted through Consortium for Unfavorable Rice Environments (CURE) activities. Factors associated with adoption of CURE-related varieties are estimated using a random utilty model and a dataset of 800 farm households with rice fields in salinity prone areas of the MRD. Results suggest that there has been widespread adoption of CURE-related varieties in salinity-prone areas. Further, multivariate analysis reveals that environment and location characteristics, rather than household characteristics, are the most important determinants of adoption. In particular, CURE-related varieties are more likely to be adopted in high-salinity-risk areas that are not protected by salinity barrier gates. Neighbhors’ adoption decisions also strongly influence household decisions to adopt CURE-related varieties. The contracting of mechanization, particularly for land preparation and harvest, requires the coordination of village households in timing of planting, harvest and varietal duration. This coordination appears to extend to choice of CURE-related varieties. Finally, CURE-related varieties and other varieties generate similar net revenues in a year with low salinity exposure, suggesting that CURE-related varieties are a low-cost insurance policy against salinity inundation in high risk areas. Combined, these results highlight the need to address complex factors beyond current economic profits, like environment, community choices, and risk mitigation, when designing technologies and policies that support farmer adaptation to climatic change."
https://openalex.org/W3011620560,"The APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) gene family has been shown to play a crucial role in plant growth and development, stress responses and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Nevertheless, little is known about the gene family in ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer), an important medicinal herb in Asia and North America. Here, we report the systematic analysis of the gene family in ginseng using several transcriptomic databases. A total of 189 putative AP2/ERF genes, defined as PgERF001 through PgERF189, were identified and these PgERF genes were spliced into 397 transcripts. The 93 PgERF genes that have complete AP2 domains in open reading frame were classified into five subfamilies, DREB, ERF, AP2, RAV and Soloist. The DREB subfamily and ERF subfamily were further clustered into four and six groups, respectively, compared to the 12 groups of these subfamilies found in Arabidopsis thaliana. Gene ontology categorized these 397 transcripts of the 189 PgERF genes into eight functional subcategories, suggesting their functional differentiation, and they have been especially enriched for the subcategory of nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity. The expression activity and networks of the 397 PgERF transcripts have substantially diversified across tissues, developmental stages and genotypes. The expressions of the PgERF genes also significantly varied, when ginseng was subjected to cold stress, as tested using six PgERF genes, PgERF073, PgERF079, PgERF110, PgERF115, PgERF120 and PgERF128, randomly selected from the DREB subfamily. This result suggests that the DREB subfamily genes play an important role in plant response to cold stress. Finally, we studied the responses of the PgERF genes to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). We found that 288 (72.5%) of the 397 PgERF gene transcripts responded to the MeJA treatment, with 136 up-regulated and 152 down-regulated, indicating that most members of the PgERF gene family are responsive to MeJA. These results, therefore, provide new resources and knowledge necessary for family-wide functional analysis of the PgERF genes in ginseng and related species."

https://openalex.org/W3012110813,"A key event in the development of both major forms of diabetes is the loss of functional pancreatic islet β-cell mass. Strategies aimed at enhancing β-cell regeneration have long been pursued, but methods for reliably inducing human β-cell proliferation with full retention of key functions such as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) are still very limited. We have previously reported that overexpression of the homeobox transcription factor NKX6.1 stimulates β-cell proliferation, while also enhancing GSIS and providing protection against β-cell cytotoxicity through induction of the VGF prohormone. We developed an NKX6.1 pathway screen by stably transfecting 832/13 rat insulinoma cells with a VGF promoter-luciferase reporter construct, using the resultant cell line to screen a 630,000 compound chemical library. We isolated three compounds with consistent effects to stimulate human islet cell proliferation, but not expression of NKX6.1 or VGF, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action. Further studies of the most potent of these compounds, GNF-9228, revealed that it selectively activates human β-cell relative to α-cell proliferation and has no effect on δ-cell replication. In addition, pre-treatment, but not short term exposure of human islets to GNF-9228 enhances GSIS. GNF-9228 also protects 832/13 insulinoma cells against ER stress- and inflammatory cytokine-induced cytotoxicity. GNF-9228 stimulates proliferation via a mechanism distinct from recently emergent DYRK1A inhibitors, as it is unaffected by DYRK1A overexpression and does not activate NFAT translocation. In conclusion, we have identified a small molecule with pleiotropic positive effects on islet biology, including stimulation of human β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion, and protection against multiple agents of cytotoxic stress."

Controls were selected stratified on risk scores for overweight in a propensity score framework. Maternal serum levels were analyzed in biobanked samples collected by routine around gestational week 14. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios between quartiles of maternal serum levels and child overweight at age 4.There were no consistent monotonic exposure-response relationships. We found some significant odds ratios in specific quartiles but these were regarded as spurious findings. The absence of an effect was consistent over risk strata.We did not find evidence of an association between maternal serum levels of PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA in early pregnancy and child overweight at age 4. The level of other risk factors for overweight did not affect children's susceptibility to prenatal PFAS exposure."

Here, we investigated whether innate immunity cells in patients with FH have a specific proinflammatory phenotype that is distinct from that of cells in normal participants. To this end, miR-505-3p-a microRNA related to chronic inflammation-and its target genes were investigated in monocyte-derived macrophages (MACs) of patients with FH (FH-MACs) and non-FH controls (co-MACs). On the basis of the profiler PCR array analysis of agomiR-505-3p-transfected MACs, we identified the chemokine receptors, CCR3, CCR4, and CXCR1, as genes that are regulated by miR-505-3p via the transcription factor, RUNX1. miR-505-3p was significantly down-regulated, whereas CCR3, CCR4, CXCR, and RUNX1 were increased in FH-MAC compared with co-MAC, with the increase being more evident in the proinflammatory M1-like FH-MAC. Chemokine receptor levels were unrelated to LDL plasma levels at entry, but correlated with age in patients with FH, not in controls. In summary, we demonstrate for first time to our knowledge that MACs from FH-MACs have an inflammatory phenotype that is characterized by the up-regulation of CCR3, CCR4, and CXCR1 under the control of miR-505-3p.

More extensive imaging or cerebrospinal fluid studies represent significant barriers due to cost and burden. We combined functional connectivity and graph theoretical measures, derived from resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, with computerized cognitive testing to identify differences between persons with MCI and healthy controls based on a sample of community-dwelling African American elders. We found a significant decrease in functional connectivity and a less integrated graph topology in persons with MCI. A combination of functional connectivity, topological and cognition measurements is powerful for prediction of MCI and combined measures are clearly more effective for prediction than using a single approach. Specifically, by combining cognition features with functional connectivity and topological features the prediction improved compared with the classification using features from single cognitive or EEG domains, with an accuracy of 86.5%, compared with the accuracy of 77.5% of the best single approach. Community-dwelling African American elders find EEG and computerized testing acceptable and results are promising in terms of differentiating between healthy controls and persons with MCI living in the community."
https://openalex.org/W2769916510,"The human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)–encoded channel hERG undergoes N-linked glycosylation at position 598, which is located in the unusually long S5-pore linker of the channel. In other work we have demonstrated that hERG is uniquely susceptible to proteolytic cleavage at the S5-pore linker by proteinase K (PK) and calpain (CAPN). The scorpion toxin BeKm-1, which binds to the S5-pore linker of hERG, protects hERG from such cleavage. In the present study, our data revealed that, compared with normal glycosylated hERG channels, nonglycosylated hERG channels were significantly more susceptible to cleavage by extracellular PK. Furthermore, the protective effect of BeKm-1 on hERG from PK-cleavage was lost when glycosylation of hERG was inhibited. The inactivation-deficient mutant hERG channels S620T and S631A were resistant to PK cleavage, and inhibition of glycosylation rendered both mutants susceptible to PK cleavage. Compared with normal glycosylated channels, nonglycosylated hERG channels were also more susceptible to cleavage mediated by CAPN, which was present in the medium of human embryonic kidney cells under normal culture conditions. Inhibition of CAPN resulted in an increase of nonglycosylated hERG current. In summary, our results revealed that N-linked glycosylation protects hERG against protease-mediated degradation and thus contributes to hERG channel stability on the plasma membrane.— Lamothe, S.

Here, we show that kindlin-2 maintains spindle integrity in mitotic human cells. The human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line expresses only kindlin-2, and we found that when SH-SY5Y cells are depleted of kindlin-2, they exhibit pronounced spindle abnormalities and delayed mitosis. Of note, acetylation of α-tubulin, which maintains microtubule flexibility and stability, was diminished in the kindlin-2–depleted cells.

We also provide evidence that prolonged hypoxia down-regulates kindlin-2 expression, leading to spindle abnormalities not only in the SH-SY5Y cell line, but also cell lines derived from colon and breast tissues.

https://openalex.org/W3012017133,"Purpose Image texture is increasingly used to discriminate tissues and lesions in PET/CT. For quantification or in computer-aided diagnosis, textural feature analysis must produce robust and comparable values. Because statistical feature values depend on image count statistics, we investigated in depth the stability of Haralick features values as functions of acquisition duration, and for common image resolutions and reconstructions. Methods A homogeneous cylindrical phantom containing 9.6 kBq/ml Ge-68 was repeatedly imaged on a Siemens Biograph mCT, with acquisition durations ranging from three seconds to three hours. Images with 1.5, 2, and 4 mm isometrically spaced voxels were reconstructed with filtered back-projection (FBP), ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM), and the Siemens TrueX algorithm. We analysed Haralick features derived from differently quantized (3 to 8-bit) grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs) as functions of exposure E, which we defined as the product of activity concentration in a volume of interest (VOI) and acquisition duration. The VOI was a 50 mm wide cube at the centre of the phantom. Feature stability was defined for df/dE → 0. Results The most stable feature values occurred in low resolution FBPs, whereas some feature values from 1.5 mm TrueX reconstructions ranged over two orders of magnitude. Within the same reconstructions, most feature value-exposure curves reached stable plateaus at similar exposures, regardless of GLCM quantization. With 8-bit GLCM, median time to stability was 16 s and 22 s for FBPs, 18 s and 125 s for OSEM, and 23 s, 45 s, and 76 s for PSF reconstructions, with longer durations for higher resolutions. Stable exposures coincided in OSEM and TrueX reconstructions with image noise distributions converging to a Gaussian. In FBP, the occurrence of stable values coincided the disappearance of negatives image values in the VOI. Conclusions Haralick feature values depend strongly on exposure, but invariance exists within defined domains of exposure. Here, we present an easily replicable procedure to identify said stable exposure domains, where image noise does not substantially add to textural feature values. Only by imaging at predetermined feature-invariant exposure levels and by adjusting exposure to expected activity concentrations, can textural features have a quantitative use in PET/CT. The necessary exposure levels are attainable by modern PET/CT systems in clinical routine."
https://openalex.org/W3011870297,"Although there is a consensus about the evolutionary drivers of animal migration, considerable work is necessary to identify the mechanisms that underlie the great variety of strategies observed in nature. The study of differential migration offers unique opportunities to identify such mechanisms and allows comparisons of the costs and benefits of migration. The purpose of this study was to compare the characteristics of short and long-distance migrations, and fitness consequences, in a long-lived seabird species. We combined demographic monitoring (survival, phenology, hatching success) of 58 Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) breeding on Bonaventure Island (Canada) and biologging technology (Global Location Sensor or GLS loggers) to estimate activity and energy budgets during the non-breeding period for three different migration strategies: to the Gulf of Mexico (GM), southeast (SE) or northeast (NE) Atlantic coast of the U.S. Survival, timing of arrival at the colony and hatching success are similar for short (NE, SE) and long-distance (GM) migrants. Despite similar fitness consequences, we found, as expected, that the overall energetic cost of migration is higher for long-distance migrants, although the daily cost during migration was similar between strategies. In contrast, daily maintenance and thermoregulation costs were lower for GM migrants in winter, where sea-surface temperature of the GM is 4-7o C warmer than SE and NE. In addition, GM migrants tend to fly 30 min less per day in their wintering area than other migrants. Considering lower foraging effort and lower thermoregulation costs during winter for long-distance migrants, this suggests that the energetic benefits during the winter of foraging in the GM outweigh any negative consequences of the longer-distance migration. These results support the notion that the costs and benefits of short and long-distance migration is broadly equal on an annual basis, i.e. there are no apparent carry-over effects in this long-lived bird species, probably because of the favourable conditions in the furthest wintering area."

Fourteen schools were sampled to represent different school types. We used qualitative methods: 14 key Informant interviews (teachers), six focus group discussions (parents), and 14 observations of school environments. Thematic analysis was performed.PA was not prioritized at most schools for two primary reasons: 1) there was a general lack of understanding of the importance of PA; and 2) physical education classes did not contribute to grades. Little time and resources were allotted for physical education classes because little priority was given to PA by school authorities. Outside school, lack of adequate safe open spaces undermined access to PA. Further, there were social barriers to PA including lack of parental support due to concerns about tiredness and injury and the perception that PA was detrimental to academic achievement. Many parents chose screen-based activities for children over PA.Despite policies that mandate PA, PA lost out to school and parental priorities for academic achievement. Parental concerns about tiredness, injury and safe spaces impeded children's access to PA outside of school. Steps should be taken to enforce existing policies that mandate effective PA for school children, and parents and teachers should be educated about the need for and benefits of PA."

However, these effects are challenging to quantify, particularly for mobile predators in marine ecosystems. To advance this field of research, here we used baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVs) to assess how the behavior of mobile fish species off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, was affected by exposure to large sharks. We categorized sites into three levels of differential shark predation exposure (white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias) and quantified the relative abundance and arrival times (elapsed time before appearing on screen) for six mobile fish prey groups to the BRUV stations. Increased large shark exposure was associated with a decrease in overall prey abundance, but the overall response was prey group-specific. Foraging of smooth dogfish, a likely important prey item for large sharks in the system, was significantly reduced in areas frequented by white sharks. Specifically, the predicted probabilities of smooth dogfish bait contacts or bite attempts occurring were reduced by factors of 5.7 and 8.4, respectively, in areas of high exposure as compared to low exposure. These modifications were underscored by a decrease in smooth dogfish abundance in areas of high exposure as well. Our results suggest that populations of large, roving sharks may induce food-related costs in prey. We discuss the implications of this work within the context of the control of risk (COR) hypothesis, for the purposes of advancing our understanding of the ecological role and effects of large sharks on coastal marine ecosystems."

Three C. nicotianae cercosporin autoresistance genes were tested: ATR1 and CFP, encoding an ABC and an MFS transporter, respectively, and 71cR, which encodes a hypothetical protein. Resistance to the pathogen was identified in transgenic lines expressing ATR1 and 71cR, but not in lines transformed with CFP. Silencing of the CTB1 polyketide synthase and to a lesser extent the CTB8 pathway regulator in the cercosporin biosynthetic pathway also led to the recovery of resistant lines. All lines tested expressed the transgenes, and a direct correlation between the level of transgene expression and disease resistance was not identified in any line. Resistance was also not correlated with the degree of silencing in the CTB1 and CTB8 silenced lines. We conclude that expression of fungal cercosporin autoresistance genes as well as silencing of the cercosporin pathway are both effective strategies for engineering resistance to Cercospora diseases where cercosporin plays a critical role."
https://openalex.org/W3011121748,"Autologous transplantation of spermatogonial stem cells is a promising new avenue to restore fertility in infertile recipients. Expansion of the initial spermatogonial stem cell pool through cell culturing is a necessary step to obtain enough cells for effective repopulation of the testis after transplantation. Since in vitro propagation can lead to (epi-)genetic mutations and possibly malignant transformation of the starting cell population, we set out to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation status in uncultured and cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ sorted cells and compare them with germ cell tumor samples of the seminoma subtype. Seminomas displayed a severely global hypomethylated profile, including loss of genomic imprinting, which we did not detect in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells. Differential methylation analysis revealed altered regulation of gamete formation and meiotic processes in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells but not in seminomas. The pivotal POU5F1 marker was hypomethylated in seminomas but not in uncultured or cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells, which is reflected in the POU5F1 mRNA expression levels. Lastly, seminomas displayed a number of characteristic copy number variations that were not detectable in primary testicular ITGA6+ cells, either before or after culture. Together, the data show a distinct DNA methylation patterns in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells that does not resemble the pattern found in seminomas, but also highlight the need for more sensitive methods to fully exclude the presence of malignant cells after culture and to further study the epigenetic events that take place during in vitro culture."

In the country, Plasmodium falciparum had been the main parasite responsible for indigenous cases and primaquine is the first line treatment of cases and for radical cure. However, the lack of knowledge of the national prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be one of the constraints to the malaria elimination process. Hence, this first study determines the prevalence of G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) in the archipelago. Blood samples were collected from patients who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study, in the health facilities of eight municipalities on four islands, tested with G6PD CareStart ™ deficiency Rapid Diagnosis Test (RDT). All subjects found to be G6PDd by RDT then underwent enzyme quantification by spectrophotometry. Descriptive statistics and inferences were done using SPSS 22.0 software. A total of 5.062 blood samples were collected, in majority from female patients (78.0%) and in Praia (35.6%). The RDT revealed the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in 2.5% (125/5062) of the general population, being higher in males (5.6%) than in females (1,6%). The highest G6PDd prevalence was recorded in São Filipe, Fogo, (5.4%), while in Boavista no case was detected. The G6PDd activity quantification shown a higher number of partially deficient and deficient males (respectively n = 26 and n = 22) compared to females (respectively n = 18 and n = 7), but more normal females (n = 35) than males (n = 11). According to the WHO classification, most of the G6PDd cases belongs to the class V (34.5%), while the Classes II and I were the less represented with respectively 5.8% and zero cases. This study in Cabo Verde determined the G6PDd prevalence in the population, relatively low compared to other African countries. Further studies are needed to characterize and genotyping the G6PD variants in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3010934536,"Cathepsins are the major lysosomal proteases that maintain intracellular homeostasis. Herein, we investigated the alterations in myocardial cathepsin expression during aging, cardiac hypertrophy, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Cardiac tissue and blood were sampled from autopsy cases. Subjects were classified into three groups: SCD with cardiac hypertrophy (SCH), compensated cardiac hypertrophy (CCH), and control. Immunoblotting was performed for the major cardiac cathepsins and their targets: cathepsin B, D, and L (CTSB/D/L), p62, ATP synthase subunit c (ATPSC), and α-synuclein (ASNC). Immunohistochemical analysis and ELISA using serum samples were performed for CTSD. Cardiac CTSB and CTSD were upregulated with age (r = 0.63 and 0.60, respectively), whereas the levels of CTSL, p62, ATPSC, and ASNC remained unchanged. In age-matched groups, cardiac CTSD was significantly downregulated in SCH (p = 0.006) and CTSL was moderately downregulated in CCH (p = 0.021); however, p62, ATPSC, and ASNC were not upregulated in cardiac hypertrophy. Immunohistochemistry also revealed decreased myocardial CTSD levels in SCH, and serum CTSD levels were relatively lower in SCH cases. Overall, these results suggest that upregulation of cardiac CTSB and CTSD with age may compensate for the elevated proteolytic demand, and that downregulation of CTSD is potentially linked to SCH."

In this regard, DNA polymerase θ differs from other Pols in that whereas purified Polθ misincorporates an A opposite 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine (ϵdA) using an abasic-like mode, Polθ performs predominantly error-free TLS in human cells. To test the hypothesis that Polθ adopts a different mechanism for replicating through ϵdA in human cells than in the purified Pol, here we analyze the effects of mutations in the two highly conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr-2387 and Tyr-2391, in the Polθ active site. Our findings that these residues are indispensable for TLS by the purified Pol but are not required in human cells, as well as other findings, provide strong evidence that the Polθ active site is reconfigured in human cells to stabilize ϵdA in the syn conformation for Hoogsteen base pairing with the correct nucleotide. The evidence that a DNA polymerase can configure its active site entirely differently in human cells than in the purified Pol establishes a new paradigm for DNA polymerase function.

https://openalex.org/W3012208866,"Photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels regulate Ca2+ influx in rod and cone photoreceptors. Mutations in cone CNG channel subunits CNGA3 and CNGB3 are associated with achromatopsia and cone dystrophies. Mice lacking functional cone CNG channel show endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated cone degeneration. The elevated cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) signaling and upregulation of the ER Ca2+ channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) have been implicated in cone degeneration. This work investigates the potential contribution of RyR2 to cGMP/PKG signaling-induced ER stress and cone degeneration. We demonstrated that the expression and activity of RyR2 were highly regulated by cGMP/PKG signaling. Depletion of cGMP by deleting retinal guanylate cyclase 1 or inhibition of PKG using chemical inhibitors suppressed the upregulation of RyR2 in CNG channel deficiency. Depletion of cGMP or deletion of Ryr2 equivalently inhibited unfolded protein response/ER stress, activation of the CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, and activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein, leading to early-onset cone protection. In addition, treatment with cGMP significantly enhanced Ryr2 expression in cultured photoreceptor-derived Weri-Rb1 cells. Findings from this work demonstrate the regulation of cGMP/PKG signaling on RyR2 in the retina and support the role of RyR2 upregulation in cGMP/PKG signaling-induced ER stress and photoreceptor degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3012255052,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a high-morbidity skeletal disease worldwide and the exact mechanisms underlying OA pathogenesis are not fully understood. Casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε) is a serine/threonine protein kinase, but its relationship with OA is still unknown. We demonstrated that CK1ε was upregulated in articular cartilage of human patients with OA and mice with experimentally induced OA. Activity of CK1ε, demonstrated by analysis of phosphorylated substrates, was significantly elevated in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced OA-mimicking chondrocytes. CK1ε inhibitor or CK1ε short hairpin RNA (shRNA) partially blocked matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression by primary chondrocytes induced by IL-1β, and also inhibited cartilage destruction in knee joints of experimental OA model mice. Conversely, overexpression of CK1ε promoted chondrocyte catabolism. Previous studies indicated that CK1ε was involved in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and noncanonical Wnt/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Interestingly, the activity of JNK but not β-catenin decreased after CK1ε knockdown in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes in vitro, and JNK inhibition reduced MMP expression in chondrocytes overexpressing CK1ε, which illustrated that CK1ε-mediated OA was based on JNK pathway. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CK1ε promotes OA development, and inhibition of CK1ε could be a potential strategy for OA treatment in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3012345616,"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited channelopathy responsible for almost 20% of sudden cardiac deaths in patients with nonstructural cardiac diseases. Approximately 70% of BrS patients, the causative gene mutation(s) remains unknown. In this study, we used whole exome sequencing to investigate candidate mutations in a family clinically diagnosed with BrS. A heterozygous 1616G>A substitution (R539Q mutation) was identified in the transmembrane protein 168 (TMEM168) gene of symptomatic individuals. Similar to endogenous TMEM168, both TMEM168 wild-type (WT) and mutant proteins that were ectopically induced in HL-1 cells showed nuclear membrane localization. A significant decrease in Na+ current and Nav1.5 protein expression was observed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes expressing mutant TMEM168. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias and conduction disorders were induced in the heterozygous Tmem168 1616G>A knock-in mice by pharmacological stimulation, but not in WT mice. Na+ current was reduced in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from the Tmem168 knock-in heart, and Nav1.5 expression was also impaired. This impairment was dependent on increased Nedd4-2 binding to Nav1.5 and subsequent ubiquitination. Collectively, our results show an association between the TMEM168 1616G>A mutation and arrhythmogenesis in a family with BrS."
https://openalex.org/W3010702847,"Needlestick and sharp injuries (NSIs) experienced by physicians have been identified as a major occupational hazard. Blood-borne pathogens resulting from the NSIs experienced by physicians pose severe physical and psychological threats to them, as well as people who are around them. However, there is little research focusing on physicians' behaviours to prevent NSIs. In the present study, we investigated the roles of safety climate, job demands experienced by physicians, and physicians' self-efficacy in affecting physicians' behaviours to prevent NSIs.401 physicians from four teaching hospitals in Northern Taiwan were recruited to participate in an anonymous survey. Among them, 189 physicians returned the completed survey with a response rate of 47.1%.Overall, respondents reported frequently engaging in NSI prevention behaviours. As expected, safety climate in hospitals and physicians' self-efficacy to prevent NSIs were significantly related to their behaviours to prevent NSIs (r = 0.22 and r = 0.33, respectively). The moderating analysis also revealed that physicians with high self-efficacy tended to engage in NSI prevention behaviours regardless of levels of job demand they experienced. In contrast to our expectation, however, physicians with low self-efficacy engaged in more NSI prevention behaviours when job demands were high than when the demands were low.Our findings show the important roles safety climate, job demands and self-efficacy play in shaping physicians' NSI prevention behaviours. Hospitals may consider improving safety climate via strengthening management commitments to NSIs prevention, reducing job demands by training physicians to proactively redesign their own jobs, and increasing physicians' self-efficacy via well-designed skill-based training."
https://openalex.org/W3010845770,"Surface-expressed colonization factors and their subunits are promising candidates for inclusion into a multivalent vaccine targeting enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), a leading cause of acute bacterial diarrhea in developing regions. However, soluble antigens are often poorly immunogenic in the absence of an adjuvant. We show here that the serum immune response to CfaE, the adhesin of the ETEC colonization factor CFA/I, can be enhanced in BALB/c mice by immunization with a chimeric antigen containing CfaE and pentameric cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) of cholera toxin from Vibrio cholerae. We constructed this antigen by replacing the coding sequence for the A1 domain of the cholera toxin A subunit (CTA) with the sequence of donor strand complemented CfaE (dscCfaE) within the cholera toxin operon, resulting in a dscCfaE-CTA2 fusion. After expression, via non-covalent interactions between CTA2 and CTB, the fusion and CTB polypeptides assemble into a complex containing a single dscCfaE-CTA2 protein bound to pentameric CTB (dscCfaE-CTA2/CTB). This holotoxin-like chimera retained the GM1 ganglioside binding activity of CTB, as well as the ability of CfaE to mediate the agglutination of bovine red blood cells when adsorbed to polystyrene beads. When administered intranasally to mice, the presence of CTB in the chimera significantly increased the serum immune response to CfaE compared to dscCfaE alone, stimulating a response similar to that obtained with a matched admixture of dscCfaE and CTB. However, by the orogastric route, immunization with the chimera elicited a superior functional immune response compared to an equivalent admixture of dscCfaE and CTB, supporting further investigation of the chimera as an ETEC vaccine candidate."
https://openalex.org/W3012010402,"Reproduction is one of the costliest processes in the life of an animal. Life history theory assumes that when resources are limiting allocation to reproduction will reduce allocation to other essential processes thereby inducing costs of reproduction. The immune system is vital for survival. If reproduction reduces investment in immune function, this could increase the risk of disease, morbidity and mortality. We here test in the guinea pig, if even under ad libitum food conditions, pregnancy and lactation reduce the activity of the adaptive and innate immune system compared to the reaction of non-reproducing animals. In response to a challenge with keyhole limpet haemocyanin the antibody-mediated adaptive immunity during (pregnancy and) lactation was reduced. Pregnant and lactating females showed higher levels of bacterial killing activity, an integrated measure of innate immunity, than non-reproducing females. However, two major effectors of the innate immunity, the natural antibody and the complement of pregnant and lactating females showed lower levels than in non-reproducing females. Pregnant and lactating females did not differ significantly in the expressed levels of innate immunity. Our results indicate that changes in the immune response during reproduction are physiological adjustments to predictable allocation problems, because they happen even under ad libitum food availability."
https://openalex.org/W3012474373,"Tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) is a synthetic fatty acid with a sulfur substitution in the β-position. This modification renders TTA unable to undergo complete β-oxidation and increases its biological activity, including activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) with preference for PPARα. This study investigated the effects of TTA on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in the intestine and liver of mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). Mice receiving HFD supplemented with 0.75% (w/w) TTA had significantly lower body weights compared to mice fed the diet without TTA. Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) was reduced 3-fold with TTA treatment, concurrent with increase in liver TAG. Total cholesterol was unchanged in plasma and liver. However, TTA promoted a shift in the plasma lipoprotein fractions with an increase in larger HDL particles. Histological analysis of the small intestine revealed a reduced size of lipid droplets in enterocytes of TTA treated mice, accompanied by increased mRNA expression of fatty acid transporter genes. Expression of the cholesterol efflux pump Abca1 was induced in the small intestine, but not in the liver. Scd1 displayed markedly increased mRNA and protein expression in the intestine of the TTA group. It is concluded that TTA treatment of HFD fed mice leads to increased expression of genes involved in uptake and transport of fatty acids and HDL cholesterol in the small intestine with concomitant changes in the plasma profile of smaller lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W3011725919,"Redistribution preferences depend on factors such as self-interest and political views. Recently, Deffains et al. (2016) reported that redistributive behavior is also sensitive to the actual experience of success or failure in a real effort task. While successful participants (‘overachievers’) are more likely to attribute their success to their effort rather than luck and opt for less redistribution, unsuccessful participants (‘underachievers’) tend to attribute their failure to external factors and opt for more redistribution. The aim of the present study was to test how the experience of success (symbolic success) and political views interact in producing redistributive behavior in an experimental setting. The study was conducted during the 2017 French presidential election. Our sample was biased towards left-wing, and most participants reported voting for Mélenchon, Hamon or Macron. Our findings reveal that 1) Macron voters redistribute less than Hamon voters who themselves redistribute less than Mélenchon voters, 2) overachievers redistribute less than underachievers only among Mélenchon voters. This suggests that redistributive behavior is governed primarily by political opinions, and that influence by exogenous manipulation of symbolic success is not homogenous across left-wing political groups."

Isolation of mRNA of cells exfoliated from the GI mucosa into feces (i.e., the exfoliome) offers a novel means of non-invasively examining the gene expression profile of the GI mucosa. This approach has been utilized in people with colorectal cancer. Moreover, we have utilized this approach in a murine model of GI inflammation and demonstrated that the exfoliome reflects the tissue transcriptome. The ability of the equine exfoliome to provide non-invasive information regarding the health and function of the GI tract is not known. The objective of this study was to characterize the gene expression profile found in exfoliated intestinal epithelial cells from normal horses and compare the exfoliome data with the tissue mucosal transcriptome. Mucosal samples were collected from standardized locations along the GI tract (i.e. ileum, cecum, right dorsal colon, and rectum) from four healthy horses immediately following euthanasia. Voided feces were also collected. RNA isolation, library preparation, and RNA sequencing was performed on fecal and intestinal mucosal samples. Comparison of gene expression profiles from the tissue and exfoliome revealed correlation of gene expression. Moreover, the exfoliome contained reads representing the diverse array of cell types found in the GI mucosa suggesting the equine exfoliome serves as a non-invasive means of examining the global gene expression pattern of the equine GI tract."
https://openalex.org/W3012117729,"Despite the considerable potential of low-flow showerheads to reduce household energy demand, their widespread implementation is still far from being realised. In this study, we compare the joint effect of a contextually embedded intervention in a public swimming pool to promote low-flow showerheads coupled with a mass campaign by a Swiss city’s utility to the stand-alone effect of the mass campaign. We also explore the factors that influence the outcome of the contextually embedded intervention. The quasi-experimental design of the study was possible due to the co-occurring installation of low-flow showerheads in a local public swimming pool and a campaign of a local utility, which offered low-flow showerheads for domestic use at a substantially reduced price. Our findings showed that the combined intervention was substantially more effective than the mass campaign alone. However, this result has to be interpreted with caution owing to the imperfect comparability of the two campaigns. Based on a survey of 402 swimming pool visitors, the study findings demonstrate the crucial role of a positive direct experience in the promotion of low-flow showerheads. This had a significant positive impact on attitudes towards low-flow showerheads, which in turn was found to be the most important determinant of purchase intention. The results suggest that more active communication of energy efficiency measures in public facilities might contribute to reductions in household energy use. Such campaigns can be used to share experiences of energy efficiency technologies and, therefore, promote the use of similar systems at home."

https://openalex.org/W3011845778,"Life history theory examines how characteristics of organisms, such as age and size at maturity, may vary through natural selection as evolutionary responses that optimize fitness. Here we ask how predictions of age and size at maturity differ for the three classical fitness functions–intrinsic rate of natural increase r, net reproductive rate R0, and reproductive value Vx−for semelparous species. We show that different choices of fitness functions can lead to very different predictions of species behavior. In one’s efforts to understand an organism’s behavior and to develop effective conservation and management policies, the choice of fitness function matters. The central ingredient of our approach is the maturation reaction norm (MRN), which describes how optimal age and size at maturation vary with growth rate or mortality rate. We develop a practical geometric construction of MRNs that allows us to include different growth functions (linear growth and nonlinear von Bertalanffy growth in length) and develop two-dimensional MRNs useful for quantifying growth-mortality trade-offs. We relate our approach to Beverton-Holt life history invariants and to the Stearns-Koella categorization of MRNs. We conclude with a detailed discussion of life history parameters for Great Lakes Chinook Salmon and demonstrate that age and size at maturity are consistent with predictions using R0 (but not r or Vx) as the underlying fitness function."

https://openalex.org/W3011034724,"The health status, health awareness and health behavior of persons with a migration background often differ from the autochthonous population. Little is known about the proportion of patients with a migration background (PMB) that participate in primary care studies on oral antithrombotic treatment (OAT) in Germany, and whether the quality of their antithrombotic care differs from patients without a migration background. The aim of this paper was to use the results of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (PICANT) to determine the proportion of PMB at different stages of recruitment, and to compare the results in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and antithrombotic treatment.This study used screening and baseline data from the PICANT trial on oral anticoagulation management in GP practices. For this analysis, we determined the proportion of PMB during the recruitment period at stage 1 (screening of potentially eligible patients), stage 2 (eligible patients invited to participate in the trial), and stage 3 (assessment of baseline characteristics of patients participating in the PICANT trial). In addition, we compared patients in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and quality of anticoagulant treatment. Statistical analysis comprised descriptive and bivariate analyses.The proportion of PMB at each recruitment stage declined from 9.1% at stage 1 to 7.9% at stage 2 and 7.3% at stage 3). A lack of German language skills led to the exclusion of half the otherwise eligible PMB. At stages 1 and 3, PMB were younger (stage 1: 70.7 vs. 75.0 years, p<0.001; stage 3: 70.2 vs. 73.5 years, p = 0.013), but did not differ in terms of gender. The quality of their anticoagulant care was comparable (100.0% vs. 99.1% were receiving appropriate OAT, 94.4% vs. 95.7% took phenprocoumon, or warfarin, and the most recent INR measurement of 60.8% vs. 69.3% was within their individual INR range).In the potentially eligible population and among participants at baseline, the quality of anticoagulant care was high in all groups of patients, which is reassuring. To enable the inclusion of more PMB, future primary care research on OAT in Germany should address how best to overcome language barriers. This will be challenging, particularly because the heterogeneity of PMB means the resulting sample sizes for each specific language group are small.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN41847489."
