https://openalex.org/W2010531200,"In the guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus--longitudinal muscle preparation, dynorphin-(1--13) and the prototypical kappa agonist ethylketocyclazocine had equally poor sensitivity to naloxone antagonism and showed selective cross protection in receptor inactivation experiments with the alkylating antagonist beta-chlornaltrexamine. In binding assays with membranes from guinea pig brain, ethylketocyclazocine and dynorphin-(1--13) amide were more potent in displacing tritium-labeled ethylketocyclazocine than in displacing typical mu and delta opioid receptor ligands. In the two preparations studied, the dynorphin receptor appears to be the same as the kappa opioid receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2010579678,"The opioid peptide dynorphin is widely distributed in neuronal tissue of rats. By immunocytochemical methods, it was shown previously that dynorphin-like immunoreactivity is present in the posterior pituitary and the cells of the hypothalamic neurosecretory magnocellular nuclei which also are responsible for the synthesis of oxytocin, vasopressin, and their neurophysins. By using an affinity-purified antiserum to the non-enkephalin part of the dynorphin molecule it has now been demonstrated that dynorphin and vasopressin occur in the same hypothalamic cells of rats, whereas dynorphin and oxytocin occur in separate cells. Homozygous Brattleboro rats (deficient in vasopressin) have magnocellular neurons that contain dynorphin separate from oxytocin. Thus dynorphin and vasopressin, although they occur in the same cells, appear to be under separate genetic control and presumably arise from different precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2009162588,"A method is described for the partial purification of the paired helical filaments that accumulate progressively in human neurons in Alzheimer's disease (senile dementia). Paired helical filaments have unusual solubility characteristics, including insolubility in sodium dodecyl sulfate, urea, reducing agent, and guanidine, which prevent analysis of their molecular composition by gel electrophoresis. The paired helical filaments appear to contain covalent bonds other than disulfide, which cross-link individual filaments into a rigid intracellular polymer. Thus, paired helical filaments appear to represent an example in neurons of an insoluble cross-linked protein. Covalently cross-linked protein polymers occur in lens senile cataracts and in terminally differentiated skin keratinocytes, suggesting that there may be a common mechanism for remodeling some structural proteins during cell aging."

https://openalex.org/W2023552997,"In patients with recessive, adult-onset olivopontocerebellar degeneration associated with a partial deficiency of glutamate dehydrogenase, the concentration of glutamate in plasma was significantly higher than that in controls. Plasma α-ketoglutarate was significantly lower. Oral administration of monosodium glutamate resulted in excessive accumulation of this amino acid in plasma and lack of increase in the ratio of plasma lactate to pyruvate in the glutamate dehydrogenase-deficient patients. Decreased glutamate catabolism may result in an excess of glutamate in the nervous system and cause neuronal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1620274191,"Effects of regulatory proteins on the actomyosin subfragment 1 (acto-S1) Mg2+-ATPase activity were studied over a range of S1 concentration at low actin concentration such that the specific activity was constant in the absence of the regulatory proteins. In their presence, the activity was inhibited at low [S1] and activated at higher [S1] in each of three cases: 1) troponin + tropomyosin + Ca2+; 2) tropomyosin; 3) troponin + tropomyosin - Ca2+. The [S1] required to activate increased in the order 1, 2, 3. In all three cases, however, the inhibition increased toward 100% when the [S1] approached zero. Tropomyosin titrations of acto-S1 ATPase at low [S1] which resulted in inhibition were hyperbolic and gave a binding constant of K approximately 10(7) M-1. In contrast, at higher [S1], tropomyosin titrations were sigmoidal, indicating cooperative effects on activation. These results suggest a modification of the simple steric blocking theory of regulation, in which it is postulated that both of the Ca2+-dependent positions of tropomyosin on the thin filament block the formation of active acto-S1-nucleotide intermediates at low [S1], and in which tropomyosin occupies a third nonblocking position in the active state at high [S1]. In this modified model, Ca2+ facilitates the binding of myosin heads, leading to the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1977448784,"Autoradiography demonstrated prominent retrograde labeling of olivocerebellar climbing fiber neurons after injection of tritiated D-aspartate into the rat cerebellar cortex or deep nuclei. Mossy fiber systems originating in the brainstem and spinal cord remained unlabeled. Potassium ion-induced depolarization of cerebellar slices resulted in calcium ion-dependent release of endogenous L-aspartate, L-glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine. A 26 percent decrease in aspartate release was observed after 3-acetylpyridine-induced destruction of the inferior olive, supporting the hypothesis that aspartate is a neurotransmitter in climbing fibers."

https://openalex.org/W1574332929,"Microvillus membranes from rat kidney, jejunum, and epididymis have been purified by the Ca precipitation method. The membranes exhibit enrichment in specific activities of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aminopeptidase M, and a dipeptidase. The latter has been characterized and shown to be the principal activity responsible for the hydrolysis of S derivatives of Cys-Gly (including cystinyl-bis-glycine (Cys-bis-Gly) and 5-hydroxy-6-S-cysteinylglycyl-1-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene D4)). A method is described for the simultaneous purification of papain-solubilized forms of the three enzymes from renal microvilli. Dipeptidase (Mr = 105,000) appears to be a zinc metalloprotein composed of two Mr = 50,000 subunits. The enzyme is severalfold more effective in the hydrolysis of dipeptides than aminopeptidase M. Dipeptidase, in contrast to aminopeptidase M, is inhibited by thiol compounds; Cys-Gly, in particular, is a potent inhibitor (Ki = 20 microM). The inhibition of dipeptidase by thiols has been employed to probe the relative significance of dipeptidase and aminopeptidase M in the metabolism of glutathione and its derivatives at the membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W2069200256,"Several observations have suggested that microtubule depolymerization might act as a regulator of cell proliferation. To determine whether microtubule depolymerization is required for growth-factor-induced initiation of DNA synthesis, we treated serum-free cultures of mouse embryo cells with taxol to stabilize their microtubules and measured the initiation of DNA synthesis by thrombin and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Pretreatment of quiescent cultures of mouse embryo cells with 10 μg/ml taxol inhibited up to 60% of the thrombin-stimulated and 47% of the EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. This inhibition was dose-dependent for taxol concentrations from 0.3 to 20 μg/ml. Control experiments showed that taxol did not simply affect uptake of nucleotides, glucose or amino acids, nor did it nonspecifically affect protein synthesis, cell morphology or cell viability. Taxol did not affect binding and internalization of 125I-thrombin or 125I-EGF indicating that the drug does not alter receptor number, affinity or distribution after growth factor binding. Taxol also did not affect the proteolytic activity of thrombin. Thus it appears that the inhibitory effects of toxol are mediated by a direct effect of taxol on microtubules. To determine at what point microtubule stabilization was interrupting the initiation signal, we added taxol at various times after addition of thrombin or EGF. Taxol addition during the first 8 hr after growth factor addition inhibited initiation, but after 8 hr had little if any effect. These results confirm that taxol was not nonspecifically affecting transport or metabolism required for DNA synthesis and indicate that thrombin and EGF may initiate cell proliferation through a gradual microtubule depolymerization or rearrangement that is necessary to commit cells to a replicative cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1512553642,"We have previously reported the presence of four dihydrofolate reductase messenger RNAs differing in the length of 3' untranslated regions in murine cells (Setzer, D. R., McGrogan, M., Nunberg, J. H., and Schimke, R. T. (1980) Cell 22, 361-370). We have now mapped the 3' ends of these RNAs more precisely and have demonstrated colinearity between their shared sequences. Analysis of three larger dihydrofolate reductase RNAs has shown that these RNA species contain very long 3' noncoding regions, bringing the total number of dihydrofolate reductase RNAs to seven, ranging in length from 750 to 5600 nucleotides. We have determined the nucleotide sequence at and surrounding the polyadenylation sites of the four smaller RNAs. We find no striking structures in this sequence that might constitute multiple polyadenylation signals, but conclude that the putative polyadenylation signal AAUAAA is not required for polyadenylation of at least three of the four dihydrofolate reductase messengers."

https://openalex.org/W1546876910,"A severalfold activation of calcium transport and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-activated ATPase activity by micromolar concentrations of calmodulin was observed in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles obtained from canine ventricles. This activation was seen in the presence of 120 mM KCl. The ratio of moles of calcium transported per mol of ATP hydrolyzed remained at about 0.75 when calcium transport and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-activated ATPase activity were measured in the presence and absence of calmodulin. Thus, the efficiency of the calcium transport process did not change. Stimulation of calcium transport by calmodulin involves the phosphorylation of one or more proteins. The major 32P-labeled protein, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate slab gel electrophoresis, was the 22,000-dalton protein called phospholamban. The Ca2+ concentration dependency of calmodulin-stimulated microsomal phosphorylation corresponded to that of calmodulin-stimulated (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-activated ATPase activity. Proteins of 11,000 and 6,000 daltons and other proteins were labeled to a lesser extent. A similar phosphorylation pattern was obtained when microsomes were incubated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Phosphorylation produced by added cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calmodulin was additive. These studies provided further evidence for Ca2+-dependent regulation of calcium transport by calmodulin in sarcoplasmic reticulum that could play a role in the beat-to-beat regulation of cardiac relaxation in the intact heart."
https://openalex.org/W1976113746,The participation of the opiate peptide enkephalin in the neural circuitry of the dorsal horn was examined at the light and ultrastructural level through the use of the combined techniques of immunocytochemistry and retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Enkephalin immunoreactive axonal endings made direct synaptic contact with the soma and proximal dendrites of dorsal horn thalamic projection neurons. This observation demonstrates that one major synaptic site of enkephalin modulation of the transfer of nociceptive information in the dorsla horn is on the projection neurons themselves.U
https://openalex.org/W2027000316,"Octopamine synthesized in vitro from tyramine by Limulus lateral and ventral eyes was located by light microscopic and electron microscopic autoradiography in efferent fibers which innervate ventral photoreceptors and lateral eye ommatidia. Newly synthesized octopamine was released from efferent fibers in response to depolarization in high concentrations of potassium. We propose that octopamine is a neurotransmitter of efferent fibers that may modulate basic retinal processes such as photoreceptor sensitivity, photomechanical movements, and photoreceptive membrane turnover."

https://openalex.org/W2019642489,"When injected continuously into the lateral ventricles of the rat, somatostatin increased the frequency of the migrating myoelectric complexes of the small intestine in a dose-related manner. A significant increase was obtained at a dose as low as 0.066 picomole per minute. In contrast, cholecystokinin octapeptide decreased the frequency of the migrating myoelectric complex of the small intestine or disrupted this pattern when injected into the lateral ventricle at rates of 0.073 to 0.23 picomole per minute. These findings support the hypothesis that somatostatin and cholecystokinin octapeptide act on central nervous system structures that are involved in the control of intestinal motility."

Dose-response relationships revealed that at concentrations as low as 1 micromolar, both biotin and its analog caused maximal augmentation of guanylate cyclase activity. These data suggest a role for the activation of guanylate cyclase in the mechanism of action of this vitamin."
https://openalex.org/W1515391194,"The selective removal of acidic phosphoproteins from the 80 S rat liver ribosome was accomplished by successive alcohol extractions at low salt concentration. The resulting core ribosomes lost over 90% of their translation activity and were unable to support the elongation factor 2 GTPase reaction. Both activities were partially restored when the dialyzed extracts were added back to the core ribosome. The binding of labeled adenosine diphosphoribosyl-elongation factor 2 to ribosomes was also affected by extraction and could be reconstituted, although not to the same extent as the GTPase activity associated with elongation factor 2 in the presence of the ribosome. The alcohol extracts of the 80 S ribosome contained mostly phosphoproteins P1 and P2 which could be dephosphorylated and rephosphorylated in solution by alkaline phosphatase and protein kinase, respectively. Dephosphorylation of the P1/P2 mixture in the extracts caused a decrease in the ability of these proteins to reactivate the polyphenylalanine synthesis activity of the core ribosome. However, treatment of the dephosphorylated proteins with the catalytic subunit of 3':5'-cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of ATP reactivated the proteins when compared to the activity of the native extracts. Rabbit antisera raised against the alcohol-extracted proteins were capable of impairing both the polyphenylalanine synthesis reaction and the elongation factor 2-dependent GTPase reaction in the intact ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1492102604,"The subtype of the beta-adrenergic receptor expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes differentiated with dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine was determined by comparing the affinity of the receptors for epinephrine, norepinephrine, and beta-1 and beta-2 selective antagonist, 8-fold more avidly than adipocyte receptors. In contrast, adipocyte beta-receptors had a 10-fold higher affinity for epinephrine than for norepinephrine and complexed the beta-2 selective agonist zinterol with a 20-fold higher affinity than preadipocyte receptors. Hofstee plots and computer analyses of the binding data revealed that the populations of beta-1 receptors in preadipocytes and beta-2 receptors in adipocytes were nearly homogeneous. Preliminary characterizations of the beta-receptor phenotype in (nondifferentiating) 3T3-C2 cells treated with dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine and 3T3-422A adipocytes differentiated with insulin indicated that the expression of beta-2 receptors was not correlated with differentiation, but rather with exposure of the cells to dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine. The regulator of beta-receptor subtype was identified as the glucocorticoid analog, dexamethasone, by employing 3T3-L1 adipocytes which were stimulated to differentiate with methylisobutylxanthine and insulin. Detailed binding studies showed that under these conditions the adipocyte receptors retain beta-1 character. Subsequent treatment with 0.5 microM dexamethasone promoted the loss of beta-1 receptors, the appearance of beta-2 receptors, and a net 2- to 3-fold increase in the number of beta-receptors. Dexamethasone effected a complete switch from beta-1 to beta-2 subtype at concentrations as low as 2.5 nM while other steroids were ineffective below a concentration of 10 microM."

https://openalex.org/W1490127649,"We have studied the cellular localization of human adenosine deaminase binding protein in human skin fibroblasts. The binding activity sediments with the membrane fractions in a subcellular fractionation, and anti-binding protein antiserum reacts with the cell surface of intact fibroblasts, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence. The surface of intact fibroblasts binds 125I-labeled adenosine deaminase with an apparent KD of 0.26 units/ml and a maximum binding capacity of 553 milliunits/mg of cell protein. This binding is inhibited by antibinding protein antiserum. We conclude that most, if not all, of the adenosine deaminase binding protein is located on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1581467655,"Glutamine synthetase and glutamine- and acetylglutamate-dependent carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, both of which are present in high concentrations in liver of urea-retaining elasmobranchs, have been found to be located exclusively in the mitochondria in liver from the representative elasmobranch Squalus acanthias. This observation is consistent with the view that the function of this unique carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase is related to urea synthesis, and that the initial nitrogen-donating substrate for urea synthesis in these species is glutamine rather than ammonia. The urea cycle enzymes, ornithine carbamoyltransferase and arginase, are also located in the mitochondria, whereas argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase are located in the cytosol. Glutamine synthetase and arginase are mitochondrial enzymes in uricotelic species, but are normally found in the cytoplasm in ureotelic species. the properties of the elasmobranch arginase, however, are characteristic of arginases from ureotelic species (e.g. the Km for arginine is 1.2 mM, and the enzyme has an Mr congruent to 100,000)."
https://openalex.org/W2118160510,"The molecular species that determine the unique structure and functions of the microtubules in the mitotic spindle are not known. We describe the results of two new approaches to the molecular structure of the spindle. Both approaches rely on detergent-extracted preparations of synchronized populations of cells metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine or 32P-phosphate. In these preparations, the original cellular microtubules are preserved. The microtubules in these spindle isolates are then analyzed in two ways. The microtubule components can be released from the detergent-extracted preparations by selective depolymerization with calcium ions. Alternatively, the microtubules can be stabilized by taxol, freed of chromatin by digestion with DNAase and freed of the surrounding cage of intermediate filaments by further extraction at low ionic strength. Gel electrophoresis of each of these preparations of mitotic microtubules demonstrates that they contain microtubule-associated proteins that we have previously shown to be present in interphase microtubules. They also contain a protein of 150,000 daltons, which is the first mitosis-specific microtubule-associated protein identified in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1571060277,"Trypsin treatment of spinach chloroplast thylakoids in the light but not in the dark, results in a highly active Mg2+-ATPase and an uncoupling of photophosphorylation. These light-dependent effects are due to a modification of coupling factor 1 (CF1). CF1 purified from thylakoids treated with trypsin in the light contained a clipped beta subunit and a partially clipped gamma subunit, whereas that from thylakoids treated in the dark with trypsin contained only the clipped beta subunit. CF1 containing this modified gamma subunit also retained a high level of Ca2+-ATPase activity in solution. These results suggest that the gamma subunit becomes highly sensitive to trypsin only when the CF1 is in an active conformation. A similar hypersensitivity to proteases of the gamma subunit in highly purified CF1 is seen only after the enzyme is activated (Moroney, J. V., and McCarty, R. E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5910-5914). The conversion of the enzyme to its active form, both on the membrane and in solution, therefore, seems to involve conformational changes that expose the gamma subunit to proteolysis."

The advantages of this assay are that it measures concentrations of single epitopes, purified antigen is not required, and the reagents can be obtained in unlimited amounts and are homogeneous. Its features are particularly attractive when the antigen has not been purified and is a minor component of a complex mixture of molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1607812744,"Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase auto-inactivated with L-methionine-S-sulfoximine and ATP can be completely reactivated at pH 3.5-4.6 in 1 M KCl and 0.4 M (NH4)2SO4. Both unadenylylated and adenylylated magnesium and manganese enzymes can be reactivated. Reactivation of fully inactivated enzyme is first order (t1/2 approximately 2 min at pH 4.1 and 37 degrees C) and coincides with the stoichiometric release of 0.95 +/- 0.05 eq each of L-methionine-S-sulfoximine phosphate and ADP and 2.0 +/- 0.2 eq of Mn2+ from each subunit. The rate of reactivation increases with decreasing pH and is proportional to the 3rd to 4th power of the hydrogen ion activity; the protonation of 3-4 carboxylic acid groups/subunit therefore may be required to disrupt the enzyme complex. Reactivation rate also increases with increasing KCl concentrations and temperature, with an Arrhenius activation energy of approximately 26 Kcal/mol, suggesting that some protein structural perturbation is required to disrupt the complex. Upon neutralization os reactivation solutions, the ligands and metal ions recombine with the enzyme resulting in its complete reinactivation. Thus, inactivation of glutamine synthetase at neutral pH is due to the extremely tight, but reversible, binding of L-methionine-S-sulfoximine phosphate, ADP, and Mn2+ (K'A greater than 10(12) M-1 for ADP) to the enzyme. Under certain conditions, ATP or ADP can partially inhibit inactivation. Excess ADP inhibits reinactivation by L-methionine-S-sulfoximine phosphate, and ATP has a complex effect on the rate and extent of the autoinactivation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1597660304,"The stereochemical course of the GTPase of elongation factor Tu from Escherichia coli has been determined by making use of the reaction dependent on antibiotic X5108 (an N-methylated derivative of kirromycin). Guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate stereospecifically labeled with 17O and 18O in the gamma-position was hydrolyzed in the presence of elongation factor Tu and X5108. The configuration of the product, inorganic [16O, 17O, 18O]thiophosphate was analyzed by 31P NMR after its stereospecific incorporation into adenosine 5'-(beta-thio)triphosphate. The analysis showed that the hydrolysis proceeds with inversion of configuration at the transferred phosphorus, implying that there is not a phosphoenzyme intermediate. Incubation of [beta gamma-18O, gamma-18O3]GTP with elongation factor Tu leaves the 18O-labeling unaltered, as shown by 31P NMR. No exchange of oxygens with water nor beta gamma-beta positional isotope exchange occurs, implying that not even transient cleavage can occur with the elongation factor alone. Only on interaction with X5108, kirromycin, or ribosomes does the cleavage occur, most likely by a single step, in-line transfer of the terminal phosphorus from GDP to a water oxygen. These properties of the GTP hydrolysis mechanism of elongation factor Tu are similar to those of elongation factor G."
https://openalex.org/W1484800552,"gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase, previously known to be potently inhibited by cystamine, has been found to bind covalently to cystamine-Sepharose. ATP facilitates, whereas glutamate plus magnesium ions inhibit, binding of the enzyme to cystamine-Sepharose. A large fraction of the enzyme applied to columns of cystamine-Sepharose binds by forming a disulfide bond between cysteamine-Sepharose and a sulfhydryl group at or near the active site of the enzyme. The enzyme may be released by treatment with dithiothreitol. Some of the enzyme applied to such columns is inactivated and not bound covalently to the column. That the enzyme does not bind to columns of S-(S-methyl)cysteamine-Sepharose, whereas free S-(S-methyl)cysteamine is a potent inhibitor, indicates that a cysteamine-S disulfide moiety derived from the external cysteamine residue of cystamine-Sepharose is the critical group recognized by the enzyme. The observed partitioning of the enzyme on columns of cystamine-Sepharose between covalently column-bound enzyme and nonbound inactivated enzyme suggests that the reactive enzyme sulfhydryl group forms a disulfide linkage with the sulfur atom at the immobilized end of cystamine to link the enzyme to the column and to liberate free cysteamine, and also that the enzyme interacts with the external cysteamine moiety of the bound cystamine. The latter may occur if the free cysteamine released is spontaneously oxidized to free cystamine followed by its inhibition of the enzyme, or if there is a direct reaction between the enzyme-reactive sulfhydryl group and the sulfur atom of the external cysteamine moiety of cystamine-Sepharose."

https://openalex.org/W1544178146,"A single injection of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) into adrenalectomized rats results in rapid and proportionate increases in hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase catalytic activity and in the amount of functional mRNA coding for this enzyme. This effect is transient in that mRNATAT peaks at 0.065% of total poly(A)+RNA activity at 1 h and is back to the basal level of 0.012% in 2.5 h. Enzyme activity peaks at 2.5 h and is back to the basal level by 5 h. If Bt2cAMP is repeatedly injected (0, 1, 2.5, and 4 h), enzyme activity remains at maximal levels for 4 to 5 h, whereas changes in mRNATAT activity are identical with those observed in the single injected rats. The rate of tyrosine aminotransferase synthesis at 5.5 h in the multiply injected rats, a time when mRNATAT has already returned to the basal level, is 3 to 4 times greater than that in either control or singly injected rats at the same time (0.3% of total protein versus 0.07%) and is equivalent to the maximal rate seen 1 h after the initial injection of the cyclic nucleotide. Since the rate of synthesis is increased in proportion to the increase in enzyme catalytic activity, stabilization of the enzyme against degradation is excluded as an induction mechanism at this late time point. These responses are not due to differences in the metabolism of Bt2cAMP, and the effect depends on the presence of metabolically active derivatives of this nucleotide. It thus appears that Bt2cAMP induces the synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase in rat liver in two distinct ways. One is pretranslational and involves a transient and rapid increase in mRNATAT activity. The second appears to involve a delayed but sustained increase in translation of a basal level of mRNATAT."
https://openalex.org/W1581764898,"alpha-Adrenergic stimulation of hepatocytes prevented, in a dose-dependent manner, the stimulation of [U-14C]lactate conversion to [14C]glucose by glucagon and exogenously added cAMP and Bt2cAMP. The inhibition was referable to an interaction with adrenergic receptors which resulted in a small decrease in hepatic cAMP levels. Low concentrations of epinephrine (10 nM) were able to inhibit phosphorylase activation and glucose output elicited by low doses of glucagon (5 X 10(-11) M to 2 X 10(-10) M). The ability of epinephrine (acting via alpha 1-adrenergic receptors), vasopressin, and angiotensin II to elicit calcium efflux was inhibited by glucagon, suggesting that intracellular redistributions of Ca2+ are importantly involved in the gluconeogenic process. It is proposed that vasopressin, angiotensin II, and catecholamines, acting primarily via alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, are responsible for inhibition of glucagon mediated stimulation of gluconeogenesis by altering subcellular calcium redistribution and decreasing cAMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1592911756,"Auto-inactivated EScherichia coli glutamine synthetase contains 1 eq each of L-methionine-S-sulfoximine phosphate and ADP and 2 eq of Mn2+ tightly bound to the active site of each subunit of the dodecameric enzyme (Maurizi, M. R., and Ginsburg, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4271-4278). Complete dissociation and unfolding in 6 M guanidine HCl at pH 7.2 and 37 degrees C requires greater than 4 h for the auto-inactivated enzyme complex (less than 1 min for uncomplexed enzyme). Release of ligands and dissociation and unfolding of the protein occur in parallel but follow non-first order kinetics, suggesting stable intermediates and multiple pathways for the dissociation reactions. Treatment of Partially inactivated glutamine synthetase (2-6 autoinactivated subunits/dodecamer) with EDTA and dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid at pH 8 modifies approximately 2 of the 4 sulfhydryl groups of unliganded subunits and causes dissociation of the enzyme to stable oligomeric intermediates with 4, 6, 8, and 10 subunits, containing equal numbers of uncomplexed subunits and autoinactivated subunits. With greater than 70% inactivated enzyme, no dissociation occurs under these conditions. Electron micrographs of oligomers, presented in the appendix (Haschemeyer, R. H., Wall, J. S., Hainfeld, J., and Maurizi, M. R., (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7252-7253) suggest that dissociation of partially liganded dodecamers occurs by cleavage of intra-ring subunit contacts across both hexagonal rings and that these intra-ring subunit contacts across both hexagonal rings and that these intra-ring subunit interactions are stabilized by active site ligand binding. Isolated tetramers (Mr = 200,000; s20,w = 9.5 S) retain sufficient native structure to express significant enzymatic activity; tetramers reassociate to dodecamers and show a 5-fold increase in activity upon removal of the thionitrobenzoate groups with 2-mercaptoethanol. Thus, the tight binding of ligands to the subunit active site strengthens both intra- and inter-subunit bonding domains in dodecameric glutamine synthetase."

In both these respects it was equipotent with synthetic salmon calcitonin. Photolysis of the 125I-labeled photoactive salmon calcitonin derivative bound to T47D cells was accompanied by specific labeling of only one component (Mr approximately 85,000) as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

(ii) Relaxed covalently closed circular replicative form DNA which is also formed by gene 2 protein as a side product in the initiation reaction preceding replication is converted into supercoils by DNA gyrase. (iii) The enzyme forms a noncovalent complex at the generated nick that is necessary for initiation of subsequent unwinding. (iv) The Escherichia coli rep helicase (rep protein) and E. coli DNA binding protein I unwind the double-stranded DNA. (v) Concomitant DNA replication by E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme results in the formation of rolling circle intermediates. The double-stranded core of the rolling circle remains in an open form, thus allowing continued synthesis during several rounds of replication. (vi) Processing of replicated viral DNA can be subdivided into the cleavage and the circularization of viral single strands. Comparative studies of fd and phi X174 replication in vitro have revealed differences in the kinetics of individual steps besides an apparent contrast in the conformation of rolling circle intermediates in the electron microscopy where fd DNA features extended tails rather than looped-back structures observed for phi X174 DNA."
https://openalex.org/W145798666,"The noncytotoxic degranulation of neutrophils in response to surface stimuli resembles secretory processes of endocrine and exocrine organs. Release of lysosomal contents from human neutrophils, stimulated either by immune complexes or the calcium ionophore A23187, was inhibited by inhibitors of anion transport such as 4-acetamido-4’-isothiocyano-2,2”disulfonic acid (SITS), 4,4’-diisothiocyano-2,2’-disulfonic acid (DIDS), and furosemide. In contrast, these agents did not influence generation of superoxide anion at the plasma membrane. To determine whether inhibition of anion transport is the mechanism whereby secretion is regulated, s04’- fluxes were studied. Measurement of steady state SO4*- distribution in the neutrophil suggested that 5th’- is passively distributed; the efflux for s04’- was 11.8 pmol.liter-’-min-’ (external concentration, 1 m), a lower rate than values obtained with erythrocytes. During cell activation, SO4’- efflux from neutrophils was enhanced. DIDS, SITS, and furosemide inhibited s04’- fluxes in resting and activated cells at the concentrations that inhibited degranulation. Arrhenius plots for s04’- efflux gave an activation energy (Ea) of 10 kcal=mol-’ over the temperature range from 14 to 38 “C, lower than values obtained in the erythrocyte (30 kcal*mol-’). The Ea for SO4’- efflux was not changed by SITS. Arrhenius plots for degranulation showed a break at 27 “C. This transition temperature was not affected by SITS, nor was the Ea in the range from 27 to 37 “C modified by SITS. In contrast to their highly specific effects on anion exchange in the erythrocyte, DIDS and SITS also inhibited the ecto-enzyme M&+-ATPase in the neutrophil. However, since a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue (adenylyl imidodiphosphate) inhibited M&+-ATPase activity without affecting sod2- fluxes or degranulation, it was concluded that the M&+-ATPase was not essential to degranulation. Thus, although inhibition by DIDS, SITS, and furosemide of neutrophil degranulation is correlated with their ability to inhibit anion fluxes, these effects on the neutrophil are not limited to the anion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1599401863,"Free polysomes were isolated from the livers of rats maintained on a 60% casein diet to induce ornithine aminotransferase mRNA. Ornithine aminotransferase-synthesizing polysomes were immunoadsorbed using monospecific, affinity-purified antibody and Staphylococcus aureus cells. Poly(A+)RNA prepared from these polysomes by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography was used as a template for the synthesis of double-stranded cDNA by reverse transcriptase. Using the deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate-deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate tailing method and pBR322 as a vector, recombinant molecules were produced and used to transform Escherichia coli. Two clones containing DNA complementary to ornithine aminotransferase mRNA were identified by colony hybridization and hybrid-arrest translation. A partial restriction endonuclease map of the ornithine aminotransferase cDNA inserts was constructed which spanned 1066 base pairs."

https://openalex.org/W1553148008,"Very low concentrations deoxycholate (DOC) were used to isolate two proteins from canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. These two proteins are phospholamban, a 22,000 dalton protein, and the Ca/sup 2 +/ + Mg/sup 2 +/-ATPase, the major protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, responsible for the active transport of calcium. The 22,000 dalton protein is first solubilized in a very low concentration of DOC and then subjected to column chromatography. After molecular weight sieving on a Sephadex G-75 column, the 22,000 dalton protein appears as a purified protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. The purified protein is specifically phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Phospholipids are still bound to the isolated protein. The Ca/sup 2 +/ + Mg/sup 2 +/-ATPase is purified by first solubilizing all the extrinsic proteins with a low concentration of DOC. An increasing amount of DOC is then added to yield the purified Ca/sup 2 +/ + Mg/sup 2 +/-ATPase. This protein is at least 95% pure. Adding additional DOC to the purified enzyme enhances the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze ATP. (ERB)"

https://openalex.org/W1554071253,"A purification scheme has been developed for the m7G(5')pppN-pyrophosphatase from human placenta. The 1400-fold purified placental enzyme exhibited physical and enzymatic properties similar to those previously reported for a crude preparation of the human m7G(5')pppN-pyrophosphatase obtained from HeLa cells. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of enzyme fractions at different stages of purification revealed a Mr = 40,000 polypeptide that increased in relative concentration as the specific activity of the enzyme fractions increased. Copurification of this polypeptide with m7G(5')pppN-pyrophosphatase activity suggests the possibility that the 81,000-dalton native enzyme is a dimer composed of subunits of identical molecular weight. The highly purified placental enzyme, like the crude HeLa enzyme, failed to hydrolyze the cap moiety of intact mRNA even under conditions known to reduce mRNA secondary structure. Moreover, when a series of capped oligonucleotides that differed progressively in chain length by a factor of one nucleotide was tested as substrate, the rate of enzyme-catalyzed cap hydrolysis decreased as the chain length increased. The purified placental enzyme failed to release m7pG from oligonucleotides containing the cap and 3 or more additional nucleotides. These results are discussed in terms of the probable biological function of the m7G(5')pppN-pyrophosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1552649522,"5-Oxoprolinase catalyzes the coupled hydrolysis of ATP and 5-oxoproline to yield glutamate, ADP, and Pi; the reaction may be partially or completely uncoupled by structural modification of either substrate. In the present work, we found slow 5-oxoproline-dependent changes in the rates of hydrolysis of ITP, GTP, and UTP. For example, in the absence of 5-oxoproline, the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of UTP at a rapid and constant rate. Following addition of 5-oxo-L-proline, the rate of hydrolysis decreases slowly; after about 25 min, a much slower and constant rate of hydrolysis is attained. This change in rate is associated with a decrease in Vmax and an increase in the Km for UTP. In similar studies with ATP, both Vmax and Km increase over a much shorter time period (less than 10 s). The findings indicate that 5-oxoprolinase is a hysteretic enzyme, and are consistent with the hypothesis that in the normal catalytic reaction, the binding of both ATP and 5-oxo-proline to the enzyme induces a conformational change that brings the substrates into a juxtaposition that facilitates the reaction."
