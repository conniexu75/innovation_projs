https://openalex.org/W1973663126,"The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La(2)CuO(4), have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought ""resonating-valence-bond"" state or ""quantum spin liquid"" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state."
https://openalex.org/W1997252211,"Advances in sequence stratigraphy and the development of depositional models have helped explain the origin of genetically related sedimentary packages during sea level cycles. These concepts have provided the basis for the recognition of sea level events in subsurface data and in outcrops of marine sediments around the world. Knowledge of these events has led to a new generation of Mesozoic and Cenozoic global cycle charts that chronicle the history of sea level fluctuations during the past 250 million years in greater detail than was possible from seismic-stratigraphic data alone. An effort has been made to develop a realistic and accurate time scale and widely applicable chronostratigraphy and to integrate depositional sequences documented in public domain outcrop sections from various basins with this chronostratigraphic framework. A description of this approach and an account of the results, illustrated by sea level cycle charts of the Cenozoic, Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic intervals, are presented."

Quantitative phenological studies over several years may be essential to understanding the temporal organization of many tropical communities."
https://openalex.org/W2007710138,Mature female Mastophora sp. spiders attract prey with a volatile substance which apparently mimics the female sex attractant pheromone of the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera). The rate of prey capture is similar to that of a conventional orb weaver of comparable body size.

https://openalex.org/W1970202497,"Turbulence can greatly influence reaction and heat transfer rates in fluids. The topology of the three-dimensional interface between mixing fluids directly determines the location and degree of reaction. The time-resolved measurement of the three-dimensional concentration field in a transitional gas jet is reported. A thin sheet of laser light was swept through the flow volume by a rotating mirror in a time brief enough that motion of the gas was minimal. The light sheet illuminated different parallel planes within the flow, and light scattered from particles seeding the jet was imaged onto a detector. The series of two-dimensional measurements made during one scan of the flow volume constituted a full three-dimensional mapping of structures within the flow. Computer graphics software was used to reconstruct and visualize three-dimensional surfaces of constant concentration and the magnitude of the concentration gradient vector over such surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2004556987,"Unusual concentrations of dissolved two- to four-carbon alkanes were observed in the waters in Norton Sound in a localized area approximately 40 kilometers south of Nome, Alaska, in 1976. The hydrocarbons were identified in the near-bottom waters downcurrent for more than 100 kilometers from a sea-floor point source. Preliminary dynamic modeling estimates of the initial gas phase composition predict methane/ethane and ethane/propane ratios of 24 and 1.7, respectively, assuming the hydrocarbons were introduced by bubbles. The low ethane/propane ratio is indicative of gas from a liquid petroleum source rather than from nonassociated or biogenic natural gas. Preliminary data on the structural geology of Norton Basin lend support to the interpretation based on the hydrocarbon plume. Unconformably truncated strata dip basinward from the seep locus; acoustic anomalies and numerous steeply dipping faults in the immediate vicinity of the seep are corroborating evidence that shallow gas- or petroleum-charged sediments and strata coincide with avenues for migration of mobile hydrocarbons to the sea floor. These factors, taken in concert with the sedimentological regime, the recent revision (increase) of basin depth estimates, and the highly localized hydrocarbon source, strongly suggest a thermogenic rather than a recent biogenic origin for these gaseous compounds."

Plankton net samples were collected in front of and behind a set of internal waves as well as in the convergence and divergence zones over the waves. Tar ""balls"" were most abundant (greater than 30-fold) in the samples from the convergence zone. Comparison of the abundance of tar balls in front of and behind the set of waves suggests that the internal waves ""caught"" about 68% of the asphalt encountered and concentrated and swept shoreward tar balls from almost 8 kilometers of ocean."

https://openalex.org/W2077981161,"A line in the water vapor maser spectrum of the HII region W3(OH) was observed to increase in brightness over an 8-day period and then decline to its original intensity over the following 4 weeks. The intensity variation can be explained by a simple maser model, with an impulse of energy suddenly applied. The observed time scale and energy output are consistent with a maser on the outskirts of a dust cocoon surrounding an O5 star, with a momentary ""leak,"" lasting a day or. two, supplying the necessary energy."

biological neural circuits."
