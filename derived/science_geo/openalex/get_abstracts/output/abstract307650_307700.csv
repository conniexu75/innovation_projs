https://openalex.org/W2129786988,"We have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible, to cover up all the tracks, to not worry about the blind alleys or to describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn't any place to
publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually did in order to get to do the work, although there has been, in these days, some interest in this kind of thing. Since winning the prize is a personal thing, I thought I could be excused in this particular situation if I were to talk personally about my relationship to quantum electrodynamics, rather than to discuss the subject itself in a refined and finished fashion. Furthermore, since there are three people who have won
the prize in physics, if they are all going to be talking about quantum electrodynamics itself, one might become bored with the subject. So, what I would like to tell you about today are
the sequence of events, really the sequence of ideas, which occurred, and by which I finally came out the other end with an unsolved problem for
which I ultimately received a prize."
https://openalex.org/W2065978203,"Water in the form of ice can exist on Mars as permafrost that is either in equilibrium with the water content of the atmosphere or gradually evaporating through a protective layer of soil. The latter situation is evaluated quantitatively, and the required thicknesses of the protective layers are estimated. The presence of subsurface ice may explain the higher radar reflectivity of the dark areas than of the bright areas. Observation of its seasonal variations is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1972346343,The ratios of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 and of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in the early shell and septa of two Nautilus specimens are interpreted for the early ontogeny of the animals. Changes in the carbon isotope content are tentatively correlated with the end of the embryonic period and with environmental changes. Variations in the oxygen isotope content are in part ascribed to migrations from warm to cooler water after a certain stage of development. The size of the body chamber of the young animals can be determined by comparison of the isotope contents in outer shell and septa.

https://openalex.org/W1965269481,"Through control of the crystallization process many polymers can be made to exhibit a broad spectrum of structural possibilities, ranging from a state of high disorder to one of high order. Emphasis has been placed on bulk-crystallized polymers which normally fall near the center of this spectrum. This was done in part because polymers are most commonly fabricated in this manner, and also because the amount of attention given in recent years to crystals grown from dilute solution has tended to obscure important aspects of the structure of bulk-crystallized polymers. Differences in the structure of the interlamellar regions account most reasonably for many of the variations in mechanical properties that crystalline polymers can be made to display. The interlamellar amorphous model, proposed here as a structural model for bulk-crystallized polymers, largely neglects the lamellae themselves, because so little is known about the structure of the lamellae of bulk-crystallized polymers and how variations in lamellar structure can affect properties. This model is intended, therefore, as both a working hypothesis to aid further investigation and as an outline to be filled in as more is learned about the supramolecular structure of crystalline polymers (31)."
https://openalex.org/W1985780067,The increase in K:Rb ratio with decrease in potassium content found in basaltic rocks does not seem to apply to ultramafic rocks. The ratios in a series of alpine ultramafic rocks and ultramafic inclusions in basals and kimberlite pipes are about 200 to 500-significantly lower than those in oceanic tholeiites. This characteristic of ultramafic rocks appears to be consistent with a simplified model in which early differentiation of the primitive mantle led to formation of an upper mantle region enriched in alkali elements and having a low K:Rb ratio. Alpine ultramafic rocks may be residuals from such an upper mantle region.
https://openalex.org/W2039630558,"Organic mats are associated with sulfur deposits in Upper Pleistocene sand ridges of the coastal plain of southern Israel; black, brittle, and non-volatile, they show parallel layering but no other apparent cellular structure. Two independent carbon-14 determinations yielded ages of 27,750+/-500 and 31,370+/-1400 years. Four carbon-13:carbon-12 determinations fell within the range deltaC(13) =-82.5 to -89.3 per mille relative to the PDB standard; these appear to be the lowest values yet reported for naturally occurring high-molecular-weight organic material. The origin of the carbon is probably complex; it must have passed through at least one biologic cycle before final deposition."
https://openalex.org/W1991656396,The relative strengths of the hydrogen bonds in kaolinite-alkali salt-water systems control kaolinite-salt interactions. A new technique for intercalation results in formation of a kaolinite-salt complex free of excess salt.
https://openalex.org/W2072047919,"Striae and associated structures beneath and within the Buckeye Tillite in the Ohio Range of the Horlick Mountains show that Permian(?) glaciers moved toward the west-southwest. Striae in the Wisconsin Range of the Horlicks display similar orientation, but the sense of movement could not be determined. Paleoglaciers in the Neptune Range and the Cordiner Peaks of the Pensacola Mountains moved toward the south-southwest with some dispersion. Paleocurrents flowed parallel to ice motion in the Ohio Range and in the Pensacolas, but they also flowed toward the north-northeast in the Pensacolas."

https://openalex.org/W2066065274,"The frequency spectrum of fluctuations caused by interplanetary scintillations may give a sensitive estimate of the diameter of a radio source. Observations of 3C 138, 3C 245, 3C 267, and 3C 273 give diameters of 0.1, </=0.04, </= 0.2, and </= 0.02 second of arc, respectively. Resolution is at least a factor of 5 higher than that obtained to date by means of either radio interferometers or lunar occulations."
https://openalex.org/W2102677262,The ferrichrome content of cells of the smut fungus Ustilago sphaerogena during growth in a medium deficient in zinc increases with increase in the cobalt of the medium from 0 to 3 X 10(-5)M. The addition of zinc to such cultures prevents the accumulation of ferrichrome. The results suggest that zinc is involved in the utilization of iron via a process which can be blocked by cobalt.

https://openalex.org/W1988960373,"Conventional concepts of chemical bonding appear inadequate to explain the structures of the anhydrous polyborates. A cage-type structure with occluded oxide ion is proposed for the octaborate, hexaborate, and tetraborate ions. The proposed structure is discussed in terms of the composition, x-ray diffraction patterns, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the sodium polyborates."
