https://openalex.org/W2084067481,"Some cultivars of tobacco are resistant to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and synthesize pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins upon infection. In a search for the signal or signals that induce resistance or PR genes, it was found that the endogenous salicylic acid levels in resistant, but not susceptible, cultivars increased at least 20-fold in infected leaves and 5-fold in uninfected leaves after TMV inoculation. Induction of PR1 genes paralleled the rise in salicylic acid levels. Since earlier work has demonstrated that treatment with exogenous salicylic acid induces PR genes and resistance, these findings suggest that salicylic acid functions as the natural transduction signal."
https://openalex.org/W2021521164,"In an effort to identify the signal compound that mediates systemic acquired resistance (SAR), changes in the content of phloem sap were monitored in cucumber plants inoculated with either tobacco necrosis virus or the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum lagenarium. The concentration of a fluorescent metabolite was observed to increase transiently after inoculation, with a peak reached before SAR was detected. The compound was purified and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as salicylic acid, a known exogenous inducer of resistance. The data suggest that salicylic acid could function as the endogenous signal in the transmission of SAR in cucumber."

When crystallized from an aqueous solution while the solution is not stirred, statistically equal numbers of levo (L) and dextro (D) NaClO(3) crystals were found. When the solution was stirred, however, almost all of the NaClO(3) crystals (99.7 percent) in a particular sample had the same chirality, either levo or dextro. This result represents an experimental demonstration of chiral symmetry breaking or total spontaneous resolution on a macroscopic level brought about by autocatalysis and competition between L- and D-crystals."

The isolation and molecular analysis of several homeotic genes in Antirrhinum majus provide insights into the underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms of flower development. A model is presented of how the characteristic sequential pattern of developing organs, comprising the flower, is established in the process of morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2088476626,"Appropriate regulation of transcription in higher plants requires specific cis elements in the regulatory regions of genes and their corresponding trans-acting proteins. Analysis of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter has contributed to the understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. The intact 35S promoter confers constitutive expression upon heterologous genes in most plants. Dissection into subdomains that are able to confer tissue-specific gene expression has demonstrated that the promoter has a modular organization. When selected subdomains are combined, they confer expression not detected from the isolated subdomains, suggesting that synergistic interactions occur among cis elements. The expression patterns conferred by specific combinations of 35S subdomains differ in tobacco and petunia. This indicates that a combinatorial code of cisregulatory elements may be interpreted differently in different species."
https://openalex.org/W2106015768,"The shoot system of higher plants passes through several different phases during its development. Each of these phases is characterized by a unique set of morphological and physiological attributes. The intermediate character of the structures produced during phase changes and the phenotypes of mutations that affect this process demonstrate that these phases are specified by independently regulated, overlapping developmental programs. Transitions between phases appear to be initiated by factors extrinsic to the shoot apical meristem; the ability of the shoot to respond to such factors and to remain in a particular phase of development is regulated by factors intrinsic to the meristem. The possibility that developmental phases are maintained by epigenetic cell states and the role of DNA methylation in this process are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1982493705,"In the lower Amazon River, suspended sediment is stored during rising stages of the river and resuspended during falling river stages. The storage and resuspension in the reach are related to the mean slope of the flood wave on the river surface; this slope is smaller during rising river stages than during falling stages. The pattern of storage and resuspension damps out the extreme values of high and low sediment discharge and tends to keep them near the mean value between 3.0 x 10(6) and 3.5 x 10(6) metric tons per day. Mean annual discharge of suspended sediment in the lower Amazon is between 1.1 x 10(9) and 1.3 x 10(9) metric tons per year."
https://openalex.org/W1984168323,"Twenty years of climatic, hydrologic, and ecological records for the Experimental Lakes Area of northwestern Ontario show that air and lake temperatures have increased by 2Â°C and the length of the ice-free season has increased by 3 weeks. Higher than normal evaporation and lower than average precipitation have decreased rates of water renewal in lakes. Concentrations of most chemicals have increased in both lakes and streams because of decreased water renewal and forest fires in the catchments. In Lake 239, populations and diversity of phytoplankton also increased, but primary production showed no consistent trend. Increased wind velocities, increased transparency, and increased exposure to wind of lakes in burned catchments caused thermoclines to deepen. As a result, summer habitats for cold stenothermic organisms like lake trout and opposum shrimp decreased. Our observations may provide a preview of the effects of increased greenhouse warming on boreal lakes."
https://openalex.org/W2045838052,"The Texas cytoplasm of maize carries two cytoplasmically inherited traits, male sterility and disease susceptibility, which have been of great interest both for basic research and plant breeding. The two traits are inseparable and are associated with an unusual mitochondrial gene, T-urf13, which encodes a 13-kilodalton polypeptide (URF13). An interaction between fungal toxins and URF13, which results in permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, accounts for the specific susceptibility to the fungal pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2022120039,"The development of nitrogen fixing root nodules on the roots of leguminous plants is induced by soil bacteria (for example, from the genus Rhizobium). The formation of this plant organ involves specific activation of genes in both plant and bacterium. Analysis of these genes gives insight into the way in which plant and bacterium succeed in coordinating plant development."
https://openalex.org/W2102003825,"Molecular chaperones are a family of unrelated proteins found in all types of cell. They mediate the correct assembly of other polypeptides, but are not components of the mature assembled structures. Chaperones function by binding specifically to interactive protein surfaces that are exposed transiently during many cellular processes and so prevent them from undergoing incorrect interactions that might produce nonfunctional structures. The concept of molecular chaperones originated largely from studies of the chloroplast enzyme rubisco, which fixes carbon dioxide in plant photosynthesis; the function of chaperones forces a rethinking of the principle of protein self-assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1964641020,"Monolayers of aliphatic long-chain alcohols induced nucleation of ice at temperatures approaching 0 degrees C, in contrast with water-soluble alcohols, which are effective antifreeze agents. The corresponding fatty acids, or alcohols with bulky hydrophobic groups, induce freezing at temperatures as much as 12 degrees C lower. The freezing point induced by the amphiphilic alcohols was sensitive not only to surface area per molecule but, for the aliphatic series (C(n)H(2n + 1)OH), to chain length and parity. The freezing point for chains with n odd reached an asymptotic temperature of 0 degrees C for an upper value of n = 31; for n even the freezing point reached a plateau of -8 degrees C for n in the upper range of 22 to 30. The higher freezing point induced by the aliphatic alcohols is due to formation of ordered clusters in the uncompressed state as detected by grazing incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements. The diffraction data indicate a close lattice match with the ab layer of hexagonal ice."
https://openalex.org/W1987004728,"A numerical model of mantle convection shows that sea level fluctuations are not simply associated with temporal changes in ocean c plate spreading. In the dynamic model, sea level rises rapidly and then falls toward a steady value (but one still higher than the initial) following increased ridge spreading; this time dependence results from profound changes in the deep thermal structure under ocean and continent. The use of past variations in oceanic spreading to infer sea level fluctuations is called into question. With more realistic models and better continental stratigraphy, constraints may be placed on the viscosity structure of the mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2043223386,"Massive protests are taking place in Russia against nuclear weapons testing. Efforts have been mounted to stop all testing at Kazakhstan test site near the town of Semipalatinsk, site of the first nuclear detonation in 1949 and of more than 500 test conducted since. Boris Yeltsin proposed just after his election as president of the federation the elimination of testing grounds for nuclear and biological weapons on Russian territory. The central government in Moscow has announced that it is considering closing the Semipalatinsk site. Reaction has also been strong to testing at the Arctic island of Novaya Zemlya, and severe constraints, such as Arctic cold, frozen rocks, high winds, difficult access, and protests by Greenpeace activists and USSR's Nordic neighbors do not make this site attractive. The author feels that this movement in the USSR has set in motion a politically dynamic situation that makes for the best chance for a comprehensive test ban treaty yet witnessed."
