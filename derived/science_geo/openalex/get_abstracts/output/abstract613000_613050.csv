https://openalex.org/W2807921964,"The breast cancer risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies explain only a small fraction of the familial relative risk, and the genes responsible for these associations remain largely unknown. To identify novel risk loci and likely causal genes, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study evaluating associations of genetically predicted gene expression with breast cancer risk in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry. We used data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project to establish genetic models to predict gene expression in breast tissue and evaluated model performance using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Of the 8,597 genes evaluated, significant associations were identified for 48 at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P < 5.82 × 10−6, including 14 genes at loci not yet reported for breast cancer. We silenced 13 genes and showed an effect for 11 on cell proliferation and/or colony-forming efficiency. Our study provides new insights into breast cancer genetics and biology. A transcriptome-wide association study identifies associations of genetically predicted gene expression with breast cancer risk. This analysis finds 48 candidate genes implicated in breast cancer susceptibility, including 14 at novel loci."
https://openalex.org/W2808357284,"We introduce and validate a new precision oncology framework for the systematic prioritization of drugs targeting mechanistic tumor dependencies in individual patients. Compounds are prioritized on the basis of their ability to invert the concerted activity of master regulator proteins that mechanistically regulate tumor cell state, as assessed from systematic drug perturbation assays. We validated the approach on a cohort of 212 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), a rare malignancy originating in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. The analysis identified several master regulator proteins, including key regulators of neuroendocrine lineage progenitor state and immunoevasion, whose role as critical tumor dependencies was experimentally confirmed. Transcriptome analysis of GEP-NET-derived cells, perturbed with a library of 107 compounds, identified the HDAC class I inhibitor entinostat as a potent inhibitor of master regulator activity for 42% of metastatic GEP-NET patients, abrogating tumor growth in vivo. This approach may thus complement current efforts in precision oncology. This study presents OncoTreat, a framework for the prioritization of compounds targeting mechanistic tumor dependencies in individual patients."
https://openalex.org/W2809069215,"The aim of this study was to examine sex disparity in metabolic syndrome prevalence and its risk factors among Chinese adults.Using the 2010-2012 China National Nutrition and Health Survey (CNNHS), a nationally representative cross-sectional study on nutrition and non-communicable chronic diseases, a total of 98,042 participants aged 18 years and older were included in the analysis. Dietary information was collected with a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the updated NCEP ATP III criteria. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to examine the associations between sociodemographic and dietary factors with metabolic syndrome prevalence, and the results are presented using odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).The overall standardized prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 24.2% (24.6% in men and 23.8% in women). The metabolic syndrome prevalence was positively associated with age in men and women. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was negatively associated with the physical activity level among men and inversely associated with the education level among women (P for trend < 0.01). Frequent consumption of fungi and algae was an underlying risk factor for metabolic syndrome in men, whereas frequent consumption of nuts and pork was associated with a decreased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in women.The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in men was not different from that in women. There are sex-specific associations between multiple risk factors and metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2809298136,"Over the past decades, Bangladesh has made substantial progress in improving higher education, and in part, this was achieved by promoting residence based higher education in public universities. University residency is considered a crucial period for students to develop healthy eating habits and adopt nutritious intake, which comprise a strong foundation for good health throughout life. Although, there is extensive literature on eating behaviors and dietary intake internationally, there appears to be relatively scarce research and analysis concerning Bangladesh. This study aims to address this, by investigating the factors that influence eating behavior and dietary intake.Adopting a qualitative approach, we conducted 25 in-depth interviews and 13 focus group discussions with students of various disciplines and semesters. We used thematic analysis to analyze the textual data, and methodological triangulation to validate the information provided.Student eating behavior and dietary intake are influenced by a variety of factors. Individual factors (cooking skills, food taste, food taboos, and knowledge and perceptions), societal factors (influence of peers and social norms), factors related to university (campus culture and frequency of examination), and environmental factors (availability of cooking resources and facilities and food prices) emerged as the key aspects that determine students' eating behavior and dietary intake.This is the first study that explored factors influencing nutritional behavior and dietary intake among resident graduates in a Bangladeshi university. The results suggest that resident students have a poor dietary intake that might have a harmful impact on their health, well-being, and academic performance. Therefore, multilevel nutritional interventions may be beneficial to promote healthy eating behavior and dietary intake among university students."
https://openalex.org/W2809292206,"Urbanisation is increasing worldwide and is regarded a major driver of environmental change altering local species assemblages in urban green areas. Forests are one of the most frequent habitat types in urban landscapes harbouring many native species and providing important ecosystem services. By using a multi-taxa approach covering a range of trophic ranks, we examined the influence of degree of urbanisation and forest size on the species richness and functional diversity of plants, and ground surface-active ants and spiders. We conducted field surveys in twenty-six forests in the urban region of Basel, Switzerland. We found that a species’ response to urbanisation varied depending on trophic rank, habitat specificity and the diversity indices used. In plants, species richness decreased with degree of urbanisation, whereas that of both arthropod groups was not affected. However, ants and spiders at higher trophic rank showed greater shifts in species composition with increasing degree of urbanisation, and the percentage of forest specialists in both arthropod groups increased with forest size. Local abiotic site characteristics were also crucial for plant species diversity and species composition, while the structural diversity of both leaf litter and vegetation was important for the diversity of ants and spiders. Our results highlight that even small urban forests can harbour a considerable biodiversity including habitat specialists. Nonetheless, urbanisation directly and indirectly caused major shifts in species composition. Therefore, special consideration needs to be given to vulnerable species, including those with special habitat requirements. Locally adapted management practices could be a step forward to enhance habitat quality in a way to maximize diversity of forest species and thus ensure forest ecosystem functioning; albeit large-scale factors also remain important."

https://openalex.org/W2950789770,"Previous research has sought to quantify head impact exposure using wearable kinematic sensors. However, many sensors suffer from poor accuracy in estimating impact kinematics and count, motivating the need for additional independent impact exposure quantification for comparison. Here, we equipped seven collegiate American football players with instrumented mouthguards, and video recorded practices and games to compare video-based and sensor-based exposure rates and impact location distributions. Over 50 player-hours, we identified 271 helmet contact periods in video, while the instrumented mouthguard sensor recorded 2,032 discrete head impacts. Matching video and mouthguard real-time stamps yielded 193 video-identified helmet contact periods and 217 sensor-recorded impacts. To compare impact locations, we binned matched impacts into frontal, rear, side, oblique, and top locations based on video observations and sensor kinematics. While both video-based and sensor-based methods found similar location distributions, our best method utilizing integrated linear and angular position only correctly predicted 81 of 217 impacts. Finally, based on the activity timeline from video assessment, we also developed a new exposure metric unique to American football quantifying number of cross-verified sensor impacts per player-play. We found significantly higher exposure during games (0.35, 95% CI: 0.29–0.42) than practices (0.20, 95% CI: 0.17–0.23) (p<0.05). In the traditional impacts per player-hour metric, we observed higher exposure during practices (4.7) than games (3.7) due to increased player activity in practices. Thus, our exposure metric accounts for variability in on-field participation. While both video-based and sensor-based exposure datasets have limitations, they can complement one another to provide more confidence in exposure statistics."
https://openalex.org/W2809090948,"Here, we use recent U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) data to document trends in the NIH-funded workforce over time. Consistent with previous studies that were initiated by NIH, we find that the number of scientists funded on competing R01-equivalent (R01 Eq.) and research project grants (RPGs) increased 2-5% per year between 2009 and 2016. Primary beneficiaries of this growth were experienced investigators (Exp), whereas the share of funding awarded to early-stage investigators (ESIs) and new investigators (NIs) declined. The decline occurred even after NIH instituted the New and Early-Stage Investigator policy in 2009. When we evaluate the investigator pool, we find that women and racial and ethnic minorities represent a higher percentage of NIs and ESIs relative to Exp. Thus, trends of diminishing support for NIs and ESIs may negatively impact the diversity of the current and future biomedical research workforce. We find some recent gains among women and Hispanics as part of the applicant and awardee pool for both R01 Eq. and RPGs, but significant, large gaps persist among nationally underrepresented racial minorities. Our findings suggest a need to prioritize investments and support of ESIs and NIs, groups in which women and racial and ethnic minorities represent a larger proportion of the applicant pool, to enhance diversity in the NIH-funded workforce.-Nikaj, S., Roychowdhury, D., Lund, P.

https://openalex.org/W2809247538,"People watch subtitled audiovisual materials more than ever before. With the proliferation of subtitled content, we are also witnessing an increase in subtitle speeds. However, there is an ongoing controversy about what optimum subtitle speeds should be. This study looks into whether viewers can keep up with increasingly fast subtitles and whether the way people cope with subtitled content depends on their familiarity with subtitling and on their knowledge of the language of the film soundtrack. We tested 74 English, Polish and Spanish viewers watching films subtitled at different speeds (12, 16 and 20 characters per second). The films were either in Hungarian, a language unknown to the participants (Experiment 1), or in English (Experiment 2). We measured viewers’ comprehension, self-reported cognitive load, scene and subtitle recognition, preferences and enjoyment. By analyzing people’s eye gaze, we were able to discover that most viewers could read the subtitles as well as follow the images, coping well even with fast subtitle speeds. Slow subtitles triggered more re-reading, particularly in English clips, causing more frustration and less enjoyment. Faster subtitles with unreduced text were preferred in the case of English videos, and slower subtitles with text edited down in Hungarian videos. The results provide empirical grounds for revisiting current subtitling practices to enable more efficient processing of subtitled videos for viewers."
https://openalex.org/W2809079842,"Sedation induces changes in electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics. However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer’s Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms. EEG-based clinical sedation monitoring should consider the effect of drug types on EEG dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2809285525,"Short-wavelength visible light (blue light: 400–500 nm) has lethal effects on various insects, such as fruit flies, mosquitoes, and flour beetles. However, the most toxic wavelengths of blue light might differ across developmental stages. Here, we investigate how the toxicity of blue light changes with the developmental stages of an insect by irradiating Drosophila melanogaster with different wavelengths of blue light. Specifically, the lethal effect on eggs increased at shorter light wavelengths (i.e., toward 405 nm). In contrast, wavelengths from 405 to 466 nm had similar lethal effects on larvae. A wavelength of 466 nm had the strongest lethal effect on pupae; however, mortality declined as pupae grew. A wavelength of 417 nm was the most harmful to adults at low photon flux density, while 466 nm was the most harmful to adults at high photon flux density. These findings suggest that, as the morphology of D. melanogaster changes with growth, the most harmful wavelength also changes. In addition, our results indicated that reactive oxygen species influence the lethal effect of blue light. Our findings show that blue light irradiation could be used as an effective pest control method by adjusting the wavelength to target specific developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2809198367,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality globally. Although cigarette smoking is by far the most important risk factor for lung cancer, the aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes contributes a great deal to tumorigenesis. Here, we reveal that aberrant expression of endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (EPAS1) gene, which encodes hypoxia inducible factor 2a, has a critical role in NSCLC. Our results showed EPAS1 mRNA was down-regulated in 82.5% of NSCLC tissues, and a new region of EPAS1 promoter was found to be highly methylated in lung cancer cell lines and NSCLC tissues. Moreover, the methylation rates were negatively correlated to EPAS1 mRNA expression in lung tissues. Further, demethylation analysis demonstrated EPAS1 was regulated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in NSCLC. In contrast, DNMT1was verified as an EPAS1 target gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and could be transactivated by stabilized EPAS1 proteins in hypoxic lung cells, thereby decreasing EPAS1 mRNA expression by methylation regulation. Collectively, our study suggests there might be a mechanism of negative-feedback regulation for EPAS1in NSCLC. That is, hypoxic-stabilized EPAS1 proteins transactivated ΌΝΜΤΊ, which further promoted the hypermethylation of EPAS1 promoter and decreased EPAS1 mRNA expression levels in NSCLC.—Xu, X.-H., Bao, Y., Wang, X., Yan, F., Guo, S., Ma, Y., Xu, D., Jin, L., Xu, J., Wang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2809307194,"Introduction Short telomeres have been associated with adverse lifestyle factors, cardiovascular risk factors and age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, and also with mortality. However, previous studies report conflicting results. Objectives The aim of the present study has been to investigate the involvement of telomere length in all-cause and CVD mortality in subjects hospitalized for diagnostic coronary angiography of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study. Methods Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured with a Q-PCR based method in 3,316 participants of the LURIC study. Age-corrected RTL was calculated as the ratio between RTL and age. Median follow-up was 9.9 years. Cox regression and Kaplan-Maier analyses were performed to evaluate the role of RTL for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Results RTL correlated negatively with age (r = -0.09; p<0.001). In surviving patients the correlation between age and RTL was statistically significant (r = -0.088; p<0.001), but not in patients who died during follow-up (r = -0.043; p = 0.20). Patients in quartiles 2–4 of RTL had a lower hazard ratio for all-cause mortality (HR:0.822; 95%CI 0.712–0.915; p = 0.008) and CVD-mortality (HR:0.836; 95%CI 0.722–0.969; p = 0.017) when compared to those in the 1st quartile. Adjustment for major cardiovascular risk factors did not change this result, however additional adjustment for age attenuated this effect. Patients in the 4th quartile of age-corrected RTL compared to those in the 1st quartile had a lower hazard ratio for all-cause mortality, even with adjustment for major cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions The present study supports the hypothesis that short telomere length increases the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Age appears to be an important co-variate that explains a substantial fraction of this effect. It remains unclear whether short telomeres contribute directly to the increase in mortality or if they are simply a surrogate marker for other adverse processes of aging."
https://openalex.org/W2808640273,"The leading cause of death in cancer patients is metastasis, for which an effective treatment is still necessary. During metastasis, cancer cells aberrantly express several glycans that are correlated with poor patient outcome. This study was aimed toward exploring the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on membranous N-glycans that are associated with the progression of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Global O-GlcNAcylation in CCA cells was depleted using specific siRNA against O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which transfers GlcNAc to the acceptor proteins. Using an HPLC-Chip/Time-of-Flight (Chip/TOF) MS system, the N-glycans associated with O-GlcNAcylation were identified by comparing the membranous N-glycans of siOGT-treated cells with those of scramble siRNA-treated cells. In parallel, the membranous N-glycans of the parental cells (KKU-213 and KKU-214) were compared with those of the highly metastatic cells (KKU-213L5 and KKU-214L5). Together, these data revealed that high mannose (Hex9HexNAc2) and biantennary complex (Hex5HexNAc4Fuc1NeuAc1) N-linked glycans correlated positively with metastasis. We subsequently demonstrate that suppression of O-GlcNAcylation decreased the expression of these two N-glycans, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation mediates their levels in CCA. In addition, the ability of highly metastatic cells to migrate and invade was reduced by the presence of Pisum Sativum Agglutinin (PSA), a mannose-specific lectin, further indicating the association of high mannose type N-glycans with CCA metastasis. The molecular mechanism of O-GlcNAc-mediated progression of CCA was shown to proceed via a series of signaling events, involving the activation of Akt/Erk (i), an increase in FOXO3 phosphorylation (ii), which results in the reduction of MAN1A1 expression (iii) and thus the accumulation of Hex9HexNAc2 N-glycans (iv). This study demonstrates for the first time the association between O-GlcNAcylation, high mannose type N-glycans, and the progression of CCA metastasis, suggesting a novel therapeutic target for treatment of metastatic CCA."
https://openalex.org/W2809235299,"Psoriasis is an inflammatory autoimmune skin disorder possessing a complex etiology related to genetic and environmental triggers. Keratinocytes show a potential role for the origin of psoriasis. In this study, we estimated the efficiency of 2 anthranilate derivatives—(E)-4-(N-{2-[1-(hydroxyimino)ethyl]phenyl}sulfamoyl)phenyl pivalate (HFP031) and butyl 2-[2-(2-fluorophenyl)acetamido]benzoate (HFP034)—on psoriasis amelioration in a mouse model. The results showed that topical treatment with both compounds could attenuate epidermal thickness and scaling in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model via decreased expression of cytokines and chemokines [C-X-C chemokine ligand (CXCL)1 and CXCL2], leading to the reduction of neutrophilic abscess in the skin. The in vivo cutaneous absorption of HFP034 was 7.6-fold greater than that of HFP031. Both compounds caused negligible irritation on healthy mouse skin. In addition, we examined the effect of the anthranilate derivatives on chemokine expression in IMQ-treated HaCaT keratinocytes. Our results elucidated a mechanism for anti-inflammatory activity of HFP034 that involved the elevation of intracellular cAMP concentration, suppression of NF-κB activity, and attenuation of neutrophil chemoattractant expression. These results suggest that HFP034 could increase the cutaneous concentration of cAMP to suppress neutrophil infiltration into the skin. Topically applied HFP034 may demonstrate a potential for future clinical application as a novel therapy for psoriasis treatment.—Lin, Z.-C., Hsieh, P.-W., Hwang, T.-L., Chen, C.-Y., Sung, C.

https://openalex.org/W2809167389,"The bacterium Vibrio coralliilyticus can threaten vital reef ecosystems by causing disease in a variety of coral genera, and, for some strains, increases in virulence at elevated water temperatures. In addition, strains of V. coralliilyticus (formally identified as V. tubiashii) have been implicated in mass mortalities of shellfish larvae causing significant economic losses to the shellfish industry. Recently, strain BAA-450, a coral pathogen, was demonstrated to be virulent towards larval Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas). However, it is unclear whether other coral-associated V. coralliilyticus strains can cause shellfish mortalities and if infections are influenced by temperature. This study compared dose dependence, temperature impact, and gross pathology of four V. coralliilyticus strains (BAA-450, OCN008, OCN014 and RE98) on larval C. gigas raised at 23°C and 27°C, and evaluated whether select virulence factors are required for shellfish infections as they are for corals. All strains were infectious to larval oysters in a dose-dependent manner with OCN014 being the most pathogenic and BAA-450 being the least. At 27°C, higher larval mortalities (p < 0.05) were observed for all V. coralliilyticus strains, ranging from 38.8-93.7%. Gross pathological changes to the velum and cilia occurred in diseased larvae, but there were no distinguishable differences between oysters exposed to different V. coralliilyticus strains or temperatures. Additionally, in OCN008, the predicted transcriptional regulator ToxR and the outer membrane protein OmpU were important for coral and oyster disease, while mannose sensitive hemagglutinin type IV pili were required only for coral infection. This study demonstrated that multiple coral pathogens can infect oyster larvae in a temperature-dependent manner and identified virulence factors required for infection of both hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2808988953,"All surgical meshes entering the U.S. market have been cleared for clinical use by the 510(k) process of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in which devices simply require proof of ""substantial equivalence"" to predicate devices, without the need for clinical trials. However, recalled meshes associated with adverse effects may, indirectly, continue to serve as predicates for new devices raising concerns over the safety of the 510(k) route.Here we assess the potential magnitude of this problem by determining the ancestral network of equivalence claims linking recently cleared surgical meshes. Using the FDA website we identified all surgical meshes cleared by the 510(k) route between January 2013 and December 2015 along with all listed predicates for these devices. Using a network approach, we trace the ancestry of predicates across multiple generations of equivalence claims and identify those meshes connected to devices that have since recalled from the market along with the reason for their recall.We find that the 77 surgical meshes cleared between 2013 and 2015 are based on 771 interconnected predicate claims of equivalence from 400 other devices. The vast majority of these devices (97%) are descended from only six surgical meshes that were present on the market prior to 1976. One of these ancestral meshes alone, provided the basis of 183 subsequent devices. Furthermore, we show that 16% of recently cleared devices are connected through equivalence claims to the 3 predicate meshes that have been recalled for design and material related flaws causing serious adverse events. Taken together, our results show that surgical meshes are connected through a tangled web of equivalency claims and many meshes recently cleared by the FDA have connections through chains of equivalency to devices which have been recalled from the market due to concerns over clinical safety.

Here, we investigated gene expression changes following CHMI using RNA-Seq. Peripheral blood samples were collected in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, from ten adults who were injected intradermally (ID) with 2.5x104 aseptic, purified, cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites (Sanaria® PfSPZ Challenge). A total of 2,758 genes were identified as differentially expressed following CHMI. Transcriptional changes were most pronounced on day 5 after inoculation, during the clinically silent liver phase. A secondary analysis, grouping the volunteers according to their prepatent period duration, identified 265 genes whose expression levels were linked to time of blood stage parasitemia detection. Gene modules associated with these 265 genes were linked to regulation of transcription, cell cycle, phosphatidylinositol signaling and erythrocyte development. Our study showed that in malaria pre-exposed volunteers, parasite prepatent period in each individual is linked to magnitude and timing of early gene expression changes after ID CHMI."

The aim of this study was to calculate the social burden of HCC using the cost of illness (COI) method, and to identify the key factors driving changes in the economic burden of HCC. Methods Utilizing government-based statistical nationwide data, the cost of illness (COI) method was used to estimate the COI for 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2014 to make predictions for 2017, 2020, 2023, 2026, and 2029. The COI comprised direct and indirect costs (morbidity and mortality costs) of HCC. Results From 1996 to 2014, COI trended downward. In 2014, COI (579.2 billion JPY) was 0.71 times greater than that in 1996 (816.2 billion JPY). Mortality costs accounted for more than 70% of total COI and were a major contributing factor to the decrease in COI. It was predicted that COI would continue a downward trend until 2029, and that the rate of decline would be similar. Conclusions COI of HCC has been decreasing since 1996. Treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus using newly introduced technologies has high therapeutic effectiveness, and will affect the future prevalence of HCC. These policies and technologies may accelerate the downward tendency of COI, and the relative economic burden of HCC is likely to continue to decrease."
https://openalex.org/W2809319757,"Matrix protease activity is fundamental to developmental tissue patterning and remains influential in adult homeostasis. In cartilage, the principal matrix proteoglycan is aggrecan, the protease-mediated catabolism of which defines arthritis; however, the pathophysiologic mechanisms that drive aberrant aggrecanolytic activity remain unclear. Human ciliopathies exhibit altered matrix, which has been proposed to be the result of dysregulated hedgehog signaling that is tuned within the primary cilium. Here, we report that disruption of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88), a core ciliary trafficking protein, increases chondrocyte aggrecanase activity in vitro.We find that the receptor for protease endocytosis in chondrocytes, LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), is unevenly distributed over the cell membrane, often concentrated at the site of cilia assembly. Hypomorphic mutation of IFT88 disturbs this apparent hot spot for protease uptake, increases receptor shedding, and results in a reduced rate of protease clearance from the extracellular space. We propose that IFT88 and/or the cilium regulates the extracellular remodeling of matrix—independently of Hedgehog regulation—by enabling rapid LRP-1–mediated endocytosis of proteases, potentially by supporting the creation of a ciliary pocket. This result highlights new roles for the cilium's machinery in matrix turnover and LRP-1 function, with potential relevance in a range of diseases.—Coveney, C.

https://openalex.org/W2809559332,"The role of dyslipidemia in the development of retinal dysfunction remains poorly understood. Using an animal model of diet-induced obesity/pre-type 2 diabetes, we investigated molecular defects in the retina arising from consumption of a diet high in saturated fats and sugars (i.e., a Western diet). We found that feeding mice a Western diet increased the abundance of retinal sphingolipids, attenuated protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation, enhanced JNK activation, and increased retinal cell death. When we used palmitate or C6-ceramide (Cer) to assess sphingolipid-mediated signaling in cultured murine and human cells, we observed similar effects on Akt, JNK, and cell death. Furthermore, both Western diet and C6-Cer exposure enhanced expression of the stress-response protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) and loss of REDD1 increased C6-Cer-induced JNK activation and cell death. Exogenous REDD1 expression repressed JNK-mediated phosphorylation in cultured cells. We found that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) expression was elevated in REDD1–deficient cell lines and C6-Cer promoted TXNIP expression in both wild-type and REDD1–deficient cells. Likewise, TXNIP knockdown attenuated JNK activation and caspase 3 cleavage after either C6-Cer exposure or REDD1 deletion. The results support a model wherein Cer-induced REDD1 expression attenuates TXNIP-dependent JNK activation and retinal cell death.—Dai, W., Miller, W. P., Toro, A. L., Black, A. J., Dierschke, S.

https://openalex.org/W2808913983,"Dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP)14 (also known as MAP-kinase phosphatase 6) inhibits T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and T-cell-mediated immune responses by inactivation of the TGF-β activated kinase 1 binding protein (TAB1)-TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex and ERK. DUSP14 phosphatase activity is induced by the E3 ligase TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF)2-mediated Lys63-linked ubiquitination. Here we report an interaction between DUSP14 and protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)5 by proximity ligation assay; similarly, DUSP14 directly interacted with TAB1 but not TAK1. DUSP14 is methylated by PRMT5 at arginine 17, 38, and 45 residues. The DUSP14 triple-methylation mutant was impaired in PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation, TRAF2-mediated lysine ubiquitination, and DUSP14 phosphatase activity. Consistently, DUSP14 methylation, TRAF2 binding, and DUSP14 ubiquitination were attenuated by PRMT5 short hairpin RNA knockdown. Furthermore, DUSP14 was inducibly interacted with PRMT5 and was methylated during TCR signaling in T cells. Together, these findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of DUSP14 by which PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation may sequentially stimulate TRAF2-mediated DUSP14 ubiquitination and phosphatase activity, leading to inhibition of TCR signaling.—Yang, C.-Y., Chiu, L.-L., Chang, C.-C., Chuang, H.-C., Tan, T.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2809163922,"The histone H3 variant H3.3 is a highly conserved and dynamic regulator of chromatin organization. Therefore, fully elucidating its nucleosome incorporation mechanisms is essential to understanding its functions in epigenetic inheritance. We previously identified the RNase P protein subunit, Rpp29, as a repressor of H3.3 chromatin assembly. Here, we use a biochemical assay to show that Rpp29 interacts with H3.3 through a sequence element in its own N terminus, and we identify a novel interaction with histone H2B at an adjacent site. The fact that archaeal Rpp29 does not include this N-terminal region suggests that it evolved to regulate eukaryote-specific functions. Oncogenic H3.3 mutations alter the H3.3–Rpp29 interaction, which suggests that they could dysregulate Rpp29 function in chromatin assembly. We also used KNS42 cells, an H3.3(G34V) pediatric high-grade glioma cell line, to show that Rpp29 1) represses H3.3 incorporation into transcriptionally active protein-coding, rRNA, and tRNA genes; 2) represses mRNA, protein expression, and antisense RNA; and 3) represses euchromatic post-translational modifications (PTMs) and promotes heterochromatic PTM deposition (i.e. histone H3 Lys-9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3.1/2/3K27me3). Notably, we also found that K27me2 is increased and K36me1 decreased on H3.3(G34V), which suggests that Gly-34 mutations dysregulate Lys-27 and Lys-36 methylation in cis. The fact that Rpp29 represses H3.3 chromatin assembly and sense and antisense RNA and promotes H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 suggests that Rpp29 regulates H3.3-mediated epigenetic mechanisms by processing a transcribed signal that recruits H3.3 to its incorporation sites.

https://openalex.org/W2808974124,"Insect repellents are widely used to fend off nuisance mosquitoes and, more importantly, to reduce or eliminate mosquito bites in areas where viruses and other vector-borne diseases are circulating. Synthesized more than six decades ago, DEET is the most widely used insect repellent. Plant-derived compounds are used in a plethora of commercial formulations and natural recipes to repel mosquitoes. They are also used as fragrances. We analysed Bombshell® to identify the constituent(s) eliciting a previously reported “off- label” repellence activity. The two major fragrance ingredients in Bombshell, i.e., methyl dihydrojasmonate and lilial, demonstrated strong repellence against the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, in laboratory assays. Both compounds activated a previously identified DEET-sensitive odorant receptor, CquiOR136. These compounds were also major constituents of Ivanka Trump eau de parfum. The methyl dihydrojasmonate content was higher in the Ivanka Trump perfume than in Bombshell, the reverse being true for lilial. Both Bombshell and Ivanka Trump eaux de parfums retained activity for as long as 6 hours in laboratory assays. Although wearing these perfumes may repel nuisance mosquitoes, their use as “off-label” repellents against infected mosquitoes is not recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2808999444,"Dogs are commonly affected with cruciate ligament rupture (CR) and associated osteoarthritis (OA), and frequently develop a second contralateral CR. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a component of whole blood that contains numerous growth factors, which in combination with a collagen scaffold may act to promote bioenhanced primary repair of ligament. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment of partial stable CR stifles with an intra-articular collagen scaffold and PRP would decrease the disease progression, synovitis and risk of complete CR over a 12-month study period. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 29 client-owned dogs with an unstable stifle due to complete CR and stable contralateral stifle with partial CR. All dogs were treated with tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) on the unstable stifle and a single intra-articular application of PRP-collagen in the stable partial CR stifle. Dogs were evaluated at the time of diagnosis, and at 10-weeks and 12-months after treatment. We evaluated correlation between both development of complete CR and time to complete CR with diagnostic tests including bilateral stifle radiographs, 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and bilateral stifle arthroscopy. Additionally, histologic evaluation of synovial biopsies, C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in serum and synovial fluid, and synovial total nucleated cell count, were determined. Results indicated that a single application of PRP-collagen in partial CR stifles of client owned dogs is not an effective disease-modifying therapy for the prevention of progression to complete CR. Radiographic effusion, arthroscopic evaluation of cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) damage, and MR assessment of ligament fiber tearing in partial CR stifles correlated with progression to complete CR over the 12-month follow-up period. We determined that the best predictive model for development of complete CR in PRP-collagen treated partial CR stifles included variables from multiple diagnostic modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2809340407,"Nigeria reports high rates of mortality linked with recurring meningococcal meningitis outbreaks within the African meningitis belt. Few studies have thoroughly described the response to these outbreaks to provide strong and actionable public health messages. We describe how time delays affected the response to the 2016/2017 meningococcal meningitis outbreak in Nigeria.Using data from Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), World Health Organisation (WHO), and situation reports of rapid response teams, we calculated attack and death rates of reported suspected meningococcal meningitis cases per week in Zamfara, Sokoto and Yobe states respectively, between epidemiological week 49 in 2016 and epidemiological week 25 in 2017. We identified when alert and epidemic thresholds were crossed and determined when the outbreak was detected and notified in each state. We examined response activities to the outbreak.There were 12,535 suspected meningococcal meningitis cases and 877 deaths (CFR: 7.0%) in the three states. It took an average time of three weeks before the outbreaks were detected and notified to NCDC. Four weeks after receiving notification, an integrated response coordinating centre was set up by NCDC and requests for vaccines were sent to International Coordinating Group (ICG) on vaccine provision. While it took ICG one week to approve the requests, it took an average of two weeks for approximately 41% of requested vaccines to arrive. On the average, it took nine weeks from the date the epidemic threshold was crossed to commencement of reactive vaccination in the three states.There were delays in detection and notification of the outbreak, in coordinating response activities, in requesting for vaccines and their arrival from ICG, and in initiating reactive vaccination. Reducing these delays in future outbreaks could help decrease the morbidity and mortality linked with meningococcal meningitis outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2809378894,"Falls are the most common cause of injury for older people in the general population as well as among those with intellectual disability. There are many risk factors for falls, including a range of drugs which are considered to be fall-risk-increasing (FRIDs). The aim of the present study was to describe prescription patterns of FRIDs in itself as well as in relation to falls requiring health care among older people with intellectual disability and their age-peers in the general population. Moreover, to investigate possible differences between the two groups.A cohort of people with intellectual disability and a referent cohort, one-to-one-matched by sex and year of birth, were established. Each cohort comprised 7936 people aged 55+ years at the end of 2012. Register data were collected for 2006-2012 on prescription of antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, opioids, and antipsychotics, as well as for fall-related health care contacts. Analyses were performed on yearly data, using repeated measures models.People with intellectual disability were more likely to be prescribed at least one FRID (Relative Risk [RR] 2.31). The increase was highest for antipsychotics (RR 25.0), followed by anxiolytics (RR 4.18), antidepressants (RR 2.72), and hypnotics and sedatives (RR 1.42). For opioids, however, a lower prevalence (RR 0.74) was found. In both cohorts, those with prescription of at least one FRID were more likely to have a fall-related injury that required health care. The increased risk was higher in the referent cohort (RR 3.98) than among people with intellectual disability (RR 2.27), although people with intellectual disability and prescription still had a higher risk of falls than those with prescription in the referent cohort (RR 1.27). A similar pattern was found for all drug groups, except for opioids, where prescription carried the same risk of having a fall-related injury that required health care in both cohorts.With or without prescription of FRIDs, older people with ID have a higher risk of falls requiring health care than their age-peers in the general population. It is important to be aware of this when prescribing drugs that further increase the risk of falls."
https://openalex.org/W2809439837,"GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE3/Shaggy-like kinases (GSKs) represent a highly conserved group of proteins found in all eukaryotes. In plants they are encoded by multigene families and integrate signaling of brassinosteroids, auxin and abscisic acid in wide range of physiological and developmental processes with a strong impact on plant responses to environmental and biotic factors. Based on comprehensively studied structures of 10 Arabidopsis thaliana GSK genes and encoded proteins we report identification and phylogenetic reconstruction of 7 transcriptionally active GSK genes in barley. We re-evaluated annotation of the GSK genes in the current barley genome (Hv_IBSC_PGSB_v2) and provided data that a single gene annotated in the previous barley genome ensemble should be retained in the current one. The novel structure of another GSK, predicted in Hv_IBSC_PGSB_v2 to encode both GSK and amine oxidase domains, was proposed and experimentally confirmed based on the syntenic region in Brachypodium distachyon. The genes were assigned to 4 groups based on their encoded amino acid sequences and protein kinase domains. The analysis confirmed high level of conservation of functional protein domains and motifs among plant GSKs and the identified barley orthologs. Each of the seven identified HvGSK genes was expressed indicating semi-constitutive regulation in all tested organs and developmental stages. Regulation patterns of GSKs from the indicated groups showed a shift in organ-preferential expression in A. thaliana and barley illustrating diversification of biological roles of individual HvGSKs in different plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2808785704,"The CXCR4/CXCL12 axis has been extensively associated with different types of cancer correlating with higher aggressiveness and metastasis. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is involved in the dissemination of malignant B cells and is a marker of poor prognosis. CXCR7 is a chemokine receptor that binds to the same ligand as CXCR4 and regulates de CXCR4-CXCL12 axis. These findings together with the report of CXCR7 prognostic value in several tumor types, led us to evaluate the expression of CXCR7 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma biopsies. Here, we describe that CXCR7 receptor is an independent prognostic factor that associates with good clinical outcome. Moreover, the expression of CXCR7 associates with increased survival in CXCR4+ but not in CXCR4- DLBCL patients. Thus, the combined immunohistochemical evaluation of both CXCR7 and CXCR4 expression in DLBCL biopsies may improve their prognostic value as single markers. Finally, we show that CXCR7 overexpression in vitro is able to diminish DLBCL cell survival and increase their sensitivity to antitumor drugs. Hence, further studies on the CXCR7 receptor may establish its role in DLBCL and the molecular mechanisms that modulate CXCR4 activity."

In the immediate postoperative period, each side was randomly treated in a single-blind method with an LLL at the auriculotherapy points or simulation of its use (contralateral side) over a 21-day interval. This protocol was repeated 24 and 48 hours after surgery. All patients used the same analgesic (paracetamol) but only in case of pain. The primary variable was postoperative pain according to the visual analogue scale, and the secondary variables were mouth opening, edema, local temperature, dysphagia, and the presence of infection (systemic temperature, lymphadenopathy). These variables were evaluated at baseline and at 24 hours, 48 hours and seven days after surgery. Adverse effects were recorded and reported.There was no difference between the groups in relation to any of the evaluated parameters (p>0.05).For this experimental model, application of a low-intensity laser at auriculotherapy points did not prevent postoperative pain following lower third molar surgery.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; the registration number is NCT02657174 and the Unique Protocol ID number is 1.100.869.

https://openalex.org/W2809239945,"Purpose The permeability of the corneal epithelium to fluorescein Pdc is an indicator of the health of the ocular surface. It can be measured in a clinical setting by determining the accumulation of fluorescein in the stroma following administration of the dye on the ocular surface. Here we demonstrate a new multi-drop method for the measurement of Pdc by a spot fluorometer. Methods Twenty-nine healthy participants were recruited for this study. First, a probe-drop of fluorescein (0.35%, 2 μL) was instilled on the conjunctiva. The clearance of the dye from the tears was immediately measured using the fluorometer. Following this, two loading drops (2%; 6 μL each) were administered 10 min apart. Fifteen minutes later, the ocular surface was washed and fluorescence from the stroma Fs was measured. Permeability was calculated using Pdc = (Q x Fs)/ (2 x AUC), where Q is the stromal thickness and AUC is the area under the fluorescence vs. time curve for the loading drops. Results After the probe drop, the tear fluorescence followed an exponential decay (elimination rate constant; kd = 0.41 ± 0.28 per min; 49 eyes of 29 subjects), but the increase in Fs was negligible. However, after the loading drops, the measured Fs was ~ 20-fold higher than the autofluorescence and could be recorded at a high signal to noise ratio (SNR > 40). The intra-subject variability of kd was insignificant. Since fluorescein undergoes concentration quenching at > 0.5%, the value of AUC for the loading drops was estimated by scaling the AUC of the probe drop. The calculated Pdc was 0.54 ± 0.54 nm/sec (n = 49). A Monte Carlo simulation of the model for the multi-drop protocol confirmed the robustness of the estimated Pdc. Conclusions The new multi-drop method can be used in place of the single-drop approach. It can overcome a lack of sensitivity in fluorometers of high axial resolution. The Pdc estimated by the multi-drop method is ~ 11-fold higher than previously reported but closer to the value reported for other drugs with equivalent octanol/water partition coefficient."
https://openalex.org/W2809523642,"The FoxP2 transcription factor and its target genes have been implicated in developmental brain diseases with a prominent language component, such as developmental verbal dyspraxia and specific language impairment. How FoxP2 affects neural circuitry development remains poorly understood. The sushi domain protein SRPX2 is a target of FoxP2, and mutations in SRPX2 are associated with language defects in humans. We have previously shown that SRPX2 is a synaptogenic protein that increases excitatory synapse density. Here we provide the first characterization of mice lacking the SRPX2 gene, and show that these mice exhibit defects in both neural circuitry and communication and social behaviors. Specifically, we show that mice lacking SRPX2 show a specific reduction in excitatory VGlut2 synapses in the cerebral cortex, while VGlut1 and inhibitory synapses were largely unaffected. SRPX2 KO mice also exhibit an abnormal ultrasonic vocalization ontogenetic profile in neonatal pups, and reduced preference for social novelty. These data demonstrate a functional role for SRPX2 during brain development, and further implicate FoxP2 and its targets in regulating the development of vocalization and social circuits."

We investigated if unexpected adverse events (AEs) or unusual patterns of AEs after vaccination were reported among HIV-positive persons. We searched for domestic reports among HIV-positive persons to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1990-2016. We analyzed reports by age group (<19 and ≥19 years), sex, serious or non-serious status, live vaccine type (live versus inactivated), AEs reported, and CD4 counts. Of 532,235 reports received, 353 (0.07%) described HIV-positive persons, of whom 67% were aged ≥19 years, and 57% were male; most reports (75%) were non-serious. The most commonly reported inactivated vaccines were pneumococcal polysaccharide (27%) and inactivated influenza (27%); the mostly reported common live virus vaccines were combination measles, mumps, and rubella (8%) and varicella (6%). Injection site reactions were commonly reported (39%). Of 67 reports with CD4 counts available, 41 (61%) described persons immunocompromised at time of vaccination (CD4 count <500 cells/mm3), and differed from overall reports only in that varicella was the most common live virus vaccine (4 reports). Of 22 reports describing failure to protect against infection, 6 described persons immunocompromised at time of vaccination, among whom varicella vaccine was most common (3 reports). Of 66 reports describing live virus vaccines, 7 described persons with disseminated infection: 6 had disseminated varicella, 3 of whom had vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus. Of 18 reported deaths, 7 resulted from disseminated infection: 6 were among immunocompromised persons, 1 of whom had vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus. We identified no unexpected or unusual patterns of AEs among HIV-positive persons. These data reinforce current vaccine recommendations for this risk group. However, healthcare providers should know their HIV-positive patients' immune status because immunocompromising conditions can potentially increase the risk of rare, but severe, AEs following vaccination with live virus vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2809159791,"Background In the context of road safety, this study aims to examine the prevalence of drug use in a random sample of drivers. Methods A stratified probabilistic sample was designed to represent vehicles circulating on non-urban roads. Random drug tests were performed during autumn 2014 on 521 drivers in Catalonia (Spain). Participation was mandatory. The prevalence of drug driving for cannabis, methamphetamines, amphetamines, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines was assessed. Results The overall prevalence of drug use is 16.4% (95% CI: 13.9; 18.9) and affects primarily younger male drivers. Drug use is similarly prevalent during weekdays and on weekends, but increases with the number of occupants. The likelihood of being positive for methamphetamines is significantly higher for drivers of vans and lorries. Conclusions Different patterns of use are detected depending on the drug considered. Preventive drug tests should not only be conducted on weekends and at night-time, and need to be reinforced for drivers of commercial vehicles. Active educational campaigns should focus on the youngest age-group of male drivers."
https://openalex.org/W2809340254,"The integrity of image content is essential, although most watermarking algorithms can achieve image authentication but not automatically repair damaged areas or restore the original image. In this paper, a self-recovery reversible image watermarking algorithm is proposed to recover the tampered areas effectively. First of all, the original image is divided into homogeneous blocks and non-homogeneous blocks through multi-scale decomposition, and the feature information of each block is calculated as the recovery watermark. Then, the original image is divided into 4×4 non-overlapping blocks classified into smooth blocks and texture blocks according to image textures. Finally, the recovery watermark generated by homogeneous blocks and error-correcting codes is embedded into the corresponding smooth block by mapping; watermark information generated by non-homogeneous blocks and error-correcting codes is embedded into the corresponding non-embedded smooth block and the texture block via mapping. The correlation attack is detected by invariant moments when the watermarked image is attacked. To determine whether a sub-block has been tampered with, its feature is calculated and the recovery watermark is extracted from the corresponding block. If the image has been tampered with, it can be recovered. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively recover the tampered areas with high accuracy and high quality. The algorithm is characterized by sound visual quality and excellent image restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2808808141,"Single cell transcriptome (SCT) analysis provides superior resolution to illustrate tumor cell heterogeneity for clinical implications. We characterized four SCTs of MCF-7 using 143 housekeeping genes (HKGs) as control, of which lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) expression is silenced. These SCT libraries mapped to 11,423, 11,486, 10,380, and 11,306 RefSeq genes (UCSC), respectively. High consistency in HKG expression levels across all four SCTs, along with transcriptional silencing of LDHB, was observed, suggesting a high sensitivity and reproducibility of the SCT analysis. Cross-library comparison on expression levels by scatter plotting revealed a linear correlation and an 83-94% overlap in transcript isoforms and expressed genes were also observed. To gain insight of transcriptional diversity among the SCTs, expressed genes were split into consistently expressed (CE) (expressed in all SCTs) and inconsistently expressed (IE) (expressed in some but not all SCTs) genes for further characterization, along with the 142 expressed HKGs as a reference. Distinct transcriptional strengths were found among these groups, with averages of 1,612.0, 88.0 and 1.2 FPKM for HKGs, CE and IE, respectively. Comparison between CE and IE groups further indicated that expressions of CE genes vary more significantly than that of IE genes. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that proteins encoded by CE genes are mainly involved in fundamental intracellular activities, while proteins encoded by IE genes are mainly for extracellular activities, especially acting as receptors or ion channels. The diversified gene expressions, especially for those encoded by IE genes, may contribute to cancer drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2809064007,"This study aimed to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and the level of knowledge and awareness of its related conditions in a sample of cancer survivor patients. In this cross-sectional survey, a self-reported questionnaire was administered to outpatients aged >20 years with a diagnosis of cancer. This self-reported questionnaire on patient demographic characteristics, disease characteristics, and knowledge and awareness of metabolic syndrome was used as an instrument to assess patient's knowledge of metabolic syndrome. A total of 88 participants were included; of these 34.1% had metabolic syndrome, although only 6.8% of participants were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Over half of the participants had heard about metabolic syndrome; however, 70% of the participants did not know about the blood tests for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome although they were aware of the physical measurements, such as weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference. The highest proportion of correct answers for questions about metabolic syndrome was related to stroke, while the lowest was about cholesterol levels. The proportions of correct answers for selected parameters were as follows: diabetes, 39.1%; adiposity, 47.2%; hypertension, 46.8%; cholesterol levels, 36.7%; arteriosclerosis, 45.5%; myocardial infarction, 37.8%; and stroke, 62.8%. The results suggest that the level of knowledge of metabolic syndrome among the cancer survivors in our sample was poor, although more than one-third of them had metabolic syndrome. Thus, it is essential to educate cancer survivors about metabolic syndrome and its related conditions to improve their overall health and quality of life."

Given the high prevalence and established harmful effects of passive tobacco smoking, this study aimed to estimate of pattern of smoking policies in residential and work place, and to identify the associated socio-economic and demographic correlates in Bangladesh.Secondary data of sample size 9629 collected by the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2010 has been used. Along with descriptive analysis, binary logistic regression model has been used to analyze the socio-demographic and economic correlates to tobacco smoking policy.The prevalence of male and female passive tobacco smokers was 74.3% and 25.8% respectively. Among the passive tobacco smokers, 22.2% reported that smoking was allowed at their home and 29.8% reported that there was no such smoking policy at their home. Alternatively, 26.0% passive tobacco smokers reported that smoking was allowed and 27.5% reported that there was no such smoking policy at their work place. Logistic regression analysis indicated that for tobacco smokers group, the odds of allowing smoking at home was 4.85 times higher than the non-smoker respondent (OR = 4.85, 95% CI = 4.13, 5.71), 1.18 times more likely to be allowed at home in rural areas than urban areas (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.06,1.32) and less for college/university completed and (or) higher educated respondent than no formal schooling (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.24, 0.52). On the other hand, smoking was 1.70 times more likely to be allowed at work place for tobacco smokers than their counter part respondent (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.36, 2.14) and was less likely to be allowed for college/university completed and (or) higher educated respondent (OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.14, 0.45) than respondent with no formal schooling.To reduce the passive smoking, lower educated people and people in urban areas should advocate more about the adverse effect of active and passive tobacco smoking.

Intranasally (IN) delivered live-attenuated vaccines represent the most extensively studied approach for immunization of RSV-naïve infants and children, however, achieving an effective balance of attenuation and immunogenicity has proven challenging. Here we report pre-clinical immunogenicity and efficacy data utilizing a live-attenuated vaccine candidate, RGΔM2-2, which was obtained by deleting the M2-2 open reading frame from the genome of the MSA1 clinical isolate. Intramuscular (IM) administration of RGΔM2-2 in cotton rats induced immunity and protective efficacy that was comparable to that induced by intranasal (IN) immunization. In contrast, the protective efficacy of RGΔM2-2 delivered by the IM route to African green monkeys was substantially reduced as compared to the efficacy following IN administration, despite comparable levels of serum neutralizing antibodies. This result suggests that mucosal immunity may play an important role in RSV protection. The RGΔM2-2 vaccine also demonstrated different attenuation profiles when tested in cotton rats, non-human primates, and a human airway epithelial (HAE) cell model. The data suggest RGΔM2-2 is less attenuated than a similarly designed vaccine candidate constructed on the A2 genetic background. These findings have important implications with regard to both the design and the preclinical safety testing of live-attenuated vaccines."

However, whether there are specific legibility factors in which preterm children demonstrate difficulty remains unknown. In addition, handwriting performance beyond the first grade and the influence of sex on handwriting performance in preterm children are still unclear. We aimed to investigate the influence of prematurity and sex on multiple dimensions of handwriting in grade two and to identify the contributors to performance.Sixty-three preterm (34 boys and 29 girls) and 67 full-term (27 boys and 40 girls) peers in grade two were included. Class teachers were asked to complete the Chinese Handwriting Evaluation Form. A subgroup of 39 preterm children received assessments on intelligence, visual perception, tactile and kinesthetic sensation, and fine motor skills. Their inattention behavior was rated using a maternal self-report with a behavioral scale.Boys born prematurely exhibited poorer performance in the speed dimension than full-term boys (p = 0.008), whereas there was comparable performance in the two groups of girls (p = 0.221). In the dimensions related to legibility, preterm boys (32.4%) had a higher percentage of children with difficulty in the construction dimension than the other groups (preterm girls: 6.9%, full-term boys: 7.4%, full-term girls: 5.0%). However, no group difference was found in the dimensions of accuracy and directionality. Of the sensory-perceptual-motor factors, attention was the most significant predictor of accuracy in performance (p = 0.046) and speed dimensions (p = 0.001) in preterm children.Boys appear to be vulnerable to the adverse impacts of preterm birth in terms of performance in the dimensions of speed and construction in grade two. Based on the significant contribution of attention to handwriting performance in preterm children, assessment and intervention in the area of attention is strongly suggested for preterm children with handwriting problems."
https://openalex.org/W2809217879,"There are numerous reasons to conduct scientific research within protected areas, but research activities may also negatively impact organisms and habitats, and thus conflict with a protected area's conservation goals. We developed a quantitative ecological decision-support framework that estimates these potential impacts so managers can weigh costs and benefits of proposed research projects and make informed permitting decisions. The framework generates quantitative estimates of the ecological impacts of the project and the cumulative impacts of the proposed project and all other projects in the protected area, and then compares the estimated cumulative impacts of all projects with policy-based acceptable impact thresholds. We use a series of simplified equations (models) to assess the impacts of proposed research to: a) the population of any targeted species, b) the major ecological assemblages that make up the community, and c) the physical habitat that supports protected area biota. These models consider both targeted and incidental impacts to the ecosystem and include consideration of the vulnerability of targeted species, assemblages, and habitats, based on their recovery time and ecological role. We parameterized the models for a wide variety of potential research activities that regularly occur in the study area using a combination of literature review and expert judgment with a precautionary approach to uncertainty. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the relationships between model input parameters and estimated impacts to understand the dominant drivers of the ecological impact estimates. Although the decision-support framework was designed for and adopted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for permitting scientific studies in the state-wide network of marine protected areas (MPAs), the framework can readily be adapted for terrestrial and freshwater protected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2808903642,"Correct chromosomal segregation, coordinated with cell division, is crucial for bacterial survival, but despite extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying this remain incompletely understood in mycobacteria. We report a detailed investigation of the dynamic interactions between ParA and ParB partitioning proteins in Mycobacterium smegmatis using microfluidics and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to observe both proteins simultaneously. During growth and division, ParB presents as a focused fluorescent spot that subsequently splits in two. One focus moves towards a higher concentration of ParA at the new pole, while the other moves towards the old pole. We show ParB movement is in part an active process that does not rely on passive movement associated with cell growth. In some cells, another round of ParB segregation starts before cell division is complete, consistent with initiation of a second round of chromosome replication. ParA fluorescence distribution correlates with cell size, and in sister cells, the larger cell inherits a local peak of concentrated ParA, while the smaller sister inherits more homogeneously distributed protein. Cells which inherit more ParA grow faster than their sister cell, raising the question of whether inheritance of a local concentration of ParA provides a growth advantage. Alterations in levels of ParA and ParB were also found to disturb cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2809182294,"Identifying the abnormally high-risk regions in a spatiotemporal space that contains an unexpected disease count is helpful to conduct surveillance and implement control strategies. The EigenSpot algorithm has been recently proposed for detecting space-time disease clusters of arbitrary shapes with no restriction on the distribution and quality of the data, and has shown some promising advantages over the state-of-the-art methods. However, the main problem with the EigenSpot method is that it cannot be adapted to detect more than one spatiotemporal hotspot. This is an important limitation, since, in reality, we may have multiple hotspots, sometimes at the same level of importance. We propose an extension of the EigenSpot algorithm, called Multi-EigenSpot that is able to handle multiple hotspots by iteratively removing previously detected hotspots and re-running the algorithm until no more hotspots are found. In addition, a visualization tool (heatmap) has been linked to the proposed algorithm to visualize multiple clusters with different colors. We evaluated the proposed method using the monthly data on measles cases in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan (Jan 2016- Dec 2016), and the efficiency was compared with the state-of-the-art methods: EigenSpot and Space-time scan statistic (SaTScan). The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting multiple clusters in a spatiotemporal space."
https://openalex.org/W2809230517,"Sanionia uncinata is a dominant moss species in the maritime Antarctic. Due to its high adaptability to harsh environments, this extremophile plant has been considered a good target for studying the molecular adaptation mechanisms of plants to a variety of environmental stresses. Despite the importance of S. uncinata as a representative Antarctic plant species for the identification and characterization of genes associated with abiotic stress tolerance, suitable reference genes, which are critical for RT-qPCR analyses, have not yet been identified. In this report, 11 traditionally used and 6 novel candidate reference genes were selected from transcriptome data of S. uncinata and the expression stability of these genes was evaluated under various abiotic stress conditions using three statistical algorithms; geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The stability ranking analysis selected the best reference genes depending on the stress conditions. Among the 17 candidates, the most stable references were POB1 and UFD2 for cold stress, POB1 and AKB for drought treatment, and UFD2 and AKB for the field samples from a different water contents in Antarctica. Overall, novel genes POB1 and AKB were the most reliable references across all samples, irrespective of experimental conditions. In addition, 6 novel candidate genes including AKB, POB1 and UFD2, were more stable than the housekeeping genes traditionally used for internal controls, indicating that transcriptome data can be useful for identifying novel robust normalizers. The reference genes validated in this study will be useful for improving the accuracy of RT-qPCR analysis for gene expression studies of S. uncinata in Antarctica and for further functional genomic analysis of bryophytes."
https://openalex.org/W2809678859,"Background Improving the knowledge of angiomyolipoma physiopathology might help in refining its pharmacological treatment. We investigated if angiomyolipoma cells have migratory properties, how their growth and motility can be influenced by the hormonal milieu, and if this can be related to a specific gender. Methods Primary cells were isolated from angiomyolipomas surgically resected for therapeutical reasons in a female and in a male patient. The genetic control demonstrated no TSC2 deletion. Bi- (wound healing) and three-dimensional (transwell assay) migration were analyzed in vitro in basal conditions and under the influence of 17- β-estradiol and SDF-1α. Results Treatment up to 72 hours with 17-β-estradiol (0.1–100 nM), tamoxifen (0.2–20 μM) or with both, does not modify angiomyolipoma cells proliferation. On the other hand, SDF-1α and 17-β-estradiol treatment induce a significant motility increase (both bi- and three-dimensional) which becomes evident already after 2 hours of incubation. Angiomyolipoma cells express mRNA coding for SDF-1α and 17-β-estradiol receptors and secrete both the metalloproteases principally involved in malignant phenotype acquisition, i.e. MMP-2 and MMP-9. Conclusion Angiomyolipoma cells behave similarly, despite their different source. Primary angiomyolipoma cells migrate in response to hormonal milieu and soluble factors, and produce active metalloproteases, both aspects being consistent with the theory claiming they can migrate to the lungs (and/or other organs) and colonizing them. No main feature, among the aspects we analyzed, seems to be referable to the gender of origin."
https://openalex.org/W2809161555,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) causes watery diarrhea when colonizing the surface of enterocytes. The translocated intimin receptor (Tir):intimin receptor complex facilitates tight adherence to epithelial cells and formation of actin pedestals beneath EPEC. We found that the host cell adherens junction protein E-cadherin (Ecad) was recruited to EPEC microcolonies. Live-cell and confocal imaging revealed that Ecad recruitment depends on, and occurs after, formation of the Tir:intimin complex. Combinatorial binding experiments using wild-type EPEC, isogenic mutants lacking Tir or intimin, and E. coli expressing intimin showed that the extracellular domain of Ecad binds the bacterial surface in a Tir:intimin-dependent manner. Finally, addition of the soluble extracellular domain of Ecad to the infection medium or depletion of Ecad extracellular domain from the cell surface reduced EPEC adhesion to host cells. Thus, the soluble extracellular domain of Ecad may be used in the design of intervention strategies targeting EPEC adherence to host cells.-Login, F. H., Jensen, H. H., Pedersen, G. A., Amieva, M. R., Nejsum, L. N. The soluble extracellular domain of E-cadherin interferes with EPEC adherence via interaction with the Tir:intimin complex."
https://openalex.org/W2809518256,"Despite the capacity to accumulate ~70% w/w of lipids, commercially produced unicellular green alga A. protothecoides may become compromised due to the high cost of phosphate fertilizers. To address this limitation A. protothecoides was selected for adaptation to conditions of 100× and 5× lower phosphate and peptone, respectively, compared to ‘wild-type media’. The A. protothecoides showed initial signs of adaptation by 45–50 days, and steady state growth at ~100 days. The low phosphate (P)-adapted strain produced up to ~30% greater biomass, while total lipids (~10% w/w) remained about the same, compared to the wild-type strain. Metabolomic analyses indicated that the low P-adapted produced 3.3-fold more saturated palmitic acid (16:0) and 2.2-fold less linolenic acid (18:3), compared to the wild-type strain, resulting in an ~11% increase in caloric value, from 19.5kJ/g for the wild-type strain to 21.6kJ/g for the low P-adapted strain, due to the amounts and composition of certain saturated fatty acids, compared to the wild type strain. Biochemical changes in A. protothecoides adapted to lower phosphate conditions were assessed by comparative RNA-Seq analysis, which yielded 27,279 transcripts. Among them, 2,667 and 15 genes were significantly down- and up-regulated, at >999-fold and >3-fold (adjusted p-value <0.1), respectively. The expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cellular processes such as division, growth, and membrane biosynthesis, showed a trend toward down-regulation. At the genomic level, synonymous SNPs and Indels were observed primarily in coding regions, with the 40S ribosomal subunit gene harboring substantial SNPs. Overall, the adapted strain out-performed the wild-type strain by prioritizing the use of its limited phosphate supply for essential biological processes. The low P-adapted A. protothecoides is expected to be more economical to grow over the wild-type strain, based on overall greater productivity and caloric content, while importantly, also requiring 100-fold less phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2809529464,"Akt kinases are key signaling components in proliferation-competent and post-mitotic cells. Here, we sought to create a conditionally-inducible form of active Akt for both in vitro and in vivo applications. We fused a ligand-responsive Destabilizing Domain (DD) derived from E. coli dihydrofolate reductase to a constitutively active mutant form of Akt1, Akt(E40K). Prior work indicated that such fusion proteins may be stabilized and induced by a ligand, the antibiotic Trimethoprim (TMP). We observed dose-dependent, reversible induction of both total and phosphorylated/active DD-Akt(E40K) by TMP across several cellular backgrounds in culture, including neurons. Phosphorylation of FoxO4, an Akt substrate, was significantly elevated after DD-Akt(E40K) induction, indicating the induced protein was functionally active. The induced Akt(E40K) protected cells from apoptosis evoked by serum deprivation and was neuroprotective in two cellular models of Parkinson's disease (6-OHDA and MPP+ exposure). There was no significant protection without induction. We also evaluated Akt(E40K) induction by TMP in mouse substantia nigra and striatum after neuronal delivery via an AAV1 adeno-associated viral vector. While there was significant induction in striatum, there was no apparent induction in substantia nigra. To explore the possible basis for this difference, we examined DD-Akt(E40K) induction in cultured ventral midbrain neurons. Both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the cultures showed DD-Akt(E40K) induction after TMP treatment. However, basal DD-Akt(E40K) expression was 3-fold higher for dopaminergic neurons, resulting in a significantly lower induction by TMP in this population. Such findings suggest that dopaminergic neurons may be relatively inefficient in protein degradation, a property that could relate to their lack of apparent DD-Akt(E40K) induction in vivo and to their selective vulnerability in Parkinson's disease. In summary, we generated an inducible, biologically active form of Akt. The degree of inducibility appears to reflect cellular context that will inform the most appropriate applications for this and related reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2809102891,"Structural chromosome abnormalities can cause significant negative reproductive outcomes as they typically result in morbidity and mortality of newborns. The prevalence of structural chromosomal abnormalities in live births is at least 0.05%, of which many of them have parental origins. It is uncommon to predict structural chromosome abnormalities at birth in the first child but it is possible to prevent repeated abnormalities through screening and diagnostic programmes. This study will provide an economic analysis of the prenatal detection of these abnormalities.A cost-benefit analysis using a decision analytic model was employed to compare the status quo (doing nothing) with two interventional strategies. The first strategy (Strategy I) is preconceptional screening plus amniocentesis, and the second strategy (Strategy II) is amniocentesis alone. The monetary values in Thai baht (THB) were adjusted to international dollars (I$) using purchasing power parity (PPP) (I$1 = THB 17.60 for the year 2013). The robustness of the results was tested by applying a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.Both diagnostic strategies can reduce approximately 10.7-11.1 births with abnormal chromosomes per 1,000 diagnosed couples. The benefit cost ratios were 1.62 for Strategy I and 1.24 for Strategy II. Net present values per 1,000 diagnoses in couples were I$464,000 for Strategy I and I$267,000 for Strategy II. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that the cost-benefit analysis was sufficiently robust, confirming that both strategies provided higher benefits than costs.Since the benefits of both diagnostic strategies exceeded their costs, both strategies are economical-with Strategy I being more economically attractive. Strategy I is superior to Strategy II because it decreases the risk of normal children potentially dying from the amniocentesis process."
