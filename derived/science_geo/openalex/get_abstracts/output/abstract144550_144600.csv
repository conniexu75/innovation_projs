https://openalex.org/W2062145087,"Stress response elements, which mediate induction of the mouse heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene by several agents, resemble the binding site for the activator protein-1 (Jun/Fos), Maf, and Cap'n'Collar/basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP) families of proteins. In L929 fibroblasts, significant activation of an HO-1 enhancer-reporter fusion gene was observed only with the CNC-bZIP class of proteins with Nrf2 exhibiting the highest level of trans-activation, between 25- and 30-fold. To further examine the role of this factor in HO-1 gene regulation, a dominant-negative mutant, Nrf2M, was generated and conditionally expressed in L929 cells. The mutant protein was detected in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions but did not affect cell growth. Under conditions of Nrf2M overexpression, HO-1 mRNA accumulation in response to heme, cadmium, zinc, arsenite, and tert-butylhydroquinone was inhibited by 85–95%. In contrast, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun decreased L929 cell growth but did not inhibit HO-1 gene activation. Nrf2 does not homodimerize, but CNC-bZIP·small Maf protein heterodimers and Nrf2·Jun protein complexes are proposed to function as trans-activators. Co-expression of Jun proteins or p18, however, had no significant affect or inhibited Nrf2-mediated trans-activation. Taken together, these results implicate Nrf2 in the induction of the HO-1 gene but suggest that the Nrf2 partner in this function is a factor other than p18 or Jun proteins.

Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by the action of biliverdin reductase. The expression of one isoform of heme oxygenase, HO-1, is dramatically stimulated by a variety of agents including the substrate heme, heavy metals, hyperthermia, UV irradiation, and inflammatory cytokines. The realization that most, if not all, HO-1 inducers stimulate production of reactive oxygen species or deplete glutathione levels or both, and the fact that heme is a potent pro-oxidant whereas bilirubin is an equipotent anti-oxidant, has led to the postulate that HO-1 activity is a component of the cellular defense mechanism against oxidant stress. This hypothesis has been experimentally verified by numerous studies using both in vitro and in vivo models of oxidant injury (reviewed in Ref. 1Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). While the induction of HO-1 has been extensively documented and is known to be regulated primarily at the level of gene transcription, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this response is poorly understood. Our analyses of the mouse HO-1 gene have identified two 5′ distal enhancer regions at approximately −4 and −10 kilobase pairs, termed SX2 and AB1, respectively, that mediate transcriptional activation of linked reporter genes in response to multiple agents including heme, heavy metals, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, arsenite, hydrogen peroxide, and lipopolysaccharide (2Alam J.

Biol. 1995; 13: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Each enhancer region contains multiple copies of a cis-acting element, termed the stress response element (StRE) (1Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar) that are essential for inducer-dependent gene activation. The consensus StRE, (T/C)GCTGAGTCA, resembles the consensus binding site, TGA(C/G)TCA, for the AP-1 class of transcription factors, comprised of homo- and heterodimers of the Jun and Fos families of proteins, and we initially proposed that such factors were responsible for HO-1 gene activation (2Alam J. Den Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21894-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25049-25056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This prediction was based on, among other reasons, the observations that AP-1 proteins bound to individual StREs, that the DNA binding of c-Jun·c-Fos heterodimer is subjected to redox regulation, and that expression and activities of some members of the Jun and Fos family of protein are stimulated by many of the same agents that induce HO-1 expression. A role for AP-1 proteins in HO-1 gene regulation is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that pharmacological inhibition of AP-1 activity attenuates interleukin-1α- or tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated induction of HO-1 mRNA levels in human endothelial cells (7Terry C.M Clikeman J.A. Hoidal J.R. Callahan K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H883-H891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ectopic expression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun inhibits arsenite-mediated activation of the chicken HO-1 promoter in hepatoma cells (8Elbirt K.K. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J Bonkovsky H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8922-8931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The consensus StRE also resembles the optimal recognition sequences, TGCTGAGTCAGCA (9Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (T/C)GCTGA(G/C)TCA(C/T) (10Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), of the v-Maf oncoprotein and of NF-E2, respectively. The v-Maf oncoprotein, encoded by the avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma virus AS42 (11Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), is the founding member of the Maf family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, of which six cellular members have also been identified to date. Maf factors, like Jun and Fos proteins, contain the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain for DNA binding and dimerization. Three of the Maf members, the small Maf proteins, lack apparent trans-activation domains. NF-E2, an erythroid-specific transcription factor that is required for β-globin synthesis in mouse erythroleukemia cells (12Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), is a heterodimer of an erythroid-specific 45-kDa subunit (p45) and an ubiquitous polypeptide (p18), later identified as the small Maf protein, MafK (10Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 13Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Vani K. Leung S. Epstein A. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Other CNC-bZIP polypeptides homologous to p45 have been identified, including Nrf1 (16Chan J.Y. Han H.-L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), Nrf2 (17Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), and Nrf3 (18Kobayashi A. Ito E. Toki T. Kogame K. Takahashi S. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6443-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), which, unlike p45, are more widely expressed. Maf polypeptides resemble Jun proteins in that they can homodimerize, whereas the CNC-bZIP proteins, like Fos family members, can only form obligatory heterodimers, most prominently with the small Maf factors. The optimal recognition sequences for v-Maf and NF-E2, as noted above, are extended AP-1 binding sites. The 3-base pair extension, (T/C)GC, is critical for high affinity binding of these factors to their target sequences. In a recent report (19Inamdar N.M. Ahn Y.I. Alam J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that mutation of this 3-base extension in the context of the StRE, while leaving intact the AP-1 heptad, abolished activation of a linked reporter gene in response to heme and cadmium, suggesting that factors other than AP-1 proteins are responsible for this induction. In the present report, we provide data that implicate Nrf2 in inducer-dependent activation of the HO-1 gene. Restriction endonucleases and other DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from either Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs. Radiolabeled nucleotides were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Heme (as hemin chloride) was purchased from Porphyrin Products. Enzymes and reagents for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and luciferase assays were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Mammalian expression plasmids were kindly provided by Drs. Stuart Orkin (p45, Nrf2, p18, and p18M), Mark Kerppola (c-Maf), and Tom Curran (c-Fos). cDNA clones were kindly provided by Dr. Minami Matsui (Fra-1 and Fra-2) or purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and the appropriate cDNA fragments were cloned downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat in the mammalian expression vector pRSV. Plasmids for tetracycline-dependent mammalian gene expression (pUHD15.1 and pUHD10–3) were kindly provided by Dr. Herman Bujard. The dominant-negative mutants of Nrf2 and c-Jun, Nrf2M and c-JunM, were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the respective mouse cDNAs with oligonucleotide pairs 5′-GCACGCGGCCGCCATGGGTGAATCCCAATG-3′ and 5′-CCTCCGGATCCTAGTTTTTCTTTGTATCTG-3′ and 5′-GCACGCGGCCGCCATGGTCTACGCCAACCT-3′ and 5′-ACAGTGGATCCTCAAAACGTTTGCAACTGC-3′, respectively. The amplification products were cloned downstream of the elongation factor-1α promoter (in plasmid pEF) or the tetracycline operator (in plasmid pUHDBG (20Wei P. Ahn Y.I. Housley P.R. Alam J. Vedeckis W.V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a variant of pUHD10–3). Plasmid pCMVβ-gal was kindly provided by Dr. Ping Wei. Plasmids pT109luc (21Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) and pRSVluc encode the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter and the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, respectively. Plasmid pSX2Δ44luc was generated by replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in pSX2Δ44cat (4Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25049-25056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the luciferase gene. Mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 and fibroblast L929 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.45% glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. The L929 subclone E8.T4 (20Wei P. Ahn Y.I. Housley P.R. Alam J. Vedeckis W.V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was cultured in the same medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml Geneticin (G418 sulfate) and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Transient and stable transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously (4Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25049-25056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for transient assays, cells were seeded (∼5 × 105/60-mm plate) 16 h prior to transfection. Cells were exposed to the DNA-CaPO4 precipitate for 6 h, shocked by a 1-min treatment with 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured for an additional 24 h in complete medium. Preparation of cell extracts and measurement of CAT and luciferase activities were carried out as described previously (2Alam J. Den Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21894-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light (Tropix, Inc.) Chemiluminescent assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. To generate stable transfectants, E8.T4 or L929 cells were plated (1 × 106/10-cm plate) and transfected as described above with 13 μg of pUHDBG/Nrf2M plus 2 μg of pCEP4 (Invitrogen Corp.) or with 15 μg of pEF/c-JunM, respectively. E8.T4 and L929 transfectants were selected over a 3-week period in the presence of hygromycin (400 μg/ml) or G418 (800 μg/ml), respectively. Individual clones were isolated by limited dilution. Total RNA was isolated by the procedure of Sacchi and Chozymski (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (23Alam J. Shibahara S. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6371-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For RNA dot blot analysis, 5 μg of total RNA was transferred to Zeta-Probe (Bio-Rad) nylon membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization and washing conditions for dot blots were identical to those for Northern blots. α-32P-Radiolabeled hybridization probes were generated by random priming of the rat HO-1 (24Shibahara S. Muller R. Taguchi H. Yoshida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7865-7869Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), mouse c-Jun, chicken β-actin (25Cleveland D.W.

Biol. 1998; 64: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) genomic fragments. Hybridization signals were quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). After signal quantization, the membranes were stripped and re-hybridized to the β-actin probe. Relative mRNA levels (see Figs. 5 and 6) were calculated after correcting for RNA loading by normalizing the primary hybridization signal with the β-actin signal.Figure 6A, inhibition of c-Jun-mediated trans-activation by c-JunM.

Total cellular extracts were prepared from clones transfected with the empty expression plasmid (N) or with pEF/c-JunM (clone no. indicated). Western blot analysis was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the filter was exposed to film for 5 min. The size (kDa) and migration of the molecular mass standards are indicated. The bands between 40 and 46 kDa presumably represent endogenous Jun proteins. C, expression of c-JunM decreases the rate of cell proliferation. Control (Neo) or c-JunM-expressing cells were cultured in 10% or 2% fetal bovine serum, and cell growth was quantified as described in the legend to Fig. 3. D, expression of c-JunM does not inhibit induction of the HO-1 gene. Cell treatment and RNA dot blot analysis were carried out as described in the legends to Figs. 4 and 5. The probe fragment used to detect endogenous c-Jun mRNA was derived from the 5′ end of the c-Jun cDNA and does not hybridize to c-JunM transcripts. The data bars represent the average of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Confluent cells from one 60-mm plate were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 100–200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) and left on ice for 10 min. Cytoplasmic extracts were separated from the nuclei by centrifugation. Nuclear and whole cell extracts were prepared by direct lysis in 1× electrophoresis sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Twenty microgram samples were size-fractionated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and protein blot analysis was carried out using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Antibodies to Nrf2 and c-Jun were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at dilutions recommended by the manufacturer. Members of the AP-1 (2Alam J. Den Z. J. Biol.

Stewart, unpublished observations. families of proteins bind to one or more of the StREs in the HO-1 gene enhancers. The role, if any, of these sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins in HO-1 gene transcriptional regulation was examined by transient trans-activation assays. L929 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding individual factors and an SX2-dependent CAT reporter gene construct. The effect of the factors on SX2 transcription activity was assessed by measurement of CAT activity in cell extracts. Of the AP-1 family members tested, only the combination of c-Jun and c-Fos increased SX2 activity (∼1.5-fold) (Fig. 1). Individual members decreased enhancer activity to varying degrees (20–60% of basal level). c-Maf did not alter SX2 activity, whereas small Maf/p18 inhibited SX2-dependent transcription by approximately 90%. Only members of the CNC-bZIP family of proteins exhibited significant trans-activation (≥5-fold) with Nrf2 increasing SX2 activity between 25- and 30-fold. To further characterize the role of Nrf2 in HO-1 gene regulation, we devised a methodology to inhibit Nrf2 function. Nrf2, like Jun proteins, contains an N-terminal transcription activation domain and C-terminal dimerization and DNA-binding domains (17Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Deletion of the transcription activation domain of c-Jun results in a protein that functions as a dominant-negative mutant by virtue of homodimerization with c-Jun and heterodimerization with c-Jun partners. While Nrf2 does not homodimerize (Refs. 17Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 27Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, and 28Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16490-16497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar; see below), we reasoned that a similar mutant of Nrf2 could inhibit Nrf2 function by sequestering Nrf2 dimerization partner(s) and competing for Nrf2 recognition sequences. We, therefore, generated a mutant of Nrf2, Nrf2M, lacking the activation domain by deleting amino acid residues 1–392 (numbering as in Ref. 29Chui D.H.K. Tang W. Orkin S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The effect of Nrf2M on Nrf2 function was assessed in transient trans-activation assays. As shown in Fig. 2, overexpression of Nrf2M completely blocked Nrf2-mediated trans-activation of the SX2 enhancer in both L929 and E8.T4 cells. In the latter cells, CAT activity was reduced below basal values. To examine the effect of the Nrf2 dominant-negative mutant on HO-1 gene induction, we generated L929 clones stably expressing Nrf2M. Because of the possibility that inhibition of the Nrf2 transcription factor would affect cell proliferation or viability, Nrf2M was expressed in a regulated manner. DNA encoding Nrf2M was cloned downstream of tet operator (tet O) sequences in plasmid pUHDBG (20Wei P. Ahn Y.I. Housley P.R. Alam J. Vedeckis W.V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The resultant clone, pUHDBG/Nrf2M was stably transfected into E8.T4 cells, a subclone of L929 cells that expresses the tetracycline (Tc)-regulated trans-activator (30Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), a chimeric transcription factor that regulates gene expression via tet O sequences and whose activity is inhibited in the presence of Tc. Six individual transfectants (N1–N6) were isolated and examined for Tc-regulated gene expression by RNA dot blot analysis using a rabbit β-globin probe. (β-Globin sequences, present in pUHDBG, are fused downstream of the Nrf2M translation termination site and provide stability to the chimeric transcript.) All six clones exhibited Tc-dependent regulation of the Nrf2M/β-globin chimera (Fig. 3 A). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from N2 cells using an Nrf2 probe identified an Nrf2M transcript of the predicted size (approximately 750 bases) and the endogenous Nrf2 mRNA of 2.4 kilobases (Fig. 3 B). The level of Nrf2M mRNA was regulated by doxycycline, a tetracycline analogue, in a dose-dependent manner over a range of approximately 100-fold. The Nrf2M protein was detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and migrated at a size corresponding to 27 kDa (predicted size of 22.5 kDa) (Fig. 3 C). The predicted size of the native Nrf2 protein is 72 kDa, but the protein may migrate anomalously above 90 kDa on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (17Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Multiple, faint bands were observed in this region after longer exposure of the Western blots (data not shown). The rates of growth of N2 and N5 cells were not significantly different in the absence (Nrf2M overexpression) or presence of 1 μg/ml Tc in the culture media (Fig. 3 D) and were similar to that of the parental E8.T4 cells (data not shown). To determine if Nrf2M overexpression and, by inference, inhibition of Nrf2 function, affects HO-1 gene regulation, N2 cells were grown in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml Tc and treated with various HO-1 inducers, including heme, cadmium, zinc, arsenite, and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ). HO-1 gene induction was assessed by measuring HO-1 mRNA levels in Northern and dot blot analyses (Figs. 4 and5). In the presence of Tc (i.e. undetectable expression of Nrf2M), these agents increased the steady-state amount of HO-1 mRNA by 15–90-fold above basal levels. The magnitude of inductions is similar to that observed in the parental E8.T4 and wild-type L929 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of Nrf2M (−Tc) inhibited HO-1 mRNA accumulation by all inducers tested by 85–90%. The basal level of HO-1 mRNA was not altered. Some of the HO-1 inducers, metals in particular, activate the c-jun and metallothionein genes. These inductions, however, were not affected by Nrf2M, indicating differences in gene activation mechanisms. Similar results were observed with N5 cells (data not shown). For comparative purposes we also generated a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun, c-JunM, lacking the N-terminal activation domain (residues 1–148), which is similar to one previously described (31Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). As expected of a dominant-negative protein, c-JunM inhibited c-Jun-mediated trans-activation of a reporter gene (Fig. 6 A). Initial attempts to develop an E8.T4 cell line conditionally expressing c-JunM were unsuccessful, so we subsequently transfected L929 cells with a plasmid permitting constitutive expression of the mutant protein. Of 12 G418-resistant colonies selected, 9 clones survived during subsequent culturing, two of which, cJM-9 and cJM-11, expressed the mutant protein at high levels (Fig. 6 B). Compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (“Neo” cells), cJM-9 and cJM-11 cells exhibited reduced rates of proliferation, particularly at lower levels of serum (Fig. 6 C). The decrease in cell growth correlated with a 30–50% reduction in nuclear AP-1 DNA binding activity, as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). In contrast to Nrf2M, expression of c-JunM did not inhibit HO-1 mRNA induction by any of the agents tested (Fig. 6 D). Indeed, c-JM-9 and c-JM-11 cells exhibited a bias toward increased levels of HO-1 mRNA accumulation. An opposite tendency was observed with respect to c-Jun mRNA levels under basal conditions and in response to the agents tested (Fig. 6 D). Based on the sequence of its leucine zipper domain, Nrf2 is not expected to form homodimers (17Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), however, can bind DNA and are reported to function as transcription activators. Similarly, using in vitro synthesized proteins in electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions, the Nrf2·p18 heterodimer exhibited avid binding to the HO-1 StRE, but no such binding was observed with Nrf2 and c-Jun co-translation products or any of the individual proteins (data not shown). The lack of DNA binding by Nrf2 and c-Jun co-translation products is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that an uncharacterized cytosolic factor is required for Nrf2·c-Jun complex formation and/or DNA binding activity (32Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). To determine if the trans-activation of the SX2 enhancer by Nrf2 (see Fig. 1) is due to Nrf2·p18 heterodimers, we examined the effect of p18 on the Nrf2-independent and Nrf2-dependent expression of pSX2Δ44luc in transient transfection assays. In the absence of exogenous Nrf2 (Fig. 7 A, −Nrf2), p18 decreased luciferase activ"

Expression of the catalytic component of human telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), extends the life span of human fibroblasts and retinal pigment epithelial cells beyond senescence without causing neoplastic transformation (Bodnar, A.

Here, we show that both human large vessel and microvascular endothelial cells also bypass replicative senescence after introduction of hTERT. For the first time, we report that hTERT expression in these life-extended vascular cells does not affect their differentiated and functional phenotype and that these cells maintain their angiogenic potential in vitro. Furthermore, hTERT(+) microvascular endothelial cells have normal karyotype, and hTERT(+) endothelial cell strains do not exhibit a transformed phenotype. Relative to parental cells at senescence, hTERT-expressing endothelial cells exhibit resistance to induction of apoptosis by a variety of different conditions. Such characteristics are highly desirable for designing vascular transplantation and gene therapy delivery systems in vivo.

Aging of the vasculature is also associated with a number of phenotypic and hemodynamic changes commonly observed in cardiovascular disease states (3Cooper L.T. Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. J.

Some of these phenotypic alterations have been found to occur in ECs undergoing senescence in vitro and include increased expression of proteolytic activity (5West M.D. Arch.

Barnathan E.S. McCrae K.R. Hug B.A. Schmidt A.M. Stern D.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3527-3561PubMed Google Scholar), but ECs can be activated to proliferate, e.g. following traumatic injury, inflammation, and tumor formation or in response to physiologic cues during hair growth and ovarian cycling (15Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 16Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). This property has allowed the in vitro cultivation and expansion of ECs from many different tissues. Like most human somatic cells, however, ECs undergo replicative senescence in vitro after a finite number of divisions, which can vary between 20 and 60 population doublings (PDLs) depending on the tissue of origin and culture conditions (17Bicknell R. Bicknell R. Endothelial Cell Culture. Cambridge University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1996: xiiGoogle Scholar). Efforts to extend the life of ECs have focused on ectopic expression of viral oncogenes (18Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest.

Cambridge University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1996: xiiGoogle Scholar). One EC-specific growth factor, vascular endothelial cell growth factor has been shown to both delay the onset of human dermal microvascular EC (HDMEC) senescence (23Watanabe Y. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Ajioka I. Dvorak H.F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and block anoikis (anchorage disruption-induced apoptosis) by producing a permissive matrix that supports EC adhesion and proliferation (24Watanabe Y. Dvorak H.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). ECs will eventually undergo replicative senescence regardless of exogenous growth factors and matrix components unless they are transformed. Immortal EC lines generated by viral or spontaneous transformation, however, invariably fail to exhibit physiologic distal proliferative signaling pathways and eventually lose important differentiated EC functions. Another way to bypass senescence has recently been achieved by ectopic expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, which imparts replicative immortality to fibroblasts and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (25Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar) without converting to a neoplastic transformed phenotype (26Jiang X. Jimenez G. Chang E. Frolkis M. Kusler B. Sage M.

Wright W. Shay J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). A recent finding that both hTERT expression and inactivation of pRb or p16 is required to immortalize primary human keratinocytes and mammary epithelial cells raises the issue of cell type specificity in hTERT-mediated immortalization (28Kiyono T. Foster S.A. Koop J.I. McDougall J.K. Galloway D.A. Klingelhutz A.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that both large and small vessel-derived ECs, like dermal fibroblasts, can be effectively immortalized by hTERT alone in the absence of malignant transformation. In addition, we show for the first time that hTERT-immortalized ECs exhibit functional and morphogenetic characteristics of parental cells. These hTERT-EC lines may also display a survival advantage beyond the hurdling of replicative senescence, as they appear to be more resistant to programmed cell death. Such characteristics may be useful in the design of vascular model systems and therapeutic stratagies for treating age-related diseases of the vasculature. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were given as a gift from Drs. Thomas Maciag (Maine Medical Center) and Susan Garfinkel (American Red Cross). Human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVECs) came from Vascular Endothelial Cell (VEC) Laboratories. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), human coronary arterial endothelial cells (HCAECs), and part of HDMECs for making hTERT1 were purchased from Clonetics. hTERT3 was established in our laboratory by preparation of primary HDMECs from neonatal foreskin as described previously (29Karasek M.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 93 Suppl. 2: 33S-38SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Romero L.I. Zhang D.N. Herron G.S. Karasek M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Growth media were from EBM-2 (or EBM) MV BulletKit (Clonetics). Our primary parental HDMECs for hTERT3 was purified with PECAM-coated beads (Sigma) and recovered with a magnetic particle concentrator (Promega). A spontaneously transformed HUVEC line, ECV304, was obtained from ATCC. Gene transfer was achieved by either electroporation-based transfection or retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. For electroporation, pZeoSV-hTERT, a derivative of pZeoSV (Invitrogen) was used to transfect HUVECs (25Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar). Two different versions of retroviruses were used to transduce hTERT genes to the ECs. pBabe-hTERT (a generous gift from Dr. Woody Wright, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) was used for HAECs, HCAECs, and HSVECs (31Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar) and LZRS-hTERT was used for HDMECs (32Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The expression of hTERT for both retroviral vectors was driven by Mololey murine leukemia virus 5′-long terminal repeat promoter. Viral titers determined by the infection of NIH-3T3 cells with pBabe-hTERT or LZRS vector containing enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene were estimated at approximately 5 × 106/ml. Either a non-amplified conventional standard (33Kim N.W. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) or a PCR-ELISA-based assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to measure the telomerase activity from the hTERT transgene or endogenous telomerase. The standard protocol was used for HUVECs, HAECs, HCAECs and HSVECs, whereas PCR-ELISA was used for HDMECs. For visualizing the DNA ladder with the standard protocol, 1000 or 5000 cell equivalents were analyzed. For PCR-ELISA, 2000 cell equivalents were used. The PCR-ELISA protocol was provided by the assay kit manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Isolation of genomic DNA and Southern blot determination of mean terminal restriction fragment (TRF) were performed according to published procedures (34Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4665) Google Scholar, 35Allsopp R.C. Vaziri H. Patterson C. Goldstein S. Younglai E.V. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genet. 1993; 52: 661-667PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA (3 μg) was digested with Hin fI/Rsa I and run on 0.6% agarose gel. The gel was transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane, which was hybridized at 65 °C overnight. Hybridization signals were detected by chemiluminescence or radioactivity. Calculation of mean TRF length was done as described previously (37Levy M.Z. Allsopp R.C. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) The primers for RT-PCR were as follows: 1) in the hTERT gene, sense, CACCTCACCCACGCGAAAA; antisense, CCAAAGAGTTTGCGACGCATGTT; and 2) at the border of hTERT and retroviral LZRS sequence, sense, TCCTGAAAGCCAAGAACGCA; antisense, GACCAACTGGTAATGGTAGCGA. Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RT-PCR was performed by a one-step RT-PCR system according to the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The antibodies used for flow cytometry were anti-PECAM-1 (Becton Dickinson), ICAM-1 (Pharmingen), and Apo2.7 (Immunotech). For stimulated expression studies (e.g. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin) cells were stimulated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 15 h before the assay. For detection of the early apoptotic mitochondrial protein 7A6, monoclonal antibody Apo2.7 (38Koester S.K. Roth P. Mikulka W.R. Schlossman S.F. Zhang C. Bolton W.E. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) reactivity was measured after the cells were treated with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) + actinomycin D (1 μg/ml), lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml) + cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), or UVC light (255 nm for 0.3 min) 16 h prior to the experiments. Another group of cells were serum-starved for 40 h. The cells were incubated with either phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated primary antibody or unconjugated primary antibody + phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated secondary antibody at 37 °C. For the annexin V assay, we used all reagents and protocols according to the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The data were collected and analyzed with CellQuest (Becton Dickinson) or Coulter EPICS Elite ESP system. The procedure was as follows. 1) Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products) was placed on ice and allowed to thaw overnight at 4 °C. 350 μl of Matrigel was layered onto a prechilled well of a six-well plate and then placed in an incubator at 37 °C for 30 min until solidified. Parental HUVECs, transformed ECV304 cells, or hTERT-HUVECs (3.5 × 105 cells) in M199, 15% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml heparin, 16 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) (Roche Biomolecules) were seeded onto the matrix and allowed to incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. 2) Primary or hTERT-transduced HDMECs were overlaid with a 1:1 mixture of Vitrogen 100 (Collagen Biomaterials) and 2× Iscove's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Solidification of the collagen gel occurred 30 min after neutralization with NaOH, followed by incubation at 37 °C. Plates were photographed at 8 and 24 h using a Zeiss inverted microscope. Cells were cultured in 48-well plates and maintained at confluence for 2 days before the assay. The reagents and protocols were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Briefly, plates were centrifuged for 10 min at 200 × g, and supernatants were removed. Cells were then lysed for 30 min at room temperature, and plates were recentrifuged. 10% (v/v) of the supernatant was used for incubation with anti-histone-biotin and anti-DNA-peroxidase. After 2 h of incubation, plates were washed three times and incubated with substrate solution. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Following mitotic arrest with Colcemid®, monolayer cell cultures in log-phase growth were harvested by standard cytogenetic methods of trypsin dispersal, hypotonic shock with 0.075 m KCl, and fixation with 3:1 methanol/acetic acid fixative (39Barch M.J. Knutsen T. The AGT Cytogenetics Laboratory Manual, Vol. xiii. Lippincott-Raven, New York1997: 666Google Scholar). Mitotic cells slide preparations were analyzed by the GTW banding method (40Seabright M. Lancet. 1971; 2: 971-972Abstract PubMed Scopus (4206) Google Scholar). SA β-galactosidase staining was performed as previously published (41Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary early passage or senescent and hTERT(+) ECs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline twice and incubated in SA β-galactosidase stain solution overnight. Color pictures were taken with Zeiss inverted microscope. Primary and hTERT-infected ECs were incubated in growth medium containing 10 μg/ml of DiI-labeled acetylated LDL (Molecular Probes) for 4 h at 37 °C. The culture plates were then observed under an inverted Zeiss microscopy equipped with a rhodamine filter. Western analysis for pRb was performed as we previously described (26Jiang X. Jimenez G. Chang E. Frolkis M. Kusler B. Sage M. Beeche M. Bodnar A. Wahl G. TlstyTlsty T. Chiu C.-P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The antibody to pRb (PharMingen) recognizes both hyper- and hypophosphorylated forms of the proteins. Cells were resuspended at 1 × 104 cells/ml in growth medium containing 0.36% agar (Difco). Cell suspension (5 ml) was added to 60-mm plates (Costar) precoated with 0.9% solid agar (5 ml). We counted colonies composed of 40 or more cells after 2–6 weeks. Our previous studies showed that ectopic expression of recombinant hTERT reconstituted telomerase efficiently in both dermal fibroblasts and RPE (25Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have expressed hTERT in HUVECs by stable transfection and in HAECs, HCAECs, HSVECs, and HDMECs by retroviral transduction. The characteristic DNA ladder of the TRAP assay indicates specific telomerase activity in a representative HUVEC-hTERT clone and transduced HAEC-hTERT and HDMEC-hTERT mass cell cultures (Fig.1 A). A quantitative PCR-ELISA-TRAP shows that telomerase activity of hTERT(+) HDMECs is maintained for over 100 PDLs, and the level of telomerase activity achieved in HDMECs is comparable to that expressed by the 293 human embryonic kidney tumor cell line (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, parental HDMECs expressed a low level of endogenous telomerase transiently at early PDLs, consistent with previous reports (42Hsiao R. Sharma H.W. Ramakrishnan S. Keith E. Narayanan R. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR, we have also confirmed the presence of hTERT RNA transcribed from the transduced retroviral vector at PDL 60 in HDMECs (data not shown). Table I summarizes the maximal PDL number attained for each of the five hTERT(+) EC lines. Different parental EC strains senesced at different PDLs, exhibiting typical flattened cell morphology and unresponsiveness to growth factors (Fig.2) and showed marked SA β-galactosidase staining (Table II). By contrast, all hTERT-EC lines resembled young primary ECs in their morphology and growth response, with little or no staining with SA β-galactosidase activity. Thus, ectopic expression of hTERT in ECs extended the replicative life span of all EC strains examined to over twice that of primary ECs, technically defining these hTERT-EC lines as immortalized (43Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Exp.

To examine the effects of hTERT expression on EC telomeres, we assessed telomere lengths by TRF Southern analysis (see under “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 1 C shows the change in telomere length of hTERT(+) HDMEC mass cell cultures as a function of PDL. Telomere shortening was observed up to PDL 100–120 followed by consistent stabilization at approximately 3–4 kbp. Analysis in four different hTERT-HUVEC clones showed similar results, with TRF stabilization at approximately 2.5 kbp by PDL 100–140 (Fig. 1 D). Baseline expression of von Willebrand factor and CD31(PECAM-1) and cytokine-stimulated cell surface expression of inflammatory adhesion molecules, ICAM, VCAM, and E-selectin are regarded as key markers distinguishing ECs from other cell types both in vivo and in vitro (14Cines D.B.

Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar), a protein designed to short circuit the redox proton pumps in order to generate heat and dissipate energy. UCP1 was identified from functional studies on brown adipose tissue mitochondria (2Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar) and was one of the first membrane proteins to be sequenced (3Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For many years it was thought that UCP was expressed solely in mammalian brown adipose tissue; however, it now turns out that Nature has engineered at least five uncoupling proteins. In 1995, a plant uncoupling protein was discovered and later sequenced (4Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Nature. 1995; 375: 24Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Laloi M.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). UCP2 maps to regions of human chromosome 11 and mouse chromosome 7 that have been linked to hyperinsulinemia and obesity, and it is hypothesized that UCP2 is the peripheral target for energy dissipation in the regulation of body weight. UCP2 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, whereas UCP3 is expressed primarily in glycolytic skeletal muscle in humans and may account for the thermogenic effect of thyroid hormone (11Gong D.-W. He Y. Karas M. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24129-24132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). These aspects of this rapidly emerging area of research have been nicely reviewed by Boss et al. (12Boss O. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.-P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Virtually nothing is known about the transport functions of UCP2 and UCP3, and their putative physiological functions have been deduced primarily from their striking sequence identities with UCP1 (12Boss O. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.-P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To address this problem, we expressed human UCP2 and UCP3 in Escherichia coli, where they accumulated in inclusion bodies. Following detergent extraction, we reconstituted the proteins into liposomes and measured H+ and K+ fluxes. Purified UCP2 and UCP3 both catalyzed electrophoretic flux of protons and alkylsulfonates, and proton flux exhibited an obligatory requirement for fatty acids. We also found that FA-dependent proton transport by UCP2 and UCP3 was inhibited by purine nucleotides, albeit with lower apparent affinities for nucleotides than those observed with UCP1. From these results, we conclude that UCP2 and UCP3 are functional uncoupling proteins and that their biophysical properties are consistent with a physiological role in energy dissipation. UCPs were expressed in yeast as described previously (13Murdza-Inglis D.L. Patel H.V. Freeman K.B. Ježek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Briefly, the Sac I/Sph I fragments from M13mp19 plasmid containing wild-type rat UCP1 cDNA were subcloned into Sac I/Sph I-cut pCGS110 E. coli/S. cerevisiae shuttle vector. The S. cerevisiae strain JB516 (MATa, ura3, ade1, leu2, his4, gal+) was transformed with the shuttle vector construct and plated on uracil-lacking selective plates. The resulting yeast transformants were grown at 30 °C in selective medium, and overexpression of UCP1 was induced by the addition of 0.2% galactose (13Murdza-Inglis D.L. Patel H.V. Freeman K.B.

Human UCP2 and human UCP3 open reading frames were amplified by PCR and inserted into the Nde I and Not I sites of the pET21a vector (Novagen). From DNA sequencing, the constructs are predicted to encode proteins with an amino acid sequence identical to the wild-type UCP2 or UCP3 proteins (6Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Shyjan A.W.

Transformed cells were grown at 30 °C to A600 = 0.6 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 6 h. Cells from a 700-ml culture were lysed in a French press in 20 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol); the lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min; and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min. 1-ml aliquots of the supernatant were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min in a microcentrifuge, and the resulting pelleted inclusion bodies were stored frozen at −70 °C.

The pelleted inclusion bodies (about 2 mg of protein) were suspended and washed three times in wash buffer (tetraethylammonium (TEA+) salts of 0.15 mphosphate, 25 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8). The final pellet was solubilized in 0.4 ml of 50 mm TEA-TES, pH 7.2, containing 1.5% sodium lauroylsarcosinate (SLS). The extract was supplemented with 10 mg/ml asolectin and 3% octylpentaoxyethylene (C8E5 detergent) and then dialyzed for 15 h against 3 × 400 ml of extraction buffer (TEA+ salts of 50 mm TES and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) to remove SLS. In the first two dialysis periods (1 and 13 h), the extraction buffer was supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.03% sodium azide. These were removed from the final dialysis (1 h). Aliquots of the dialyzed extract, containing about 0.2 mg of protein, were stored at −20 °C. Reconstitutions were carried out as described previously for UCP1 (16Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Sun X. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 266: 331-348Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (UCP1) or soybean phospholipids (UCP2 and UCP3) were supplemented with cardiolipin (2 mg/ml), dried, and stored under nitrogen. Internal medium (TEA+ salts of TES (30 mm), SO4 (80 mm), and EDTA (1 mm), pH 7.2) was added to give a final concentration of 40 mg of phospholipid/ml of proteoliposome stock. The mixture was vortexed and sonicated to clarity in a bath sonicator, and detergent (10% C8E5), protein extract, and fluorescent probe were added. The final mixture (1.1 ml) was applied onto 2 ml of Bio-Bead SM-2 (Bio-Rad) column to remove the detergent. After 2 h of incubation, the column was centrifuged, and the resulting proteoliposomes were applied onto a new 2-ml Bio-Bead column, incubated for 30 min, and centrifuged. The formed vesicles (1 ml) were passed through a Sephadex G-25–300 column to remove external probe. Ion flux in proteoliposomes was measured using ion-specific fluorescent probes and an SLM Aminco 8000C spectrofluorometer. Measurements of H+fluxes were obtained from changes in 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium fluorescence due to quenching by the anion of TES buffer (17Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Measurements of K+ fluxes, reflecting the movement of ionic charge across the membrane, were obtained from changes in potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate fluorescence (16Garlid K.D. Paucek P.

TEA+ internal medium and K+ external medium were used for the experiments of Figs. 3and 4 to measure electrophoretic H+ efflux, while these cations were reversed for the experiments of Figs. 5 and 6 to measure nucleotide inhibition. Each proteoliposome preparation was individually calibrated for fluorescent probe response, and its internal volume was estimated from the volume of distribution of the fluorescent probe (16Garlid K.D.

The diagram shows an inner membrane segment containing UCP1. The complete uncoupling cycle consists of the following five steps. (i) FA anion partitions in the lipid bilayer with its head group at the level of the acyl glycerol linkages and below the surface of the phospholipid head groups. This location is shielded from the aqueous, which causes the p Ka values of FA in membranes to be 3–4 units higher than their values in solution (34Hamilton J.A. Cistola D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). There is no significant flux of FA anion, because the bilayer energy barrier is too high (35Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Ratkje S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 6199-6205Google Scholar). (ii) The FA anion diffuses laterally in the bilayer to reach a subsurface binding site on UCP that is shielded from the bulk aqueous phase (36Ježek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) The energy barrier to FA anion transport is lowered by a weak binding site located about halfway through the UCP transport pathway (37Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The electric field created by redox-linked proton ejection drives the anionic head group to the energy well. (iv) The FA carboxylate group is transported to the other side of the membrane and then diffuses laterally away from the conductance pathway. The preference of UCP for hydrophobic anions (36Ježek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the hydrophobic FA tail remains in the bilayer during transport. (v) The FA is protonated, and the protonated FA rapidly flip-flops again, delivering protons electroneutrally to the mitochondrial matrix and completing the cycle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate and 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc.

Materials for UCP1 expression in yeast were from sources listed previously (17Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Purine nucleotides were adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris base. The development of a functional yeast expression system allowed us to investigate structure-function relationships of UCP1 using site-directed mutagenesis (19Murdza-Inglis D.L. Modrianský M.

Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24759-24762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly, we attempted to use yeast expression for human UCP2 and UCP3 in order to study their function. As opposed to UCP1, however, both UCP2 and UCP3 expressed in lower quantities in yeast and were difficult to purify. Expression in E. coli yielded high amounts of UCP2 and UCP3, which accumulated in inclusion bodies. However, when the proteins were extracted using SLS detergent and reconstituted into liposomes, the proteins were found to be inactive (not shown). We obtained functionally active protein by supplementing the extract with asolectin and octylpentaoxyethylene and subjecting the extract to prolonged dialysis against SLS-free buffer. The dialysis may have reduced the SLS concentration, but this was not assayed. The proteoliposomes typically had an internal volume of 1.2 μl/mg of lipid and contained 3–5 μg protein/mg of lipid. To estimate the purity of reconstituted UCP2 and UCP3, the proteoliposomes were delipidated and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with the results shown in Fig.1. The representative ion flux traces in Fig. 2 show that UCP2 catalyzes FA-dependent, electrophoretic proton flux. The traces in Fig. 2 A follow H+ movement across the membrane. It can be seen that FA induce a strong H+ flux (Fig. 2 A, trace a) that is absent in the absence of FA (trace b) and does not occur in liposomes without protein (trace c). Undecanesulfonate, an analogue of laurate, does not support H+ transport (trace d). The traces in Fig. 2 B follow K+movement. It can be seen that charge movement across the membrane exactly matches FA-induced H+ flux (trace a), confirming that the H+ flux is electrophoretic. Undecanesulfonate induced a strong K+ flux (trace d), demonstrating that the sulfonate anion is transported by UCP2. A rapid intraliposomal acidification ensues upon the addition of FA (Fig. 2 A, traces a and c). This is due to flip-flop of the protonated FA and acid-base equilibration (21Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Ježek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is an electroneutral process, as evidenced by the lack of a corresponding K+ jump upon the addition of FA (Fig. 2 B). The representative ion flux traces in Fig.3 were obtained with UCP3, and they are qualitatively identical in every detail with those of UCP2. These results are highly reproducible and are representative of more than 20 assays from 10 or more preparations of each UCP. Preliminary results from a kinetic study of UCP2 and UCP3 (not shown) indicate that there may be quantitative differences in FA preference among the UCPs. The Km values for FA are similar among all three UCPs (10–20 nmol of FA/mg of lipid), and the Vmax values for palmitate are also similar (10–30 μmol/mg·min). However, the Vmax for laurate is much lower in UCP2 than in UCP1 or UCP3, indicating a preference for long-chain FA by UCP2. A second essential property of UCP1 is inhibition of fatty acid-induced proton fluxes by purine nucleotides. To our surprise, we found striking differences in nucleotide sensitivity among the UCPs, as evidenced by the data in Fig.4 comparing inhibition by 1 mm GDP, ATP, and GTP. To date, we have identified ATP as the most potent inhibitor of UCP2 (Fig.5 A) and UCP3 (Fig.5 B), although the apparent Ki values for ATP inhibition are considerably lower than that for UCP1 (TableI). UCP2 and UCP3 are notably less sensitive to GDP or GTP, which are potent inhibitors of UCP1.Table IKi values for nucleotide inhibition of the uncoupling proteinsNucleotideUCP1UCP2UCP3μmATP125 ± 5760 ± 50 μm650 ± 36 μmGTP20 ± 3∼1 mm∼1.7 mmGDP17 ± 2∼1.2 mm∼1 mmExperiments were carried out under identical assay conditions at pH 7.2 as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab Experiments were carried out under identical assay conditions at pH 7.2 as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Electrophoretic proton flux is the sine qua non of an uncoupling function. The data in Figs. 3 and 4 show that UCP2 and UCP3 meet this primary criterion, thereby establishing them as uncoupling proteins in function as well as in name. Indeed, the transport properties of UCP2 and UCP3 are qualitatively identical with those of UCP1 with respect to transport of protons and alkylsulfonates (21Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Ježek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22Ježek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that FA are obligatory for proton flux mediated by UCP2 and UCP3, just as they are for UCP1 (22Ježek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Strieleman P.J. Schalinske K.L. Shrago E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13402-13405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has important implications for the biophysical transport mechanism of UCPs, an issue that is not entirely resolved. We favor the FA protonophore model, shown in Fig.6, in which UCPs contain a transport pathway for the anionic head groups of FA and alkylsulfonates. The head group is driven from one membrane leaflet to the other by the electric field generated by electron transport. When the FA carboxylate reaches one side, it picks up a proton and rapidly flip-flops back to release the proton to the other side. The UCPs thus catalyze a protonophoretic cycle, leading to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (21Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Ježek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). An alternative model by Klingenberg and co-workers (24Klingenberg M. Huang S-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) proposes that UCP1 transports protons, that the transport pathway contains histidines, and that FA function as nonstoichiometric cofactors to buffer intrachannel protons. In a major advance, Bienengraeber et al. (25Bienengraeber M. Echtay K.S. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) demonstrated that substitution of two histidines (H145Q,H147N) in UCP1 caused selective loss of H+ transport and concluded that these histidines constitute part of the proton conducting pathway. The authors go on to predict that UCP2, which contains neither histidine, will not conduct protons and that UCP3, which contains only one histidine, will conduct protons only weakly. In our view, the mutagenesis results are equally consistent with the FA protonophore model and suggest that the histidines in UCP1 form part of the surface binding site in the FA anion transport pathway. UCP2 and UCP3 possess ample basic residues in this region to fulfill such a role (26Garlid K.D. Jabůrek M. Ježek P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our interpretation therefore predicts that UCP2 and UCP3 will catalyze FA-dependent proton transport, and our results thus provide independent support for the FA protonophore model (Fig.6). Transport of the head group of undecanesulfonate also supports the FA protonophore model. Undecanesulfonate is a close analogue of laurate and is a competitive inhibitor of laurate-induced H+transport in UCP1 (22Ježek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sulfonate group is transported across the membrane by all three UCPs; however, alkylsulfonates do not support H+ transport. The reason for this failure is that sulfonates are very strong acids and, consequently, cannot deliver protons by electroneutral flip-flop across the bilayer (21Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Ježek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, alkylsulfonates share the anion transport pathway in UCP1 with FA, but they cannot complete the protonophoretic cycle. The fact that the anionic head group of alkylsulfonates is transported across the membrane is a serious problem for the buffering model, because there is no known physicochemical mechanism that would permit alkylsulfonate anion transport and prohibit FA anion transport. Inhibition by purine nucleotides is also an essential property of UCP1. Since FA have no effect on the Ki for nucleotide inhibition (22Ježek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is generally agreed that transport and inhibition take place on different domains. The nucleotide binding domain in UCP1 is extensive and reasonably well characterized. The sugar-base moiety reacts with three residues located on the matrix segment that connects helices 5 and 6, an interaction that may confer selectivity among nucleotides (27Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Mayinger P. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10536-10543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A glutamate, Glu190, in the fourth transmembrane helix is the pH sensor for nucleotide binding (30Winkler E. Wachler E. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Three arginines, located in the transmembrane helices 2, 4, and 6, are required for nucleotide inhibition and have been shown to bind the nucleoside phosphates (20Modrianský M. Murdza-Inglis D.L. Patel V. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24759-24762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have led to a three-stage binding-conformational change model for nucleotide binding and inhibition in UCP1 (20Modrianský M. Murdza-Inglis D.L. Patel V. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24759-24762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the seven residues involved in nucleotide inhibition are largely conserved in UCP2, UCP3, and plant uncoupling protein, suggesting not only that these proteins would be regulated by nucleotides but also that regulation would be similar among the UCPs. Surprisingly, there are striking differences in nucleotide sensitivity among the UCPs, with UCP2 and UCP3 being only weakly sensitive to GDP, for example (Fig. 4, Table I). Similarly, plant uncoupling protein was also only weakly sensitive to purine nucleotides (31Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of variations in nucleotide inhibition is unclear, because it is not known how any of the UCPs are opened in vivo. In the case of UCP1, a common view is that uncoupling is initiated by dissociation of ATP (32LaNoue K.F. Strzelecki T. Strzelecka D. Koch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 298-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our view, nucleotide debinding is an unlikely opening mechanism; to regulate important physiological processes, Nature normally relies on specific signaling pathways and not on the law of mass action. Regulation may involve post-translational modification of the proteins; however, no such signaling pathway has yet been demonstrated in the opening of any of the UCPs. A major value of studies such as these on isolated, reconstituted UCPs is that they permit direct comparison with similar studies obtained using UCP1. In this regard, our most noteworthy finding is that the three mammalian UCPs are qualitatively identical in mediating FA-dependent proton transport. Studies on whole cells and isolated mitochondria containing native UCP2 and UCP3 are urgently needed to advance the field. It is hoped that the biophysical approach described here will prove useful as a guide to studies on the native system."

Subsequently, amoebae made resistant were able to continuously multiply in the presence of a 40 μm concentration of the drug. In contrast to mechanisms of metronidazole resistance in other protozoan parasites, resistant amoebae did not substantially down-regulate pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase or up-regulate P-glycoproteins, but exhibited increased expression of iron-containing superoxide dismutase (Fe-SOD) and peroxiredoxin and decreased expression of flavin reductase and ferredoxin 1. Episomal transfection and overexpression of the various antioxidant enzymes revealed significant reduction in susceptibility to metronidazole only in those cells overexpressing Fe-SOD. Reduction was highest in transfected cells simultaneously overexpressing Fe-SOD and peroxiredoxin. Although induced overexpression of Fe-SOD did not confer metronidazole resistance to the extent found in drug-selected cells, transfected cells quickly adapted to constant exposures of otherwise lethal metronidazole concentrations. Moreover, metronidazole selection of transfected amoebae favored retention of the Fe-SOD-containing plasmid. These results strongly suggest that peroxiredoxin and, in particular, Fe-SOD together with ferredoxin 1 are important components involved in the mechanism of metronidazole resistance in E. histolytica.

Klutman N.E. Lamp K.C. Drugs. 1997; 54: 679-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The drug enters the cell through passive diffusion, where a nitro group is subsequently reduced to reactive cytotoxic nitro radicals by reduced ferredoxin or flavodoxin. Ferredoxin and flavodoxin function as electron acceptors of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, hydrogenase, and some other enzymes found specifically in microaerophilic bacteria and protozoan parasites (2Müller M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Biaglow J.E. Varnes M.E. Roizen-Towle L. Clark E.P. Epp E.R. Astor M.B. Hall E.J. Biochem.

The selective toxicity of metronidazole for anaerobic and microaerophilic organisms is due to the redox potential of their electron transport components, which are sufficiently negative to reduce the nitro group of metronidazole (3Biaglow J.E. Varnes M.E. Roizen-Towle L. Clark E.P. Epp E.R. Astor M.B. Hall E.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Townson S.M. Boreham P.F.L. Upcroft P. Upcroft J.A. Acta Trop. 1994; 56: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, the nitro radicals can be oxidized by oxygen, which leads to futile cycling and detoxification of the drug. During this reaction, superoxide radical anions are formed that may also be toxic for the anaerobic organisms (6Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. FASEB J. 1986; 45: 2471-2475Google Scholar). Treatment with metronidazole is usually very effective. However, metronidazole resistance is well documented for various bacteria and protozoan species (7Johnson J.P. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Sindar P. Britz M.L. Wilkinson R.G. J. Med. Microbiol. 1982; 15: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Aerobic as well as anaerobic resistance to metronidazole has been described in Trichomonas vaginalis. In this organism, activation of the drug occurs in a specific organelle called the hydrogenosome, in which pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, ferredoxin, and hydrogenase are localized. Some clinical T. vaginalis strains exhibit resistance only under aerobic conditions (9Müller M. Lossick J.G. Gorrell T.E. Sex. Transm. Dis. 1988; 15: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Tachezy J. Kulda J. Tomkova E. Parasitology. 1993; 106: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under anaerobic conditions, these isolates are metronidazole-sensitive. They show no decrease in pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase or hydrogenase levels, which are required for reductive activation of metronidazole. These trichomonads have lowered oxygen-scavenging capabilities, leading to higher oxygen concentrations and therefore to a futile cycling of reduced metronidazole and inactivation of the drug (11Land K.M. Johnson P.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Yarlett N. Yarlett N.C. Lloyd D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 19: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Other reports have indicated decreased levels of ferredoxin in metronidazole-resistant trichomonads (13Quon D.V.K. D'Oliveira C.E. Johnson P.J. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4402-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Yarlett N. Yarlett N.C. Lloyd D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or overexpression of a gene encoding an ATPase related to the P-glycoprotein family (7Johnson J.P. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Anaerobic resistance to metronidazole has only been induced in vitro (15Kulda J. Čerkasov J. Demes P. Čerkasovová A.

Microbiol. 1993; 40: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and has been correlated with decreased levels or total lack of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and hydrogenase, leading to inactivation of the pyruvate-oxidizing pathway that is responsible for metronidazole activation (17Upcroft J.A. Healey A. Murray D.G. Boreham P.F.L. Upcroft P. Parasitology. 1992; 104: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Čerkasovová A. Čerkasov J. Kulda J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 11: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for metronidazole-resistant strains of Giardia accompanied by chromosomal rearrangements (19Ellis J.E. Wingfield J.M. Cole D. Boreham P.F.L. Lloyd D. Int. J. Parasitol. 1993; 23: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Smith N.C. Bryant C. Boreham P.F.L. Int. J.

Recently, Samarawickrema et al. (22Samarawickrema N.A. Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Thammapalerd N. Upcroft P. J. Antimicrobiol. Chemother. 1997; 40: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) described for the first time the in vitro induction of metronidazole resistance under microaerophilic conditions in the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of human amoebiasis. Like Giardia, E. histolytica has no hydrogenosomes and hydrogenase, and drug activation occurs in the cytosol (23Reeves R.E. Adv. Parasitol. 1984; 23: 105-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, amoebae made resistant exhibited normal levels of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity, but a substantial increase in the iron-containing superoxide dismutase (Fe-SOD)1 (22Samarawickrema N.A. Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Thammapalerd N. Upcroft P. J. Antimicrobiol. Chemother. 1997; 40: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Up to now, studies about the regulation of ferredoxin and P-glycoproteins have not been performed in drug-resistant E. histolytica isolates. Besides Fe-SOD, which catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radical anions to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, two other enzymatic antioxidants, a flavin reductase (NADPH:flavin oxidoreductase) and a peroxiredoxin, have been identified in E. histolytica. Flavin reductase functions as a disulfide reductase, but is also able to reduce oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide (24Bruchhaus I. Richter S. Tannich E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxin was shown to remove hydrogen peroxide, which is produced during the flavin reductase reaction or during dismutation of superoxide radical anions by amoebic Fe-SOD. The peroxiredoxin-mediated hydrogen peroxide-removing reaction is dependent on the presence of thiols or flavin reductase activity (25Bruchhaus I. Richter S. Tannich E. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Poole L.B. Chae H.Z. Flores B.M. Reed S.L. Rhee S.G. Torian B.E. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This tight interaction of the enzymatic antioxidants might suggest involvement of the three enzymes in the mechanism of amoeba metronidazole resistance, as up-regulation of Fe-SOD should result in elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide, which are toxic and therefore need to be inactivated. In this study, we report on the pattern of expression of the different antioxidant enzymes as well as of ferredoxin and P-glycoprotein in metronidazole-resistant E. histolytica trophozoites. In addition, recently developed methods for Entamoeba transfection were applied to elucidate whether overexpression of Fe-SOD and/or of the other antioxidant enzymes is sufficient to confer amoeba resistance to metronidazole. The axenically cultured trophozoites of the E. histolytica isolate HM-1:IMSS were grown in TYI-S-33 medium (27Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar) under microaerophilic (5–7% O2) or anaerobic conditions using Anaerocult C or A, respectively (Merck). To induce metronidazole resistance, amoebae growing in the mid-logarithmic phase under microaerophilic conditions were exposed to a low concentration of the drug (4 μm) for 24 h. Live amoebae were transferred in new medium without the drug and cultivated until mid-logarithmic phase. This procedure was repeated three times with the same concentration before higher metronidazole concentrations were used (8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 29, 33, 37, and 40 μm). All plasmids used for the transfection of E. histolytica trophozoites are derivatives of the expression vectors pEhNEO/CAT and pEhHYG/CAT (28Hamann L. Nickel R. Tannich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8975-9879Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Hamann L. Buß H. Tannich E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was removed by restriction with the endonucleases Kpn I and Bam HI (pNeoCass/pHygCass) and replaced by the E. histolytica genes coding Fe-SOD, peroxiredoxin, and flavin reductase, respectively (30Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. Walter R.D. Horstmann R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Bruchhaus I. Tannich E. Trop. Med.

The Fe-SOD-, peroxiredoxin-, and flavin reductase-coding sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction of the respective DNA fragments. The transfection vectors were pBS (Stratagene)-derived plasmids containing the neomycin phosphotransferase- or hygromycin phosphotransferase-coding sequence flanked by 480 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated sequence and 600 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated sequence of an E. histolytica actin gene. The Fe-SOD-, peroxiredoxin-, or flavin reductase-coding sequence is flanked by 485 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated sequence of an E. histolytica lectin gene and 600 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated actin gene (pNeoFe-SOD, pNeoPRD, pNeoFR, pHygFe-SOD, and pHygFR) (29Hamann L. Buß H. Tannich E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed by electroporation as described previously (28Hamann L. Nickel R. Tannich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8975-9879Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Drug selection started 48 h after transfection, using a 10 μg/ml concentration of the neomycin analogue G418 or 5 μg/ml hygromycin. After 2 weeks, the concentration of G418 was increased to 50 μg/ml, and the concentration of hygromycin was increased to 10 μg/ml. For transfection of E. histolytica with two different expression vectors, the trophozoites were first transfected with the plasmid containing the neo gene. After 2 weeks of cultivation in the presence of 10 μg/ml G418, they were transfected with the second plasmid, which contains the hyg gene. These amoebae were cultivated for 2 weeks in the presence of 5 μg/ml hygromycin and 10 μg/ml G418. After 2 weeks of cultivation, a G418 concentration of 50 μg/ml and a hygromycin concentration of 10 μg/ml were used. Trophozoites (1 × 106) transfected with pNeoCass, pNeoFe-SOD, pNeoPRD, or pNeoFR were cultivated in 50-ml culture flasks in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 6 μmmetronidazole and 50 μg/ml G418 for 72 h. Each day, fresh culture medium, G418, and metronidazole were added to the amoebae. After 48 and 72 h of cultivation in the presence of metronidazole, viable amoebae were counted. Trophozoites transfected with pNeoCass were used as controls. Double-transfected amoebae were cultivated in TYI-S-33 medium for 96 h without G418 and hygromycin. After 96 h, 1 × 106 amoebae were cultivated in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 6 μm metronidazole. After 48 and 72 h of cultivation in the presence of metronidazole, viable amoebae were counted. It is important to cultivate amoebae transfected with expression vectors containing the hyg gene for a few days without addition of hygromycin because the combination of hygromycin and metronidazole is highly toxic for E. histolytica. Overexpression of Fe-SOD, peroxiredoxin, and flavin reductase after 96 h without addition of G418 and hygromycin was examined by Western blot analysis. Each assay was done five times in duplicate. Viability of the amoebae was examined by trypan blue exclusion (0.5 mg/ml). The survival rate of the transfected amoebae relative to the controls was determined. The p value was calculated using one-way analysis of variance. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli was extracted by the alkaline lysis method using a plasmid mega kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Northern blotting was carried out by standard protocols. Hybridizations were performed in 0.5 m Na2HPO4, 7% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2) at 55 °C. Blots were washed in 40 mm Na2HPO4 and 1% SDS (pH 7.2) at 55 °C. E. histolytica trophozoites were harvested in the mid-logarithmic phase of growth by chilling on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 430 × g (4 °C, 5 min). The pellet was washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, freeze-thawed five times in solid CO2/ethanol, and sedimented by centrifugation at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. The 150,000 × g supernatant (trophozoite extract) was used for the enzymatic assays. The consumption of H2O2 by E. histolytica peroxiredoxin was determined using a reaction mixture containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm H2O2, and different amounts of protein. Before addition of H2O2, protein samples were preincubated with 0.2 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min. The reaction was stopped after 30 min by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (10% final concentration). After removal of the precipitated protein, 0.2 ml of 10 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate and 0.1 ml of 2.5 m potassium thiocyanate were added to a 1-ml aliquot of the supernatant. H2O2 was determined spectrophotometrically (at 480 nm) using known amounts of H2O2 (1–50 μm) as a standard (33Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Flavin reductase activity was determined as described (34Lo H.-S. Reeves R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1980; 2: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The activity was assayed by measuring the initial rate of NADPH oxidation at 340 nm (ε = 6.22 m/cm) at 25 °C. One unit of NADPH oxidase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADPH/min. The activity of superoxide dismutase was determined by the reduction of ferricytochrome c according to standard methods (35McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were done at least in triplicate. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotting was carried out as described (36Leippe M. Ebel S. Schoenberger O.L. Horstman R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal anti-Fe-SOD, anti-peroxiredoxin, and anti-flavin reductase antisera were described previously (24Bruchhaus I. Richter S. Tannich E. Biochem.

Brattig N.W. Tannich E. Arch. Med. Res. 1992; 23: 27-29PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent assay (Pierce). Cultivation of wild-type E. histolytica trophozoites (HM-1) under microaerophilic conditions (5–7% oxygen) in the presence of various amounts of metronidazole revealed that a concentration of 12 μm was sufficient to reproducibly kill 50% of the cells within 24 h and was lethal for all cells after prolonged exposures over 72 h. In contrast, amoebae grown under strict anaerobic conditions were less susceptible to metronidazole. At a concentration of 12 μm, only 28% of the cells died within 24 h, and only 50% did so within 72 h. As, from a clinical point of view, only those E. histolytica trophozoites that are resistant to metronidazole in the presence of oxygen are of medical importance, all further experiments were performed under microaerophilic conditions. To generate metronidazole-resistant amoebae, cells were challenged with increasing amounts of the drug, starting with 4 μm and ending up with 40 μm metronidazole added to the culture medium. The whole procedure took ∼200 days, and afterwards, cells made resistant (HM-1/Met) were continuously maintained in the presence of 40 μm metronidazole for several months. Although the doubling time of resistant cells was slower compared with that of wild-type cells, HM-1/Met cells constantly multiplied, and microscopic inspection did not reveal any abnormalities. A further increase in the metronidazole concentration resulted in a significant decrease in the doubling time, and at a concentration of 200 μm, no further multiplication was observed. However, even at this drug concentration, cells were still viable, as evidenced by their adherence to the culture plate, regular amoeboid movement, and trypan blue exclusion. Expression of peroxiredoxin, flavin reductase, Fe-SOD, and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase was compared between wild-type amoebae (HM-1) and those made resistant and continuously grown in the presence of 40 μm metronidazole (HM-1/Met). Northern blot analyses revealed a slight decrease of ∼20% for pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase RNA and a more pronounced decrease of ∼40% for flavin reductase RNA in resistant amoebae, whereas the levels of Fe-SOD and peroxiredoxin RNAs in these cells were found to be increased by 5.1- and 2.9-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 A). These results corresponded with respective protein data as evidenced by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B) and enzymatic assay analyses (TableI). Compared with HM-1 cells, HM-1/Met cells exhibited 40% less NADPH oxidase activity, but 5.5 times higher Fe-SOD- and 4.0 times higher H2O2-removing activities.Table IActivities of antioxidant enzymes in metronidazole-susceptible (HM-1) and resistant (HM-1/Met) E. histolytica trophozoitesFe-SODNADPH oxidasePeroxiredoxinunits/mgmilliunits/mgnmol H2O2/min/mgHM-16.0 ± 1.1113 ± 102.6 ± 0.3HM-1/Met33 ± 668 ± 1310.5 ± 3 Open table in a new tab In addition to the various antioxidant enzymes, the levels of RNA expression of the two E. histolytica ferredoxins (ferredoxins 1 and 2) and of the six P-glycoprotein genes (pgp1 through pgp6) were compared between metronidazole-susceptible and -resistant amoebae by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 C). There were no differences in the expression of the various P-glycoprotein genes and the ferredoxin 2 gene, but a strong decrease of ∼80% was found in the expression of ferredoxin 1-specific RNA in metronidazole-resistant amoebae. To further analyze the role of Fe-SOD, peroxiredoxin, and flavin reductase in the metronidazole resistance of E. histolytica trophozoites, mutants that stably overexpressed the various antioxidant enzymes were generated by episomal transfection. Compared with cells transfected with the respective control plasmid (pNeoCass), transfection with the expression plasmid pNeoFe-SOD, pNeoPRD, or pNeoFR resulted in amoebae expressing exceedingly higher levels of Fe-SOD, peroxiredoxin, or flavin reductase RNA (Fig. 2). Likewise, extracts of these cells contained higher amounts and exhibited elevated activities of the corresponding antioxidant enzymes (Fig. 3 and TableII). Fe-SOD activity was increased by 7.8-fold, H2O2-removing activity by 4.0-fold, and NADPH oxidase activity by 15.2-fold. Interestingly, cells overexpressing Fe-SOD revealed induction of peroxiredoxin, whereas overexpression of peroxiredoxin did not influence Fe-SOD expression.Figure 3Western blot analyses of transfected amoebae. Trophozoites of the E. histolytica isolate HM-1:IMSS were transfected with the various expression plasmids (see the legend to Fig. 2). The transfected amoebae were selected in the presence of 50 μg/ml G418 with or without 10 μg/ml hygromycin. Subsequently, trophozoites were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, freeze-thawed five times in solid CO2/ethanol, and sedimented by centrifugation at 4 °C for 40 min. The 150,000 ×g supernatants were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose and developed with antisera to Fe-SOD, peroxiredoxin (PRD), and flavin reductase (FR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIEnzymatic activities of transfected amoebae (HM-1) overexpressing antioxidant enzymesFe-SODNADPH oxidasePeroxiredoxinunits/mgmilliunits/mgnmol H2O2/min/mgHM-1/pNeoCass2.8682.0HM-1/pNeoFe-SOD22.0607.5HM-1/pNeoFRND2-aNot determined.1039NDHM-1/pNeoPRD2.9688.5HM-1/pNeoCass/ pHygCass3.0702.5HM-1/pNeoPRD/pHygFe-SOD22.06510.0HM-1/pNeoPRD/ pHygFRND8777.52-a Not determined. Open table in a new tab In addition to cells overexpressing one of the three antioxidant enzymes, mutants were generated simultaneously overexpressing peroxiredoxin and Fe-SOD or peroxiredoxin and flavin reductase. For comparison, amoebae were transfected with the two control plasmids pNeoCass and pNeoHyg. The level of expression of each of the respective enzymes in the double-transfected mutants was comparable with the level of expression in cells transfected with a single construct, with the exception that H2O2-removing activity was ∼20–30% higher in cells transfected with pNeoPRD and pHygFe-SOD compared with those transfected with either pNeoPRD or pNeoFe-SOD (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table II). Compared with nontransfected cells, amoebae transfected with the control plasmids and selected with G418 and/or hygromycin were more sensitive to metronidazole, as only a 5 μm concentration of the drug was sufficient to kill 50% of the cells within 24 h, and none of the cells survived at this drug concentration after prolonged exposures over 120 h. Therefore, amoebae transfected with the different constructs were challenged with 6 μm metronidazole and followed for 48 and 72 h. Although a decrease in the number of viable cells for all transfected lines was observed, the survival rate of those overexpressing Fe-SOD, irrespective of whether pNeoFe-SOD or pHygFe-SOD and pNeoPRD were transfected, was significantly higher. The survival rate after 72 h was highest for the pHygFe-SOD/pNeoPRD double-transfected amoebae (Fig. 4). Moreover, under prolonged exposures to metronidazole, only cells of the two mutants overexpressing Fe-SOD survived and multiplied. In general, amoebae lose their episomally transfected plasmids within a few weeks after selection with G418 or hygromycin has been omitted. To investigate whether metronidazole would favor maintenance of the Fe-SOD-containing plasmid, amoebae transfected with pNeoFe-SOD were cultivated for several weeks in the presence or absence of 6 μm metronidazole, but without further G418 selection. Subsequent Northern blot analyses revealed elevated levels of Fe-SOD RNA and the presence of the neo transcript only in those trophozoites exposed to metronidazole (Fig.5). In contrast to amoebae made resistant to 40 μm metronidazole (HM-1/Met), transfected cells selected with a 6 μm concentration of the drug did not exhibit decreased expression of the ferredoxin 1 gene or any changes in the level of RNA for the gene encoding ferredoxin 2, pyruvate-phosphate oxidoreductase, or P-glycoprotein. In an attempt to characterize the mechanism of metronidazole resistance in the protozoan parasite E. histolytica, we have generated, by stepwise selection over >200 days, amoebae that were able to continuously multiply in the presence of a 40 μmconcentration of the drug. This concentration was ∼4 times higher than the concentration necessary to reproducibly kill the respective wild-type cells within 72 h. In addition, amoebae made resistant tolerated a constant exposure to 200 μm metronidazole (but without further multiplication) for several weeks, which is >2-fold higher than the drug concentration found in serum during therapy (∼80 μm after administration of 500 mg of metronidazole and a half-life of 7 h) (38Scully B.E. Med. Clin. North Am. 1988; 72: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our approach focused on the mechanism of metronidazole resistance under microaerophilic conditions since, after tissue invasion, amoebae are exposed to elevated levels of oxygen, and therefore, from a clinical point of view, only those E. histolytica trophozoites that are drug-resistant in the presence of oxygen are of medical importance. However, as our preliminary results indicated, amoeba grown under anaerobic conditions are less susceptible to the drug. Therefore, the mechanism of resistance under these conditions might differ. The metronidazole susceptibility of the amoeba isolates used for selection was comparable with that reported previously (39Gault M.J. Reiner D.S. Gillin F.D. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1985; 79: 60-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, there is no documented example of drug-resistant amoebae that have been grown in the presence of 40 μm metronidazole. The only report so far available describes a metronidazole-resistant E. histolytica line that, after 177 days of selection under microaerophilic conditions, could be maintained in medium containing as little as 10 μm metronidazole (22Samarawickrema N.A. Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Thammapalerd N. Upcroft P. J. Antimicrobiol. Chemother. 1997; 40: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, metronidazole-resistant lines of other protozoan parasites such as Trichomonas and Giardia that could be grown in as much as several 100 μmol have repeatedly being reported (15Kulda J. Čerkasov J. Demes P. Čerkasovová A. Exp. Parasitol. 1984; 57: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 40Townson S.M. Laqua H. Upcroft P. Boreham P.F. Upcroft J.A. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1992; 86: 521-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, consistent with our results, it is obviously more difficult and time-consuming to generate metronidazole-resistant E. histolytica, as this parasite appears to be unable to develop resistance to high concentrations of the drug. As in the previous study (22Samarawickrema N.A. Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Thammapalerd N. Upcroft P. J. Antimicrobiol. Chemother. 1997; 40: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), metronidazole resistance of amoebae was found to be associated with high levels of expression of Fe-SOD and could not be attributed to down-regulation of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, as expression of this enzyme was only marginally decreased, or to up-regulation of P-glycoproteins, as expression of this class of proteins was unaltered in resistant amoebae. However, as was shown for the aerobic metronidazole resistance of T. vaginalis, resistant E. histolytica expressed reduced levels of ferredoxin 1-specific RNA. Interestingly, expression of a second amoebic ferredoxin (ferredoxin 2) remained unchanged in metronidazole-resistant cells, suggesting that the two ferredoxins exert different functions within the parasite. However, down-regulation of ferredoxin 1 appears to be of importance only in those E. histolytica trophozoites that are resistant to high concentrations of metronidazole, as this phenomenon was found only in cells resistant to a 40 μm concentration of this, but not in those resistant to 6 μm. The increase of Fe-SOD in metronidazole-resistant amoebae is most likely not the result of a general stress response as previously suggested (22Samarawickrema N.A. Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Thammapalerd N. Upcroft P. J. Antimicrobiol. Chemother. 1997; 40: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) since cultivation of E. histolytica trophozoites under standard stress-inducing conditions such as elevated temperatures or addition of ethanol did not increase Fe-SOD activity (data not shown). It has to be considered that transfected amoebae were more sensitive to metronidazole, most likely due to superimposing effects caused by G418 or hygromycin selection. Nevertheless, transfected trophozoites overexpressing Fe-SOD revealed a significant reduction in the susceptibility to metronidazole; they quickly adapted to constant exposures of otherwise lethal metronidazole concentrations; and metronidazole selection favored retention of the transfected plasmid. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that increased expression of Fe-SOD constitutes an important component involved in the mechanism of metronidazole resistance in E. histolytica. Besides increased Fe-SOD expression, our data indicate that resistance of amoebae is also associated with increased expression of peroxiredoxin. At present, it is hard to assess whether peroxiredoxin expression in resistant amoebae is directly linked to metronidazole or whether it is a consequence of the induction of Fe-SOD, as increased peroxiredoxin expression was also found in cells transfected with the Fe-SOD expression plasmid. On the other hand, although transfection with pNeoPRD did not reduce susceptibility to metronidazole, the strongest reduction in metronidazole susceptibility was obtained in cells transfected with both the Fe-SOD- and peroxiredoxin-containing plasmids, indicating that overexpression of peroxiredoxin is not sufficient, but may at least support resistance to metronidazole. Questions remain open about the role of Fe-SOD and peroxiredoxin in mediating resistance. It may be possible that besides dismutation of superoxide radical anions, amoebic SOD is able to detoxify nitro radicals of reactive metronidazole metabolites. For the nervous system, it has been shown that excess production of reactive nitric oxide radicals leads to various neurotoxic effects, which could be reversed by overexpression of SOD (41Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Ensz L.M. Mukhina G. Lebovitz R.M. Zwacka R.M. Engelhardt J.F. Oberley L.W. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2040-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, inactivation of metronidazole might simply be due to reoxidation of nitro radicals, as cultivation of E. histolytica trophozoites takes place under microaerophilic conditions. In the presence of oxygen, the reoxidation of the nitro radicals produces the nontoxic metronidazole and superoxide radical anions. On one hand, this might be a detoxification reaction since the free toxic radical is oxidized. On the other hand, superoxide radical anions are produced. The superoxide radical anions can be removed by E. histolytica Fe-SOD, which leads to the production of toxic hydrogen peroxide. Since amoebae do not contain detectable amounts of catalase or peroxidase (42Dierickx P.J. Almar M.M. De Jonckheere J.F. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 593-600PubMed Google Scholar, 43Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Arrick B. Overdank-Bogart T. Aley S.B. Science. 1984; 224: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), detoxification of hydrogen peroxide is most likely catalyzed by E. histolytica peroxiredoxin. Consistent with our findings, this reaction pathway would require elevated levels of Fe-SOD and peroxiredoxin. The episomal transfection and overexpression of Fe-SOD did not confer metronidazole resistance to the extent obtained in long-term metronidazole-selected cells. Therefore, it is probable that additional factors such as down-regulation of ferredoxin 1 are involved in metronidazole resistance. To evaluate the role of ferredoxin 1 in the mechanism of E. histolytica metronidazole resistance, knockout experiments or antisense-mediated reduction of ferredoxin expression is required. Unfortunately, gene knockout in E. histolytica has not been achieved so far, and antisense inhibition did not reveal stable phenotypes that reproducibly express decreased levels of ferredoxin. Amoeba made resistant exhibited reduced levels of flavin reductase activity, and transfected cells overexpressing the enzyme revealed higher sensitivity to metronidazole exposure. Toxicity of flavin reductase in conjunction with metronidazole might be explained by the following two mechanisms. (i) The E. histolytica enzyme might function as a nitroreductase, whereas the reduced flavin of the E. histolytica enzyme is oxidized by metronidazole, which leads to the toxic nitro radical. The presence of nitroreductase activity was described for another class of NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductases of various organisms such as Salmonella typhimurium and Vibrio fischeri (44Inouye S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 45Watanabe M. Nishino T. Takio K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23922-23928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). (ii) Under microaerophilic conditions, amoebic flavin reductase has been shown to reduce oxygen, which leads to the formation of increased amounts of toxic hydrogen peroxide (24Bruchhaus I. Richter S. Tannich E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Metronidazole is a cheap, effective, and widely used drug. Although failures in the treatment of amoebiasis with metronidazole have been reported, it has been questioned whether in vivo metronidazole resistance of amoebae does exist, as no case of clinical resistance of E. histolytica has been documented (46Knight R. J. Antimicrobiol. Chemother. 1980; 6: 577-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 47Ravdin J.I. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The difficulties in generating amoebae in vitro that are resistant to substantial amounts of the drug might support this idea. However, as we have shown here, in principle, it is possible to select E. histolytica trophozoites that are able to tolerate a constant exposure to metronidazole levels comparable to those found in serum during therapy following recommended doses.

(1998) Science 281, 832–835). Here we investigated how Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate the IQGAP1 function. IQGAP1 interacted with the amino-terminal region (amino acids 1–183) of β-catenin, which contains the α-catenin-binding domain. IQGAP1 dissociated α-catenin from the β-catenin-α-catenin complex in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS)·glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdc42 and GTPγS·GST-Rac1 inhibited the binding of IQGAP1 to β-catenin in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, whereas neither GDP·GST-Cdc42, GDP·GST-Rac1, nor GTPγS·GST-RhoA did. The coexpression of dominant active Cdc42 with IQGAP1 suppressed the dissociation of α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex induced by the overexpression of IQGAP1 in L cells expressing E-cadherin (EL cells). Consistent with this, the overexpression of either dominant negative Cdc42 or Rac1 resulted in the reduction of E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesive activity in EL cells. These results indicate that Cdc42 and Rac1 negatively regulate the IQGAP1 function by inhibiting the interaction of IQGAP1 with β-catenin, leading to stabilization of the cadherin-catenin complex.

The cytoplasmic domain of cadherin binds to β-catenin, and this complex is linked to the actin cytoskeleton by α-catenin. It is well known that this linkage is essential for the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (for a review see Ref. 4Tsukita Sh. Tsukita Sa. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Curr. Opin.

However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism underlying the rearrangement of the cadherin-catenin complex. Cdc42 and Rac1, members of the Rho family, participate in the regulation of actin reorganization (for reviews see Refs. 5Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C.

The overexpression of IQGAP1 induces the dissociation of α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex and results in reduction of the E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesive activity in EL cells but not in L cells expressing E-cadherin mutant in which the cytoplasmic domain is deleted and replaced by the carboxyl-terminal half of α-catenin (nEαCL cells) (26Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of IQGAP1 on the E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is counteracted by the coexpression of dominant active Cdc42 (Cdc42Val12). Thus, IQGAP1 together with Cdc42 and Rac1 appear to regulate the cell-cell adhesion through the rearrangement of the cadherin-catenin complex. However, how Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate the IQGAP1 function remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated how Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate the IQGAP1 function. We found that IQGAP1 bound to the amino terminus of β-catenin and thereby dissociated α-catenin from the β-catenin-α-catenin complex. GTPγS·GST-Cdc42 and GTPγS·GST-Rac1, which interacted with IQGAP1, inhibited the binding of IQGAP1 to β-catenin in vitro. We also found that dominant active Cdc42 suppressed the dissociation of α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex induced by IQGAP1 in vivo. These results indicate that Cdc42 and Rac1 negatively regulate the IQGAP1 function by inhibiting the interaction of IQGAP1 with β-catenin, resulting in the stabilization of the cadherin-catenin complex.

Briefly, indicated MBP-β-catenin mutants were mixed with affinity beads coated with GST, GST-IQGAP1, or GST-Rho GDI in Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 μm (p-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The beads were then washed with Buffer A, and the bound proteins were coeluted with GST fusion proteins by the addition of Buffer A containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-MBP antibody. Full-length MBP-β-catenin or β-catenin-N-2-(aa 1–183) (5 pmol each) was immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) with anti-MBP polyclonal antibody. The beads were incubated with GST-α-catenin (1 μm) for 1 h at 4 °C in Buffer A. After the beads had been washed, the bound proteins were eluted with GST, GST-IQGAP1, or GST-Rho GDI (500 nm each). The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-α-catenin antibody. Various concentrations of GST-α-catenin were mixed with the indicated amounts of GST-IQGAP1. The mixture was incubated with MBP-β-catenin-N-2-(aa 1–183) (5 pmol)-immobilized beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads had been washed, the immunocomplex was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-α-catenin and anti-IQGAP1 antibodies. GST-IQGAP1 (100 nm) was mixed with the indicated small GTPases (3 μm) for 1 h at 4 °C in Buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.4, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7.3 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm(p-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The mixture was incubated with MBP-β-catenin-N-2-(aa 1–183)-immobilized beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, the beads were washed with Buffer A containing 5 mm MgCl2, and the immunocomplex was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-IQGAP1 antibody. EL cells, nEαCL cells, or LAP86 cells (3 × 106/10-cm dish) were seeded. The indicated plasmids together with pME18-tAic2A (29Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Koyasu S. Miyajima A. Schreurs J. Arai K.

After a 20-h incubation, the cells were scraped from 5 to 10 dishes with silicon-rubber policemen and transferred to a plastic dish precoated with anti-Aic2 antibody (HC) (29Yonehara S. Ishii A.

The immunologically collected cells (5 × 105 cells) were then seeded onto a 48-well culture dish and incubated for 24 h. The recombinant small GTPases and IQGAP1 were expressed in 80–90% of the collected cells and at a level 2–3-fold higher than that of endogenous proteins as described previously (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). By using immunologically collected cells (5 × 105 cells) as described above, the cell dissociation assay with EL cells or nEαCL cells was performed after treatment of the cells with trypsin in the presence of either Ca2+ (TC treatment) or EGTA (TE treatment) as described (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K.

The total particle numbers after TC or TE treatment were designated as NTC and NTE, respectively. The cell dissociation assay with LAP86 cells was performed after treatment of the cells with EDTA either in the presence (TEd treatment) or absence (Ed treatment) of trypsin as descried (27Kawakami A. Kitsukawa T. Takagi S. Fujisawa H. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 29: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Takagi S. Kasuya Y. Shimizu M. Matsuura T. Tsuboi M. Kawakami A. Fujisawa H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The total particle numbers after Ed or TEd treatment were designated as NEd and NTEd, respectively. The extent of dissociation of cells was represented by the cell dissociation index NTC/NTE or NEd/NTEd. The lower the values of these indexes, the higher the activity of cell adhesion. In some experiments, confluent cultures were pretreated with 1 μm cytochalasin D in culture medium for 2 h and then the cell dissociation assay was performed in the presence of 1 μm cytochalasin D as described (32Imamura Y. Itoh M. Maeno Y. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The immunologically collected cells (5 × 106 cells) were transferred to a 6-well culture dish, and after incubation for 24 h, immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested and suspended with phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 0.75 mm DSP. Next the cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and then the DSP activity was quenched by the addition of 50 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μm (p-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2), and the lysates were mixed with indicated antibody and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. We have recently shown that IQGAP1 directly binds to β-catenin in a dose-dependent and saturable manner in vitro (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To determine the binding domain of β-catenin to IQGAP1, indicated mutants of β-catenin were produced as MBP-fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A), and their interactions with GST-IQGAP1 were assessed. MBP-β-catenin mutants were subjected to the beads coated with either GST, GST-IQGAP1, or GST-Rho GDI, which is an unrelated protein to β-catenin and is used as a negative control. Full-length MBP-β-catenin, N-1-(aa 1–535), and N-2-(aa 1–183) mutants bound to GST-IQGAP1 but not to GST or GST-Rho GDI. Neither β-catenin-N-3-(aa 1–123) nor β-catenin-C-1-(aa 536–781) bound to GST-IQGAP1 (Fig. 1 B). A similar experiment was performed using MBP-β-catenin-M-1-(aa 184–535); however, this protein interacted with both GST and GST-IQGAP1 nonspecifically. Therefore, it is not known whether this domain of β-catenin interacts with IQGAP1. These results indicate that the amino-terminal domain of β-catenin-(aa 1–183), containing the α-catenin-binding domain-(aa 120–151) (33Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is capable of binding to IQGAP1. The fact that the IQGAP1-binding domain and α-catenin-binding domain in β-catenin overlap, as noted in Fig.1 A, is consistent with our previous observation that IQGAP1 induced the dissociation of α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex in vivo (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We examined whether IQGAP1 induces the dissociation of α-catenin from the α-catenin-β-catenin complex in vitro. GST-α-catenin was mixed with affinity beads coated with either MBP or MBP-β-catenin-N-2-(aa 1–183) mutant. After the beads had been washed, the α-catenin bound to β-catenin was eluted with either GST, GST-IQGAP1, or GST-Rho GDI. The dissociated GST-α-catenin was detected with anti-α-catenin antibody. GST-α-catenin was specifically dissociated from the α-catenin-β-catenin complex by GST-IQGAP1 but not by GST or GST-Rho GDI (Fig.2 A). Under these conditions, we confirmed that GST-IQGAP1, but neither GST nor GST-Rho GDI, bound to MBP-β-catenin-N-2 (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when full-length MBP-β-catenin was used instead of MBP-β-catenin-N-2-(aa 1–183) (Fig. 2 A). These results strongly suggest that IQGAP1 and α-catenin compete to bind β-catenin. We next examined whether GST-IQGAP1 and GST-α-catenin indeed compete for the β-catenin binding. A mixture of various concentrations of GST-α-catenin and GST-IQGAP1 was added to affinity beads coated with MBP-β-catenin-N-2-(aa 1–183). α-Catenin or IQGAP1 alone interacted with β-catenin-N-2. IQGAP1 inhibited binding of α-catenin to β-catenin-N-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). Inversely, α-catenin inhibited binding of IQGAP1 to β-catenin-N-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). Under these conditions, we confirmed that GST-Rho GDI affected neither binding of α-catenin to β-catenin-N-2 nor binding of IQGAP1 to β-catenin-N-2 (data not shown). These results indicate that IQGAP1 and α-catenin compete to bind β-catenin. We examined whether Cdc42 or Rac1 regulates the interaction of IQGAP1 with β-catenin in vitro. A mixture, containing GST-IQGAP1 with various small GTPases, was added to affinity beads coated with either MBP or MBP-β-catenin-N-2-(aa 1–183). GTPγS·GST-Cdc42 inhibited the binding of IQGAP1 to β-catenin-N-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). A similar result was obtained when GTPγS·GST-Rac1 was used instead of GTPγS·GST-Cdc42 (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of either GDP·GST-Cdc42, GDP·GST-Rac1, or GTPγS·GST-RhoA, the interaction of IQGAP1 with β-catenin-N-2 was not affected (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that activated Cdc42 or Rac1 inhibits the interaction of IQGAP1 with β-catenin in vitro. We have previously shown that IQGAP1 interacts with E-cadherin as well as β-catenin both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we tried to examine whether Cdc42 or Rac1 affects the interaction of IQGAP1 with E-cadherin under the same conditions as β-catenin. However, neither Cdc42 nor Rac1 affected the interaction of IQGAP1 with E-cadherin (data not shown). The role of Cdc42 and Rac1 in the interaction of IQGAP1 with E-cadherin remains to be clarified. We have previously shown that Cdc42Val12 counteracts the inhibitory effect of IQGAP1 on the E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the Cdc42 or Rac1 activation leads to stable cadherin-catenin complex formation in vivo through inhibition of the binding of IQGAP1 to β-catenin. To examine the effect of Cdc42 and IQGAP1 on the cadherin-catenin complex formation in vivo, EL cells were used because these cells are mouse L fibroblasts expressing E-cadherin and adhere to each other in an E-cadherin-dependent fashion (26Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We have already found that IQGAP1 induces the dissociation of α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex in EL cells (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We here examined whether activated Cdc42 suppresses the dissociation of α-catenin from the cadherin-catenin complex induced by IQGAP1 in EL cells. To enrich the EL cells transiently expressing IQGAP1 and Cdc42, the cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either Myc, Myc-IQGAP1, or Myc-IQGAP1 plus HA-Cdc42Val12 together with a plasmid encoding tAic2A, an IL-3β1 receptor lacking a cytoplasmic domain. The transfected cells were immunologically collected by anti-Aic2 antibody (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y.

Science. 1990; 247: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). E-cadherin was then immunoprecipitated from those cells. When E-cadherin was immunoprecipitated from the cells expressing Myc alone, both β-catenin and α-catenin were coimmunoprecipitated with E-cadherin. When E-cadherin was immunoprecipitated from the cells expressing Myc-IQGAP1, β-catenin, but not α-catenin, was coimmunoprecipitated with E-cadherin as described previously (10Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). When E-cadherin was immunoprecipitated from the cells expressing both Myc-IQGAP1 and HA-Cdc42Val12, both β-catenin and α-catenin were coimmunoprecipitated with E-cadherin (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the Cdc42 activation leads to stable cadherin-catenin complex formation by suppressing IQGAP1 function in vivo as well as in vitro. We and others (7Braga V.M.M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) have reported that Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA are involved in the regulation of the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. However, direct evidence has yet to be presented that Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA regulate the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. We, therefore, examined whether these small GTPases affect the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion using the cell dissociation assay (26Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), one of the adhesion assays for the evaluation of the cadherin activity. To obtain an enriched population of EL cells expressing recombinant small GTPases, EL cells were transfected with plasmid encoding the various small GTPases together with a plasmid encoding tAic2A, and the transfected cells were immunologically collected by an antibody to Aic2 as described above. In the cell dissociation assay, EL cells expressing dominant negative Cdc42 (Cdc42Asn17) were easily dissociated, and many single cells were observed (Fig.5 A). A similar result was obtained when the cells expressing dominant negative Rac1 (Rac1Asn17) were used instead of the cells expressi"

A larger number of proteins are carbonylated in cells lacking cytoplasmic SOD compared with cells lacking catalases, OxyR, or RpoS which, in turn, exhibit a larger number of oxidized proteins than the wild-type parent. Proteins exclusively oxidized during stasis in mutants lacking cytoplasmic SOD include GroEL, EF-G, and the acidic isoform of H-NS indicating that these mutants experience problems in peptide elongation and maintaining protein and DNA architecture. These mutants also survive stasis poorly. Likewise, but to a much lesser extent, mutations in oxyR, an oxidative stress regulator, shorten the life-span of stationary phase cells. The low plating efficiency of cells lacking OxyR is the result of their inability to grow on standard culture plates unless plating is performed anaerobically or with high concentration of catalase. In contrast, cells lacking cytoplasmic SOD appear to die prior to plating. Our data points to the importance of oxidative stress defense in stasis survival, and we also demonstrate that the life-span of growth-arrested wild-type E. coli cells can be significantly extended by omitting oxygen.

One model, we could call it the future provision model, suggests that this induction of stress defense proteins including oxidative stress proteins prepares the starved cell for stress conditions that it may encounter in the future. It has been argued that such a response is sensible at the onset of starvation because energy generation will become more and more limited as cells progress into stationary phase making inducible responses less immediate and less effective (6Huisman G.W.

C.1996: 1672-1682Google Scholar). Another model suggests that the induction of oxidative stress proteins has a role in minimizing damage to target molecules caused by stasis per se (3Matin A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 7Eisenstark A. Miller C. Jones J. Levén S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been proposed that the ubiquitous progressive decline in the functional capacity of aging eukaryotes is a consequence of the accumulation of oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS)1produced by normal metabolism (9Orr W.C. Sohal R.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). This is the postulation of the free radical hypothesis of aging (10Yan L.J. Levine R.L. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The hypothesis is supported by different experimental data demonstrating that (i) steady-state levels of oxidatively damaged macromolecules increase with age in all species examined thus far (11Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar), (ii) oxidatively modified proteins lose their catalytic activity and structural integrity (12Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11823-11827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (iii) there is a close association between oxidative damage of proteins and life expectancy of houseflies (13Sohal R.S. Agarwal S. Dubey A. Orr W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7255-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and (iv) the life-span of fruitflies can be prolonged by overproducing antioxidants (9Orr W.C. Sohal R.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Recent identifications of gerontogenes (genes whose alteration causes life extension) and their functions in both Caenorhabditis elegans (14Murakami S. Johnson T.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1091-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Drosophila melanogaster (15Lin Y.J. Seroude L. Benzer S. Science. 1998; 282: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) further support the notion of a strong correlation between longevity and oxidative stress defense. With the development of sensitive immunochemical methods for the detection of protein carbonyls, the presence of such groups has been used as a marker of ROS-mediated protein oxidation (16Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and to demonstrate a correlation between the oxidation of target molecules and aging (17Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). In this work, we have used such a method to show that the cytoplasmic E. coli superoxide dismutases (SOD), whose levels we demonstrate are elevated upon starvation, and catalases are important in slowing down stasis-induced protein oxidation. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with carbonyl detection, we found that stasis-induced oxidation targets specific proteins and that protein oxidation is both quantitatively and qualitatively different in wild-type cells as compared with cells lacking cytoplasmic SOD and catalases activity and the regulators OxyR and RpoS. Further, viability measurements give support for the hypothesis that oxidative defense proteins prevent oxidative deterioration which, in mutants lacking SOD leads to die-off in the starvation regimen, whereas in OxyR-deficient mutants it leads to a loss in the ability of the cell to recover on standard laboratory nutrient plates. This stasis-induced loss of culturability of oxyR mutants is closely associated to oxidative stress because plating anaerobically or with high levels of catalase increased the plating efficiency by about one order of magnitude. Moreover, we show that the die-off of wild-type E. coli cells during the first 10 days of stasis can be completely counteracted by omitting oxygen, indicating that reactive oxygen species may limit longevity also of wild-type E. coli cells starved under aerobic conditions. However, the life-span of the wild-type stationary phase culture does not appear to depend on protection against oxidative mutations and damage to DNA. Detection of carbonylated proteins was performed using the chemical and immunological reagents of the OxyBlotTM Oxidized Protein Detection Kit (Oncor). The chemiluminescence blotting substrate (POD) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and (ECL+) Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and used according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore Corp. Protein assay reagents were from Pierce Inc. All chemicals used for radiolabeling of proteins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. X-Omat AR-5 film was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. The ampholines (Resolyte 4–8) used for two-dimensional electrophoresis were from BDH. The E. coli K-12 strains used in this study are listed in TableI. Cultures were grown aerobically or anaerobically in liquid Luria Bertani (LB) or glucose M9 (18Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

When appropriate, the medium was supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), carbenicillin (200 μg/ml), and/or tetracycline (20 μg/ml) or bovine catalase (5,000 units). Anaerobic LB media were supplemented with 1% glucose. For anaerobic experiments, all media and materials were equilibrated in the anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory Products inc., Type C) for at least one day before use.Table IStrains used in this workBacteriumGenotype or relevant characteristic(s)SourceE. coli strains MG1655F−D.

Taddei Open table in a new tab Cells were grown aerobically overnight in glucose minimal M9 medium, harvested, and washed twice with M9 medium lacking glucose (M9-G), and subsequently resuspended in M9-G to a density of 108 colony-forming units/ml. The starving culture was split into two, and one was incubated (and plated) aerobically whereas the other was incubated (and plated) anaerobically. Bacteria were starved aerobically at 37 °C in a rotary shaker or anaerobically at 37 °C in the anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory Products Inc., Type C). Culturable bacteria starved anaerobically were assayed by plating, in the anaerobic chamber, on LB with 1% glucose after serial dilutions in M9 buffer. Plasmid DNA purifications and P1 transductions were performed as described (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Crude cell extracts were obtained using an Aminco French Pressure Cell (SLM Instrument Inc.). Culture samples were processed to produce extracts for resolution on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels by the methods of O'Farrell (19O'Farrel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications (20VanBogelen R.A. Hutton M.E. Neidhardt F.C. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 1131-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing and nonequilibrium pH gel electrophoresis was performed as described in VanBogelen et al., (20VanBogelen R.A. Hutton M.E. Neidhardt F.C. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 1131-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The differential rate of synthesis of selected proteins was performed as described in Nyström and Neidhardt (21Nyström T. Neidhardt F.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of proteins recovered from two-dimensional gels was performed as described previously (22Nyström T. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The carbonyl groups in the protein side chains were derivatized, using the Oncor OxyBlotTMkit, to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP-hydrazone) by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. As described (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), crude protein extracts were obtained during growth and at different times in stationary phase, the extracts reacted with the carbonyl reagent dinitrophenylhydrazine and dot-blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and oxidatively modified proteins were detected with anti-DNP antibodies. Cells of E. coli were pulse-labeled with [3H]leucine during exponential growth and also at times after growth ceased because of glucose depletion. Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the rates of synthesis of both SodA (Mn-superoxide dismutase) and SodB (Fe-superoxide dismutase) were induced during the starvation condition studied. The identifications of SodA and SodB in the two-dimensional gene-protein data base (23VanBogelen R.A. Abshire K.Z. Pertsemlidis A. Clark R.L. Neidhardt F.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella thyphimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2067-2117Google Scholar) was verified by N-terminal sequencing. The location of these proteins on the E. coli reference two-dimensional gels (SodB on isoelectric focusing gel and SodA on nonequilibrium pH gel electrophoresis gel) and the extent and kinetics of induction during carbon starvation are depicted in Fig.1, A and B. As seen in Fig. 1 B, induction of SodA synthesis preceded SodB. A sodA::lacZ fusion demonstrated that the increased synthesis of SodA was the result of transcriptional activation during stasis (not shown). The increased rate of SodA and SodB synthesis during stasis does not appear to be an effect of a gradual reduction in growth rate upon entry into stationary phase because the production rates were found to be indistinguishable at steady state growth rates between k = 0.3 to 1.9 (Fig. 1 C). For a comparison, the rate of SdhA (succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit) production, known to be inversely dependent on growth rate (24Nyström T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), is also depicted in Fig. 1 C. These results, together with the fact that growth-arrested cells accumulate catalases (25Loewen P.C. Switala J. Triggs-Raine B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), indicate that the capacity of the cell to deal with ROS generated from endogenous metabolism increase during stasis. The question of whether these enzymes indeed are needed to prevent oxidation of macromolecules during growth arrest was approached by determining the levels of protein carbonyls during stasis of wild-type cells and cells lacking SOD and/or catalases activities. The carbonyl content of total proteins was measured immunochemically, and densitometric quantification of the blots demonstrated a 4- to 5-fold increase in carbonyl content in wild-type cells during a period of 2 days in stationary phase (Fig. 2) as previously demonstrated (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking cytoplasmic SOD activity (sodA sodB double mutants), catalases activity (katE katG double mutants), or both exhibited enhanced (about 10-fold) carbonyl content during stasis (Fig. 2). No, or only minor, differences in protein carbonyl levels were observed between wild-type and mutant cells growing exponentially (Fig. 2). Protein carbonylation could not be detected when cells were grown and growth-arrested anaerobically (not shown). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with immunochemical assay for protein carbonyl groups (26Nakamura A. Goto S. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that some proteins are specifically susceptible to stasis-induced oxidation (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, we demonstrate that a larger fraction of proteins are oxidized in all oxidative defense mutants analyzed as compared with the wild-type strain and that the largest number of oxidized proteins is present in the mutants lacking cytoplasmic SOD activity. No significant difference between wild-type and mutant strains were detected during exponential growth of cells (only one, unidentified, protein was found to be significantly oxidized during exponential growth in LB; not shown). By overexposing the films, we were able to determine whether some proteins were exclusively oxidized in response to stasis in cells lacking cytoplasmic SOD activity. We found that the heat shock chaperone GroEL, elongation factor EF-G, carbamoylphosphate synthetase (small subunit, CarA), pyruvate formate lyase (Pfl), and the acidic isoform of H-NS were oxidized only in cells lacking cytoplasmic SOD and SOD/catalases activity (Fig. 4). This result cannot be explained by an increased level of these proteins in the mutant strain because Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of proteins demonstrated that the levels were very similar in the wild-type and mutant backgrounds (not shown). One exception, GroEL, was found to be elevated as a result of the sodA sodB katE katG mutations consistent with previously reported data (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Figure 4Specific protein carbonylation determined by two-dimensional Western blot immunoassay of 2 days stationary-phase (in LB medium) wild-type and sodA sodB katE katG mutants.

The superoxide dismutase and catalase activities appear to synergistically protect stationary phase cells as judged by the poor survival of the sodA sodB katE katG quadruple mutant (Table II). It should be noted that stationary phase death of a sodA sodB double mutant has been demonstrated previously in another genetic E. coli background (27Benov L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Table IISurvival of wild-type and mutant cells during stationary phase (LB)Strains% Survival2-aPercent viable cells after 3 days in stationary phase calculated as the fraction of culturable cells divided by the maximal number of culturable cells measured during early stationary phase.Aerobic2-bPlating aerobically as described in “Experimental Procedures.”+Catalase2-cPlating with catalase (5,000 units) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Anaerobic2-dPlating anaerobically as described.WT6.26.16.2sodA sodB8.5 10−28.8 10−28.8 10−2katE katG2.156.36.3sodA sodB katE katG6.9 10−3NDNDoxyR0.9211.86.8dps7.5ND2-eND, not determined.NDΔrecA3.9NDNDΔrecA dps3.6NDNDmutT6NDNDThe analysis was repeated three times to confirm reproducibility.

Ames B.N. Cell. 1985; 41: 753-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and RpoS (29Loewen P.C. Triggs B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) regulons are known to be involved in oxidative stress defense, and rpoS mutants are known to survive stationary phase poorly (30Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that the total protein carbonyl levels are enhanced in both oxyR and rpoS mutants during stasis (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We found that oxyR mutants, like rpoS mutants (30Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), are impaired in stationary phase survival (Table II). In addition, the yield of oxyR colony-forming units/ml was always about 10-fold lower than that of the wild-type culture in early stationary phase. We next asked whether the fraction of cells that failed to form colonies on the LB plates in fact died in the stationary phase regimen or were killed upon plating. We approached this question by comparing plating efficiencies on standard LB plates incubated anaerobically and aerobically with and without catalase (5,000 units), arguing that the increased stasis-induced protein oxidation observed in the different mutants (Ref. 8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, and this study) may degenerate the cells to the extent that they fail to cope with the subsequent burst of aerobic catabolism when plated on a rich growth medium. As seen in Table II, both anaerobiosis and catalase addition increased the plating efficiency of oxyR and katE katG mutants to levels comparable with the wild-type strain. However, anaerobiosis and addition of catalase did not increase the plating efficiency of wild-type cells or sodA sodB double mutants (Table II). Similarly, anaerobiosis and catalase additions did not increase the plating efficiency of stationary phase rpoS mutants (not shown). It should be noted that protein oxidation preceded stationary phase die-off of mutant cultures indicating that death per se is not the causal factor responsible for increased carbonylation. It is possible that stasis sensitivity of cells lacking oxidative defense proteins is caused by increased DNA damage and mutation frequencies. Indeed, the sodA sodB double mutant was found to have about two-fold higher mutation frequencies than the wild-type in stationary phase (measured by the occurrence of rifampicin-resistance mutants). However, we think that this increase in mutation frequency is of no consequence for the survival of the cells because stationary phase survival of a mutT mutant, which has a 300 to 1,000-fold increase in mutation frequency during stasis, was found to be indistinguishable from the wild-type parent (Table II). We also determined stasis survival of ΔrecA and ΔrecA dps double mutants which are unable to cope with oxidative DNA damage. Again, we found no evidence that oxidative damage to DNA limits survival during stasis because the colony forming capacity of the wild-type and ΔrecA or ΔrecA dps double mutant strains was very similar during the first 3 days in stationary phase (Table II). The data presented suggest that endogenous generation of ROS creates a serious problem in mutants lacking cytoplasmic SOD and SOD/catalases activity during conditions of growth arrest (Table II). To investigate whether the longevity also of growth-arrested wild-type E. coli cells is limited by self-inflicted oxidative damage, we determined and compared the life-span of cultures starved for carbon aerobically and anaerobically. The cells were grown aerobically rather than anaerobically prior to starvation to avoid production and excretion of mixed acid fermentation products which are potentially toxic and can seriously debilitate the membrane. As depicted in Fig. 5, the culture life-span of anaerobically starved cells significantly exceeded that of the aerobically starved counterpart. About 98% of the culture which was glucose-starved aerobically died within 10 days of starvation whereas no significant killing of cells in the anaerobic culture was observed during the same period. Starvation-induced growth arrest results in protein oxidation in wild-type cells of E. coli and is enhanced in cells lacking cytoplasmic SOD and/or catalases activity. Striking differences in total carbonyl levels were observed between the mutant and wild-type cells only in stationary phase, which suggests that these functions are especially important during this period. We believe that this self-inflicted gradual increase in protein oxidation during stasis is caused by an imbalance between macromolecular synthesis and endogenous catabolism. The rate of macromolecular synthesis is drastically reduced or totally blocked upon starvation because of the lack of precursor metabolites and the control by the alarmone ppGpp (31Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella thyphimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). However, the rates of respiration (22Nyström T. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and production of reactive oxygen species (32Gonzalez-Flecha B. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) are not reduced to the same extent and proceed at relatively high levels for an extended period during stasis. Thus, the growth-arrested cell, in contrast to the exponentially growing one, has only limited abilities to titrate out time-dependent oxidation of target macromolecules and the levels of such damaged molecules will increase unless the oxidative defense machinery can fully repair or remove them. It appears that a significant number of the genes and regulons induced by stasis is indeed part of such a defense machinery which, however, fails to fully combat stasis-induced oxidation. The two-dimensional carbonyl immunoassay demonstrates that stasis-induced protein oxidation (carbonyls groups could be introduced at lysine, arginine, proline, and threonine residues (17Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar)) is selective. Based on the identity of the oxidized proteins, we can conclude that several different cell processes are targets for stasis-induced damage. In the wild-type strain, these functions include peptide chain elongation (EF-Tu), protein folding and reconstruction (DnaK), DNA architecture and gene expression (H-NS, basic isoform), central carbon catabolism (Icd, Mdh, AceF, SucC, Pyk, PtsI), amino acid biosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation (GlnA, GltD), and general stress protection (UspA) (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Additional proteins, including GroEL, EF-G, and the acidic isoform of H-NS, were found to be oxidatively damaged in the sodA sodB and the sodA sodB katE katG strains, indicating that these strains experience even larger problems in maintaining translation, proper protein folding, and DNA architecture during stasis. We do not know whether the specific sensitivity of some proteins to oxidation is the result of design rather than necessity or chance. For example, it is possible that metal-catalyzed oxidation will be an intrinsic problem for all proteins containing, or being associated with, metals like e.g. iron and manganese (16Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,33Fucci L. Oliver C.N. Coon M.J. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It is known that a number of different ROS are involved during the course of the protein oxidation process and that transition metal ions can substitute for hydroxyl groups and superoxide radicals in some of the reactions (17Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Two possible models explaining the role and causation for stasis-induced stress protein production have been discussed in the literature. One model suggests that the induction of stress defense proteins and regulons prepares the growth-arrested starved cell for future cataclysmic stress conditions (future provision model). Another model suggests that the induction of stress defense regulons during stationary phase has a role in minimizing damage to target molecules caused by stasis per se (3Matin A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 7Eisenstark A. Miller C. Jones J. Levén S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the latter model, it is argued that stasis causes increased damage (e.g. by oxidation) of cellular components, and stress resistance develops because the cells are already exposed to the normal stress response signals. Support of this model, with respect to induction of heat shock genes during stasis, was recently presented by demonstrating that aberrant proteins are the likely candidates triggering induction of heat shock regulon during both heat stress and stasis but the signal (aberrant proteins) is generated by different pathways (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The same argument can be made for stasis-induced expression of OxyR-dependent genes. OxyR becomes an active regulator upon oxidative formation of a disulfide bond between two of its cysteine residues (34Zheng M. Åslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), and it is feasible that the critical cysteine residues on OxyR are subjected to gradual oxidation during stasis, which eventually may give rise to a high enough titer of oxidized OxyR to activate gene expression (Indeed, formation of disulfide bonds in a cytoplasmic alkaline phosphatase has recently been shown to occur during stasis of E. coli cells (8Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)). Moreover, the data concerning the role of superoxide dismutases, catalases, OxyR, and RpoS in preventing stasis-induced protein oxidation and promoting stasis survival (this work; Refs. 7Eisenstark A. Miller C. Jones J. Levén S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 27Benov L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggests that many stress proteins are not just for future provision but are actively participating in stationary phase physiology. However, it should be noted that the two models are not mutually exclusive. It is possible that oxidative stress proteins have a dual role of enhancing the chances of survival of the growth-arrested cell by damage repair and protection and at the same time provide for the future. It may be difficult to explain the origin and evolution of the genetic program directing stasis induction of oxidative stress systems by the future provision model unless we propose that starved cells almost always will encounter future oxidative stress. Perhaps the process of recovery and subsequent regrowth of stationary phase cells subjected to up-shift conditions is intimately associated with such oxidative stress. For example, a sudden burst in catabolic activities preceding macromolecular biosynthesis during recovery could generate severe damage unless the cells are already provided with a battery of oxidative defense systems. The data presented in Table I lend some credence to this notion by demonstrating that the poor plating efficiency of stationary phase katE katG and oxyR cells can be counteracted by anaerobiosis or including catalase in the LB plates. Thus, stasis induction of oxidative stress systems could perhaps be explained by both models, and it appears as if superoxide dismutases are important in protecting the cell against primary damage caused by ongoing metabolism during stasis per se while catalases and the OxyR regulon may be required during secondary oxidative stresses associated with recovery during upshift conditions. However, it is important to note that the failure of oxyR and katE katG mutants to grow when plated aerobically only occurs after the cell have been subjected to growth arrest for some time, indicating the involvement of a progressive stasis-dependent deterioration. Based on the results demonstrating stasis-induced oxidation of target proteins and the poor ability of cells lacking components of oxidative stress systems to survive (or recover from) stasis, it may seem reasonable to propose that ROS and oxidative stress is a major cause of stationary phase death. This proposition would be in accord with the free radical hypothesis of aging. However, this, and most contemporary papers concerning stationary phase survival in bacteria, concerns the analysis of mutants that are worse off than the wild-type strain, and we cannot make the a priori assumption that wild-type E. coli dies for the same reason as those mutants.

We report here that single point mutations introduced into this region of the mouse cardiac ryanodine receptor reduce or abolish high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding.

The G4824A mutant channel was modulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, caffeine, ruthenium red, and ryanodine. Co-expression of the wild type and G4824A mutant proteins produced single channels that have intermediate unitary conductances of 516, 256, 176, and 60 pS.

These channels play an essential role in intracellular Ca2+signaling by virtue of releasing Ca2+ from the lumen of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum to the cytosol of muscle and non-muscle cells (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6187) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). RyR is a homotetrameric structure composed of four identical subunits, each having ∼5000 amino acids. Sequence analysis reveals that one-fifth of the COOH terminus of the molecule is likely to form the channel conducting pore. The remaining ∼4000 amino acid residues apparently constitute the cytoplasmic “foot” domain (3Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J.

Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). A truncated RyR in which the foot domain has been deleted has been shown to function as a Ca2+ release channel. The truncated RyR channel was still regulated by Ca2+, was modified by ryanodine, and exhibited a single channel conductance similar to that of the full-length RyR (8Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the sites for Ca2+ activation and ryanodine binding, and the ion conduction pathway are located within the COOH-terminal ∼1000 amino acid residues. A glutamate residue located in the putative transmembrane sequence M2 has recently been identified as the Ca2+ sensor of RyR (9Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The locations of the ryanodine binding site and the pore-forming segment of RyR, however, have yet to be defined. RyRs and IP3Rs share some sequence homology, in particular in the COOH-terminal channel-forming domain (10Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Considering their sequence homology and similar conduction properties (11Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12Tinker A. Lindsay A.R.G. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 495-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 571-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), RyRs and IP3Rs are likely to share similar structural features in the channel pore. A hydrophobic region between the M5 and M6 transmembrane sequences of the mouse type 1 IP3R has been proposed to be the pore-forming region (14Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi R. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equivalent region in RyR, corresponding to the M9 transmembrane sequence proposed by Zorzato et al. (15Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is also hydrophobic. Sequence alignment of these regions reveals a G X R X GGG X GD motif that can be found in all known RyRs and IP3Rs (Fig.1). To investigate its role in RyR function, we have introduced point mutations into this highly conserved region and examined the functional consequences of these point mutations. Our data indicate that this region is critical for ryanodine binding and ion conduction and probably constitutes the pore-forming segment of RyRs. Ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem. [3H]Ryanodine was from NEN Life Science Products. Monoclonal antibody 34C was a generous gift from Dr. John L. Sutko (16Airey J.A. Beck C.F. Murakami K. Tanksley S.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H.

These cDNA fragments were then used as probes to screen a mouse cardiac cDNA library. Four overlapping clones, corresponding to nucleotides 5′-UTR-6486, 1891–8268, 7602–13,359, and 12,991–3′-UTR, covering the entire coding region and part of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the mRyR2, were obtained. These overlapping clones were used to construct the full-length mRyR2 cDNA in the expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) for functional expression studies. Point mutations were carried out by the overlap extension method (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Morton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using the PCR. The Nru I (14,237)-Not I (vector) cDNA fragment that contains the 3′ end of the mRyR2 cDNA was subcloned into the pBluescript vector and was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript and the sequence of each PCR clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Nru I (14,237)-Not I (vector) fragment was removed from the PCR clone and subcloned into the full-length mRyR2 cDNA. Transfection of HEK293 cells were carried out using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation. Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in transfected HEK293 cells was measured with the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 as described previously (9Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to cell lysates was carried out using the method described by Du et al. (22Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type and mutant mRyR2 proteins were purified from cell lysates by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (23Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Single channel recordings were carried out using CHAPS-solubilized and sucrose density gradient-purified wild type and mutant recombinant mRyR2 proteins as reported previously (23Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Free Ca2+concentrations were calculated using the computer program of Fabiato and Fabiato (24Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). We first investigated the functional consequences of single point mutations in the putative pore-forming segment (Fig.1) by measuring caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells transfected with the wild type and various mutant cDNAs. Addition of 2 mm caffeine resulted in an increase in the fluo-3 fluorescence in cells transfected with the wild type and all mutant cDNAs, but not in cells transfected with the vector DNA (Fig.2 a). These data demonstrate that all mutants can function as Ca2+ release channels. To further characterize these mutants, we carried out [3H]ryanodine binding. Fig. 2 b shows that mutations at R4822, G4825, G4828, and D4829 reduced or abolished high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding, while caffeine-induced Ca2+ release from these mutants was comparable with that from the wild type. On the other hand, mutation at G4824 retained [3H]ryanodine binding, but decreased caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. Mutations at G4820 and G4826 reduced caffeine-induced Ca2+ release and abolished [3H]ryanodine binding. It should be noted that the levels of expression of the wild type and mutant RyR proteins were similar as revealed by immuno blotting (Fig. 2 b). These data indicate that this conserved region is critical for ryanodine binding and channel function. Ryanodine binds to RyRs in an open state with high affinity. The binding of ryanodine modifies channel gating and ion conduction and reduces single channel conductance of RyRs (3Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 5Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The significance of this region in ion conduction was examined by determining the effect of these mutations on single channel conductance. Fig.3 a shows single channel recordings of the wild type and mutant G4824A channels after incorporating into planar lipid bilayers at different holding potentials. The unitary conductance of the mutant G4824A channel, determined in symmetrical 250 mm KCl, was 22 ± 1.1 pS (n = 4), compared with 798 ± 17 pS (n = 3) for the wild type channels. Thus, the G4824A mutation reduced the single channel conductance of mRyR2 by 97%. To examine whether the G4824A mutant channel is still sensitive to modulators of RyR, we assessed the effects of various ligands on single channel activity and [3H]ryanodine binding. The mutant channel was activated by ATP and caffeine, was inhibited by MgCl2, and was modified by ryanodine (Fig. 3 b). [3H]Ryanodine binding to mutant G4824A was also activated by ATP, caffeine, and Ca2+ and was inhibited by MgCl2, ruthenium red, and EGTA (Fig. 3c). A similar extent of modulation by these ligands on [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 3 c) and single channel activity (not shown) was also observed with the wild type channel. Thus, the specific effect of G4824A mutation on single channel conductance and the critical role of residues flanking this glycine in high affinity ryanodine binding suggest that this region is involved in the formation of the channel conducting pore. In potassium channels, the ion conduction pathway is formed by the pore-forming segments of each subunit (26Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfeutzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar, 27MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is also the case for RyR, we co-expressed the wild type and mutant G4824A cDNA in a 1:1 ratio in HEK293 cells and determined the unitary conductance of each single channel observed. We expected that co-expression of the wild type and mutant channel would result in the formation of hybrid channels that contained different ratios of wild type and mutant subunits. These hybrid channels would exhibit certain conductance levels depending on the ratios of wild type and mutant subunits and the structural characteristics of the channel pore. We detected a total of 29 single channels, which can be separated into six groups according to their single channel conductances. Of the 29 single channels detected, one exhibited an unitary conductance of 778 pS, three 516 ± 4.3 pS, four 256 ± 14 pS, nine 176 ± 2.0 pS, eleven 60 ± 6.6 pS, and one 21 pS. All these single channels were sensitive to EGTA and Ca2+ and were modified by ryanodine (not shown). The 778- and 21-pS single channels probably represent the homotetrameric wild type and mutant G4824A channels, respectively, whereas single channels with intermediate unitary conductances are most likely represent the wild type-mutant hybrid channels. For example, the 516-pS conductance may be produced by a hybrid channel with three wild type and one mutant subunits, while the 60-pS conductance may be generated by a hybrid channel with three mutant and one wild type subunits. The 256- and 176-pS channels may be formed by two wild type and two mutant subunits with different subunit arrangements (Fig. 4 a). It is of interest that these intermediate conductances can not be derived from a simple additive of the quarter conductance of the wild type (798/4 pS) and mutant (22/4 pS) in any possible ratios for a tetramer. Therefore, it is unlikely that the RyR channel conduction pathway is formed by four individual pores from each RyR subunit. Conversely, the glycines at position 4824 and the flanking residues of each monomer may act cooperatively to form the conduction pathway or the ion selectivity filter of the tetrameric RyR. The equivalent region of other RyR isoforms (RyR1 and RyR3) and of IP3Rs is most likely to be important in determining the single channel conductance. To examine this possibility, we have mutated G4729 in RyR3, corresponding to G4824 in mRyR2, to alanine. The G4729A mutant RyR3 showed decreased caffeine-induced Ca2+release and a drastic reduction in single channel conductance, but retained [3H]ryanodine binding, similar to those observed with the G4824A mutant mRyR2 (unpublished data). Recently, a mutation, I4898T, in RyR1, corresponding to I4827 in mRyR2, has been reported to be associated with severe central core disease (28Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M. Mallet A. Giblin L. Heffron J.J.A. Vaughan P. Zafra G. MacLennan D.H. McCarthy T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Introduction of this mutation into the rabbit RyR1 abolished [3H]ryanodine binding and caffeine or halothane-induced Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells transfected with the mutant cDNA. Co-expression of the wild type and mutant RyR1 cDNA in a 1:1 ratio produced RyR channels with normal caffeine and halothane sensitivities, but reduced levels of Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding (28Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M. Mallet A. Giblin L. Heffron J.J.A. Vaughan P. Zafra G. MacLennan D.H. McCarthy T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). One explanation for these observations is that the I4849T mutation may disrupt the channel conduction pathway (29Balshaw D. Gao L. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3345-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutations near this isoleucine in RyR1 have also been reported to alter both [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel conductance (30Gao L. Tripathy A. Xu L. Pasek D. Balshaw D. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, we propose that this conserved region (GVRAGGGIGD) is likely to be the pore-forming segment of RyR, and that the pore-forming segments of each subunit constitute the RyR channel conduction pathway (Fig. 4 b), analogous to the K+ channel pore (26Doyle D.A.

Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 328-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a metal-sensitive, plasmid-free derivative of strain CH34.Escherichia coli K38(pGP1–2) (19Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) was used for expression of czcCBAD derivatives under control of the phage T7 promoter as described (20Nies A. Nies D.H. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5065-5070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tris-buffered mineral salts medium (14Mergeay M. Nies D. Schlegel H.G. Gerits J. Charles P. van Gijsegem F. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 328-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 2 g/liter sodium gluconate was used for testing metal resistance and growth of Ralstonia. E. coli was cultivated in Luria broth (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory., Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Analytical grade salts of CdCl2·H2O, ZnCl2, and CoCl2·6 H2O were used to prepare 1m stock solutions, which were sterilized by filtration. Solid Tris-buffered medium contained 2 g/liter agar. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined as described (14Mergeay M. Nies D. Schlegel H.G. Gerits J. Charles P. van Gijsegem F. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 328-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using Tris-buffered mineral salts medium. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), unless otherwise stated. Standard molecular genetic techniques were used (8Nies D. Mergeay M. Friedrich B. Schlegel H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4865-4868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory., Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli strains was conducted as described previously (8Nies D. Mergeay M. Friedrich B. Schlegel H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4865-4868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of czcCBAD derivatives under control of the lac promoter in Ralstonia strain AE104, the plasmid pT7–5-derivatives containing the various czc constructs were cut with Eco RI and Xba I and cloned into the broad host range plasmid pVDZ′2 (23Deretic V. Chandrasekharappa S. Gill J.F. Chatterjee D.K. Chakrabarty A. Gene. 1987; 57: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pVDZ′2-derivatives were transformed into E. coli S17–1 (24Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar) and transferred into Ralstonia AE104 by conjugation as described (8Nies D. Mergeay M. Friedrich B. Schlegel H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4865-4868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For reporter gene fusions, fusion vector pECD500 (11Rensing C. Pribyl T. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6871-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and E. coli CC118 were used (25Manoil C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All fusions were done immediately downstream of an arginine or lysine residue of CzcA. Activity of alkaline phosphatase (25Manoil C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was determined in triplicate as published previously. Mutations in the czcA gene were constructed using PCR by an overlap extension method (26Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) as published previously (11Rensing C. Pribyl T. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6871-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ part of the internal 1,034-base pair Nhe I-Mun I internal fragment of czcA (position 3,489 to 4,523) (9Nies D.H. Nies A. Chu L. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was amplified from plasmid pECD110 (9Nies D.H. Nies A. Chu L. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) using a primer corresponding to the sequence at the Nhe I site (TAGAGGATCCCGAACGGCTAGCGTCGTA, Nhe I primer) and a primer corresponding to the mutated region. These were (mutations underlined) TCGAAAACAGTGTGAGGCGA for C417S, TGGCGCGTGCGCAGGAACA for H423R, AGGAACGCCATGGCCGGC for H427R, AGGAACACCGTGGCCGGC for H428R, TCCGAGCGGTTCCGTGAGGT for H439R, GTGGTGATTGTCGACAACTGTGTG for E415D, GTGGTGATTGTCCAAAACTGTGTG for E415Q, GGCGCGCTCAACTTCGGCATC for D402N, and ATCATCATCAATGGCGCGGTG for D408N. The 3′-part of the 1,034 contained the region from the mutation to the Mun I site. These fragments were amplified from pECD110 (9Nies D.H. Nies A. Chu L. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) with primers inverse to the primers listed above and a Mun I region primer (AAAGGATCCCACGAACAATTGACACC, Mun I-primer). After purification (Wizard PCR preps, Promega, Madison, WI), each pair of PCR fragments was used as a template in another PCR reaction with the Nhe I and Mun I primers, which both contained additional Bam HI sites at their ends to facilitate cloning. The resulting DNA fragment was purified, digested with Bam HI, and cloned into pUC19 (27Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). All final PCR products were sequenced to verify the exchange and to check for PCR-mediated unwanted changes. To facilitate the exchange of the wild type Nhe I-Mun I fragment against the mutated fragments, the respective fragment from plasmid pECD110 was first deleted and a kanamycin resistance gene was inserted instead leading to plasmid pECD451. This was done as published (11Rensing C. Pribyl T. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6871-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the mutated Nhe I-Mun I fragments were inserted into pECD451 instead of the kanamycin resistance gene. The resulting plasmids were verified by restriction endonuclease digestion using several enzymes, and correct expression of the mutant proteins was demonstrated by T7 expression (19Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). The czcA gene was PCR-amplified as an Eco RI-Bam HI fragment from plasmid pECD110 (9Nies D.H. Nies A. Chu L. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and cloned into the vector pASK3 (Institut für Bioanalytik, Göttingen, Germany) in E. coli BL21 (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The resulting plasmid pECD559 was verified by DNA sequencing. For each expression, the bacterial strain was freshly transformed. E. coli BL21(pECD559) was cultivated for 16 h at 30 °C and diluted into 1 liter of fresh Luria broth (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory., Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cultures were cultivated with shaking at 30 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 1.0. CzcA production was induced with 100 μg of anhydrotetracyclin/liter of medium. The cells were cultivated for an additional 3 h with shaking at 30 °C and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was washed and suspended in 10 ml of buffer W (100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA), treated twice with the French press (SLM Aminco, SOPRA GmbH, Germany; 1,000 psi) in the presence of protease inhibitor (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and DNase (10 μg/liter), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g. The membrane fraction of the resulting supernatant was harvested by ultracentrifugation (1.5 h, 100,000 × g) and suspended in buffer W at 10 g of protein/liter (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bensadown A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). CzcA was solubilized from membranes of the E. coli host using 1 g of n-dodecyl-maltoside/g of membrane protein and 3.5 g ofl-α-phosphatidylcholine, β-linoyl-γ-palmitoyl/liter (stirred for 30 min at 23 °C), and membrane debris was removed (30 min, 100,000 × g). CzcA was purified on a strep-tactin-Sepharose column (bed volume 1 ml) equilibrated with buffer W containing 0.1 mm n-dodecyl-maltoside and 0.2 g of phospholipid/liter. After the column was washed with 12 bed volumes buffer W containing 0.1 mm n-dodecyl-maltoside and 0.2 g of phospholipid/liter, CzcA was eluted using buffer W containing 0.1 mm n-dodecyl-maltoside, 0.2 g of phospholipid/liter, and 2.0 mm desthiobiotin. Aliquots from the different steps of the purification procedure were loaded on a SDS gel (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Soybeanl-α-phosphatidylcholine (type II-S, 17% phosphatidylcholine) was suspended in Tris buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, β-d-octylglucoside (15 g/liter)) to yield a lipid concentration of 10 g/liter. Subsequently, β-d-octylglucoside was removed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and the resulting liposomes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For reconstitution, the liposomes were thawed and extruded through a 400-nm filter (31Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 (0.45% w/v) was added, and total solubilization of lipids was determined by measuring changes in adsorbance at 540 nm (32Rigaud J.-L. Pitard B. Philippot J.R. Schuber F. Liposomes as Tools in Basic Research and Industy. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 71-88Google Scholar, 33Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Junk K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Detergent-destabilized liposomes were mixed with purified CzcA in a 100:1 ratio (w/w) and incubated at room temperature under gentle agitation for 15 min. Detergent was removed by adding Bio-Beads SM-2 at a final concentration of 80 mg/ml (34Holloway P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). After 30 min of incubation, Bio-Beads were removed by filtration on glass silk, and incubation was continued with fresh Bio-Beads for an additional 30 min at 23 °C, and overnight at 4 °C. The turbid proteoliposome suspension was dialyzed two times against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C, and concentrated by centrifugation at 300,000 ×g for 45 min. For NH4Cl loading, the proteoliposomes (pellet) were suspended in 4 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0 (containing 0.5 mNH4Cl) and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by a second ultracentrifugation at 300,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0 (containing 0.5 m NH4Cl). Light scattering indicated a mean diameter of the resulting proteoliposomes of about 500 nm. This calculates to a liposome volume of 65.4 attoliter, an outer surface area of 785,000 nm2 and an inner surface area of 736,000 nm2. With a surface area of 0.23 nm2/phospholipid (35Small D. Zoeller R.A. Meyer R.A. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine. 3. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1996: 442-462Google Scholar), each liposome contained 6.61·106 phospholipids/liposome. With 1 g of CzcA (116,611 g/mol)/100 g of phospholipids (734 g/mol), about 417 CzcA proteins should have been present in each proteoliposome. The loaded proteoliposomes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. As published (10Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2707-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,36Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), 1 μl of proteoliposomes were diluted into 2 ml of buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m choline chloride, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 2 μmacridine orange (3,6 bis-dimethylaminoacridine). Acridine orange fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm (SFM25 spectrofluorometer, Kontron, Zürich, Switzerland) in stirred cuvettes at 24 °C. Cation uptake experiments using the filtration method were performed as described (17Nies D.H. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 896-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The NH4Cl-containing proteoliposomes were diluted into Tris-choline buffer (0.5 m choline chloride, 20 mm Tris (pH 9.0)) to a final volume of 30 μl. After 1 min (5 min in inhibitor experiments), cation uptake was started by the addition of the radioactive cations 65Zn2+,57Co2+, or 109Cd2+(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C. Samples (5 μl) were filtered through membrane filters (pore size 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) and rinsed with 0.3 ml of Tris-choline buffer containing 10 mm EDTA and 10 mm Mg2+. The radioactivity that remained on the membrane filter was determined with a scintillation counter (LS6500, Beckman, München, Germany). Control liposomes without CzcA were prepared using the same amounts of phospholipids but no CzcA. To calculate a “mol zinc/mol CzcA” value with these negative controls, the amount of zinc accumulated by control liposomes was divided by the CzcA content of the CzcA-containing proteoliposomes in the parallel experiment, which was 0.5 μg/sample. With 417 CzcA molecules/proteoliposome and an internal volume of 65.4 attoliter/proteoliposome, 1 Zn2+/CzcA transported into the proteoliposome corresponds to an internal zinc concentration (ci) of 10 μm. CzcA was purified to homogeneity (Fig.1). The first amino acids of CzcA were determined as MFE as expected from DNA sequence analysis (9Nies D.H. Nies A. Chu L. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). CzcA was reconstituted into proteoliposomes, which were incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.0. At 1 mm Zn2+, CzcA proteoliposomes accumulated about 70 mol of Zn2+/mol of CzcA (ci = 0.7 mm) more within the first 15 s than control liposomes (Fig.2 A). In the following 2 min, another 100 mol of Zn2+/CzcA (final ci = 1.7 mm) were accumulated, whereas binding of zinc by control liposomes did not increase with time. The rapid transport of zinc by CzcA proteoliposomes could be inhibited by 100 μmof the protonophore FCCP (Fig. 2 A) or using Tris buffer, pH 5.0, instead of pH 7.0 for dilution (data not shown). Thus, this rapid transport was probably driven by the zinc concentration gradient across the proteoliposome membrane. Increased amounts of CzcA proteoliposomes led to increased metal transport, but increased amounts of control liposomes did not (Fig. 2 B). Thus, CzcA was functional, catalyzed a proton-independent fast facilitated diffusion of zinc and a proton-dependent slower transport of zinc into the proteoliposomes.Figure 2Activity of CzcA-containing proteoliposomes. A volume of 3 μl of proteoliposomes (3 g of CzcA/liter) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.0, was diluted into 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0 (panels A and B), or proteoliposomes charged with 0.5 mNH4Cl were diluted into choline buffer, pH 9.0 (panels C and D). After 1 or 5 min,65Zn2+ was added. 5-μl samples (containing 0.5 μg of CzcA each) were filtrated, washed, and used to calculate the mols of zinc transported into the proteoliposomes per mol of CzcA (molecular mass of CzcA-strep-tag, 116,611 Da). Control liposomes did not contain CzcA but were prepared in a parallel fashion, contained the same amount of phospholipids, and were adjusted to a concentration giving the same acridine orange fluorescence quench level as CzcA proteoliposomes. To calculate a “mol of zinc/mol of CzcA” value with these negative controls, the amount of zinc accumulated by control liposomes was divided by the CzcA content of the CzcA-containing proteoliposomes in the parallel experiment, which was 0.5 μg/sample.Panel A, the uptake of CzcA proteoliposomes (•) in the Tris system was compared with CzcA-containing proteoliposomes in the presence of 100 μm FCCP (▪). After 10-fold dilution, 1 mm of zinc was added after 1 min. The control (○) were liposomes without CzcA. Panel B, uptake of zinc (1 mm) by CzcA-containing proteoliposomes diluted 10-fold (•) or 6-fold (▪). Control liposomes were diluted 10- (○), 6- (▪), or 2.5-fold (Δ). Please note that these data are given in “nmol of zinc/sample” to show the differences between the various amounts of proteoliposomes and liposomes. Panel C, CzcA-containing proteoliposomes (•) and control liposomes in the ammonium chloride/choline system (○). Panel D, uptake of 3 (•), 1 (▪), or 0.5 mm of zinc (▴). The values obtained for the liposome control were subtracted from the CzcA proteoliposome values to yield a zero point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To yield a stronger proton gradient, the proteoliposomes were loaded with 0.5 m NH4Cl; diffusion of NH3out of the liposome leaves protons inside and generates a proton gradient. A stable gradient for at least 20 min was shown with acridine orange fluorescence quenching experiments (data not shown). Ammonium chloride-charged CzcA proteoliposomes accumulated Zn2+rapidly (30-fold, Fig. 2 C), whereas control liposomes did not. CzcA-dependent uptake of zinc into ammonium-charged proteoliposomes could be partially inhibited with 100 μmFCCP or 500 μm carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, but neither with 10 μm FCCP nor 50 μm carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (data not shown). The high concentration of uncoupler needed in these experiments might be the result of the very high concentration of membranes used in the experiments (Fig. 2). Velocity of zinc uptake was two-fold higher when 3 mm zinc was used as the substrate instead of 1 mm, however, nearly no uptake was measured with 0.5 mm zinc (Fig. 2 D). The velocity of zinc transport by CzcA followed a sigmoidal substrate saturation curve (Fig. 3 A). A Vmax value of 385 s−1 (TableI) was calculated from the velocities at 10 and 5 mm zinc, and this velocity was used for a Hill plot (Fig. 3 B) yielding a cooperativity constant n = 2 and a K50 of 6.6 mm (Table I). Concentration higher than 10 mmgave no significant uptake, probably due to the toxic effect of zinc on the integrity of the proteoliposomes (data not shown).Table IHeavy metal cation transport by CzcAMetal ionnKm/K50Vmaxmm1/secZn2+1.966.6385Co2+1.9118.5100Cd2+(1)7.728The velocity of metal cation uptake was determined for all three metals. For zinc and cobalt, the substrate saturation curve was sigmoidal. For zinc, the Vmax was determined using the velocities at 5 and 10 mm; for cobalt, it was the velocity at 50 mm. Higher concentrations of either metal inactivated the proteoliposomes. With this Vmaxvalue, a Hill plot using the equation ln(V/Vmax −V) = n · ln S −n · ln K50 was performed yielding the resulting values. For cadmium, concentration higher than 5 mm inactivated the proteoliposomes, and no significant transport could be measured with concentrations lower than 1 mm. Within this range of concentrations, the Lineweaver-Burk plot was linear and yielded the listed Km and Vmax values. Open table in a new tab The velocity of metal cation uptake was determined for all three metals. For zinc and cobalt, the substrate saturation curve was sigmoidal. For zinc, the Vmax was determined using the velocities at 5 and 10 mm; for cobalt, it was the velocity at 50 mm. Higher concentrations of either metal inactivated the proteoliposomes. With this Vmaxvalue, a Hill plot using the equation ln(V/Vmax −V) = n · ln S −n · ln K50 was performed yielding the resulting values. For cadmium, concentration higher than 5 mm inactivated the proteoliposomes, and no significant transport could be measured with concentrations lower than 1 mm. Within this range of concentrations, the Lineweaver-Burk plot was linear and yielded the listed Km and Vmax values. Cobalt transport by CzcA was much slower than zinc transport. To measure any significant transport, 1.5 μl of proteoliposomes instead of 0.3 μl had to be used, and the cobalt concentration had to be raised to 10 mm (Fig.4 A). The substrate saturation of cobalt transport by CzcA was again sigmoidal (Fig. 3 A), and, due to a toxic effect, no uptake was detectable at concentrations higher than 50 mm. Using the velocity measured at 50 mm, a Hill plot was performed (Fig. 3 B) yielding n = 2 and a K50 of 18.5 mm (Table I). Cadmium transport by CzcA was even slower than cobalt uptake (Fig. 4 B). No uptake could be detected at concentrations lower than 1 mm or higher than 5 mm. In this narrow range of substrate concentration (Fig.3 A), a Lineweaver-Burk plot was linear and yielded a Vmax of 28 s−1 and a Km of 7.7 mm (Table I). Computer predictions (data not shown) indicated 12 hydrophobic peaks in the amino acid sequence of CzcA, which might resemble membrane-spanning α-helices (TMHs), and two large hydrophilic regions between TMH I/II and TMH VII/VIII, respectively. The specific activities of CzcA::PhoA translational fusions (Table II) gave evidence for (i) a cytoplasmic location of both termini of CzcA, (ii) a periplasmic location of both large hydrophilic domains, (iii) the presence of TMHs I (between N terminus and large hydrophilic domain 1), II, III, IV, VII, VIII, IX, XI and XII. No fusion could be isolated between TMHs IX and X, and the low specific activity of the fusion between TMHs V and VI (position 475) gave no evidence for a periplasmic location of this region (Table II).Table IISpecific activity and proposed localization of CzcA::PhoA translational fusionsPositionSpecific activity of PhoA fusions, d.w.2-aMean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations are shown.Amino acid residue of CzcAPredicted topology of CzcAunits/mg13N terminus0.15 ± 0.0233Large hydrophilic domain 12.14 ± 0.1064Large hydrophilic domain 12.60 ± 0.03192Large hydrophilic domain 14.31 ± 0.14334Large hydrophilic domain 13.80 ± 0.01345Large hydrophilic domain 13.97 ± 0.07366TMH II/III0.50 ± 0.00390TMH III/IV2.89 ± 0.03419TMH IV2.38 ± 0.17449TMH IV/V0.37 ± 0.01475TMH V/VI0.28 ± 0.03510TMH VI/VII0.35 ± 0.02532TMH VI/VII0.32 ± 0.01557TMH VII0.46 ± 0.02880Large hydrophilic domain 20.99 ± 0.04927TMH VIII/IV0.20 ± 0.02980TMH X/XI0.16 ± 0.041008TMH XI/XII2.13 ± 0.021038C terminus0.16 ± 0.032-a Mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations are shown.

https://openalex.org/W2160927584,"In eukaryotes, the 20 S proteasome is the proteolytic core of the 26 S proteasome, which degrades ubiquitinated proteins in an ATP-dependent process. Archaebacteria lack ubiquitin and 26 S proteasomes but do contain 20 S proteasomes. Many archaebacteria, such as Methanococcus jannaschii, also contain a gene (S4) that is highly homologous to the six ATPases in the 19 S (PA700) component of the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome. To test if this putative ATPase may regulate proteasome function, we expressed it in Escherichia coli and purified the 50-kDa product as a 650-kDa complex with ATPase activity. When mixed with the well characterized 20 S proteasomes from Thermoplasma acidophilum and ATP, this complex stimulated degradation of several unfolded proteins 8–25-fold. It also stimulated proteolysis by 20 S proteasomes from another archaebacterium and mammals. This effect required ATP hydrolysis since ADP and the nonhydrolyzable analog, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidophosphate, were ineffective. CTP and to a lesser extent GTP and UTP were also hydrolyzed and also stimulated proteolysis. We therefore named this complex PAN for proteasome-activating nucleotidase. However, PAN did not promote the degradation of small peptides, which, unlike proteins, should readily diffuse into the proteasome. This ATPase complex appears to have been the evolutionary precursor of the eukaryotic 19 S complex, before the coupling of proteasome function to ubiquitination.

However, PAN did not promote the degradation of small peptides, which, unlike proteins, should readily diffuse into the proteasome. This ATPase complex appears to have been the evolutionary precursor of the eukaryotic 19 S complex, before the coupling of proteasome function to ubiquitination. proteasome-activating nucleotidase ATPases associated with a variety of activities 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidophosphate AAA ATPase-forming Ring-shaped complexes dithiothreitol The 26 S proteasome, which is the major site of protein breakdown in mammalian cells, is composed of the 20 S proteasome (molecular mass of 700 kDa) and two 19 S regulatory complexes (700 kDa) (1Coux O.

The 20 S proteasome is a cylindrical proteolytic complex composed of four stacked, seven-membered rings (3Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R.

In the presence of ATP, the 19 S complex (also called PA700) becomes associated with each end of the 20 S cylinder (4DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Chu-Ping M. Afendis S.J.

These ATPases are all members of the large AAA family, which contains more than 100 ATPases that are involved in diverse cellular processes, including protein degradation, cell division, peroxisome biogenesis, vesicle transport, and meiosis (11Beyer A.

The 20 S proteasome from archaebacteria, although containing only one type of α-subunit in the outer rings and one type of β-subunit in the central two rings, is quite similar in architecture to the eukaryotic proteasome and is clearly the evolutionary ancestor of the eukaryotic particle (2Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), which contains seven distinct but homologous α-subunits and seven distinct but homologous β-subunits.The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether the archaebacterial 20 S proteasome, like the eukaryotic particle, might also function in an ATP-dependent manner in association with a regulatory ATPase complex. In bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, which also lack ubiquitin, most intracellular protein degradation requires ATP and is catalyzed by large ATP-hydrolyzing proteolytic complexes (23Goldberg A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 24Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Cell. 1997; 91: 435-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Several of these enzymes (ClpAP, ClpXP, and HslVU) are composed of central proteolytic particles (ClpP and HslV) whose function in protein degradation requires ATP hydrolysis by an associated ring-shaped ATPase complex (ClpA, ClpX, and HslU) (24Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Cell. 1997; 91: 435-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Prior attempts to find a larger form of the archaebacterial proteasome that functions in an ATP-dependent fashion have not been successful (25Ehlers C. Kopp F. Dahlmann B. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 249-253Google Scholar). However, the sequencing of the genome of Methanococcus jannaschii and other archaebacteria have revealed a gene (S4) (26Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J.

Therefore, we investigated whether this protein, which we have termed “PAN”1 for proteasome-activating nucleotidase, can stimulate protein degradation by archaebacterial 20 S proteasomes in an ATP-dependent reaction. In these studies, we have chosen primarily to study 20 S proteasomes from T. acidophilum because their structure and enzymatic properties have been especially well characterized (3Löwe J. Stock D.

The present finding of an ATPase that markedly stimulates protein degradation by archaebacterial proteasomes reveals that a coupling of nucleotide and protein hydrolysis was established early in evolution. Accordingly, these archaebacteria also contain genes that encode homologs of the ATP-hydrolyzing protease La (Lon) (15Zwickl P. Goldberg A.L. Baumeister W. Wolf D.H. Hilt W.

Oguchi A. Aoki K. Kikuchi H. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Therefore, PAN should be considered as the evolutionary precursor of the six eukaryotic 26 S ATPases, which most likely arose from one primordial gene by gene duplications during the evolution of eukaryotic cells. The eukaryotic 20 S particle also evolved through multiple gene duplications, in which the single α-subunit and single β-subunit, typical of prokaryotic proteasomes, gradually evolved into seven distinct, but homologous, α-type and seven distinct, but homologous, β-type subunits in the eukaryotic particle (51Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).PAN thus appears likely to regulate 20 S function in many archaebacteria, as shown by its ability to stimulate proteolysis by the quite different proteasomes from Thermoplasma and Methanosarcina. It is also most likely that PAN activates these particles from Methanococcus, which is a methanogen closely related to Methanosarcina. However, this protein is probably not the only mode of regulation of proteasomes in these prokaryotes. Despite several attempts, we have failed to find a PAN homolog by polymerase chain reaction in Thermoplasma (the source of our 20 S proteasomes) using primers synthesized according to highly conserved regions of the archaebacterial PAN and eukaryotic 26 S ATPases. Moreover the complete genome of another archaebacterium, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, has been sequenced; it contains proteasomal genes, but no gene similar to PAN was found nor any ClpA homolog. 2S. Fitz-Gibbon, personal communication. Therefore, the mode of regulation of proteasomes in these species remains uncertain but presumably involves distinct ATPase complexes.PAN, its homologs in other archaebacteria, and the eukaryotic 26 S ATPases share a single nucleotide binding domain, P-loop, three highly conserved domains of unknown function, and an N-terminal coiled-coil (Fig. 1). This coiled-coil region was shown to be essential for the interactions of some of the 26 S ATPases with each other (52Richmond C. Gorbea C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13403-13411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and they may also be important in the binding of substrates (53Wang W. Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8236-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the truncated 40-kDa fragment of PAN lacks about half of the predicted coiled-coil, yet it was copurified in the same complex as the full-length PAN (Fig. 2). Interestingly, one of the six homologous ATPases in human and yeast 26 S proteasomes shows a low likelihood of containing a coiled-coil domain (52Richmond C. Gorbea C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13403-13411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,54Russell S.J. Sathyanarayana U.G. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32810-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 3D. Ng, P. Zwickl, and A. L. Goldberg, manuscript in preparation. ClpA and ClpB also contain internal translation initiation sites that produce full-length and truncated forms of these proteins that differ in their catalytic properties (55Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29468-29473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Park S.K. Kim K.I. Woo K.M. Seol J.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, by site-directed mutagenesis, we have recently eliminated this internal initiation site in PAN and obtained a similar sized PAN complex that contains only full-length subunits and that, surprisingly, stimulates protein breakdown almost identically to the preparations shown here.3It is noteworthy that ATP and PAN dramatically stimulate the degradation of several proteins (Tables I and II) but do not affect the hydrolysis of tetrapeptide and tripeptide substrates (Table III). Presumably, these small peptides can enter the 20 S particle and reach the central chamber in the absence of PAN. X-ray analysis of the Thermoplasma proteasome has shown that the outer α rings surround a 13-Å channel (3Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), which appears to be the site of entry for protein substrates (43Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but this opening is closed in the crystal structure of the yeast 20 S particle (57Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). Perhaps the binding of PAN or the ATPases of the eukaryotic 19 S complex to the terminal α-rings of the 20 S proteasome enlarges this opening in an ATP-dependent manner (8Larsen C.N. Finley D. Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and thus facilitates the access of proteins to the active sites localized in the central chamber (28Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In addition, PAN may stimulate the uptake of a polypeptide by the proteasome by altering its conformation and orientation (see below). In fact, in more recent studies, we have demonstrated that PAN not only forms a specific complex with the 20 S proteasome (as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments) but PAN also interacts directly with protein substrates (as shown by their ability to enhance ATPase activity of PAN).The stimulation of the breakdown of proteins, but not of small peptides, strongly suggests that PAN, by binding to the 20 S particle, promotes protein translocation into the 20 S proteasome. It has often been suggested that ATPases of the 26 S complex or ATP-dependent proteases function as chaperones to unfold prospective substrates. However, the substrates studied here (casein or oxidized α-lactalbumin) behave as unfolded molecules at 37 °C and at 55 or 60 °C must completely lack any tertiary structure. Consequently, the primary function of PAN under these conditions must be to translocate the denatured polypeptide into the 20 S particle. Moreover, the ability of PAN to stimulate proteolysis by two different types of archaebacterial proteasomes and even mammalian proteasomes, but not by ClpP or HslV, also supports the idea that PAN acts by forming a specific complex with the proteasome, rather than a mechanism where PAN alone binds to the substrate and releases the polypeptide in a form that then diffuses into the 20 S particle. By analogy to the other bacterial ATPase complexes that regulate proteolysis (ClpA, ClpX, and HslU) by specific proteolytic complexes (ClpP and HslV), it is attractive to assume that the 650-kDa PAN complex contains two rings, each of which is a complex of six or seven subunits that can bind to the ends of the 20 S particle. Our attempts thus far to analyze the structure of PAN by electron microscopy indicate ring-shaped structures and stacked rings, but a variety of other complexes with heterogeneous appearance were also present for reasons that are unclear.Unlike several ATP-dependent proteases or chaperones (ClpA, ClpX, and HslU), PAN hydrolyzes all four nucleotide triphosphates at significant rates, and all four can support protein degradation. Although we assume that PAN functions primarily in an ATP-dependent fashion in vivo, other nucleotides (especially CTP) may also support protein breakdown. Unfortunately, information is not available on the relative concentrations of these different nucleotides in archaebacteria under different growth conditions. This preference for ATP and CTP over GTP and UTP may even be a general feature of the AAA family members. A similar preference in nucleotide hydrolysis or in nucleotide-dependent proteolysis was found with eukaryotic 26 S proteasomes and 19 S regulatory particles (58Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32538-32545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the E. coli metalloprotease FtsH (59Herman C. Thevenet D. Bouloc P. Walker G.C. D'Ari R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and the Rhodococcus ARC complex (60Wolf S. Nagy I. Lupas A. Pfeifer G. Cejka Z. Mueller S. Engel A. De Mot R. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray structure of the second ATPase domain (D2) of the human NSF protein, a member of the AAA family, was determined (61Lenzen C.U. Steinmann D. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 62Yu R.C. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1998; 5: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It functions with ATP, but not GTP, apparently because the active site binds ATP in a syn conformation and does not sterically admit the carbonyl and amine groups on GTP's (purine) ring in this conformation (61Lenzen C.U. Steinmann D. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. Cell. 1998; 94: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 62Yu R.C. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1998; 5: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Since CTP and UTP also differ in the presence of the amine and carbonyl groups on the pyrimidine ring, binding of CTP but steric hindrance of UTP binding would also appear likely.Despite the very large evolutionary distance, the primary sequence and domain organization of PAN and those of the human and yeast 26 S ATPases are indeed very similar, and therefore, they probably function quite similarly in promoting protein breakdown by the 20 S particle. Therefore, further mechanistic and structural studies of the PAN-proteasome complex should help clarify the precise role of ATP in the formation and function of the 26 S eukaryotic complex. Certain bacteria (actinomycetes), which also lack ubiquitin and 26 S proteasomes, contain their 20 S proteasome α and β genes in close proximity to the gene for the ATPase termed ARC (60Wolf S. Nagy I. Lupas A. Pfeifer G. Cejka Z. Mueller S. Engel A. De Mot R. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Presumably, this ring-shaped nucleotidase activates protein degradation by the bacterial proteasomes by a similar mechanism as PAN, although it is not a close homolog of PAN nor the 26 S ATPases. By contrast, PAN shows extensive homologies to the 26 S proteasome and is therefore the most likely evolutionary precursor to the 19 S complex and, in particular, to its base, the portion which contains its six ATPases that associates with the 20 S proteasome (10Glickman M.H.

The one notable potential difference between these ATPase complexes is that PAN does not enhance peptide hydrolysis by its 20 S particle whereas the 19 S (PA700) complex does so, perhaps because this effect may involve a non-ATPase subunit. Recent findings have suggested that the other proteins of the 19 S complex that comprise its “lid” are homologous to the COP9-signalosome-like complex, which functions in signal transduction and translation (10Glickman M.H.

The combination of these components with PAN must have been the critical step during the evolution of eukaryotic cells that allowed the coupling of proteasome function to ubiquitin conjugation and the establishment of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The 26 S proteasome, which is the major site of protein breakdown in mammalian cells, is composed of the 20 S proteasome (molecular mass of 700 kDa) and two 19 S regulatory complexes (700 kDa) (1Coux O.

PLC-γ1 contains two SH2 domains, which are 35% identical in amino acid sequence, and one SH3 domain. The SH2 domains mediate the association of PLC-γ1 with autophosphorylation sites on activated receptor tyrosine kinases (23Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), an essential prerequisite to PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. The function of SH3 domains is to mediate association with proline-rich sequences in partner proteins; however, the exact role of this domain in PLC-γ1 function is unclear, as no interacting protein has been convincingly identified in vivo.In several growth factor receptors a specific autophosphorylation site is essential for PLC-γ1 association: Tyr-1021 in the platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor (19Rönnstrand L.

In each instance, mutagenesis of the essential tyrosine produces near complete abrogation of PLC-γ1 association and tyrosine phosphorylation. In the case of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, however, mutagenesis of each of the five autophosphorylation sites did not reveal a specific site essential for PLC-γ1 interaction (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the capacity of a complex of activated EGF receptor and fusion protein containing both SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 to differentially affect the sensitivity of individual phosphorylation sites to phosphatase digestion, it was found that the pY992 site was protected most while the pY1068 and pY1173 residues were protected to a lesser extent (35Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation sites pY1086 and pY1148 were not significantly protected. Based on these results, the authors concluded that pY992 was the major PLC-γ1 association site. However, another group demonstrated that mutagenesis of Tyr-992 to Phe had no influence on PLC-γ1 association (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or phosphorylation (36Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it remains unclear how PLC-γ1 interacts with autophosphorylation sites on the EGF receptor.Since PLC-γ1 has two dissimilar SH2 domains it is also not clear whether one or both are needed for association with the EGF receptor. One analysis of SH2 fusion protein binding to activated EGF receptors showed binding by the N-SH2 domain and, based on the synergistic binding of an construct containing both N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains, concluded that the C-SH2 domain also bound to the EGF receptor (23Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar).To explore the mechanism of PLC-γ1 interaction with the EGF receptor in more detail we have used two approaches. First, in vitro assays have utilized surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and enzyme-linked immunosubstrate assays (ELISA) to measure the binding of a panel of novel GST-SH2 constructs to phosphotyrosine-containing peptides representing each EGF receptor autophosphorylation site. The second approach employed is an in vivo assay in which point mutations are introduced into the PLC-γ1 molecule to disable each or both SH2 domains. The mutants were then tested in intact cells for their capacity to associate with the activated EGF receptor.DISCUSSIONThe data in this paper lead to the conclusion that PLC-γ1 interacts with the activated EGF receptor by a mechanism that involves the N-SH2 domain as a primary association event and the C-SH2 domain as a secondary event necessary for a maximal level of association. Together with other published data this model would suggest that the N-SH2 domain interacts primarily with pY1173, which is the major EGF receptor autophosphorylation site in vivo (48Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 most likely interacts with pY992, a minor autophosphorylation site in vivo (49Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).As reported elsewhere (35Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), phosphatase protection experiments in vitro showed that a fusion protein containing the single C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 blocked dephosphorylation of pY992 and a fusion protein having both N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains blocked dephosphorylation of the pY1068 and pY1173 sites in addition to pY992. The single N-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 was not assessed in that study. Hence, our data and conclusions are not in disagreement with the phosphatase protection data, but rather emphasize the contribution of the N-SH2 domain and the pY1173 site.The model described above is also consistent with published mutagenesis data. Analysis of single site autophosphorylation mutants showed that the Y1173F mutation decreased wild-type PLC-γ1 association by 35%, while no decrease was observed with the Y992F mutant (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Y1173F mutant also had a decreased capacity (∼30%) to produce inositol phosphates following the addition of EGF (50Magni M. Pandiella A. Helin K. Meldolesi J. Beguinot L. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since our data show that only the N-SH2 domain mediates PLC-γ1 association with the EGF receptor in cells, it seems reasonable to conclude that the PLC-γ1 activation and association with the Y1173F mutant observed in these prior studies were mediated by interactions between the N-SH2 domain and other autophosphorylation sites, such as pY1068.Analyses of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of EGF receptor also support a major role for the pY1173 site in mediating PLC-γ1 association. Deletion of residues encompassing the pY1173 and pY1148 sites or a larger deletion including the pY1173, pY1148, pY1086, and pY1068 sites substantially decreased ligand-stimulated PLC-γ1 association with the activated EGF receptor (51Margolis B. Li N. Koch A. Mohammadi M. Hurwitz D.R. Zilberstein A. Ullrich A. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In a separate study, deletion of Tyr(P) sites 1173 and 1148 dramatically decreased binding to the EGF receptor of a fusion protein containing both SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 (52Zhu G. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9559-9563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar results implicating carboxyl-terminal autophosphorylation sites in the control of PLC-γ1 interaction with the EGF receptor have been reported for the multiple autophosphorylation site mutants Y1173F,Y1148F and Y1173F,Y1148F,Y1068 (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, available mutagenesis studies are all consistent with a major role of pY1173 in mediating PLC-γ1 association with the EGF receptor and a lesser role for pY992. Unfortunately, stoichiometry data regarding the phosphorylation of these two autophosphorylation sites in vivo is not available. Hence, it is not possible to assess their relative contributions.Based on the screening of degenerate peptide libraries with various SH2 domains, consensus recognition sites for each SH2 domain have been developed (53Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the N-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 would have a preference for a pYLEL site and it was suggested that the N-SH2 domain might recognize the pYLRV sequence at pY1173 in the EGF receptor. This is directly supported by our data and model. In the studies with peptide libraries (53Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar), the C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 showed a selectivity for a pYV/IIP site which compares favorably with the pYLIP sequence at pY992. In fact, the same studies reported that, following Val or Ile at the +1 position, the C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 recognized Leu most frequently. The sequences at other EGF receptor autophosphorylation sites (pY1068, pY1068, and pY1148) do not conform to consensus sequences for either PLC-γ1 SH2 domain. Our in vitro data would support a minor accessory role for these sites, particularly pY1068 in recognizing the C-SH2 domain.Using an analogous but different approach, the contribution of SH2 domains to the association of SHP-1, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, and the activated EGF receptor has been reported (54Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5966-5973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Using Arg to Lys mutations to disable each or both SH2 domains of SHP-1 and in vitro measurements of association with activated EGF receptors, the N-SH2 domain was shown to be essential for receptor association; however, both SH2 domains were required for maximal association. Additionally, SHP-1 association was substantially decreased in the EGF receptor Y1173F mutant (55Keilhack H. Tenev T. Nyakatura E. Godovac-Zimermann J. Nielsen L. Seedorf K. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24839-24846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These studies concluded that the N-SH2 of SHP-1 bound to pY1173, but the exact recognition site for the C-SH2 domain was unclear.Since the structure of the EGF receptor carboxyl-terminal domain containing the five autophosphorylation sites is not known, it is difficult to further resolve the data into a more exact model. It will be important to understand how close together the multiple Tyr(P) sites may exist. Also, an important unknown is the stoichiometry of tyrosine phosphorylation at each autophosphorylation site. When autophosphorylated in vitro, a stoichiometry of up to 4 mol of phosphotyrosine/mol of EGF receptor has been reported (56Weber W. Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14631-14636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, receptor autophosphorylation stoichiometry in intact cells has not been reported and is likely to be lower. Since PLC-γ1 and SHP-1 have two SH2 domains, it is plausible that in each case the two SH2 domains engage different autophosphorylation sites on one receptor molecule or different sites on each monomer within a receptor dimer. A rapid cellular response to growth factor binding to cell surface receptors is the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). Respectively, these molecules initiate the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C. The mechanism by which growth factors stimulate this reaction involves the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of a specific phospholipase C (PLC) isoform: PLC-γ1 or PLC-γ2 (2Kamat A.

PLC-γ isoforms are structurally unique within this phospholipase family as they include Src homology (SH) domains, which enable protein/protein interactions (21Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 22Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). PLC-γ1 contains two SH2 domains, which are 35% identical in amino acid sequence, and one SH3 domain. The SH2 domains mediate the association of PLC-γ1 with autophosphorylation sites on activated receptor tyrosine kinases (23Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), an essential prerequisite to PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. The function of SH3 domains is to mediate association with proline-rich sequences in partner proteins; however, the exact role of this domain in PLC-γ1 function is unclear, as no interacting protein has been convincingly identified in vivo. In several growth factor receptors a specific autophosphorylation site is essential for PLC-γ1 association: Tyr-1021 in the platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor (19Rönnstrand L. Mori S.

In each instance, mutagenesis of the essential tyrosine produces near complete abrogation of PLC-γ1 association and tyrosine phosphorylation. In the case of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, however, mutagenesis of each of the five autophosphorylation sites did not reveal a specific site essential for PLC-γ1 interaction (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the capacity of a complex of activated EGF receptor and fusion protein containing both SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 to differentially affect the sensitivity of individual phosphorylation sites to phosphatase digestion, it was found that the pY992 site was protected most while the pY1068 and pY1173 residues were protected to a lesser extent (35Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation sites pY1086 and pY1148 were not significantly protected. Based on these results, the authors concluded that pY992 was the major PLC-γ1 association site. However, another group demonstrated that mutagenesis of Tyr-992 to Phe had no influence on PLC-γ1 association (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or phosphorylation (36Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it remains unclear how PLC-γ1 interacts with autophosphorylation sites on the EGF receptor. Since PLC-γ1 has two dissimilar SH2 domains it is also not clear whether one or both are needed for association with the EGF receptor. One analysis of SH2 fusion protein binding to activated EGF receptors showed binding by the N-SH2 domain and, based on the synergistic binding of an construct containing both N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains, concluded that the C-SH2 domain also bound to the EGF receptor (23Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism of PLC-γ1 interaction with the EGF receptor in more detail we have used two approaches. First, in vitro assays have utilized surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and enzyme-linked immunosubstrate assays (ELISA) to measure the binding of a panel of novel GST-SH2 constructs to phosphotyrosine-containing peptides representing each EGF receptor autophosphorylation site. The second approach employed is an in vivo assay in which point mutations are introduced into the PLC-γ1 molecule to disable each or both SH2 domains. The mutants were then tested in intact cells for their capacity to associate with the activated EGF receptor. DISCUSSIONThe data in this paper lead to the conclusion that PLC-γ1 interacts with the activated EGF receptor by a mechanism that involves the N-SH2 domain as a primary association event and the C-SH2 domain as a secondary event necessary for a maximal level of association. Together with other published data this model would suggest that the N-SH2 domain interacts primarily with pY1173, which is the major EGF receptor autophosphorylation site in vivo (48Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 most likely interacts with pY992, a minor autophosphorylation site in vivo (49Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).As reported elsewhere (35Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), phosphatase protection experiments in vitro showed that a fusion protein containing the single C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 blocked dephosphorylation of pY992 and a fusion protein having both N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains blocked dephosphorylation of the pY1068 and pY1173 sites in addition to pY992. The single N-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 was not assessed in that study. Hence, our data and conclusions are not in disagreement with the phosphatase protection data, but rather emphasize the contribution of the N-SH2 domain and the pY1173 site.The model described above is also consistent with published mutagenesis data. Analysis of single site autophosphorylation mutants showed that the Y1173F mutation decreased wild-type PLC-γ1 association by 35%, while no decrease was observed with the Y992F mutant (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Y1173F mutant also had a decreased capacity (∼30%) to produce inositol phosphates following the addition of EGF (50Magni M. Pandiella A. Helin K. Meldolesi J. Beguinot L. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since our data show that only the N-SH2 domain mediates PLC-γ1 association with the EGF receptor in cells, it seems reasonable to conclude that the PLC-γ1 activation and association with the Y1173F mutant observed in these prior studies were mediated by interactions between the N-SH2 domain and other autophosphorylation sites, such as pY1068.Analyses of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of EGF receptor also support a major role for the pY1173 site in mediating PLC-γ1 association. Deletion of residues encompassing the pY1173 and pY1148 sites or a larger deletion including the pY1173, pY1148, pY1086, and pY1068 sites substantially decreased ligand-stimulated PLC-γ1 association with the activated EGF receptor (51Margolis B. Li N. Koch A. Mohammadi M. Hurwitz D.R. Zilberstein A. Ullrich A. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4375-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In a separate study, deletion of Tyr(P) sites 1173 and 1148 dramatically decreased binding to the EGF receptor of a fusion protein containing both SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 (52Zhu G. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9559-9563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar results implicating carboxyl-terminal autophosphorylation sites in the control of PLC-γ1 interaction with the EGF receptor have been reported for the multiple autophosphorylation site mutants Y1173F,Y1148F and Y1173F,Y1148F,Y1068 (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, available mutagenesis studies are all consistent with a major role of pY1173 in mediating PLC-γ1 association with the EGF receptor and a lesser role for pY992. Unfortunately, stoichiometry data regarding the phosphorylation of these two autophosphorylation sites in vivo is not available. Hence, it is not possible to assess their relative contributions.Based on the screening of degenerate peptide libraries with various SH2 domains, consensus recognition sites for each SH2 domain have been developed (53Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the N-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 would have a preference for a pYLEL site and it was suggested that the N-SH2 domain might recognize the pYLRV sequence at pY1173 in the EGF receptor. This is directly supported by our data and model. In the studies with peptide libraries (53Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar), the C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 showed a selectivity for a pYV/IIP site which compares favorably with the pYLIP sequence at pY992. In fact, the same studies reported that, following Val or Ile at the +1 position, the C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 recognized Leu most frequently. The sequences at other EGF receptor autophosphorylation sites (pY1068, pY1068, and pY1148) do not conform to consensus sequences for either PLC-γ1 SH2 domain. Our in vitro data would support a minor accessory role for these sites, particularly pY1068 in recognizing the C-SH2 domain.Using an analogous but different approach, the contribution of SH2 domains to the association of SHP-1, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, and the activated EGF receptor has been reported (54Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5966-5973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Using Arg to Lys mutations to disable each or both SH2 domains of SHP-1 and in vitro measurements of association with activated EGF receptors, the N-SH2 domain was shown to be essential for receptor association; however, both SH2 domains were required for maximal association. Additionally, SHP-1 association was substantially decreased in the EGF receptor Y1173F mutant (55Keilhack H. Tenev T. Nyakatura E. Godovac-Zimermann J. Nielsen L. Seedorf K. Böhmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24839-24846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These studies concluded that the N-SH2 of SHP-1 bound to pY1173, but the exact recognition site for the C-SH2 domain was unclear.Since the structure of the EGF receptor carboxyl-terminal domain containing the five autophosphorylation sites is not known, it is difficult to further resolve the data into a more exact model. It will be important to understand how close together the multiple Tyr(P) sites may exist. Also, an important unknown is the stoichiometry of tyrosine phosphorylation at each autophosphorylation site. When autophosphorylated in vitro, a stoichiometry of up to 4 mol of phosphotyrosine/mol of EGF receptor has been reported (56Weber W. Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14631-14636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, receptor autophosphorylation stoichiometry in intact cells has not been reported and is likely to be lower. Since PLC-γ1 and SHP-1 have two SH2 domains, it is plausible that in each case the two SH2 domains engage different autophosphorylation sites on one receptor molecule or different sites on each monomer within a receptor dimer. The data in this paper lead to the conclusion that PLC-γ1 interacts with the activated EGF receptor by a mechanism that involves the N-SH2 domain as a primary association event and the C-SH2 domain as a secondary event necessary for a maximal level of association.

Thus, the calcium-dependent formation of the calcineurin-dynamin 1 complex, delivered to the other endocytic coat proteins, provides a calcium-sensing mechanism that facilitates endocytosis. calcineurin phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis C-terminal portion of dynamin 1 SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 hemagglutinin Neurotransmitter release occurs by calcium-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from nerve terminals mediated by a complex of proteins whose interactions are calcium-dependent (1Sudhof T.C.

Endocytic recycling of released synaptic vesicles is initiated at the same time as exocytosis and involves a complex of endocytic proteins including clathrin, clathrin adapters, dynamin 1, amphiphysin, and synaptojanin (3De Camilli P.

A possible link between calcium and dephosphorylation is suggested by evidence that the calcium-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin (Cn)1can dephosphorylate endocytic proteins (7Liu J.P. Sim A.T.

We now provide direct evidence that Cn is physically linked to the endocytic machinery. We show that Cn binds to dynamin 1 independent of its catalytic activity and that the Cn-dynamin 1 complex combines with amphiphysin 1, the anchor protein of the endocytic complex. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Cn-dynamin 1 interaction is calcium-dependent, allowing this complex to act as a calcium sensor. Finally, we show that disruption of the Cn-dynamin 1 interaction leads to inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Adult rat brain was homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble materials. The resulting lysate was divided into equal aliquots and incubated with GST-FKBP12-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Where indicated, GST-FKBP12-Sepharose beads were pre-absorbed with FK506 for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed twice in lysis buffer prior to adding to the cell lysate. Following the incubation, the Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose filters for immunoblotting. The protein band was excised, tryptically digested, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) (W. M. Keck Foundation). Protein 1 was identified as rat dynamin 1 with 0.015% error and a probability score of 1.0e + 00. The full-length human CnAβ open reading frame was cloned into yeast expression vector pPC97, containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain. This was used to screen a rat hippocampal cDNA library cloned into pPC86, containing the GAL4 transactivation domain as described in (18Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Positive interactions were defined as clones that are both His+ and β-galactosidase+. Rat brain lysate, prepared as described above, was incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibody for 2 h at 4 °C following preclearing with mouse IgG and protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed four times with lysis buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Where indicated, 2 mm EGTA was substituted for CaCl2. Cn and dynamin 1 were co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain lysate as before, using buffers containing varying concentrations of free calcium (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0–2599 μm CaCl2, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF). Free calcium concentrations were calculated as described (19Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). The CnA-H101Q or CnA-wild-type cDNA was subcloned into pRK5-HA vector and transiently transfected into PC12 cells, along with empty pEGFP vector (CLONTECH), using the LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Stratagene). After 40 h, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h before the addition of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 25 min. After a 10-min acid incubation (50 mm glycine, pH 3.0, 100 mm NaCl) at 4 °C, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Transferrin uptake was quantified by measuring the fluorescent intensities of internalized Texas Red labels in transfected and untransfected cells using a digital imaging system (Zeiss). Expression of transfected Cn constructs were independently confirmed by immunostaining with αCnA antibody. Using a GST-FKBP12 resin preincubated with FK506, we sought to immobilize Cn and Cn-associated proteins from a total rat brain extract. One major associated protein was detected as a 100-kDa band (Fig. 1 A, protein 1 in lane 4) and subsequently identified by mass spectroscopy as rat dynamin 1. Its identity was further confirmed by Western immunoblotting. Independently, we also detected the Cn-dynamin 1 association in a yeast two-hybrid screen (data not shown). Using full-length CnA as a bait, positive interaction was seen with a peptide fragment corresponding to the C-terminal portion of dynamin 1 (dyn1C, amino acids 618–850). To address the possibility that dynamin 1 may bind to FKBP12/FK506 independent of Cn, we expressed dyn1C as a polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein in bacteria (18Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and saw that it only bound the GST-FKBP12/FK506 resin in the presence of exogenously supplied Cn (Fig. 1 B), supporting a direct interaction between dynamin 1 and Cn. Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, we localized this interaction to the last 135 amino acids of dynamin 1 (Fig. 1 C). Because phospho-dynamin 1 is a Cn substrate (7Liu J.P. Sim A.T. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the binding we observed reflected a substrate-enzyme interaction. This seems improbable, because the Cn-dynamin 1 interaction occurs in the presence of the Cn inhibitor FK506, and bacterially produced dynamin 1, which cannot be phosphorylated, bound well to Cn. We directly demonstrated the independence of phosphorylation from the Cn-dynamin 1 interactions by showing that dynamin 1 co-immunoprecipitates with a form of Cn in which the histidine at position 101 has been mutated to glutamine, a change which abolishes the catalytic activity of Cn (Fig.2 A) (20Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 21Burnett P.E. Blackshaw S. Lai M.M. Qureshi I.A. Burnett A.F. Sabatini D.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8351-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To demonstrate a physiologic association between dynamin 1 and Cn, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Cn from rat brain and observed a co-precipitation of dynamin 1 (Fig. 2 B, top). Consistent with our previous findings, the addition of FK506 did not disrupt the Cn-dynamin 1 complex. Interestingly, we observed a strict dependence of this interaction on calcium, as addition of the calcium-chelator EGTA abolished the Cn-dynamin 1 association (Fig. 2 B, bottom). To further characterize the calcium-dependence of the Cn-dynamin 1 interaction, we co-immunoprecipitated Cn and dynamin 1 from rat brain in the presence of varying calcium concentrations. Maximal interaction between Cn and dynamin 1 occurs with as little as 1 μm free calcium, with an estimated EC50 for calcium in the range of 0.1–0.4 μm. This value falls within the physiologic range of intracellular [Ca2+]; and it is consistent with the reported affinity of Cn for calcium (Kd ≤ 1 μm) (22Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6270-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In similar experiments, we also found that the presence or absence of Mg2+ does not affect the interaction between Cn and dynamin 1 (data not shown). Amphiphysin 1 is the anchor protein that brings dynamin 1, clathrin, synaptojanin, and other proteins together in the endocytic complex (5Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We wondered whether dynamin 1 can deliver Cn to this complex. Accordingly, we applied a brain lysate to a GST-amphiphysin 1 column and demonstrated the binding of both dynamin 1 and Cn to amphiphysin 1 (Fig. 3 A). The presence of EGTA again caused Cn to dissociate from this complex of proteins, whereas the association between dynamin 1 and amphiphysin 1 appears to be calcium-independent. To test our hypothesis that dynamin 1 links Cn to the endocytic protein complex, we attempted to disrupt the dynamin 1-amphiphysin 1 interaction by the addition of a peptide corresponding to the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 (amphSH3, amino acids 588–695) to our binding experiment. Because the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 mediates its binding to dynamin 1 (23Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the addition of amphSH3 peptide caused both dynamin 1 and Cn to dissociate from the GST-amphiphysin 1 column (Fig. 3 B), confirming that dynamin 1 provides a physical linkage between Cn and the endocytic protein complex. This experiment also showed that no direct interaction between Cn and amphiphysin 1 exists. Recent studies provided evidence that microinjection of the amphSH3 peptide inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis in living nerve terminals (24Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Cn in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we disrupted the Cn-dynamin 1 interaction in vivo and assessed the endocytic uptake of transferrin molecules. Because CnA-H1010Q binds dynamin 1 but is devoid of catalytic activity (Fig. 2 A), we reasoned that it could act as a dominant-negative mutant when overexpressed in PC12 cells, which contain both endogenous Cn and dynamin 1. Indeed, we observed that overexpression of CnA-H101Q caused complete inhibition of transferrin endocytosis in certain transfected cells (Fig. 4, A–C). Overall, cells overexpressing the CnA-H101Q mutant showed a decrease of approximately 35% in transferrin uptake (n = 46, p < 0.005, paired t test) (Fig.4 G). Overexpression of the wild-type CnA subunit did not alter the endocytosis of transferrin (Fig. 4, D–G). The protein interactions we have described here are consistent with a model in which the interaction between Cn and dynamin 1 serves as a calcium sensor of endocytosis (Fig. 5). Under basal conditions, Cn and dynamin 1 are largely unassociated. A rise in intracellular calcium concentration, produced by either neuronal depolarization or extracellular stimuli, causes the association between Cn and dynamin 1, as well as the dephosphorylation of dynamin 1. The Cn-dynamin 1 complex binds to amphiphysin 1, and the delivery by dynamin 1 of Cn to the endocytic protein complex provides the proximity enabling Cn to initiate the dephosphorylation of other proteins in the complex. Consistent with previous studies, Cn, and possibly other phosphatases, allows the endocytic coat complex to remain assembled and functional. Calcium is the crucial facilitator of both exocytosis and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Synaptotagmin has been implicated as the calcium sensor for exocytosis (2DeBello W.M. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 947-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C.

Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), whereas the nature of the calcium sensor for endocytosis has been unclear. Our findings provide a direct demonstration that Cn is a key component of the endocytic complex and is brought into the complex via its binding to dynamin 1. In addition, the calcium-dependent nature of the Cn-dynamin 1 association, which occurs in the presence of sub-micromolar calcium concentrations, provides a possible mechanism for sensing alterations in intracellular calcium concentration during endocytosis. Elucidating the precise molecular nature of the Cn-dynamin 1 interaction may provide valuable insights into the calcium-sensing mechanism of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W1986861517,"To characterize the regulatory mechanism of phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1) in the bradykinin (BK) receptor-mediated signaling pathway, we used a clone of PC12 cells, which stably overexpress PLC-δ1 (PC12-D1). Stimulation with BK induced a significantly higher Ca2+ elevation and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production with a much lower half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of BK in PC12-D1 cells than in wild type (PC12-W) or vector-transfected (PC12-V) cells. However, BK-induced intracellular Ca2+ release and IP3 generation was similar between PC12-V and PC12-D1 cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the availability of extracellular Ca2+ is essential to the activation of PLC-δ1. When PC12-D1 cells were treated with agents that induce Ca2+ influx, more IP3 was produced, suggesting that the Ca2+ entry induces IP3production in PC12-D1 cells. Furthermore, the additional IP3 production after BK-induced capacitative calcium entry was detected in PC12-D1 cells, suggesting that PLC-δ1 is mainly activated by capacitative calcium entry. When cells were stimulated with BK in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, [3H]norepinephrine secretion was much greater from PC12-D1 cells than from PC12-V cells.

So far, 10 different mammalian phosphoinositide-specific PLC isozymes (PLC-β1, -β2, -β3, -β4, -γ1, -γ2, -δ1, -δ2, -δ3, and -δ4) have been characterized (1Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol.

The δ-type isozymes are smaller (Mr85,000) than the PLC-β and PLC-γ (Mr140,000–155,000) isoforms. PLC-β has been shown to be regulated by heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) (5Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The PLC-β family is regulated by α-subunits of a pertussis toxin-insensitive Gq family of G-protein (6Martin T.F. Lewis J.E. Kowalchyk J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 7Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 8Smrcka A.V.

Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). PLC-γ is thought to be a cytosolic isozyme that contains two Src homology 2 domains and an Src homology 3 domain and is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation following binding to either growth factor-activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor (10Meisenhelder J.

Raab M. de Silva A. Telfer J.C. Yamamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 239-266PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison with the PLC-β and PLC-γ isozymes, the physiological role and regulation of the PLC-δ family has been poorly understood despite its wide distribution (13Watson S. Arkinstall S. Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-protein Linked Receptor FactsBook. Academic Press, London1994: 372-387Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a PLC-δ1 molecule lacking the pleckstrin homology domain revealed the catalytic domains (X and Y regions), which are tightly associated with two accessory modules, an EF-hand domain and a C2 domain (14Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Wiliams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), the latter of which was previously suggested to mediate Ca2+-dependent binding to lipid vesicles (15Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Furthermore, structural studies of the multidomain PLC-δ1 protein suggested that the binding sites for Ca2+ions and the head group of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate are located both within and outside the catalytic domain (14Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Wiliams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Other studies of PLC-δ1 also revealed that substances such as Ca2+ ions and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) could play important roles as positive (16Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cockcroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and negative (17Cifuentes M.E. Delaney T. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1945-1948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) regulators, respectively. Although all PLC isozymes are activated by Ca2+ in vitro, PLC-δ isozymes seem more sensitive to Ca2+than the other isozymes. An increase in Ca2+ ion concentration within the physiological range (0.1–10 μm) was sufficient to stimulate PLC-δ1 but not PLC-β1 and PLC-γ1 and to hydrolyze cellular inositol lipids present in permeabilized cells (16Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cockcroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ to a level sufficient to fix the C2 domain of PLC-δ might therefore trigger the enzyme's activation. Thus, it has been suggested that the activation of the PLC-δ isozymes might occur as an event secondary to the receptor-mediated activation of other PLC isozymes or Ca2+channels (18Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells are known to express PLC-δ1 (19Rhee S.G. Kim H. Suh P.-G. Choi W.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, its biological function in PC12 cells has not yet been established. In order to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of PLC-δ1, we stably overexpressed PLC-δ1 in PC12 cells. Interestingly, we found that stimulation of G-protein-coupled bradykinin receptors significantly potentiated the responses of the PLC-δ1-overexpressing PC12 cells. Our data demonstrate that PLC-δ1 is mainly activated by capacitative calcium entry following PLC-β activation in the BK receptor-mediated signaling pathway.

PC12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Hyclone), and 1% antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. The culture medium was changed every 2 days, and the PC12 cells were subcultured weekly. PLC-δ1 cDNA was cloned in a plasmid vector, pIBI20. The PLC-11/pIBI20 plasmid was then digested with Not I. The 2.8-kilobase pair insert obtained was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pZipNeo, which contains a viral promoter and the neomycin resistance gene. The constructed plasmid DNA (PLC-δ1/pZipNeo) or the vector DNA (pZipNeo) alone was transfected into PC12 cells using an electroporator (Bio-Rad, 960 microfarads/250 V). One day after transfection, the cells were selectively grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 for a week. The G418-resistant clones were screened for the expression of PLC-δ1 protein by Western blotting and probing with a monoclonal anti-PLC-δ1 antibody using the ECL detection system. Positive clones were then maintained in the presence of 100 μg/ml G418. Cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 as reported previously (20Park T.J. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, PC12 cell suspensions were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing Fura-2/AM (3 μm) and sulfinpyrazone (250 μm) for 40 min at 37 °C) with continuous stirring. The cells were then washed with Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES buffer adjusted to pH 7.4) containing sulfinpyrazone (250 μm) and left at room temperature until use. Fluorescence ratios were measured by an alternative wavelength time scanning method (dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm; emission at 500 nm). Calibration of the fluorescent signal in terms of [Ca2+]i was performed as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PC12 cells that had been loaded with Fura-2/AM as described above were stimulated with bradykinin in the presence of 25 μmMn2+, and changes in fluorescence were measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm, which is an isosbestic wavelength, and at an emission wavelength of 500 nm, as described by Lee et al. (22Lee H. Suh B.C. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21831-21838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). IP3 concentration in the cells was determined by competition assay with [3H]IP3 as described previously (23Park T.J. Song S.K. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, to determine agonist-evoked IP3 production, PC12 cells were stimulated with agonists for the indicated periods of time. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium off the cells and adding 15% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm EGTA. The cells were left on ice for 30 min to extract the water-soluble inositol phosphates. Trichloroacetic acid was then removed by extraction with diethyl ether. The final preparation was neutralized with 200 mm Tris, and its pH was adjusted to about 7.4. Assay buffer (0.1 m Tris buffer containing 4 mm EDTA and 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), [3H]IP3 (0.1 μCi/ml), and IP3-binding protein were added to the cell extract. The mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. Water and scintillation mixture were added to the pellet to measure radioactivity. IP3concentration in the sample was determined based on a standard curve and expressed as pmol/μg of protein in the soluble cell extract. The IP3-binding protein was prepared from bovine adrenal cortex according to the method of Challiss et al. (24Challiss R.A. Chilvers E.R. Willcocks A.L. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Catecholamine secretion by PC12 cells was measured in 24-well plates following the method reported by Park et al. (25Park T.J. Shin S.Y. Suh B.C. Suh E.K. Lee I.S. Kim K.T. Synapse. 1998; 29: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with some modification. In brief, cells were loaded with [3H]NE (1 μCi/ml; 68 pmol/ml) while incubating in RPMI containing 0.01% ascorbic acid for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. The cells were washed with Locke's solution twice and incubated in Locke's solution for 15 min to stabilize. Then the cells were incubated in Locke's solution for 10 min during which basal secretion was measured. The cells were subsequently stimulated with the drugs under test for 10 min. After the incubation, the medium was aspirated from each well and transferred to a scintillation vial. Finally, residual catecholamine in the cells was extracted with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the extract was transferred to a scintillation vial. The radioactivity in each vial was determined in a scintillation counter. The amount of [3H]NE secreted was calculated as percentage of total [3H]NE content. Net secretion was obtained by subtracting basal secretion from the stimulated secretion. In order to study the effect of SK&F 96365 on the BK-induced [3H]NE secretion, the drug was added to both media used to measure basal and stimulated secretion. Photoaffinity labeling of G-protein with [α-32P]GTP was carried out by the method of Linse and Mandelkow (26Linse K. Mandelkow E.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15205-15210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (27Baek K.J. Das T. Gray C. Antar S. Murugesan G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27390-27397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were photolabeled with 5–10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in the presence of 2 mmMgCl2 in an ice bath under 254-nm UV irradiation for 5–10 min. After the irradiation, the samples were mixed with Laemmli stopping solution (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5–12% gels. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT XAR-5 film using DuPont image-intensifying screens. Transglutaminase activity was determined by quantifying the incorporation of [3H]putrescine into casein as described previously (29Miraglia C.C. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This reaction was carried out in 0.1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, N, N′-dimethylcasein (1 mg/ml), 250 μm putrescine, 1 μCi of [3H]putrescine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and the enzyme in the indicated amounts. Where indicated, CaCl2 (1 mm) and GTP (5 mm) were added in the reaction mixture. Glycerol was included in the buffer, because its presence has been found to stabilize the transglutaminase activity (29Miraglia C.C. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of glycerol in the assay had no effect on the GTP-induced inhibition of guinea pig liver transglutaminase activity. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was collected on Whatman GF/C filters and washed three times with 10 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Cells were grown to confluence and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.2), 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% triton X-100). After sonication, the cell homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins (50 μg) were separated in 7.5–12% (w/v) gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with low detergent blotto (LDB; 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) at room temperature and then incubated in LDB containing polyclonal antibody against Ghα (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. For immunoblots probed with monoclonal antibody against PLC-β1, PLC-γ1, and PLC-δ1, the antibody was diluted 1:2000, and the incubation was overnight. After being washed with LDB, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse immunoglobulin peroxidase-linked antibody (1:5000 dilution) in high detergent blotto (2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in LDB) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the membranes were subjected to the procedures for enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and each extract (800 μg/1000 μl) was treated with a preformed complex of Staphylococcus aureus goat anti-mouse IgG (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 min and washed three times with lysis buffer. The pellets were then processed by PAGE and Immunoblotting and probing with anti-Ghα antibody, exactly as described above. The amount of protein was estimated by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein determination kit and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Statistical analysis of the data was done using the unpaired Student's t test in comparison between two experimental groups. Differences were considered significant when probability (p) values were <0.05. PC12 cells were transfected with a construct containing rat brain PLC-δ1 cDNA. Seven clones were obtained. One clone, PLCδ14, exhibiting the highest level of PLC-δ1 as inferred by Western blot analysis was selected and used under the name PC12-D1 throughout the following experiments. A clone of vector-transfected PC12 cells (PC12-V) was used as a control. Western blot analyses using monoclonal antibodies against mouse PLC-β1, -γ1, and -δ1 revealed a marked overexpression of PLC-δ1 in the PC12-D1 cells (lane 3 in Fig.1 C). Although wild type (PC12-W) and vector-transfected (PC12-V) cells also expressed PLC-δ1, the level of expression was much lower in those cells than in the PC12-D1 cells (lanes 1 and 2 in Fig.1 C). On the other hand, the three kinds of cells all expressed similar amounts of PLC-β1 (Fig. 1 A) and PLC-γ1 (Fig. 1 B). We investigated the effect of PLC-δ1 overexpression on the BK-induced signaling in PC12 cells. BK induced a much greater [Ca2+]i rise in the PC12-D1 cells than in the PC12-W or PC12-V cells (Fig.2 A). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) was much lower for the PC12-D1 cells (∼10 nm) than the PC12-W or PC12-V cells (both ∼100 nm) (Fig. 2 B). However, the maximal effective concentrations (EC100) were same for the three kinds of cells, namely 5 μm. When the three kinds of PC12 cells were treated with HOE140, an antagonist of B2bradykinin receptors, BK-induced [Ca2+]i rise was completely blocked (data not shown), suggesting that the BK-induced response is entirely dependent on the B2 receptors. We also investigated whether BK-induced [Ca2+]irise is also potentiated in other PC12 clones that overexpress different levels of PLC-δ1. As shown in Fig.3, the expression levels of PLC-δ1 in four different PC12 clones (δ5, δ12, δ14, and δ15) differentially affect the BK-induced [Ca2+]irise. Two clones, δ5 and δ12, which express intermediate levels of PLC-δ1, exhibited intermediate [Ca2+]iincreases caused by BK. Interestingly, δ14 and δ15 showed similar BK-induced [Ca2+]i rises, although the expression level of PLC-δ1 in δ14 clone is apparently higher than in δ15 clone. These results suggest that there is some limitation in the activation of PLC-δ1 when the enzyme is expressed over a certain level. The BK-induced [Ca2+]i rise in PC12 cells occurs via two routes: Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ release-activated calcium channels (31Suh B.C. Lee C.O. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We tested which route of Ca2+ mobilization contributed to the enhanced [Ca2+]i rise after BK treatment in PC12-D1 cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, BK-induced Ca2+ release in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was not significantly different in the three kinds of PC12 cells. Both EC50 and EC100 were similar (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, BK-induced Ca2+influx after the addition of extracellular Ca2+, which is thought to occur through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels, was greater in the PC12-D1 cells than in the PC12-W or PC12-V cells (Fig. 4 A). EC50 was ∼3 and ∼30 nm for PC12-D1 and PC12-W or PC12-V cells, respectively (Fig. 4 B). However, the EC100remained similar (5 μm) among the three kinds of cells. The increased BK-induced Ca2+ influx into the PC12-D1 cells was confirmed by Mn2+ quenching experiments. Mn2+ is a good surrogate for Ca2+ ions in these kind of experiments, since it is not pumped out of the cells. Thus, it can be used as a selective tracer for Ca2+ influx (22Lee H. Suh B.C. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21831-21838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the fluorescence of Fura-2 was gradually quenched by the presence of Mn2+. When PC12 cells were stimulated with BK, fluorescence rapidly decreased, suggesting that BK-induced Mn2+ influx had occurred. The fluorescence quenching induced by the BK treatment was greater in the PC12-D1 cells than in PC12-W or PC12-V cells. The results together, therefore, suggest that BK-induced Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels is greatly enhanced in cells overexpressing PLC-δ1.Figure 5Effect of BK on Mn2+quenching. Fura-2-loaded cells were incubated with 25 μm Mn2+ for 3 min prior to the 10 nm BK treatment. The influx of Mn2+ was measured in terms of quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence excited at 360 nm and emitted at 500 nm. Traces shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since IP3 production can be an indicator of PLC activity, BK-induced IP3 production in PC12-V and PC12-D1 cells was compared. When cells were treated with various concentrations of BK, more IP3 was formed in the PC12-D1 cells than in the PC12-V cells (Fig.6 A). At 5 μm BK concentration, the maximal IP3 produced occurred 15 s after stimulation, which is in good agreement with our previous result (31Suh B.C. Lee C.O. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 B). At this time, the PC12-D1 cells produced ∼1.7 times more IP3 than the PC12-V cells, suggesting that PLC activity is higher in the PC12-D1 cells. Because PC12-D1 cells overexpress PLC-δ1, the difference in the PLC activity between the PC12-V and PC12-D1 cells can be attributed to the activity of overexpressed PLC-δ1. In the most simple scenario, one could assume that the greater IP3 production in the PC12-D1 cells subsequently induces a greater Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores. However, the amount of Ca2+ release in PC12-V and PC12-D1 cells was similar, which contradicts the assumption of a greater IP3 production in PC12-D1 cells. A difference in the experimental conditions may provide a clue for the understanding of this discrepancy. Unlike the IP3 production experiments, which were done in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, BK-induced Ca2+ release was determined in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Therefore, additional IP3 production by the overexpressed PLC-δ1 in PC12-D1 cells may depend on the availability of extracellular Ca2+. This possibility was tested by measuring IP3 levels under conditions when extracellular Ca2+ was removed and intracellular Ca2+ was chelated with BAPTA. In the absence of any Ca2+, the IP3 production in PC12-V and PC12-D1 cells was similar (Fig. 6, C and D), suggesting that Ca2+ is required for the activation of PLC-δ1. The Ca2+ that is necessary for the activation of PLC-δ1 can be supplied by Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores or by Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. When released Ca2+ can activate PLC-δ1, then the BK-induced Ca2+ release in the PC12-D1 cells should be greater than in PC12-V cells due to the additional IP3 produced by the overexpressed PLC-δ1. However, released Ca2+ can be ruled out as a prominent candidate for PLC-δ1 activator, considering that the BK-induced Ca2+ release between the PC12-V and PC12-D1 cells was similar (Fig. 4). Therefore, we tested the possibility that Ca2+ could have entered from the extracellular space to activate PLC-δ1. As shown in Fig.7 A, Ca2+influx-inducing agents such as high K+, thapsigargin, and ionomycin activated additional IP3 production in PC12-D1 cells but not in PC12-V cells. The additional IP3production induced by these agents disappeared in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 7 B). The results, therefore, suggest that entry of extracellular Ca2+activates PLC-δ1. Since the BK-induced Ca2+ influx is generally thought to occur by capacitative calcium entry through Ca2+release-activated Ca2+ channels, it is likely that PLC-δ1 activation after BK treatment is mainly due to capacitative calcium entry. To test this hypothesis, the effect of reintroduction of extracellular Ca2+ 30 s after stimulation with BK in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ on IP3production was investigated. In contrast to PC12-V cells (Fig.8 B), PC12-D1 cells showed a significant increase in IP3 after the reintroduction of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 8 D). In addition, SK&F 96365, an inhibitor of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels, diminished the additional IP3production stimulated by the entry of extracellular Ca2+into the PC12-D1 cells (Fig. 8 D), without affecting the BK-induced IP3 production into the PC12-V cells (Fig.8 B). These results suggest that, when PC12 cells are stimulated with BK, PLC-δ1 is activated by capacitative calcium entry occurring subsequent to IP3 production and Ca2+release after PLC-β activation. These results also explain greater Ca2+ influx induced by BK stimulation in PC12-D1 cells as shown in Fig. 4. Capacitative calcium entry in the PC12-D1 cells triggers serial feedback events such as rapid activation of PLC-δ1, more IP3 production, further depletion of Ca2+stores, and more capacitative calcium entry. The effect of PLC-δ1 overexpression on catecholamine secretion, in which Ca2+ increase plays a key role, was also investigated. Like the Ca2+ increase, the BK-induced [3H]NE secretion was much greater in the PC12-D1 cells (Table I). The enhanced secretion was observed in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, but not in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the enhancement of the secretion in PC12-D1 cells is due to the greater influx of extracellular Ca2+. In the presence of SK&F 96365, PC12-V and PC12-D1 cells secreted similar amounts of [3H]NE upon BK stimulation, suggesting that the capacitative calcium entry through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels induces PLC-δ1 activation and the subsequent additional increase in [Ca2+]i, leading to the potentiation of [3H]NE secretion.Table IEffect of PLC-δ1 overexpression on BK-evoked [3H]NE secretionTreatmentNet secretion of [3H]NE (percentage of total)Without extracellular Ca2+With extr"

While in LAD II hypofucosylation of glycoconjugates is secondary to an impaired synthesis of GDP-fucose due to a deficiency of the GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase, synthesis of GDP-fucose was normal in our patient (Körner, C., Linnebank, M., Koch, H., Harms, E., von Figura, K., and Marquardt, T.

In our patient the saturable high affinity import of GDP-fucose was deficient, while import of UDP-galactose and the activity of GDPase, which generates the nucleoside phosphate required for antiport of GDP-fucose, were normal.

We propose that this new form of carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome is caused by impaired import of GDP-fucose into the Golgi. carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome(s) leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II The glycosylation of proteins and lipids, which mainly takes place in the luminal part of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, requires the presence of specific nucleotide sugar transporters. These proteins allow the import of cytoplasmically synthesized nucleotide sugars and function as antiporters by exchanging the nucleotide sugars with the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates. The latter is generated in the organelle lumen by the action of glycosyltransferases and nucleoside diphosphatases (1Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev.

Several of these transporters have been identified by cDNA complementation studies using mutant cell lines with impaired nucleotide sugar transport.

In the present study we describe for the first time the association of a human disease with a defect in the translocation of a nucleotide sugar.

Tonetti M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since the activity of GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase was normal in fibroblasts from our patient (17Körner C. Linnebank M. Koch H.G. Harms E. von Figura K. Marquardt T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the hypofucosylation must result from a different defect. Here we report that the hypofucosylation results from a severely decreased import of GDP-fucose into the Golgi. [2-3H]Mannose (636 GBq/mmol), GDP-[14C]fucose (11.5 GBq/mmol), UDP-[3H]galactose (359 GBq/mmol), and [methoxy-14C]inulin (0.33 MBq/g) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Braunschweig, Germany). Human primary fibroblast cultures from controls, parents, and the patient were obtained from upper arm skin biopsies. Cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Pansystems, Aidenbach, Germany). Labeling of fibroblasts with 125 μCi of [2-3H]mannose was carried out for 30 min or 6 h as described previously (18Körner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). GDP-[3H] mannose and GDP-[3H]fucose were separated from other labeled metabolites by descending paper chromatography. [3H]Mannose and [3H]fucose were released from nucleotide sugars by mild acid hydrolysis, separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and quantified by TLC scanner (Berthold) as described previously (18Körner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins of control and patient fibroblasts labeled with [2-3H]mannose were sequentially extracted as described previously (18Körner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) followed by a digestion with 100 μg/ml of Pronase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 24 h at 50 °C in a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5% SDS. [3H]Mannose and [3H]fucose were released from the resulting glycopeptides by acid hydrolysis in 1m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h and analyzed by TLC as described above. Radiolabeled glycopeptides were subjected to lectin affinity chromatography on a column containing agarose bound L. culinaris lectin (Sigma) as described previously (19Cumming D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 67-86Google Scholar). Golgi-derived membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (20Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For each experiment two 150-cm2 cell culture dishes were seeded with 3 × 106 fibroblasts each. After culturing for 10 days, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (0.15 mNaCl in sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and swollen for 30 s in 0.25m sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4. Cells were scraped into PBS and centrifuged for 5 min with 500 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were redissolved in 2 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, disrupted in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Homogenization of the pellet in sucrose/imidazole and centrifugation were repeated. The supernatants were combined and overlaid onto a cushion of 1.3m sucrose in 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, for density gradient centrifugation in a SW 40-rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 105 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. Golgi-enriched membranes were collected at the 0.25–1.3 msucrose interphase and quantified by galactosyltransferase activity as described (21Brändli A.W. Hansson G.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein determination followed the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Import of nucleotide sugars into Golgi-enriched membranes was determined as described previously (23Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The reaction was started by the addition of Golgi-enriched membranes (60–100 μg) to buffer A (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose) containing GDP-[14C]fucose or UDP-[3H]galactose in a final volume of 0.47 ml. Unless otherwise stated, the assays contained 3 μm GDP-[14C]fucose (≈885,000 dpm) or 0.5 μm UDP-[3H]galactose (≈4.3 × 106 dpm). After an incubation for 10 min or the time indicated at 30 °C the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.8 ml of ice-cold buffer A, followed by centrifugation at 105× g for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA-45 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The supernatant was removed and used for the calculation of radioactivity in the incubation medium. The pellet was washed three times with ice cold buffer A, redissolved in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 5 mm EDTA and 2% SDS by sonification for 2 min (Branson), and incubated for 30 min at 23 °C. The amount of radioactivity associated with the pellet represents the nucleotide sugars imported into vesicles, including the sugars transferred to glycoconjugates and the radioactivity trapped in the extravesicular space of the pellet. To determine the latter, membranes were incubated under identical conditions with [methoxy-14C]inulin, which does not penetrate into vesicles. The value for imported nucleotide sugar was obtained by correcting the radioactivity associated with the pellet for the radioactivity trapped in the extravesicular space (23Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under standard conditions using membranes from control fibroblasts, the trapped radioactivity represented 17 ± 5% of the [14C]fucose or 12 ± 2% of the [3H]galactose radioactivity associated with the pellet. To differentiate in the vesicles between nucleotide sugar and glycoprotein associated radioactivity, 0.05 ml of 0.5 nHCl, containing 20% trichloroacetic acid and 1% phosphotungstic acid were added to the solubilized pellet. After an overnight precipitation and centrifugation the pellet was solubilized in 2.5 nNaOH, and the radioactivity was determined. Under standard conditions 25% of the imported [14C]fucose and 14% of the imported [3H]galactose were found to be transferred to glycoproteins. For a precise description of the calculation, see Ref.23Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. For preparation of crude membranes cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2 (buffer B) and scraped into 1 ml of the same buffer. The cells were passed 20 times through a 22-gauge needle, and unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g. Crude membranes were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 105 × g for 30 min and redissolved in buffer B. GDPase activity was measured by a modification of the method described by Abeijon et al. (24Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out in buffer B containing 3 mmGDP, 0.1% Triton X-100, and crude membranes (20 μg) in a final volume of 100 μl. Following incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of 5% (w/v) SDS. The samples were then diluted to 0.3 ml with buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and inorganic phosphate was determined by the Ames method (25Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-117Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). A biochemical hallmark in leukocytes and fibroblasts of our patient is the absence of α1,2-, α1,3-, and α1,6-linked fucose residues in glycoconjugates (15Marquardt T. Brune T. Lühn K. Zimmer K.P. Körner C. Fabritz L. van der Werft N. Vormoor J. Freeze H. Louwen F. Biermann B. Harms E. von Figura K. Vestweber D. Koch H.G. J. Pediatr. 1999; 134: 681-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests either a defect in the cytoplasmic synthesis of GDP-fucose, of its import in the Golgi, or of a common cofactor of fucosyltransferases. De novo synthesis of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose is catalyzed by GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase together with the FX protein, which has an epimerase and reductase activity. Extracts from fibroblasts and leukocytes of our patient catalyzed the synthesis of GDP-fucose from GDP-mannose at a normal rate (17Körner C. Linnebank M. Koch H.G. Harms E. von Figura K. Marquardt T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the synthesis of GDP-fucose and the fucosylation of glycoproteins in fibroblasts from our patient in more detail. When fibroblasts were incubated for 30 min in the presence of [2-3H]mannose the incorporation of radioactivity into GDP-fucose was almost six times lower than in controls (TableI). When the incubation period was prolonged to 6 h, the incorporation of radioactivity into GDP-fucose pool was close to normal, while the incorporation into glycoproteins was about one-fourth of control (Table I). One possibility to explain these observations is the assumption that the import of cytosolic GDP-fucose into the Golgi is impaired, leading to an accumulation of GDP-fucose in the cytosol, a deficiency of GDP-fucose in the Golgi and a hypofucosylation of glycoproteins. The increase of cytosolic GDP-fucose can explain the decreased rate of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose conversion by the known feed back inhibition of GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase by GDP-fucose (26Sullivan F.X. Kumar R. Kriz R. Stahl M. Xu G.-Y. Rouse J. Chang X.-J. Boodhoo A. Potvin B. Cumming D.A. J. Biol.

The fraction containing GDP-mannose and GDP-fucose was subjected to mild acid hydrolysis. The released [2-3H]mannose and [2-3H]fucose were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified with a flat screen scanner.

The glycopeptides were subjected to acid hydrolysis and the liberated [2-3H]mannose and [2-3H]fucose were separated and quantified as above. After labeling for 0.5 h incorporation of [2-3H]fucose into glycoproteins was below the limit of detection in controls and in the patient.

To verify the hypofucosylation of glycoproteins, fibroblasts were metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose for 6 h. When labeled glycopeptides prepared from these cells were subjected to L. culinaris affinity chromatography, which retains α1,6-fucosylated glycopeptides, the bound fraction was less than 1% of that in controls (Table II), thus confirming the severe hypofucosylation of glycoproteins. Moreover, we could demonstrate that incubation of the patients fibroblasts in the presence of 1 mm fucose, but not in the presence of 1 mm mannose overcomes by large the fucosylation defect (Table I). One explanation for the correction of the defect by addition of l-fucose to the medium would be a Kmdefect in the GDP-fucose transport. The elevated amount of GDP-fucose in the cytoplasm would increase the transport into the Golgi to an extent that ensures nearly normal fucosylation of glycoproteins. The corrective effect renders the possibility unlikely that the hypofucosylation results from the deficiency of a cofactor common to all fucosyltransferases.Table IICorrection of hypofucosylation by addition of fucose to patient derived fibroblastsAdditionFlow-throughEluate% bound to Lens lectincpm [3H]glycopeptidesControl160,35427,34114.57 1 mm mannose33,84336649.77 1 mmfucose147,96222,13213.01Patient113,8801310.11 1 mmmannose38,747630.16 1 mmfucose135,15810,2257.041.2 × 106 fibroblasts were grown for 48 h in the absence or in the presence of either 1 mmd-mannose or 1 mml-fucose.

Next we assayed the import of GDP-[14C]fucose into preparations enriched in Golgi vesicles. The import of GDP-[14C]fucose under standard assay conditions was linear with time for up to 10 min, leveled off after 20 min, and was proportional to the amount of vesicles added for up to 110 μg of protein per assay. Determination of import as a function of GDP-fucose revealed that import of GDP-fucose is composed of a saturable and a nonsaturable component (Fig.1 A). The Kmfor the saturable component was 0.7 ± 0.3 μmGDP-fucose. At standard assay conditions (3 μmGDP-fucose) import via the saturable mechanism accounted for about 85% of total GDP-fucose import. GDP-fucose import by the patients' vesicles at standard assay conditions was 20% of controls (Fig.1 B). Following import for up to 60 min revealed that GDP-fucose import into patients' vesicles reached its maximum within 5 min. When import was determined at 0.5–30 μm GDP-fucose, it became apparent that the residual import was accounted largely if not exclusively by the nonsaturable import mechanism (Fig.1 A). As a control we determined the activity of galactosyltransferase, a marker of trans Golgi membranes (Fig. 1 C). The activity of galactosyltransferase was similar in membranes from controls (37 ± 11 pmol [3H]galactose/min × mg protein, n = 9) and the patient (25 ± 9 pmol [3H]galactose/min × mg protein, n = 7). Furthermore we determined the import of a second nucleotide sugar as a control for the integrity of the vesicles. The import rate for UDP-[3H]galactose in control and patients' membranes was comparable (Fig. 1 D). This indicates that the patients' vesicles were import competent for nucleotide sugars and that the failure to import GDP-fucose represents a specific defect. Nucleotide sugar transporters operate as antiporters with the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate (1Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Impaired GDP-fucose import could therefore also result from a decreased transfer of fucose onto glycoproteins or decreased GDPase, which converts the released GDP into the GMP substrate of the transporter. A deficiency of fucosyltransferase activity as a cause for the reduced import is unlikely, due to the corrective effect of exogenous fucose (see above) and the absence of α1,2-, α1,3-, and α1,6-linked fucose residues, which are all transferred by different fucosyltransferases. As shown previously, transport of GDP-mannose into the lumen of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Golgi vesicles requires a guanosine diphosphatase. A null mutation (gda1) showed a five times reduced rate of GDP-mannose import (27Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells posses a Golgi UDPase showing highest activity with UDP and GDP as substrates (28Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The UDP/GDPase is expressed in all human tissues. In order to exclude a defect in the hydrolysis of GDP in our patient, we examined the GDPase activity and found it to be comparable in control and patient's membranes (Fig. 2). We conclude from these data that in the Golgi vesicles of the patient, GDP-fucose is severely reduced due to a defect in the saturable, high affinity import of GDP-fucose and that under cell culture conditions the deficiency of GDP-fucose in the Golgi can largely be overcome by raising the fucose concentration in the medium to 1 mm. The defect in our patient is assumed to be recessively transmitted. We therefore examined the import of GDP-fucose and UDP-galactose into vesicles prepared from the fibroblasts of the parents. GDP-fucose and UDP-galactose were imported at a normal rate by vesicles from the mother, while import into vesicles from the father was reduced by about 40% for both nucleotide sugars (Fig. 1, B and D). It should be noted that the activity of galactosyltransferase was comparable in the parents and about 1.5–2-fold higher than in control and patient's membranes (Fig.1 C). These data would be compatible with the view that the impaired import of GDP-fucose in the patient's vesicles is secondary to a defect in a gene unrelated to the GDP-fucose transporter and that only homozygosity for a defect in this gene of unknown function affects GDP-fucose import. Such a gene could encode for a cofactor of the transporter. Alternatively the affected gene could encode for one of the transporter subunits if the transporter for GDP-fucose is a heterooligomer. It should be noted, however, that the only sugar nucleotide transporter for which the quaternary structure has been examined is likely to exist as a homodimer (29Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4474-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of the GDP-fucose transporter is unknown. Cloning of the gene complementing the GDP-fucose import in our patient may help to identify its molecular nature."

We therefore analyzed dimerization of the bradykinin B2receptor. The binding of the agonist bradykinin to the B2receptor endogenously expressed on PC-12 cells led to the formation of receptor dimers, whereas the B2 antagonist HOE140 did not induce dimerization, suggesting that B2 receptor dimerization was linked to receptor activation. Addition of a peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of the receptor reduced the amount of detected B2 receptor dimers, whereas peptides derived from the extracellular loops had no effect. To further analyze the role of the amino terminus of the receptor in receptor dimerization, we created two different rat B2 receptor variants with truncated amino termini, B253 and B265, starting at amino acids 53 and 65. In contrast to the wild-type B2 receptor and to B253, bradykinin did not induce dimerization of the B265 receptor. Both receptor variants were similar to the wild-type B2 receptor with respect to agonist binding and signal generation. However, B265 was not phosphorylated, did not desensitize, and was not downregulated upon bradykinin stimulation. Likewise, antibodies directed to the amino terminus of the receptor partially reduced internalization of [3H]bradykinin on PC-12 cells. These findings suggest that the amino terminus of the B2 receptor is necessary for triggering agonist-induced B2 receptor dimerization, and receptor dimers are involved in receptor-mediated signal attenuation.

G-protein-coupled receptors are classified into three main families according to the structure and length of their amino terminus and the localization of the agonist binding site (5Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The metabotropic glutamate receptor and the calcium sensing receptor are members of family 3 receptors. In family 3 receptors, the amino terminus is not only involved in dimerization but also essential for agonist binding. In contrast, adrenaline and dopamine, which are agonists on family 1 receptors, bind within the seven transmembrane helices (5Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The transmembrane regions are also involved in dimerization of these receptors (1Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P.

Thus, the mechanism of receptor dimerization seems to be related to agonist binding. To further investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed dimerization of the bradykinin B2 receptor. The B2 receptor belongs also to family 1. However, receptors for catecholamines or dopamine belong to the 1a subfamily, whereas receptors for peptides like bradykinin are classified into the subfamily 1b (5Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). In contrast to family 1a receptors, 1b-type receptors are characterized by an agonist binding site within the amino terminus of the receptor and the extracellular loops (5Bockaert J. Pin J.P.

In accordance with its classification as a family 1b receptor, a binding site(s) for the agonist bradykinin was identified within the extracellular loop regions, e.g. the connecting loops between membrane domains IV and V and domains VI and VII (6Abd Alla S.

Because the agonist binding site of 1b receptors differs from that of 1a family receptors, we asked whether the sites necessary for receptor dimerization were also different between members of these two subfamilies. Here, we report that binding of bradykinin to the B2 receptor endogenously expressed on PC12 cells or transiently expressed in HEK293 cells led to the formation of receptor dimers/oligomers, which were irreversibly captured by covalent cross-linking. The amino terminus of the receptor seemed to be involved in receptor dimerization because a B2receptor variant lacking the entire amino terminus, B265 was impaired in agonist-induced receptor dimerization. [2,3-prolyl-3,4-3H]Bradykinin (specific activity, 98 Ci/mmol), myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity, 17 Ci/mmol), Na125I (specific activity, 17.4 Ci/mg), and the chemiluminescence detection kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; bradykinin, desArg9-Lys0-bradykinin, and HOE140 (d-Arg0-Hyp3-Thi5-d-Tic7-Oic8-bradykinin) were from Bachem; fura-2/AM was from Calbiochem; and m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS),11,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB), and iodogen (1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α-6α-diphenyl-glycoluril) were from Pierce. HEK293 and PC-12 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and kept in a humidified 7.5% CO2/92.5% air atmosphere at 37 °C. Absence of mycoplasma infection was routinely controlled. HEK293 cells were transfected by Ca2+ phosphate precipitation with 20 μg of DNA/106 cells (10Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). For B2 receptor desensitization and down-regulation, the B2 receptor was expressed at low levels (0.05–0.1 pmol/mg of protein) to avoid saturation of the downstream effector components of the cells. The amount of B2-cDNA used for these experiments was 0.1–0.2 μg of DNA/106 cells, and the total amount of transfected DNA was held constant by plasmid pcDNA3. The transfection efficiency was usually 70–90%, as determined by staining of the cells by X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-βd-galactopyranoside) after transfection with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. Binding affinities of B2 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells for [2,3-prolyl-3,4-3H]bradykinin (specific activity, 98 Ci/mmol) were determined on cell membranes. Membranes were prepared as described previously in the presence of protease inhibitors (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out in binding buffer (20 mmK+-Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm enalaprilate, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm bacitracin, 1 μg/ml N-[N-(l-3-transcarboxyoxiran-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl] agmatin at 4 °C for 2 h with increasing concentrations of [3H]bradykinin (0.01–10 nm) as described previously (6Abd Alla S.

At higher concentrations of [3H]bradykinin (>10 nm) a low affinity binding site was detected with B265. The cDNAs coding for the rat B2 receptor variants starting at amino acid 53 (B253) and 65 (B265) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pcDNA3. An initiating ATG was introduced to start translation at the indicated amino acid. The identity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Bradykinin-induced changes in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, were determined in fura-2-loaded HEK293 cells expressing the different B2 receptor variants. Cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) suspended in incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 1 g/liter glucose, 20 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 7.3) were loaded with fura-2/AM as described previously (11Quitterer U. Schröder C. Müller-Esterl W. Rehm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1992-1999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Desensitization of the B2 receptor was initiated by stimulation of fura-2-loaded HEK293 cells with 1 μm bradykinin for 5 min at 25 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with prewarmed incubation buffer and used for [Ca2+]i determination. Changes in [Ca2+]i are given as the ratio between 340 and 380 nm. For determination of total inositol phosphate levels, HEK293 cells expressing the different B2 receptor variants were seeded on six-well plates and labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml; specific activity, 17 Ci/mmol) for 16 h in inositol-free RPMI medium containing 0.2% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Prior to the experiment, cells were washed with incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 1 g/liter glucose, 20 mmNa+-HEPES, pH 7.3), and stored for 5 min in incubation buffer with 10 mm LiCl. Then, the cells were placed at 37 °C, and the experiment was started by addition of buffer or bradykinin as indicated. For B2 receptor down-regulation, cells were incubated with 10 μm bradykinin for 6 h and washed three times with incubation buffer before the experiment was started as described above by the addition of bradykinin (0.1 nm to 1 μm). After 20 min, total inositol phosphates were extracted as described previously (12Quitterer U. AbdAlla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13368-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). B2receptor phosphorylation was performed as described previously (13Blaukat A. Abd Alla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, B2 receptor-enriched membranes from transiently transfected HEK293 cells were prepared at 4 °C by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (14Abd Alla S. Buschko J. Quitterer U. Maidhof A.

Membranes containing 3–5 pmol of B2 receptor/100 μg of protein were washed by 5m urea and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (15Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron G.M. Lefkowitz R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). For B2 receptor phosphorylation, reaction mixtures (50 ul) contained 20 nm B2 receptor, 50 nmGRK2, 200 nm βγ complexes purified from bovine brain (16Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6. Incubations were carried out at 30 °C for 25 min in the presence or absence of 1 μm bradykinin. Reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample loading buffer, and samples were electrophoresed on SDS/10% polyacrylamide gels containing 6 m urea. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Bradykinin-induced formation of receptor dimers on PC12 cells and on HEK293 cells expressing wild-type B2receptor, B253, and B265 was detected similarly. Membranes of PC-12 or transfected HEK293 cells were prepared at 4 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors as described previously (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with 10 nm bradykinin or 10 nm HOE140 for 30 min at 25 °C in incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES, 138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). For cross-linking, buffers were routinely degassed and handled under N2 atmosphere. Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of 0.2 mm MBS and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. A new batch of MBS was used for each experiment to avoid inactivation of the cross-linker. Cross-linking was terminated by addition of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mmdithiothreitol. Membranes were collected by centrifugation and solubilized in SDS sample loading buffer for 15 min at 25 °C instead of boiling to avoid unspecific receptor aggregation. Solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, including 6 m urea. Cross-linked bradykinin-B2 receptor complexes were detected by anti-bradykinin antibodies (7Abd Alla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27382-27387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly, HOE140-B2receptor complexes were detected by anti-HOE140 antibodies (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To control B2 receptor specificity, a 500-fold molar excess of HOE140 was used as a control for bradykinin cross-linking and a 500-fold molar excess of bradykinin as a control for HOE140 cross-linking. Bound antibodies were visualized with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies with enhanced chemiluminescence detection. PC-12 membranes containing 0.5–1 pmol of B2 receptor/mg of protein were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline including protease inhibitors (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and to the amino terminus of the B2receptor (ED1) for 1 h at 4 °C. The position of the peptides in the rat B2 receptor and their synthesis has been described previously (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To induce receptor dimerization, 10 nm[125I]Tyr8bradykinin was added to the membranes for 30 min at 25 °C. Preparation of [125I]Tyr8bradykinin was performed as described previously (14Abd Alla S. Buschko J. Quitterer U. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Breipohl G. Knolle J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17277-17285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cross-linking by 0.2 mmDFDNB was performed for 15 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and unbound ligand was removed by washing with the same buffer. The membranes were solubilized in SDS-sample buffer, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE including 6 m urea. [125I]Tyr8bradykinin-labeled B2receptors were visualized by autoradiography. PC-12 cells on six-well plates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the absence (control) or presence of 100 nm affinity-purified antibodies to the amino terminus of the B2 receptor (α-ED1) or to the connecting loop between membrane domains II and III (α -ED2), IV and V (α-ED3C), and VI and VII (α -ED4N) in incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 1 g/liter glucose, 20 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 7.3). The generation of the antibodies has been performed essentially as described previously (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Then, 5 nm[3H]bradykinin was added and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. To induce internalization, cells were shifted to 37 °C. At the time points indicated, cells were washed three times with 0.2 m glycine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 3.0, followed by three washing steps with incubation buffer. Then, cells were dissolved by 1 m NaOH, and internalized [3H]bradykinin was determined in a β-counter. To determine a potential functional role of receptor dimerization, we attempted to detect B2 receptor dimers in a system with endogenously expressed B2receptors, and we chose PC-12 cells (11Quitterer U. Schröder C. Müller-Esterl W. Rehm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1992-1999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To detect bradykinin-stimulated receptor dimerization, we stimulated cell membranes by bradykinin at 25 °C for 30 min and irreversibly captured receptor dimers by addition of the cross-linker MBS (0.2 mm). Cross-linked bradykinin-B2 receptor complexes were detected by anti-bradykinin antibodies (7Abd Alla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27382-27387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). And indeed, bradykinin binding to the B2 receptor lead to the formation of receptor dimers and higher oligomerization states as shown in Fig.1 A, lane 1. The B2antagonist HOE140 did not significantly stimulate the formation of receptor aggregates when HOE140 was cross-linked to the B2receptor under similar conditions as described above and detected by anti-HOE140 antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). To control B2 receptor specificity, a 500-fold molar excess of HOE140 was used as a control for bradykinin cross-linking (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and a 500-fold molar excess of bradykinin as a control for HOE140 cross-linking (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). The presence of a 500-fold molar excess of HOE140 or bradykinin abolished the specific labeling of the B2 receptor. Thus, B2 receptors had been labeled by bradykinin and by HOE140, but only bradykinin had induced the formation of receptor dimers/oligomers. This finding suggests that B2 receptor dimerization/oligomerization was dependent on the binding of agonist to the B2 receptor. We asked whether the extracellular domains of the B2 receptor might be involved in B2 receptor dimerization, and we analyzed the effect of peptides derived from the extracellular domains of the B2 receptor. The position of the peptides in the rat B2 receptor has been described previously (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Membranes of PC-12 cells were preincubated without (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 5) or with 10 μm of a peptide corresponding to the connecting loop between membrane domains II and III, ED2 (Fig. 1 B, lane 1); to the connecting loop between membrane domains IV and V, ED3C (Fig. 1 B, lane 2); to the connecting loop between membrane domains VI and VII, ED4N (Fig. 1 B, lane 3); and to the amino terminus of the B2receptor, ED1 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2) (cf. Ref. 6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar for sequence of the peptides). B2receptor monomers and dimers were identified by cross-linking of [125I]Tyr8bradykinin to B2receptors on PC-12 cell membranes by 0.2 mm DFDNB. The presence of 10 μm peptide corresponding to the extracellular loops of the B2 receptor did not reduce the ratio between labeled B2 receptor monomers versus dimers compared with the control without peptide (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–3 versus lane 4). Interestingly, no oligomeric states larger than dimers were found when we used the homobifunctional cross-linker DFDNB (Fig. 1 B) compared with the heterobifunctional cross-linker MBS (cf. Fig.1 A). This finding may be due to different length and different specificity of the applied cross-linkers. The specificity of the cross-linking was confirmed by the finding that a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled bradykinin suppressed the labeling of the B2 receptor by [125I]Tyr8bradykinin (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Together, these findings suggest that peptides corresponding to the extracellular loops of the B2 receptor did not affect the capturing of receptor dimers by DFDNB. In contrast, a peptide derived from the amino terminus of the B2 receptor (ED1) significantly reduced the ratio between labeled B2 receptor monomers versus dimers (Fig.1 C, lane 2) compared with the control without peptide (Fig.1 B, lane 4, and Fig. 1 C, lane 1) or compared with the controls with peptides directed to the extracellular loops (Fig.1 B, lanes 1–3). The presence of a 500-fold molar excess of the B2 antagonist HOE140 abolished the labeling by [125I]Tyr8bradykinin, demonstrating B2 receptor specificity of the signal(s) (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). Together, these findings may suggest that the amino terminus of the B2 receptor was involved in triggering B2 receptor dimerization induced by bradykinin. To further analyze the role of the amino terminus of the B2 receptor in receptor dimerization, we created two rat B2 receptor variants with truncated amino termini, B253, starting with amino acid 53 after the conserved cysteine 52 (17AbdAlla S. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Braun A. Roscher A.A. Müller-Esterl W. Quitterer U. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7514-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and B265, lacking the entire amino terminus. The indicated positions of the amino acids are derived from the rat B2 receptor sequence with extended amino terminus (17AbdAlla S. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Braun A. Roscher A.A. Müller-Esterl W. Quitterer U. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7514-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The wild-type B2 receptor and the two B2 receptor variants were expressed in HEK293 cells. Expression of the B2 receptor protein was detected in Western blot by anti-HOE140 antibodies after cross-linking of HOE140 to the B2 receptor. The antibodies detected a major protein of 55 ± 5 kDa in wild-type receptor-expressing cells (Fig.2, A, lane 1, and B, lane 1), and proteins of 45 ± 6 and 43 ± 4 kDa were detected in cells expressing B253 (Fig.2 B, lane 2) and B265 (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), respectively. No significant amounts of receptor dimers were detected (Fig. 2, A, lane 1, and B, lanes 1–3). The labeling of the B2 receptors by HOE140 was suppressed when the cross-linking was performed in the presence of a 500-fold molar excess of bradykinin, as demonstrated for the wild-type B2 receptor (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). These findings demonstrate that binding of HOE140 to the different B2receptors expressed in HEK293 cells did not induce the formation of receptor dimers, although HOE140 was efficiently cross-linked to these receptors, revealing similar expression levels. Next we asked whether bradykinin stimulated receptor dimerization of the wild-type B2receptor and the truncated B2 receptor variants expressed on HEK293 cells. Similarly as on PC-12 cells, B2 receptor dimers were irreversibly captured by MBS and detected by anti-bradykinin antibodies in Western blot. Bradykinin induced the formation of receptor dimers and higher oligomerization states on membranes of HEK293 cells expressing wild-type B2 receptors (Fig. 2 C, lane 1) and on membranes of cells expressing B253 (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). Although no oligomeric states larger than dimers were found with B253, the ratio between B2 receptor monomers versus dimers was similar for the wild-type B2 receptor and for B253. In contrast, there were no significant amounts of receptor dimers detectable following stimulation of the B265variant by bradykinin (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). Bradykinin was efficiently cross-linked to the monomeric form of B265 (Fig. 2 C, lane 3), confirming that the truncation of further 12 amino acids in B265 compared with B253did not reduce cross-linking efficiency (Fig. 2 C, lane 3 versus lane 2). A 500-fold molar excess of HOE140 suppressed the specific labeling of the wild-type B2 receptor, of B253 and of B265 by bradykinin, confirming B2 receptor specificity (not shown). Together, these findings suggest that 12 amino acids upstream of membrane domain I were sufficient to support agonist-induced dimerization/oligomerization of the B2 receptor. Next, we analyzed the interrelationship between B2 receptor dimerization and receptor function, and we determined the KD values for the binding of [3H]bradykinin. The binding affinity of bradykinin for the wild-type B2 receptor, for B253, and for B265 was similar. The KD values of the wild-type B2, of B253, and of B265 were 0.5 ± 0.4 × 10−9, 0.3 ± 0.4 × 10−9, and 0.5 ± 0.4 × 10−9m, respectively. This finding suggests that the entire amino terminus of the B2 receptor was not essential for binding of the agonist bradykinin. Next, we determined the bradykinin-induced rise in inositol phosphate levels of HEK293 cells expressing the different B2 receptor variants. The concentration of bradykinin necessary to produce the half-maximum increase in inositol phosphate levels (EC50 value) was 34 ± 7 × 10−9, 22 ± 8 × 10−9, and 38 ± 6 × 10−9m for the wild-type B2 receptor, for B253, and for B265, respectively (cf. Fig.3 C). Thus, the amino terminus of the B2 receptor is not essential for B2receptor activation. B2 receptor phosphorylation is the initial step in B2 receptor desensitization (12Quitterer U. AbdAlla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13368-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Blaukat A. Abd Alla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation of the B2 receptor variants by GRK2 was analyzed. GRK2 phosphorylated the B253variant upon agonist stimulation (Fig. 3 A, lane 5) similarly to the wild-type B2 receptor (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). No significant increase in B2 receptor phosphorylation was detected after stimulation by a B1-specific agonist, desArg10kallidin (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 6) compared with the unstimulated control (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 4). In contrast, GRK2 did not significantly phosphorylate the B265 variant upon bradykinin stimulation (Fig. 3 A, lane 8) compared with the unstimulated control (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). This experiment strongly suggests that agonist-induced phosphorylation of the B265 receptor by GRK2 was impaired. Receptor phosphorylation is assumed to precede receptor desensitization (18Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Roscher A.A. Manganiello V.C. Jelsema C.L. Moss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next asked whether desensitization of the B265 variant was also impaired. The desensitization of the bradykinin signal was analyzed for the bradykinin-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i on fura-2-loaded HEK293 cells expressing the different B2 receptor variants. The bradykinin-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was similar in wild-type B2 receptor-expressing cells, in cells expressing B253, and in cells expressing B265 (Fig. 3 B, panels 1–3). To initiate receptor desensitization, the cells were preincubated for 5 min with 1 μm bradykinin. After removal of bradykinin, the cells were given a second pulse of bradykinin. A second stimulation by bradykinin did not significantly increase [Ca2+]i in wild-type B2receptor-expressing cells (Fig. 3 B, panel 4) or in cells expressing the B253 receptor (Fig. 3 B, panel 5), indicating that the receptors were efficiently desensitized after prestimulation by 1 μm bradykinin. In contrast, the B265 receptor was not desensitized after the initial bradykinin stimulation, as revealed by a rise in [Ca2+]i following a second pulse of bradykinin (Fig. 3 B, panel 6). The B265 receptor poorly dimerized, was not significantly phosphorylated, and did not desensitize upon bradykinin stimulation. Therefore, we asked whether the B265 receptor could be down regulated. To this end, the B2 receptor-expressing cells were prestimulated by 10 μm bradykinin for 6 h. After washing, the bradykinin-stimulated increase in inositol phosphate levels was determined compared with the unstimulated control. After long-term bradykinin stimulation, the B2 receptor-mediated signal was down-regulated on wild-type B2receptor-expressing cells and on B253expressing cells. The signal was reduced by 28 ± 3 and 25 ± 5%, respectively (Fig. 3 C, panels 1 and 2). In contrast, the B2 receptor-mediated signal was not down regulated on B265-expressing cells (Fig.3 C, panel 3). Thus, a B2 receptor variant lacking the entire amino terminus had lost its capability to undergo agonist-induced dimerization, phosphorylation, desensitization, and down-regulation. Finally, we asked whether the amino terminus of the B2 receptor was also involved in the signal attenuation process of a B2 receptor expressed in a native system. To this end, we initially tested the effect of the peptide ED1 derived from the amino terminus of the B2 receptor, which has been shown to reduce the ratio between detected B2 receptor monomers versus dimers (cf. Fig. 1 C). However, this peptide (10 μm) had no significant effect on B2 receptor phosphorylation and internalization under the conditions applied (not shown). Therefore, we next analyzed the effect of site-directed antibodies to the extracellular domains of the B2 receptor. The generation, immunoselection, and characterization of these antibodies was performed as described previously (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The site-directed antibodies used for this study did not affect the binding of [3H]bradykinin or the activation of the B2receptor (6Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Grigoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The antibodies to the amino terminus of the B2 receptor (α-ED1) caused a significant reduction of internalized [3H]bradykinin (Fig.4, A and B) by 24 ± 4%, whereas site-directed antibodies to the extracellular loops (α-ED2, α-ED3C, and α-ED4N) had no effect on internalization of [3H]bradykinin (Fig.4 A). Results obtained with the site-directed antibodies in phosphorylation studies were not consistent, probably due to the moderate effect of the antibodies (not shown). Nevertheless, our data indicate that the amino terminus of the B2 receptor is also involved in B2 receptor-mediated signal attenuation processes on PC-12 cells. Although the detailed mechanism of receptor dimerization is far from being understood, different regions of G-protein-coupled receptors have been identified to be involved in receptor dimerization. Dimerization of the dopamine D2 and the β2-adrenergic receptor occur via transmembrane regions (1Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 2Ng G.Y.K. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In contrast, the metabotropic glutamate receptor and the calcium sensing receptor dimerize via their large extracellular amino terminus and to a lesser extent via their transmembrane regions (3Romano C. Yang W.-L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 4Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although the B2 receptor, as a family 1b receptor, lacks a large extracellular domain that is characteristic of family 3 receptors, agonist-induced B2 receptor dimerization also needs the amino terminus of the receptor because (i) a peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of the B2 receptor partially suppressed bradykinin-induced receptor dimerization on PC-12 cells, and (ii) a B2 receptor variant lacking the entire amino terminus, B265, was impaired in agonist-induced receptor dimerization. The amino terminus, which was necessary for agonist-stimulated B2 receptor dimerization, was not essential for agonist binding. Such a finding is in contrast to previous studies with the β2-adrenergic, the dopamine, the calcium sensing, or the metabotropic glutamate receptor where the region(s) involved in receptor dimerization were overlapping with the agonist binding sites (1Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 2Ng G.Y.K. O'Dowd B.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This potential mechanistic difference of B2 receptor dimerization may be related to the predicted topology of the B2 receptor, which is different from rhodopsin with five transmembrane domains instead of seven and two membrane reentrant segments, membrane domains I and II (20Quitterer U. Zaki E. Abd Alla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14773-14778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, membrane domain I, which follows the amino terminus, is not membrane-spanning. In addition to the mechanism, the functional importance of receptor dimerization is not clear. Receptor dimerization of the β2-adrenergic receptor seems to be related to receptor activation because the amount or receptor dimers increased upon agonist stimulation, and a peptide derived from transmembrane domain VI partially suppressed receptor dimerization and receptor activation (1Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Several other lines of evidence suggest, however, that receptor dimerization does not seem to be essential for receptor activation. The stoichiometry of the interaction between the receptor, G-protein, and effector molecule is assumed to be 1:1:1 (21Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar), and a single receptor with a single Gαs protein fused to its carboxyl terminus is functionally active (22Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, the potential role of receptor dimerization may lie apart from receptor activation. And indeed, a B2 receptor variant (B265) with impaired agonist-induced receptor dimerization was “normal” with respect to signal generation. In contrast, this B2 receptor variant was defective in agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and down-regulation. Likewise, affinity-purified antibodies to the region that is necessary for receptor dimerization, the amino terminus of the B2 receptor, partially reduced internalization of [3H]bradykinin on PC-12 cells. Thus, agonist-induced dimerization of the B2 receptor seems to follow receptor-induced G-protein activation and to precede receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and down-regulation. Twelve amino acids upstream of membrane domain I may be sufficient to support agonist-induced B2 receptor dimerization because B253 was still capable of dimerizing after bradykinin stimulation, whereas B265, lacking the entire amino terminus, did not significantly dimerize after bradykinin stimulation. Bradykinin-induced B2 receptor dimerization did not depend on receptor overexpression because bradykinin-induced B2 receptor dimerization was also detected on PC-12 cells with endogenously expressed B2receptors. Thus, agonist-induced B2 receptor dimerization via the amino terminus of the receptor is a characteristic of B2 receptor signaling. In addition to agonist-induced dimerization, G-protein-coupled receptors tend to dimerize under native conditions via hydrophobic interactions (7Abd Alla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27382-27387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Receptor clustering via hydrophobic interactions within the (trans)membrane domains may be supported by high receptor density. Future work will have to determine whether, in addition to agonist-induced receptor dimerization, which has been shown to regulate signal attenuation processes, receptor clustering under basal conditions represents an additional mechanism of regulating B2 receptor activity. We thank Drs. H. Moawad (Alexandria, Egypt) and A. El Massiery (Cairo, Egypt) for help in generating site-directed antibodies and M. J. Lohse (Würzburg, Germany), for support in the field of G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2077717093,"The electrogenic activity of the NADPH oxidase is associated with depolarization of the plasma membrane in activated neutrophils. The magnitude and consequences of this depolarization, however, remain unknown. Neutrophils are not amenable to electrophysiological determinations of membrane potential by current clamp. Instead, the occurrence of depolarization has been inferred from the use of potential-sensitive fluorescent dyes. However, such dyes partition into intracellular organelles and may yield erroneous results, particularly because the NADPH oxidase resides largely in secretory granules, where it has been claimed to become activated. We confirmed the intracellular generation of oxidase products using dihydrorhodamine, which is converted to the fluorescent rhodamine 123 when oxidized. Rhodamine 123 accumulated inside endomembrane organelles in both neutrophils and in differentiated HL60 cells, where it co-localized with the primary granule marker CD63. To estimate the surface membrane potential without interference from organelles, we devised a method based on the voltage-driven uptake of Mn2+ across the plasmalemma. The uptake of Mn2+ through calcium release-activated channels was measured as the rate of Indo-1 fluorescence quenching in thapsigargin-treated cells. The rate of Mn2+ influx was found to vary when the membrane potential was manipulated using conductive ionophores and also when the NADPH oxidase was activated. A calibration curve in the positive potential range was constructed using the Na+ ionophore SQI-Pr. Using this calibration, the membrane potential of phorbol ester-activated neutrophils was found to reach +58 ± 6 mV, a sustained depolarization of over 100 mV compared with the resting potential. The depolarization was greatly diminished when the NADPH oxidase was inhibited with diphenylene iodonium. Together, these results indicate that the NADPH oxidase can generate a large depolarization of the plasmalemma, which should suffice to activate a variety of voltage-gated channels, including the outwardly rectifying H+ conductance.

They circulate in the bloodstream in a quiescent state but are rapidly recruited to sites of infection upon activation by chemoattractants produced by the microbes and/or by the surrounding tissues. Following diapedesis across the endothelium and chemotaxis to the site of infection, neutrophils employ phagocytosis to internalize the invading microorganisms. These are subsequently eliminated by a combination of microbicidal mechanisms that include phagosomal acidification, secretion of lytic enzymes and cationic peptides, and generation of reactive oxygen species (1Cohen M.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 18 (Suppl. 2): S170-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Elsbach P. Weiss J. Immunol. Lett. 1985; 11: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The primary source of reactive oxygen metabolites is the NADPH oxidase, an enzymatic complex consisting of both membrane-bound and cytosolic subunits. The former include flavocytochrome b558, which is a heterodimer of gp91phoxand p22phox. The cytosolic subunits include p47phox, p67phox, and the recently discovered p40phox, as well as the GTPase Rac (see Refs. 3Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1987; 16: 229-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 4DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar for reviews). Assembly of the active oxidase, which involves translocation of the cytosolic subunits to the membrane, facilitates transfer of one electron from intracellular NADPH to molecular oxygen. The resulting massive consumption of oxygen and concomitant production of superoxide is called the respiratory burst. Other products of the reduction of oxygen by the oxidase are NADP+ and protons, which are seemingly released intracellularly. Intracellular release of H+ (equivalents) is suggested by the large cytosolic acidification that accompanies the respiratory burst when Na+/H+ exchange is precluded (5Grinstein S. Elder B. Furuya W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: C379-C386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because superoxide anions are delivered to the extracellular (or intraphagosomal) space while NADP+ and H+ are released into the cytosol, separation of charges must occur across the plasmalemma. Accordingly, a depolarization of the membrane potential was reported to accompany the activation of neutrophils, which was absent in patients with chronic granulomatous disease that lack a functional oxidase (6Seligmann B.E. Gallin J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Whitin J.C. Clark R.A. Simons E.R. Cohen H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8904-8906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in activated eosinophils, which also express the NADPH oxidase, a transmembrane electron current was recorded electrophysiologically by Schrenzel et al. (8Schrenzel J. Serrander L. Banfi B. Nusse O. Fouyouzi R. Lew D.P. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although these observations confirm the predicted occurrence of an oxidase-associated membrane potential change, neither the magnitude of the depolarization nor its functional consequences have been established. The precise magnitude of the membrane potential change (Em) has been difficult to determine electrophysiologically because: (i) the input resistance of the neutrophil membrane is inordinately high, precluding accurate current clamp determination of Em and (ii) neutrophils are activated by contact with the glass micropipette used for patch clamping, complicating the determination of the resting potential. As an alternative, indirect methods have been applied to estimate Em in activated neutrophils. These have included isotopic (9Korchak H.M. Weissmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 601: 180-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Martin M.A. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3928-3935PubMed Google Scholar) and fluorescence determinations of the partition of lipid-soluble ions (6Seligmann B.E. Gallin J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Bashford C.L. Pasternak C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Jones G.S. Van Dyke K. Castranova V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 104: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although qualitatively informative, these approaches have proved unsuitable for precise quantitative determinations for several reasons. Some of the probes used undergo chemical conversion when exposed to the products of the NADPH oxidase (7Whitin J.C. Clark R.A. Simons E.R. Cohen H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8904-8906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, the lipophilic ions can traverse not only the plasma membrane but also the membranes of intracellular organelles, where they partition in accordance with the prevailing organellar potential. Because a large fraction of the cellular volume of neutrophils is occupied by endomembrane granules and because their content changes during the course of activation, the determinations of Em using partition dyes are inherently inaccurate. An added complication of the methods employing lipophilic ions is introduced by the possibility that the organellar potential may itself change during the course of neutrophil stimulation. In this regard, the group of Dahlgren has provided evidence that activation of the oxidase occurs not only on the plasma membrane but also in intracellular granules (13Johansson A. Jesaitis A.J. Lundqvist H. Magnusson K.E. Sjolin C. Karlsson A. Dahlgren C. Cell Immunol. 1995; 161: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Lundqvist H. Follin P. Khalfan L. Dahlgren C. J.

If separation of charges is also part of the reaction in the granules, a sizable potential change is predicted to occur across the membrane of these organelles. The objective of the experiments reported here was 2-fold. We initially wanted to establish whether superoxide was in fact produced intracellularly and whether such production is associated with changes in organellar potential. Secondly, we attempted to devise a method for measurement of the plasma membrane potential of activated neutrophils that would not be contaminated by the contribution of intracellular organelles. Gramicidin D and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem. Sodium azide was from Fisher. DHR, DiSC5 (3Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1987; 16: 229-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), rhodamine 123, valinomycin, Indo-1, and its acetoxymethyl ester form were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antimycin A, ATP (K+ salt), dimethyl sulfoxide, NADPH, GTP (Li+salt), PBS,1 and TPA were from Sigma-Aldrich. The sodium ionophore SQI-Pr was from Teflabs Inc. (Austin, Texas). DPI was synthesized in our laboratory as described (16Colette J. McGreer D. Crawford R. Chubb F. Sandin R.D. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 3819-3820Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against CD63 and CD66b were obtained from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) and Serotec Ltd. (Oxford, UK), respectively. Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Medium RPMI 1640 (bicarbonate-free) was purchased from Sigma. Na+-rich medium consisted of 140 mmNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). K+-rich medium contained 143 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). To calibrate Emto the indicated values using valinomycin, Na+-rich and K+-rich media were mixed in the appropriate proportions. NMG medium contained 143 mm NMG-Cl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). In all cases the osmolarity was adjusted to 290 ± 5 mOsm. Neutrophils were isolated from heparinized whole blood obtained by venipuncture, using dextran sedimentation, followed by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation as described (17Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1968; 97: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, cells were suspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in bicarbonate-free, HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 and rotated at room temperature until used (less than 4 h). HL60 cells obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection were cultured and differentiated using dimethyl sulfoxide as described previously (18Trudel S. Paquet M.R. Grinstein S. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were permeabilized by electroporation, essentially as described (19Grinstein S. Furuya W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1779-1783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold K+-rich medium at 107 cells/ml and placed in a Bio-Rad electropermeabilization cuvette. Three pulses of 5 kV/cm were applied, mixing the cells gently between pulses. After electroporation, the cells were sedimented and resuspended in K+-rich medium supplemented with 300 μmNADPH, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm GTP. Where specified, NADPH was omitted. Electropermeabilization efficiency, assessed by exclusion of trypan blue, was found to be ≈95%. Cells suspended in Na+-rich medium at a concentration of 107/ml were incubated with 200 nm DHR with or without 100 nm TPA for 15 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, 4 μg/ml antimycin A, 4 μm valinomycin, or 10 μm DPI were also present. At the end of this incubation, the cells were rapidly sedimented, resuspended in PBS and layered on a 25-mm coverslip mounted in a Leiden chamber for direct analysis by epifluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, fluorescence was analyzed by cytometry using a Becton-Dickinson HP FACScan flow cytometer. In this case 250-μl samples containing 107 cells/ml were incubated with DHR plus or minus TPA as above. The samples were then diluted with 500 μl of PBS and used immediately for cytometry. When using permeabilized cells, K+-rich solution was used as the diluent. Cells were incubated with DHR and TPA as detailed above, sedimented, and layered onto a coverslip to allow spreading, facilitating visualization of granules. Epifluorescence and differential interference contrast images were acquired on a Leica DM-IRB microscope with a MicroMax 2 cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments), using WinView software and a PC-compatible computer. The region of interest was marked on the coverslips using a diamond pencil, and the cells were then fixed for 30 min using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Next, samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 5% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. The same medium was used to dilute the primary antibodies (monoclonal antibodies against CD63 and CD66b, used at a 1:100 dilution) and the secondary antibody (Cy3-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG, used at 1:1500 dilution). Incubation with the antibodies was for 1.5 h at room temperature, followed by washing and finally mounting using Dako mounting medium. The cells that had been photographed live after reaction with DHR were located using the marks on the coverslips and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy, using the same setup as above. Aliquots of the neutrophil stock suspension (107 cells/ml) were loaded with Indo-1 by incubation with 2 μm of the precursor acetoxymethyl ester for 15 min at 37 °C. Unreacted ester was removed by washing the cells twice in 0.5 ml of NaCl medium with 25 μm EGTA, and the cells were ultimately resuspended in 1.3 ml of the appropriate medium for fluorimetry. Indo-1 fluorescence was measured in a cuvette using a thermostatted Hitachi F-4000 spectrofluorimeter with magnetic stirring. Following addition of thapsigargin (77 nm), depletion of endomembrane Ca2+ stores was monitored with excitation at 331 nm, while recording emission at 410 nm, using 5-nm slits. When depletion was found to be complete (i.e. when [Ca2+]i returned to base-line levels), the excitation and emission wavelengths were switched to 335 and 450 nm, respectively, corresponding to the isosbestic point of Indo-1 toward Ca2+. Measurements of Mn2+ influx were then initiated by adding to the cuvette either 38 or 380 μmMnCl2 (final) from an aqueous stock. Where specified, TPA or DPI were also added. For calibration of flux versus Em, the cells were suspended in the appropriate medium, and valinomycin or SQI-Pr were added 2 min prior to the introduction of Mn2+. To measure the activity of SQI-Pr, 2 × 106 cells were suspended in 1.7 ml of Na+-rich medium and allowed to equilibrate with 25 nm DiSC3 (5Grinstein S. Elder B. Furuya W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: C379-C386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a fluorimeter cuvette. Fluorescence was measured as above with excitation at 651 nm and emission at 675 nm. Next, 765 nm SQI-Pr was added, followed lastly by 5.9 μm gramicidin D. Cellular content of Na+ and K+was determined by flame photometry, using Li+ as an internal standard. Cells were washed three times in ice-cold medium containing 140 mm MgCl2 and 10 mmHEPES, titrated to pH 7.3 with Tris-Cl. An aliquot was taken for the determination of cell number and volume using a Coulter counter-Channelyzer (Coulter Inc., Hialeah, FL), and the remaining cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 15 mm Li+standard solution. Samples were analyzed in a model 443 flame photometer (Instrumentation Laboratories, Lexington, MA) and compared with Na+ and K+ standards. We used dihydrorhodamine (DHR) to assess whether reactive oxygen intermediates are generated intracellularly by activated neutrophils. The cell-permeant nonfluorescent substrate DHR is converted into rhodamine 123 (Rh123), a brightly fluorescent lipophilic cation when oxidized. The latter can be directly visualized by fluorescence microscopy, affording a convenient means of assessing intracellular accumulation of the reaction product. Cells were incubated in suspension with DHR in the presence and absence of the soluble agonist TPA, sedimented to remove unreacted DHR, and plated onto glass coverslips to allow cell spreading, which facilitates visualization of intracellular organelles. As shown in Fig.1 (A and B), no conversion of DHR to Rh123 was detectable for up to 15 min at 37 °C in unstimulated cells. Notice that activation of the oxidase by spreading (20Demaurex N. Downey G.P. Waddell T.K. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was not detected under these conditions, because of prior removal of DHR. By contrast, cells incubated in suspension with TPA and DHR showed distinct accumulation of Rh123 in punctate intracellular structures (Fig. 1, C and D), despite removal of the excess DHR before adherence to the coverslips. These observations imply that stimulation by TPA induces the oxidation of DHR, with intracellular accumulation of Rh123. Intracellular accumulation of Rh123 does not necessarily imply that the fluorescent product was generated within the cell. Because it is a lipophilic cation, Rh123 synthesized extracellularly may have diffused back into the neutrophils, traversing the plasma and organellar membranes. To exclude this possibility, samples were incubated with DHR and TPA in the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase at concentrations that rapidly eliminate the products of the NADPH oxidase (21Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), thereby precluding the extracellular oxidation of DHR. Under these conditions, the intracellular accumulation of Rh123 was unaffected (not illustrated), implying that oxidation of DHR occurred within the cells. In other cell types, small amounts of superoxide can be generated by the respiratory chain of mitochondria (22Zipper H. Person P. O'Connell D.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4686-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and also by the endoplasmic reticulum (23Andrew P.W. Lowrie D.B. Jackett P.S. Peters T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 611: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although these systems would not be expected to activate upon addition of TPA, it was nevertheless imperative to demonstrate that the intracellular formation of Rh123 was mediated by the NADPH oxidase. This was confirmed by studying the NADPH dependence and DPI sensitivity of the accumulation of Rh123. NADPH is the physiological substrate of the oxidase (3Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1987; 16: 229-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas DPI has been shown to be a potent inhibitor (24Ellis J.A. Mayer S.J. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The cytosolic content of NADPH was manipulated by electroporation of the plasmalemma, as described earlier (19Grinstein S. Furuya W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1779-1783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 (A and B) illustrates that formation and intracellular accumulation of Rh123 persisted in electroporated neutrophils but only when NADPH was present in the solution. Accumulation of fluorescence was not only visualized microscopically but was also quantified by flow cytometry. As summarized in Fig. 2 (C and D), fluorescence in the absence of NADPH was insignificant (≤3.5% of control). Moreover, DPI virtually eliminated the fluorescence observed in the presence of NADPH. Together, these findings confirm that intracellular accumulation of Rh123 results from activation of the NADPH oxidase by TPA. Having established the source of oxidants that convert DHR, we attempted to identify the intracellular site of accumulation of Rh123. Because Rh123 is a lipophilic cation, it tends to accumulate in organelles with negative (inside) membrane potential, such as mitochondria. In fact, Rh123 has been extensively used as a mitochondrial marker in a variety of cells (25Darzynkiewicz Z. Staiano-Coico L. Melamed M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2383-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) and accumulates readily in the mitochondria of unstimulated neutrophils (Fig.3 B). It was therefore conceivable that, although generated elsewhere, Rh123 might accumulate within mitochondria in activated neutrophils. The following findings argue against this possibility. First, the elongated shape of mitochondria (visualized adding Rh123 to unstimulated cells) is different from the more punctate distribution of Rh123 generated from DHR when the oxidase is activated (cf. Fig. 3, A and B). Secondly, treatment with DPI eliminated the conversion of DHR to Rh123 but only partially inhibited the accumulation of exogenous Rh123 in mitochondria (Fig. 3, C and D). 2DPI can partially dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential by interaction with flavoprotein components of the respiratory chain.Conversely, antimycin A, which blocks cytochrome c1 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, obliterated staining of mitochondria by added Rh123 but had little effect on the formation of Rh123 from DHR and on its accumulation in the punctate organelles within neutrophils (Fig. 3, E and F). Similarly, the conductive ionophore valinomycin abrogated the staining of mitochondria by shunting the potential across their inner membrane, whereas oxidation of DHR and accumulation of the resultant Rh123 were unaffected (Fig. 3, G and H). These findings imply that mitochondria are not the site of accumulation of Rh123 derived from DHR. Moreover, they suggest that organellar membrane potential does not play an important role in Rh123 accumulation in TPA-stimulated neutrophils, inasmuch as valinomycin had no effect. The punctate nature of the stained compartment suggested accumulation in secretory granules, which are abundant in neutrophils. Two types of granules are likely candidates to accumulate Rh123. Secondary granules are the most likely site of generation, because subcellular fractionation studies revealed that they are rich in flavocytochrome b558, the integral membrane component of the NADPH oxidase (27Borregaard N. Tauber A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 47-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Borregaard N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Primary granules could conceivably also accumulate Rh123 because they contain myeloperoxidase, which has been claimed to be required for conversion of DHR to its fluorescent product (21Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We attempted to identify the site of Rh123 accumulation using specific immunological markers: CD63, a marker of primary (azurophilic) granules, and CD66b, which is present exclusively in secondary (specific) granules (see Ref. 29Borregaard N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 832: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar for review). Cells were incubated with TPA and DHR, then fixed, and photographed to locate the sites of Rh123 accumulation. Because Rh123 is poorly retained in the cells following permeabilization, despite fixation, the location of this dye had to be established prior to immunostaining. To localize the same cells after staining for CD63 or CD66b, the coverslips were scored with a diamond pen to identify the area used for analysis of Rh123. The same area was then scanned after immunostaining to localize the cells that were photographed earlier. As shown in Fig. 4(A and B), there was good correspondence between CD63 and the Rh123 fluorescence, suggesting that the product of DHR oxidation accumulates in primary granules. In contrast, the distribution of CD66b differed from that of Rh123, suggesting little accumulation in secondary granules. To confirm the presence of Rh123 in primary but not secondary granules we used differentiated HL60 cells. Unlike mature neutrophils, differentiated HL60 cells contain a substantial number of primary but not secondary granules (30Harris P. Ralph P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 37: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We initially confirmed using the cytochrome c assay that HL60 cells differentiated by addition of dimethyl sulfoxide effectively generate superoxide in response to TPA (not shown). We next established that under the conditions used for our study, differentiated HL60 cells had numerous CD63-positive granules but no detectable CD66b (Fig.5). More importantly, we found that these cells converted DHR into Rh123, which accumulated in a punctate pattern, despite the absence of secondary granules. These findings are consistent with the notion that Rh123 accumulates in primary granules. In view of the fact that oxygen radicals appear to be generated intracellularly, it is conceivable that endomembrane potential may change during neutrophil activation. Moreover, because granule secretion accompanies stimulation of the oxidase, changes in the volume trapped by endomembranes also occur, affecting the overall distribution of lipophilic ions. Therefore, the partition methods used heretofore for the estimation of Em in activated neutrophils are inaccurate. We therefore sought a novel approach to the measurement of Em that would selectively probe the plasma membrane potential while excluding organellar potential. We devised a method that has the following central features: (i) determination of Em is based on measurements of the rate of influx of an ion across the plasmalemma as opposed to its intracellular/extracellular partition, (ii) the ion of choice is hydrophilic to preclude rapid penetration into endomembrane compartments, and (iii) a divalent cation, namely Mn2+, was chosen to magnify the effect of Em on the rate of influx. The procedure involves estimation of the rate of Mn2+influx into suspended neutrophils. Mn2+ is advantageous because it is not extruded from the cells by divalent cation pumps that eject Ca2+. The rate of entry of Mn2+ was monitored using Indo-1, which is effectively quenched by the divalent cation (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Use of the cytosolic dye Indo-1 implied that the cation would be detected and chelated immediately upon entry to the cells, ensuring minimal contribution by endomembrane compartments. It is also noteworthy that, because of the high sensitivity of Indo-1, minute amounts of Mn2+ entering the cell can be detected. This feature is essential to ensure that the flux of the probe would not by itself significantly alter the membrane potential. The rate of entry of Mn2+ is normally limited by the low endogenous permeability of the plasma membrane to divalent cations, which may vary during stimulation. To circumvent this limitation, we enhanced the cation permeability by activation of an endogenous plasmalemmal conductive pathway, specifically the store-operated channels (SOC), which are permeable to both Ca2+ and Mn2+ and are comparatively voltage-insensitive (32Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Systematic activation of the SOC was accomplished by prior depletion of the intracellular calcium stores with thapsigarg"
https://openalex.org/W2151990551,"Abstract Trypanosoma brucei contains a soluble serine oligopeptidase (OP-Tb) that is released into the host bloodstream during infection, where it has been postulated to participate in the pathogenesis of African trypanosomiasis. Here, we report the identification of a single copy gene encoding theT. brucei oligopeptidase and a homologue from the related trypanosomatid pathogen Leishmania major. The enzymes encoded by these genes belong to an emerging subgroup of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine hydrolases, referred to as oligopeptidase B. The trypanosomatid oligopeptidases share 70% amino acid sequence identity with oligopeptidase B from the intracellular pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi, which has a demonstrated role in mammalian host cell signaling and invasion. OP-Tb exhibited no activity toward the prolyl oligopeptidase substrateH-Gly-Pro-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. Instead, it had activity toward substrates of trypsin-like enzymes, particularly those that have basic amino acids in both P1 and P2(e.g. benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarink cat/K m = 529 s−1 μm −1). The activity of OP-Tb was enhanced by reducing agents and by polyamines, suggesting that these agents may act as in vivo regulators of OP-Tb activity. This study provides the basis of the characterization of a novel subgroup of serine oligopeptidases from kinetoplastid protozoa with potential roles in pathogenesis."

Using the selective sPLA2 inhibitor 3-(3-acetamide-1-benzyl-2-ethylindolyl-5-oxy)propane sulfonic acid (LY311727) and an antisense oligonucleotide specific for Group V sPLA2, we found that induction of COX-2 expression is strikingly dependent on Group V sPLA2, which was further confirmed by experiments in which exogenous Group V sPLA2was added to the cells. Exogenous Group V sPLA2 was able to induce significant arachidonate mobilization on its own and to induce expression of the COX-2. None of these effects was observed if inactive Group V sPLA2 was utilized, implying that enzyme activity is crucial for these effects to take place. Therefore, not only delayed prostaglandin production but also COX-2 gene induction are dependent on a catalytically active Group V sPLA2. COX-2 expression was also found to be blunted by the Group IV cPLA2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, which we have previously found to block Group V sPLA2 induction as well.

In turn, free AA can be converted into the prostaglandin (PG) precursor PGH2 by the action of cyclooxygenases (COX). These two reactions constitute the regulatory checkpoints of the pathway leading to PG biosynthesis in mammalian cells. A considerable body of evidence suggests that specific coupling between certain PLA2 and COX forms accounts for the differential regulation of the immediate and delayed responses (1Murakami M.

We have shown that the immediate platelet-activating factor-receptor-mediated phase of PGE2 production in LPS-primed P388D1macrophages involves Group V sPLA2 coupling to COX-2 (3Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). More recently, we have discovered that the exact same coupling of Group V sPLA2 to COX-2 also regulates the delayed PGE2 response of P388D1 macrophages to LPS alone (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Under the latter conditions, expression of both Group V sPLA2 and COX-2 was markedly induced and correlated with ongoing AA release and PG biosynthesis, respectively (4Shinohara H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting that the AA produced by Group V sPLA2 was used by COX-2 to produce PGE2. Importantly, sPLA2 expression could be abolished by pretreating the cells with the cPLA2inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, implying that a functionally active cPLA2 is required for the delayed PGE2 response to occur (4Shinohara H.

In the current study we extend our previous observations on the delayed phase of PGE2 in P388D1 macrophages to further investigate the regulatory relationships between the three effectors of the response (i.e. cPLA2, sPLA2, and COX-2). We now demonstrate tight coupling between sPLA2 and COX-2 for the delayed phase of PGE2 generation by showing that COX-2 induction by LPS is dependent upon a catalytically active Group V sPLA2.

P388D1 cells were plated at 106/well, allowed to adhere overnight, and used for experiments the following day. All experiments were conducted in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. Radiolabeling of the P388D1 cells with [3H]AA was achieved by including 0.5 μCi/ml of [3H]AA during the overnight adherence period (20 h). Labeled AA that had not been incorporated into cellular lipids was removed by washing the cells four times with serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml albumin. The cells were placed in serum-free medium for 30 min before the addition of LPS or exogenous sPLA2 for different periods of time in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The supernatants were removed, cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Transient transfection of P388D1 cells with antisense oligonucleotide ASGV-2 or its sense counterpart, SGV-2, plus LipofectAMINE was carried out as described elsewhere (4Shinohara H.

Briefly, P388D1 cells were transfected with oligonucleotide (125 nm) in the presence of 5 μg/ml LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) under serum-free conditions for 8 h before treating the cells with or without 100 ng/ml LPS for 10 h after transfection. A pCH10 vector containing the gene encoding human Group V sPLA2 (13Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Jay A. Tischfield (Dept. of Genetics, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ). The gene was transferred from the pCH10 vector to the P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9K. Because of difficulties in purifying the expressed enzyme, we opted to incorporate an N-terminal HisTag that could be removed by enterokinase. The construct was then transferred into the pPIC9K Pichia expression vector using the pPIC9 vector as a shuttle vector (14White C.E. Hunter M.J. Meininger D.P. White L.R. Komives E.A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The protease-deficient P. pastoris strain SMD1168 was transformed using 10 μg of the Bgl II fragment of pPIC9KG5HT that had been linearized with Bgl II using a spheroplasting procedure described previously (14White C.E. Hunter M.J. Meininger D.P. White L.R. Komives E.A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, colonies were picked and used to inoculate 10 ml of glycerol-containing BMGY medium and allowed to grow. For induction, cells were switched to BMMY medium containing 1% methanol as a carbon source. After 2 days, the crude medium was assayed for PLA2 activity as described below. The colony displaying the highest level of PLA2 production was chosen for high level expression using a 5.0 l BioFlow 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ). Following fermentation, cells were removed by centrifugation at 4,500 × g for 10 min, and crude medium was stored at −20 °C. For purification, the medium was thawed and centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 20 min to discard any remaining cells and precipitated proteins. The crude medium was then adjusted to 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm guanidine-HCl, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a 1.0-cm column containing 10 ml of Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After loading, the column was washed with 500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and the Group V enzyme was eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm imidazole in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing PLA2 activity were pooled and dialyzed exhaustively against 25 mm Tris, pH 6.5. This material was then loaded on a DEAE column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 6.5, and eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris, pH 6.5. The HisTag from the purified enzyme was removed with enterokinase according to the manufacturer's recommmendations. Group V sPLA2 protein was synthesized from its constituent amino acids by a procedure previously employed for the Group IIA sPLA2 (15Hackeng T.M. Mounier C.M. Bon C. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H.

The cells were overlaid with a buffer consisting of 10 mm Hepes, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 20 μm aprotinin, pH 7.5. Samples from cell extracts (100 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide gel) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Hybridizations were performed exactly as described previously (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Total RNA was isolated from unstimulated or LPS-stimulated cells by the TRIZOL reagent method (Life Technologies), exactly as indicated by the manufacturer. Fifteen μg of RNA was electrophoresed in an 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon filters (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10× SSC buffer. Hybridizations were performed exactly as described previously (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

The assay mix (500 μl) consisted of 100 μm1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine substrate (2000 cpm/nmol), 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 40 °C for 30 min, after which [14C]palmitate release was determined by a modified Dole procedure (17Lio Y.C. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the selective sPLA2 inhibitor LY311727 (18Schevitz R.W. Bach N.J. Carlson D.G. Chirgadze N.Y.

Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We have taken these results as evidence that a catalytically active Group V sPLA2 is needed for the cells to make PGE2 at long stimulation times with LPS (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We have found as well that the enzyme responsible for PGE2 production in activated P388D1 macrophages is exclusively COX-2. Albeit present in the cells, COX-1 is spared from the process (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus a tight coupling between Group V sPLA2 and COX-2 appears to exist for the regulation of PGE2 production in activated P388D1 macrophages. To further explore this coupling, we studied the effect of LY311727 on COX-2 gene expression. Unexpectedly, LY311727 was found to suppress COX-2 expression at both the mRNA (Fig.1 A) and the protein (Fig.1 B) levels. Another method of inhibiting endogenous Group V sPLA2 is to use antisense oligonucleotide technology (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

The above results indicate that Group V sPLA2 is required for COX-2 expression in activated P388D1 macrophages. We have recently succeeded in expressing Group V sPLA2 in the P. pastoris yeast expression system. In this system, the enzyme is secreted to the extracellular medium in its catalytically active form. We have purified the enzyme from the supernatants to apparent homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures”) and have studied its effect when added to the P388D1 macrophage cells. Within 1 h of addition to the cells, exogenous Group V sPLA2 was already able to induce substantial AA release by itself (Fig.2 A). This finding is particularly interesting in view of the fact that exogenous Group IIA fails to elicit any AA release under similar experimental conditions (3Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). If the enzyme was preincubated with LY311727 before adding it to the cells, no AA release was observed, implying that the AA release response observed requires a catalytically active enzyme (Fig. 2). Recently, we2 have succeeded in chemically synthesizing Group V sPLA2 utilizing the same procedure previously used for Group IIA sPLA2 (15Hackeng T.M. Mounier C.M. Bon C. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Kent S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7845-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions, the synthetic enzyme displayed the same specific activity as the recombinant enzyme obtained from P. pastoris. When this synthetic Group V sPLA2 was added to the P388D1macrophages, essentially the same results as found with the recombinant enzyme were observed, i.e. the synthetic enzyme itself induced an AA release response that was inhibited by LY311727 (Fig. 2). These results show that the synthetic enzyme is indistinguishable from the recombinant one in terms of biological activity, just as synthetic Group IIA sPLA2 was found to be biologically indistinguishable from its recombinant counterpart (15Hackeng T.M. Mounier C.M. Bon C. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Kent S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7845-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore we have used both the recombinant and synthetic enzymes for the experiments reported in this study. When measurements were conducted over longer incubation times (up to 20 h), exogenous Group V was found to increase the AA release well above unstimulated controls at every time point tested (not shown). Interestingly, when added along with LPS, exogenous Group V sPLA2 increased the AA release in an additive manner (not shown), which provides additional support to our previous proposal that Group V sPLA2 levels determine long-term AA release in the LPS-treated macrophages (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Prolonged incubation with exogenous Group V sPLA2 did not affect cell viability, as judged by the trypan blue assay. Likewise, exogenous Group V sPLA2 was found to induce the expression of COX-2 at long incubation times at both the mRNA (Fig.3 A) and the protein (Fig.3 B) level. If the enzyme was preincubated with LY311727 before adding it to the cells, no effects were observed (Fig. 3, A and B). These effects were also not observed if the cells were incubated with inactive sPLA2, which was prepared by treating the enzyme with the irreversible inhibitors p- bromophenacyl bromide (19Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and manoalide (19Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 C). In vitro activity assays had demonstrated that under the conditions employed, both p- bromophenacyl bromide and manoalide totally inactivated Group V sPLA2activity (not shown). The inactivated enzyme failed to induce AA release from the P388D1 cells (not shown). Thus, these data indicate that a functionally active sPLA2 is required not only to elicit AA release from the cells but also to induce the expression of the COX-2 gene. In a previous report we demonstrated that induction of Group V sPLA2 was dependent upon a functionally active Group IV sPLA2 (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because we have shown above that a functionally active Group V sPLA2 is needed for expression of COX-2, it would be logical to anticipate that inhibition of the cPLA2also leads to a blockade in the induction of the COX-2 gene. Utilizing the conditions described previously (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we confirmed that inhibition of cPLA2 by methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate completely blocked COX-2 expression in the LPS-treated cells (Fig.4). This inhibition could not be reversed by supplementing the incubation medium with exogenous AA (up to 100 μm), suggesting that either free AA is not responsible for COX-2 induction or COX-2 induction may depend on a specific eicosanoid whose production is not adequately mimicked by exposing the cells to exogenous AA. We have recently identified in P388D1 macrophages a pathway for delayed prostaglandin synthesis in response to LPS that involves the participation of three major effectors, namely Group IV cPLA2, Group V sPLA2, and COX-2 (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because of the existence of cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2 (2Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the exact contribution of each of these enzymes to the bulk of AA release that is metabolized to prostaglandins during the delayed phase has not been easy to quantify. However, several lines of evidence based on inhibition of the response by selective chemical inhibitors or antisense oligonucleotide technology suggest that the cPLA2 behaves primarily as an initiator of the response, whereas the sPLA2 plays an augmentative role by providing the bulk of the free fatty acid used for prostaglandin production by COX-2. The strong correlation between induction of the Group V sPLA2 gene and the time courses of both AA release and PG production provides further support for the central role of this enzyme in this process. An essential requirement for sPLA2 in COX-2-dependent PG production has now been found in a variety of other cellular systems as well (6Tada K. Murakami M. Kambe T. Kudo I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5008-5015PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19891-19897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study we have provided further evidence to substantiate the notion that the sPLA2 is tightly linked to COX-2 in the chain of events leading to delayed PG production. Quite unexpectedly, we discovered that sPLA2 activation controls expression of the COX-2 gene. Hence, COX-2-derived PG production is critically dependent on a functionally active Group V sPLA2. Three different experimental approaches support this conclusion: (i) the specific sPLA2 inhibitor LY311727 greatly diminishes the induction of COX-2 protein and mRNA by LPS; (ii) antisense inhibition of Group V sPLA2expression blocks COX-2 expression; (iii) exogenous Group V sPLA2 is able by itself to both activate the cells to release AA and to induce COX-2 expression. We have previously reported that Group V sPLA2 expression is dependent on activation of the cPLA2 (4Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As expected, here we have shown that COX-2 expression is also inhibited if the cPLA2 is inhibited. As a whole, these data demonstrate that the sequence of events leading to delayed PGE2 involves activation of the cPLA2 as the foremost event, followed by cPLA2-dependent induction and of the Group V sPLA2, which in turn controls the expression and activity of COX-2. Within this signaling cascade, two important points should be emphasized further. (a) Even though the cPLA2appears not to be the main provider of free AA for PG production, its upstream position in the cascade clearly shows that it is the key enzyme in AA signaling in macrophages. It follows from this observation that any circumstance that leads to cPLA2 inhibition will prevent the cell from being able to generate PGs via COX-2 in response to stimuli. (b) The fact that COX-2 expression is dependent on both cPLA2 activation and Group V sPLA2expression offers alternative avenues for the selective inhibition of COX-2 activity and conclusively supports our long-standing hypothesis (19Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 23Dennis E.A. Bio/Technology. 1987; 5: 1294-1300Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that stimulated PG production can be efficiently controlled by controlling the upstream phospholipolytic step. A striking feature of our study is that the effects of exogenous Group V sPLA2 on P388D1 cells reported here (AA release from cells and induction of COX-2 expression) appear to require the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In agreement with our data, Tada et al. (6Tada K. Murakami M. Kambe T. Kudo I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5008-5015PubMed Google Scholar) have reported very recently that exogenous Group IIA sPLA2 induces AA release from rat mast cells and fibroblasts by a mechanism that is dependent on enzyme activity (6Tada K. Murakami M. Kambe T. Kudo I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5008-5015PubMed Google Scholar). Our results using the irreversible inhibitors p- bromophenacyl bromide and manoalide suggest that enzyme activity is needed as well for the Group V sPLA2 to induce expression of COX-2. We cannot rule out at this time the possibility that at least part of the effect of sPLA2 on COX-2 expression may be due to the sPLA2 behaving as a ligand-like molecule if the inhibitors were preventing interaction of the enzyme with a putative binding site on the surface of the cell. Whether there are true receptors (i.e. of proteinaceous nature) on cells that account for some of the effects of exogenous sPLA2s reported in the literature remains to be clarified. To date, only one true protein receptor, the M-type receptor, which shows significant homology with the mannose scavenger receptor of phagocytes, has been cloned (24Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ancian P. Lambeau G. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5897-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor binds certain sPLA2 forms with very high affinity, which suggests that these enzymes may be natural ligands for the receptor (27Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gómez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Some cellular responses to exogenous sPLA2s, particularly Group IB, have been ascribed to interaction with the M-type receptor (28Kishino J. Ohara O. Nomura K. Kramer R.M. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5092-5098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Tohkin M. Kishino J. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other putative ligand-like actions of Group IIA sPLA2 have been shown not to involve the M-type receptor (6Tada K. Murakami M. Kambe T. Kudo I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5008-5015PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hernández M. Burillo S.L. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 606-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In summary, our data demonstrate that Group V sPLA2regulates COX-2 expression in activated P388D1 macrophages by a mechanism that is best explained by the hydrolytic action of the enzyme on the outer surface of the cells. These findings add to the growing concept that Group V sPLA2 plays a fundamental role in AA release and PG synthesis in activated macrophage cells."

The relationship of any of these Ca2+ binding sites to Ca2+ inactivation of channel function is undefined.We have explored the question of whether the glutamate-rich region (D3) and the COOH-terminal region are responsible for Ca2+inactivation in RyR1 by constructing a series of RyR1/RyR2 chimeras in which the glutamate-rich D3 sequence and three other sequences (3726–4186 (F9), 4187–4628 (F10), and 4629–5037 (F11)) in RyR1 were replaced separately and in groups by the corresponding sequences in RyR2. We tested the Ca2+ dependence of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to the chimeras, and we measured in vivo Ca2+ release induced by caffeine in Ca2+ photometry. We found that the low affinity Ca2+ inactivation site is not affected by exchange of the D3 sequence but that Ca2+ inactivation is affected to different degrees by multiple exchanges of fragments at the COOH terminus of RyR1. Our results suggest that multiple Ca2+inactivation sites or multiple components of a single Ca2+inactivation site in RyR1 are located between amino acids 3726 and 5037.

These results suggest that RyR1 has high affinity Ca2+binding sites for Ca2+ activation and low affinity Ca2+ binding sites for inactivation of channel function, whereas RyR2 has only high affinity sites for Ca2+activation (1Coronado R.

This potential Ca2+ binding site is also one of the three most divergent sequences between RyR1 and RyR2, which include RyR1 amino acids 1342–1403 (D2) and 4254–4631 (D1) (11Sorrentino V. Volpe P.

In RyR1, Ca2+binding and ruthenium red binding sites have been mapped to several locations, including three in the COOH terminus of RyR1 (16Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

The relationship of any of these Ca2+ binding sites to Ca2+ inactivation of channel function is undefined. We have explored the question of whether the glutamate-rich region (D3) and the COOH-terminal region are responsible for Ca2+inactivation in RyR1 by constructing a series of RyR1/RyR2 chimeras in which the glutamate-rich D3 sequence and three other sequences (3726–4186 (F9), 4187–4628 (F10), and 4629–5037 (F11)) in RyR1 were replaced separately and in groups by the corresponding sequences in RyR2. We tested the Ca2+ dependence of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to the chimeras, and we measured in vivo Ca2+ release induced by caffeine in Ca2+ photometry. We found that the low affinity Ca2+ inactivation site is not affected by exchange of the D3 sequence but that Ca2+ inactivation is affected to different degrees by multiple exchanges of fragments at the COOH terminus of RyR1. Our results suggest that multiple Ca2+inactivation sites or multiple components of a single Ca2+inactivation site in RyR1 are located between amino acids 3726 and 5037."

By replacing rat α3 residues 184–191 with the corresponding region from the Torpedo α1 subunit, we introduced a cluster of five α1 residues (Trp-184, Trp-187, Val-188, Tyr-189, and Thr-191) into the α3 subunit. Functional activity and αBgtx sensitivity were assessed following co-expression in Xenopus oocytes of the chimeric α3 subunit (α3/α1[5]) with either rat β2 or β4 subunits. Agonist-evoked responses of α3/α1[5]-containing receptors were blocked by αBgtx with nanomolar affinity (IC50 values: 41 nm for α3/α1[5]β2 and 19 nm for α3/α1[5]β4). Furthermore, receptors containing the single point mutation α3K189Y acquire significant sensitivity to αBgtx block (IC50 values: 186 nm for α3K189Yβ2 and 179 nm for α3K189Yβ4). Another α3 chimeric subunit, α3/α7[6], similar to α3/α1[5] but incorporating the corresponding residues from the αBgtx-sensitive α7 subunit, also conferred potent αBgtx sensitivity to chimeric receptors when co-expressed with the β4 subunit (IC50 value = 31 nm).

Muscle nAChRs have pentameric structures made up of two α1 subunits and one each β1, γ, and δ(or ε) subunits; they are among the best characterized ion channels and serve as a model for understanding the structure and function of related ligand-gated channels responding to glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (4Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1237-1244Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Advances in the characterization of muscle nAChRs have been significantly aided by the discovery of a high affinity competitive antagonist, α-bungarotoxin (αBgtx). αBgtx is used extensively in experiments on the molecular properties of nAChRs and for following expression, targeting, and clustering of these receptors on muscle during synapse formation (1Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 2McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 3Boyd R.T.

Much less is known about nAChRs on neurons, in part because comparable antagonists are in limited quantity or are nonexistent. The purpose of this paper is to define the amino acid residues that are essential for high affinity αBgtx binding through a chimeric subunit approach, by conferring αBgtx sensitivity to a neuronal α subunit that is normally insensitive to αBgtx. Previous work indicates that the main αBgtx binding site is between residues 173 and 204 on the α1 subunit of the muscle nAChR. Specifically, studies of peptides derived from the Torpedoα1 sequence capable of binding αBgtx with sub-micromolar affinity suggest that the major determinants of toxin binding are located in a region adjacent to the vicinal cysteines 192 and 193 (e.g. see Ref. 5Wilson P.T.

Recent studies of heterologously expressed muscle nAChRs have identified residues in this region of the native receptor that appear to interact with the short α-neurotoxin I from Naja mossambica mossambica (NmmI (6Ackermann E.J.

In such studies, single-site mutations in the muscle type α1 subunit have not been very helpful in fully defining the α-neurotoxin binding site in the native nAChR, as most mutations studied fail to produce large changes in αBgtx affinity (6Ackermann E.J.

Therefore, in this study, rather than eliminate αBgtx binding, we have used site-directed mutagenesis of a neuronal nAChR to introduce a toxin binding site. As a consequence, we identified the molecular determinants responsible for αBgtx binding to nAChRs. Eleven different genes encode neuronal nAChR subunits (1Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 2McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 3Boyd R.T. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 299-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar): eight α subunit genes (α2-α9) and three β subunits (β2-β4). Sequence homology demonstrates that all muscle and neuronal nAChR subunits share a common structural motif; each has four hydrophobic, putative membrane-spanning domains and a long extracellular amino terminus that contains invariant cysteines at positions 128 and 142 (α1 subunit numbering). In addition, all neuronal α subunits contain the tandem cysteines at residues 192 and 193. Functional expression studies demonstrate that pairwise assembly of α2, α3, and α4 subunits with either β2 or β4 in the same complex is sufficient to form an ACh-gated ion channel (1Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 2McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Although these neuronal nicotinic receptors have several physiological properties in common with nAChRs of muscle, they are not blocked by αBgtx. In this study we take advantage of this key difference between muscle and neuronal nAChRs to investigate the molecular determinants responsible for αBgtx binding. By measuring ACh-evoked macroscopic currents from heterologously expressed receptors, we show that as few as five α1 residues can confer a high affinity αBgtx block of chimeric α3/α1 receptors. Using a similar chimeric α3 subunit in which the same stretch of residues is replaced with those of the αBgtx-sensitive α7 subunit, we show that the αBgtx binding site is effectively modular. This approach holds considerable promise for a full description of those residues required for toxin recognition in the αBgtx-sensitive nAChRs and is likely to help elucidate the molecular basis for the insensitivity of various neuronal nAChRs to α-neurotoxins. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were reagent grade from Sigma. αBgtx was from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA).

Claudio. The pcDNA1neo-α3 plasmid was digested with Hin dIII and Not I to generate an ∼1900-base pair α3 fragment that was subcloned into pcDNA3.1zeo(+) (Invitrogen). All chimeras were generated with the QuikChange (Statagene, La Jolla, CA) polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis strategy. The α3/α1[5], α3/α7[6], α1/α4[2], and α3K189Y constructs were prepared using pcDNA3.1zeo(+)-α3 as template and paired, fully complementary mutagenic primers (synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.). The α3/α1[16] construct was produced in two steps; the five residues following Cys-193 were first changed using pcDNA3.1zeo(+)-α3/α1[5] as a template; a second round of mutagenesis substituted the remaining six residues. The α3/α1[4] construct was made by a Y189K point mutation of the α3/α1[5] subunit. Mutagenic and sequencing primer sequences are available upon request. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction cycle sequencing (Brown University Sequencing Facility) and/or manual sequencing. The amino acid sequences of the various α3 and α1 chimeric constructs examined in this study are shown in Figs. 1 and 5.Figure 5Sequence comparison of αBgtx-sensitive and αBgtx-insensitive nAChR subunits. Nicotinic receptors containing α1 or α7 subunits are highly sensitive to block by αBgtx, whereas nAChRs containing α3 or α4 subunits are completely insensitive. The chimeric subunit α3/α7[6] has the 6 divergent residues of rat α3 in the region 184–191 replaced with those of rat α7. The chimeric α1/α4[2] subunit is a double mutant in which Val-188 and Phe-189 of the mouse α1 sequence are replaced with Arg and Lys, respectively; these are the amino acids occupying the homologous positions in the rat α4 sequence.

(13Bertrand D. Cooper E. Valera S. Rungger D. Ballivet M. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 4: 174-193Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Following brief collagenase treatment to remove the follicular cell layer, healthy stage V-VI oocytes were manually selected and incubated for 1 day in ND96 (in 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Oocytes were then injected with either cRNAs or cDNAs and maintained in antibiotic-supplemented ND96 for 2–3 days at 18 °C before recording. cRNA transcripts were generated using the SP6 or T7 MessageMachine kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). Plasmids bearing cDNAs of the rat α3, β2, and β4 subunits and the α3/α1 chimeric subunits were prepared using standard procedures. Following extraction with organic solvents, cDNA plasmids were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in injection buffer (in 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0). A Drummond Nanoject was used to inject ∼23 ng (in 46 nl) for cRNAs and ∼15 ng (in 14 nl) for cDNAs. Nucleic acids for the various subunit combinations were combined in equimolar ratios. For recordings, cells were perfused with OR2 medium (in 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10−3 mm atropine sulfate, pH 7.4). Concentrated stocks of acetylcholine chloride (ACh) and toxins in water were diluted directly in OR2. ACh-evoked currents were measured from injected oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp method with a Warner 752B amplifier at a membrane potential of −60 mV. Data were acquired on a PC using Fetchex software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Electrodes of resistance 0.5–4.0 megaohms were filled with 3 m KCl. Recordings were performed in a custom Sylgard chamber or a Warner RC-8 chamber (each with an incubation volume of ∼300 μl) with gravity perfusion flow (∼5 ml/min). The flow of various drug solutions into the chamber was regulated using solenoid valves driven by a Warner VC-6 valve controller. As noted by others (14Papke R.L. Craig A.G. Heinemann S.F. J.

For each subunit combination and each recording session, we performed run-down control determinations by measuring currents for the same dose (∼EC50) of ACh given 6–10 times over a time period similar to that used for the experimental data acquisitions. In cases where run-down was observed, values for ACh-evoked inward currents were corrected by linear interpolation. Co-application experiments were used to measure the onset of toxin block. After collecting initial responses evoked by a control dose of ACh, oocytes were challenged with a solution containing both the test dose of ACh and the desired αBgtx concentration. Thereafter, cells were perfused between successive co-applications with a solution containing only the test concentration of toxin; in some cases, perfusion was stopped after ∼30 s to conserve toxin. To measure the recovery from toxin block, ACh responses were obtained for each cell before and after exposing the oocyte to a blocking concentration of αBgtx. After 10 min in toxin solution, the degree of block was measured, and recovery was initiated by perfusing the oocyte with toxin-free solution. The responses to test doses of ACh were measured at various times during the washout of toxin. Data measuring the concentration dependence of αBgtx block (Figs. 3 and 6) were fit by nonlinear regression to the logistic dose-response function (16Limbird L.E.

The α1/α4[2] subunit was co-expressed with the mouse β, γ, and δ subunits (upward triangles), and 100 μm ACh was used to elicit response; the IC50 characterizing this block was 7 ± 0.5 nm. In similar studies of αBgtx block of oocyte-expressed mouse muscle (α1βγδ) receptors, an IC50 value of 2.4 nm was observed (27Rosenthal J.A. Levandoski M.M. Chang B. Potts J.F. Shi Q.-L. Hawrot E.

The α3/α7[6] subunit was co-expressed with the rat β4 subunit (downward triangles), and 400 μm ACh was used to elicit response; the IC50 characterizing this block was 31 ± 2 nm. Currents evoked with 100 μmfrom oocytes expressing the α3/α1[4]β4 combination (×) were not blocked by αBgtx at a concentration of 1.5 μm.

For assessment of function, the chimeric α3 subunits were co-expressed with the appropriate non-α subunits (β2 or β4) in Xenopus oocytes (13Bertrand D. Cooper E. Valera S. Rungger D. Ballivet M. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 4: 174-193Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The α3/α1[5] chimera, with the residue changes Y184W, E187W, I188V, K189Y, and N191T, and the point mutant α3K189Y both expressed well, producing robust ACh-evoked currents with little apparent deleterious effect on ACh sensitivity. As indicated in TableI, the EC50 values for ACh of the various chimeric receptors co-expressed with β2 or β4 subunits, determined from dose-response titrations, are either the same as or less than those for the wild type combinations of α3β2 and α3β4. For α3 chimeric subunits co-expressed with the β2 subunit, the EC50 values ranged from 50–80 μm, in good agreement with the range 10–150 μm previously reported for wild type α3β2 (17Luetje C.W. Piattoni M. Patrick J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 657-666PubMed Google Scholar, 18Harvey S.C. Luetje C.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3798-3806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Papke R.L. Heinemann S.F.

Because the EC50 values we measured for the various chimeric subunits are in the ranges previously reported for the wild type combinations, we conclude that these substitutions cause no major structural perturbations to the receptors.Table IProperties of chimeric and wild type α3 receptorsSubunit combinationEC50 for AChIC50 for αBgtxHalf-time of recoveryμmnmminα3/α1[5]β280 ± 40 (n = 4)41 ± 924 ± 3α3/α1[5]β470 ± 10 (n = 6)19 ± 318 ± 1α3K189Yβ250 ± 20 (n = 7)186 ± 421.0 ± 0.2α3K189Yβ4230 ± 20 (n = 5)179 ± 591.0 ± 0.1α3/α7[6]β4450 ± 50 (n = 6)31 ± 2NDα3/α1[4]β440 ± 1 (n = 5) >50,000NAα3β270 ± 6 (n = 7)>100,000NAα3β4100 ± 10 (n = 6)>100,000NAValues reported are ±S.E. as determined by fitting to appropriate equations (described under “Experimental Procedures”) using Origin 5.0 software.

We also constructed the α3/α1[16] chimeric subunit (see Fig. 1) in which a more extensive region of Torpedo α1 (residues 177–199) was substituted into α3. No expression of this construct was observed following co-injection with either β2 or β4 subunit genes (46 oocytes from 5 frogs). High concentrations of ACh, dimethylphenylpiperazinium, and cytisine failed to evoke currents in these oocytes, suggesting that the additional substitutions in the α3/α1[16] chimera adversely affected subunit folding and/or assembly and membrane targeting. This phenomenon is not well understood but has been observed for other chimeric nAChRs in which residues of the amino-terminal extracellular domain were examined (17Luetje C.W. Piattoni M. Patrick J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 657-666PubMed Google Scholar, 22Corringer J.-P. Bertrand S. Bohler S. Edelstein S.J. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 648-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether the five homologous residues of the Torpedo α1 sequence adjacent to the tandem cysteines 192–193 were sufficient when substituted into the rat α3 sequence to confer sensitivity to αBgtx on these chimeric nAChRs. As shown in Fig. 2 A, following an initial co-application of 100 μm ACh and 15 nmαBgtx and further incubation in toxin between successive test co-applications, the evoked currents of an oocyte expressing the α3/α1[5]β4 combination were greatly reduced over a 15-min period. In contrast, the ACh-evoked currents from an oocyte expressing the wild type α3β4 combination showed no block after a 10-min incubation with 1 μm αBgtx (Fig. 2 B). In other experiments we confirmed that wild type α3β2 and α3β4 receptors show no block of ACh-evoked currents following incubations for up to 30 min in 10 μm αBgtx (data not shown). Combined data from several co-application experiments using α3/α1[5]β2 and α3/α1[5]β4 nAChRs, shown in Fig.2 C, describe the rate of onset of αBgtx block. Fractional block (1-Ico-application/Icontrol, proportional to the fraction of receptor bound with toxin) was determined as a function of the time of exposure to toxin. The onset of block can be well fit to a simple bimolecular association model for complex formation under pseudo-first-order conditions. We obtained a value of kapp of 1.4 ± 0.1 × 105m−1 s−1 for α3/α1[5]β2 and 1.7 ± 0.3 × 105m−1 s−1 for α3/α1[5]β4. These rate constants are very similar to those measured for association of αBgtx with muscle type receptors (24Claudio T. Green G.N. Hartman D.S. Hayden D. Paulson H.L. Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Swedlund A. Science. 1987; 238: 1688-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Endo T. Nakanishi M. Furukawa S. Joubert F.J. Tamiya N. Hayashi K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The plateau value of ∼0.6 for the two data sets shown in Fig. 2 C represents the maximal block achievable with 15 nm αBgtx. Operationally, these data also show that for receptors incorporating α3/α1[5] chimeric subunits, an incubation time of 10 min is sufficient to approach full equilibration for αBgtx concentrations in excess of 15 nm. The concentration dependence of αBgtx block of chimeric α3/α1[5]-containing receptors was determined following a 10-min incubation with αBgtx as shown in Fig.3. The solid curves represent the best fit to the logistic equation (16Limbird L.E. Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1996: 133Google Scholar), from which the IC50 values of 19 ± 3 nm and 41 ± 9 nm for the α3/α1[5]β4 and α3/α1[5]β2 receptors, respectively, were determined. Significantly, these IC50 values are the same order of magnitude as that found for the block of α3β2 receptors by κ-bungarotoxin (κBgtx, also known as neuronal bungarotoxin), a related toxin from the same venom as αBgtx (26Grant G.A. Luetje C.W. Summers R. Xu X.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12166-12171Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and only about 1 order of magnitude higher than the IC50 of 2.4 nm αBgtx measured for mouse muscle receptors expressed in oocytes (27Rosenthal J.A. Levandoski M.M. Chang B. Potts J.F. Shi Q.-L. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7847-7855Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For neuronal nAChRs, the β subunit contributes extensively in determining the affinities for many ligands, including the sensitivity to κBgtx (17Luetje C.W. Piattoni M. Patrick J. Mol.

Sci. 1993; 252: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For example, κBgtx blocks oocyte-expressed α3β2 receptors with high affinity in a prolonged manner but blocks α3β4 receptors transiently and only at high concentrations (17Luetje C.W. Piattoni M. Patrick J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 657-666PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cachelin A.B. Rust G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1168-1174PubMed Google Scholar, 28Papke R.L. Duvoisin R.M. Heinemann S.F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 252: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to our finding that the chimeric subunit α3/α1[5] co-expressed with either β2 or β4 showed little difference in affinity for αBgtx. Recently, Sine (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) has shown that a conserved Leu residue (position 119 in the γ and ε subunits, 121 in δ) was in proximity to the αBgtx binding site of muscle receptors. Interestingly, in both rat β2 and β4 subunits the homologous position is also occupied by Leu. If αBgtx makes contacts with the neighboring β subunit in the α3/α1 chimeric receptors, these contacts are likely to be similar for both β2 and β4. Harvey and Luetje (18Harvey S.C. Luetje C.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3798-3806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) find that the region 54–63 of the β2 subunit, in particular residue Thr-59, is the major determinant of the selectivity of κBgtx for α3β2 over α3β4 receptors. Together these results suggest possible differences in which residues of αBgtx and κBgtx are oriented toward the β subunit in the nAChR-bound state. In the region between residues 184–191, one of the most divergent sites between α1 and α3 sequences occurs at position 189; this residue is Tyr in Torpedo α1 (Phe in mouse α1) and Lys in α3. In fact, all known αBgtx-insensitive α subunits in rat, chick, and human have Lys in this position. To test the importance of residue 189 in αBgtx sensitivity, we mutated Lys-189 in α3 to Tyr and expressed the point mutant subunit α3K189Y with β subunits in oocytes. As shown in the dose-response curves for the point mutant combinations (Fig. 3), αBgtx blocked the ACh-evoked currents of the α3K189Yβ2 and α3K189Yβ4 rec"

In the present work we examined the coupling between Imin and IP3 receptors in excised plasma membrane patches from A431 cells. Iminwas recorded in cell-attached mode and the patches were excised into medium containing IP3. In about 50% of experiments excision caused the loss of activation of Iminby IP3. In the remaining patches activation of Imin by IP3 was lost upon extensive washes of the patch surface. The ability of IP3 to activate Imin was restored by treating the patches with rat cerebellar microsomes reach in IP3 receptors but not by control forebrain microsomes. The re-activated Imin had the same kinetic properties as Imin when it is activated by Ca2+-mobilizing agonists in intact cells and by IP3 in excised plasma membrane patches and it was inhibited by the Icrac inhibitor SKF95365. We propose that Imin is a form of Icrac and is gated by IP3receptors.

Bird G.S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The two Ca2+ transporting events are linked through the regulation of Ca2+ influx by Ca2+ content in the stores, a gating behavior termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE).1 In many cells CCE is manifested as Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+current (Icrac). Icrac is distinguished by its low conductance and very high selectivity for Ca2+ (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 4Hoth M.

Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar) can activate Icrac. The molecular identity of Icrac is not known. However, its functional characteristics began to emerge. An elegant single-channel recording of Icrac in Jurkat T cells estimated an Icrac single channel conductance of about 1 pS when transporting Ca2+ (7Kerschbaum H. Cahalan M. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This is remarkably similar to the conductance of a miniature, Ca2+-selective channel (Imin) we described in several cell types (8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, similar to Icrac, Imin is highly selective for Ca2+ over K+ (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N.

Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The open probability, but not the conductance of both channels, is increased by membrane hyperpolarization (7Kerschbaum H. Cahalan M. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N.

Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Icrac and Imin are activated by store depletion with Ca2+-mobilizing agonists or thapsigargin in intact cells, and Imin is activated by IP3 in the same excised plasma membrane patch. Therefore studying the gating of Imin by IP3 and IP3R may be relevant to understanding the gating of Icrac. Although widely documented (for review, see Refs. 1Putney J.W.J. Bird G.S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), the way Icrac is gated by store Ca2+ content is not understood. The two leading hypotheses to explain gating of Icrac by stored Ca2+ are the soluble messenger (10Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) and the conformational coupling hypothesis (2Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 11Irvine R.F. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The former proposes generation of a soluble messenger, such as the Ca2+ influx factor (10Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), in response to store depletion that diffuses to the plasma membrane to activate Icrac. The conformational coupling model proposes gating of Icrac by direct interaction with IP3R. Ca2+ release from internal stores causes a conformational change in the IP3R, which is transduced to and is sensed by the Icrac to regulate its activity (2Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Additional suggestions include gating of Icrac by agonist-generated lipid mediators (12Gailly P. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or by vesicle fusion events (13Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we studied gating of the store-operated, human homologue of the Drosophila Trp channel, hTrp3 by IP3R (14Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). We found that hTrp3 channels are gated by coupling to IP3R (14Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). These findings were corroborated by studies reported as unpublished observations (15Vannier B. Peyton M. Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2060-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which identified sequences in hTrp3 and IP3R that interacts with each other to influence Ca2+ influx. Building upon our studies of hTrp3 gating by IP3R (14Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and identification of Imin as an Icrac-like channel (8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N.

Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in the present work we studied regulation of Imin by IP3R. We report that Imin in excised plasma membrane patches is indeed gated by IP3R, further supporting the coupling hypothesis and the possible identity of Imin with Icrac. Human carcinoma A431 cells (Cell Culture Collection, Institute of Cytology, St. Petersburg, Russia) were kept in culture as described elsewhere (8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For patch clamp experiments cells were seeded onto coverslips and maintained in culture for 1 to 3 days before use. Single-channel currents were recorded using the inside-out and cell-attached modes of the patch clamp technique (16Hamill O.P. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15119) Google Scholar). Currents filtered at 500 Hz were recorded using a PC-501A patch clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) with a conventional feedback resistance in the headstage (10 GΩ). During recording the currents were digitized at 2.5 kHz. For data analysis and presentation, currents were additionally digitally filtered.NPo was determined using the following equation:NPo = <I>/i, where <I> and i are the mean channel current and unitary current amplitude, respectively. <I> was estimated from the time integral of the current above the base line, and i was determined from current records and all-point amplitude histograms. Data were collected from 20-s current records after channel activity reached steady state. Unless otherwise specified, all experiments were performed at standard conditions optimal for Imin activity. These include free Ca2+ buffered at p Ca 7 and membrane potential of −70 mV (8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). Imin was activated by 2.5 μm IP3. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 105 BaCl2 and 10 Tris/HCl (pH 7.4). The standard intracellular solution contained (in mm): 140 potassium glutamate, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES/KOH, 1.13 CaCl2 and 2 EGTA/KOH (pCa 7, pH 7.4). In cell-attached experiments, the bath solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES/KOH, 1 MgCl2, and 2 CaCl2. Drugs were applied to the patches either by bath perfusion or by brief pressure ejection. In both cases, the time required for a complete change of solution around the patch was less than 1 s. Cerebellar and forebrain microsomes were isolated from rat brains (Wistar 4–5 weeks old) as described (17Kaznacheeva E. Lupu V. Bezprozvanny I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C. Microsomes were suspended at a protein concentration of 5 μg/μl. IP3R content was determined by Western blot analysis with the use of polyclonal antibodies against type 1 IP3R. As reported before (17Kaznacheeva E. Lupu V. Bezprozvanny I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) cerebellar microsomes contained at least 20-fold more IP3R than forebrain microsomes at comparable microsomal protein content. HEPES was from Sigma, EGTA was from Fluka Chemie AG (Buchs, Switzerland), and IP3 and SKF96365 were from Calbiochem (Behring Diagnostics, La Jolla, CA). Data are given as mean ± S.E. Error bars denoting S.E. are shown where they exceed the symbol size. In previous work we reported that IP3 activates a Ca2+-selective channel in excised plasma membrane patches which we termed Imin (8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N.

Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, activation of Imin by IP3 was successful only in about 50% of excised patches. Furthermore, in these studies we noticed that the likelihood of Imin activation by IP3 was decreased with increasing patch washes. This is reminiscent of a similar observation noted when activation of hTrp3 by IP3 and IP3R was studied (14Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In the case of hTrp3, it was shown that membrane washes prevented hTrp3 activation by IP3 due to removal of IP3R associated with the patch. Activation of hTrp3 by IP3 could be restored by addition of native or recombinant IP3R1 to the patches (14Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Suspecting that the loss of Imin regulation by IP3 was due to dissociation and loss of IP3R attached to Imin in a manner similar to that reported for hTrp3, we tested whether native IP3R can restore regulation of Imin by IP3. For these experiments we used the following experimental protocol. The cell attached mode of the patch clamp technique was obtained in A431 cells. Only patches showing channel activity in cell-attached mode were used for further experiments. In most cases patch excision into IP3-free bath solution abolished channel activity observed in the cell-attached mode (8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When patches were excised into a bath solution containing IP3, Imin was observed in about 50% of patches. If Iminactivity in response to IP3 application was observed, the patches were washed until activation by IP3 was lost. If the patches showed no Imin activity upon excision, they were not further washed. Figs. 1, A and B, show an example of an excised patch that did not respond to bath application of IP3. After the control period patches were incubated with IP3 and microsomes prepared either from rat cerebellum (rich source of IP3R1, see Ref. 18Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or rat forebrains (poor source of IP3R (18Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The middle portion of Fig.1 A and the traces in Fig. 1 B show that cerebellar microsomes restored the ability of IP3 to activate Imin. Removal of IP3 abolished channel activity, despite the continuous presence of microsomes. Hence, activation of IP3R by IP3 was needed to activate Imin. Fig. 1 D shows that cerebellar microsomes restored activation of Imin by IP3 in 26/41 (63%) experiments. On the other hand, no activation was observed in all 27 experiments with forebrain microsomes or in 6 experiments in which cerebellar microsomes without IP3 were used. To further establish the specificity of the effect of cerebellar microsomes, their activity was compared with forebrain microsomes in the same patches and in patches showing weak activity of Imin. Patches from five different cells exposed to IP3 and microsomes prepared from forebrain were inactive. Subsequent exposure of the same patches to IP3and cerebellar microsomes activated Imin. Application of microsomes together with IP3 to patches that show weak response to IP3 increased the activity of Imin by about 7-fold. Thus, NPo increased from 0.22 ± 0.09 to 1.55 ± 0.38 (n = 7). The Imin current restored by IP3R had properties identical to those reported previously for Imin (8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several properties of the reconstituted Imin are illustrated in Fig.2. Specifically, the single channel conductance measured in the presence of 105 mmBa2+ in the pipette was 1 pS (Fig. 2 B). In six experiments the extrapolated reversal potential of the restored channel was close to +60 mV (Fig. 2 B), indicating high selectivity for Ca2+ (=Ba2+) over K+. Furthermore, Imin open probability was highly voltage-dependent with increased activity at potentials below −40 mV (Fig. 2 C). The channel mean open time was about 7.7 ms (Fig. 2 D). SKF 96365 (SKF) is probably the best characterized Icrac inhibitor (19Merritt J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). This compound also inhibits Ca2+ influx and current mediated by the store-operated Trp family channels (20Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to test the effect of SKF on the Imin activated by IP3R. Fig. 3 shows that SKF strongly inhibited Imin activity after its restoration by IP3 and IP3R. Similar results were obtained in eight experiments. The mechanism of Icrac gating by store depletion remained a mystery for a long time due to a lack of adequate experimental systems to study this question. Two recent findings, however, allowed the reprobing of this question. The first is the demonstration of the regulation of the store-operated hTrp3 channel by IP3R (14Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), and the second is the measurement of Icrac single channel conductance (7Kerschbaum H. Cahalan M. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Previous studies estimated single channel conductance of Icrac to be below the resolution of a standard excised patch technique (4Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 5Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). However, isolation of Icrac single channel conductance in whole-cell recording revealed that Icrac conductance is about 1 pS when transporting divalent ions, a conductance that can be comfortably resolved in excised patches. In previous studies, we measured the conductance of Imin to be about 1 pS (8Kiselyov K.I. Mamin A.G. Semyonova S.B. Mozhayeva G.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the channel mean open time to be about 7.7 ms (Fig. 2 D). Channel mean open time is the most characteristic of channel properties and is commonly used as channel fingerprints (21Hille B. Ion Channels of Cell Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). In this respect, we note that Icrac mean open time was reported to be about 8 ms (7Kerschbaum H. Cahalan M. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The findings that Imin open probability is regulated by voltage in a manner similar to that of Icrac, (7Kerschbaum H. Cahalan M. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), both channels are highly selective for divalent ions (4Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 5Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and the two channels have almost identical mean open time suggest to us that Imin is a form of Icrac. The similarity (and possible identity) of Iminand Icrac and our ability to record Imin in excised plasma membrane patches provided us with the opportunity to study the gating of native Icrac-like channels by IP3R. The present work shows that Imin is gated by interaction with IP3R, that this protein-protein interaction is relatively lose, and that the gating required occupation of IP3R by IP3. All of these characteristics are identical to those we found for the regulation of the store-operated hTrp3 channel by IP3R (14Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Gating of store-operated channels by IP3R may be mediated by direct interaction between the channels. Thus, recent findings reported as unpublished observations (15Vannier B. Peyton M. Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2060-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) indicated that IP3R/hTrp complexes can be co-immunoprecipated, and peptide sequences in IP3R can bind to peptide sequences in hTrp3 in vitro. Interaction between Icrac and IP3R may occur in vivo in microdomains rich in IP3R. Such microdomains were reported in many cells (22Muallem S. Lee M.G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and probably facilitated excision of Imin with IP3R attached to them in our experiments. We thank Dr. A. Arnautov for helping with Western blot analysis."

In contrast, binding of hPRL to the hPRLR is zinc-independent. We engineered in binding site 1 of hPRL a hGH-like zinc coordination site, by mutating Asp-183hPRL (homologous to Glu-174hGH) into Glu (D183E mutation). This mutation was also introduced into G129R hPRL, a binding site 2 mutant (Goffin, V., Kinet, S., Ferrag, F., Binart, N., Martial, J. A., and Kelly, P. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 16573–16579). These analogs were characterized using a stable clone expressing both the hPRLR and a PRLR-responsive reporter gene. The D183E mutation per se decreases the binding affinity and transcriptional activity of hPRL. However, this loss is partially rescued by the addition of zinc and the effect is much more marked on bioactivity than on binding affinity. These data indicate that the D183E mutation confers zinc sensitivity to hPRL biological properties. Due to an impaired site 2, the agonistic activity of G129R analog is almost nil. Although the double mutant D183E/G129R displays lower affinity (∼1 log) compared with G129R hPRL, it unexpectedly recovers partial agonistic activity in the absence of zinc. Moreover, whereas zinc increases the affinity of D183E/G129R, it paradoxically abolishes its agonistic activity. Our results demonstrate that the biological properties of hPRL analogs do not necessarily parallel their overall affinity. Rather, the relative affinities of the individual binding sites 1 and 2 may play an even more important role.

Eberhardt N.L. Endocr. Rev. 1983; 4: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2Sinha Y.N. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Its biological functions are mediated by a single-pass transmembrane receptor, the PRL receptor (PRLR), also known as lactogen receptor (3Boutin J.M. Jolicoeur C. Okamura H. Gagnon J. Edery M. Shirota M. Banville D. Dusanter-Fourt I. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 69-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), which belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily (4Kelly P.A. Djiane J. Postel-Vinay M.C. Edery M. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). We recently listed up to 300 different functions for PRL (5Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), the best known activities being related to lactation and reproduction as emphasized by the sterility and impaired mammary gland development of female PRLR knockout mice (6Ormandy C.J.

PRL shares several structural and functional similarities with growth hormone (GH), another anterior pituitary hormone (1Miller W.L. Eberhardt N.L. Endocr. Rev. 1983; 4: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Their amino acid sequences show 58% similarity throughout vertebrates (7Nicoll C.S. Mayer G.L. Russell S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and their three-dimensional structures are assumed to be very similar as well (8Goffin V. Martial J.A. Summers N.L. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1215-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The receptors of these hormones are also highly similar with respect to their sequence, three-dimensional structure, and signaling characteristics (5Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 9Goffin V. Kelly P.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neopl. 1997; 2: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Kossiakoff A.A. Somers W. Ultsch M. Andow K. Muller Y.A. De Vos A.M.

Both GH and PRL activate their receptors by sequential dimerization, and it is now clearly established that the interaction of one hormone with two receptors involves two different regions of the ligands referred to as binding sites 1 and 2 (12Goffin V. Shiverick K.T. Kelly P.A. Martial J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 385-410PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). First, the hormones interact with one molecule of receptor through their binding site 1 to form an intermediate 1:1 complex, which is inactive. Second, the hormone involved in this transient complex interacts via its binding site 2 with a second molecule of receptor to achieve a 1:2 complex that triggers intracellular signaling cascades. This paradigm of receptor activation has been deciphered at the residue/atomic levels by the elucidation of the now classical three-dimensional structure of the complex between human (h) GH and the hGH binding protein (BP), corresponding to the extracellular domain of the hGHR (14De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, such data is currently lacking for the hPRL·hPRLR complex. In addition to binding to the GHR, primate (human and monkey) GHs display the unique ability among growth hormones to also bind to the PRLR. This cross-reaction involves the participation of one zinc ion, since the affinity of hGH for the hPRLBP is increased by 8,000-fold in the presence of ZnCl2 compared with EDTA (15Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the 1:1 complex between hGH and the hPRLBP has shown that the four residues coordinating the zinc ion are His-18hGHand Glu-174hGH of the hormone, both residues belonging to binding site 1, and Asp-187hPRLR and His-188hPRLR of the receptor (16Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Zinc mediation is one of the, if not the major, molecular events in the interaction between hGH and the hPRLR. Indeed, the most effective point mutation introduced into hGH (if one excludes those affecting zinc coordination) drops the binding affinity by only 25-fold, compared with the 8,000-fold reduction of affinity of WT hGH in the presence of EDTA (15Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have shown that hPRL does bind zinc (18Lorenson M.Y. Patel T. Liu J.W. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Sun Z. Lee M.S. Rhee H.K. Arrandale J.M. Dannies P.S. Mol.

Zinc induces hPRL aggregation in secretory granules found in pituitary lactotroph cells, rendering the hormone osmotically inert (18Lorenson M.Y. Patel T. Liu J.W. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Otherwise, the concentration of zinc affects neither the affinity of hPRL for its receptor (15Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) nor its mitogenic activity on rat Nb2 cells (21Dattani M.T. Hindmarsh P.C. Brook C.G. Robinson I.C. Weir T. Marshall N.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc binding by hPRL thus effects its storage and secretion, but not its functional properties. With respect to the four zinc coordinating residues identified in the hGH·hPRLBP complex (16Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), sequence alignments (12Goffin V. Shiverick K.T. Kelly P.A. Martial J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 385-410PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the hPRL·hPRLBP complex only differs by the mutation of Glu-174hGH into Asp in hPRL (Asp-183hPRL in hPRL numbering). Despite the fact that Asp is one of the four amino acids able to coordinate zinc ions (the three others are His, Cys, and Glu; see Ref. 23Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar), Asp-183hPRL and His-27hPRL (homologous to His-18hGH) are presumably unable to coordinate a zinc ion in a manner similar to Glu-174hGH and His-18hGH when hGH binds to the hPRLR. Alternatively, if these residues are actually involved in zinc binding, this has no effect on the interaction between hPRL and its receptor. We have previously generated several hPRL analogs by site-directed mutagenesis (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Goffin V. Norman M. Martial J.A. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14353-14360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); those carrying a sterically hindering mutation within binding site 2 were shown to act as antagonists due to their reduced ability to induce PRLR dimerization (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The antagonistic potency of such analogs is relatively weak, however, since their overall affinity only relies on a single interaction, namely that involving the hPRL binding site 1 and one receptor. In comparison, trimeric complexes between wild type hormones (GH, PRL) and their binding proteins involve two additional contacts, one between binding site 2 of the hormone and the second receptor, and one at the receptor interface (14De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). In order to strengthen the antagonistic properties of PRL/GH mutants, a strategy would be to engineer mutations increasing their affinity at binding site 1. A typical example is the hGH antagonist referred to as B2036, which combines the widely described G120R site 2 mutation (28Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) with eight point mutations enhancing binding site 1 affinity (see Ref. 29Goffin V. Bernichtein S. Carrière O. Bennett W.F. Kopchick J.J. Kelly P.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3853-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and references therein). Using the same logic, our aim was to reconstitute in hPRL a putative hGH-like zinc binding site in order to increase the affinity of binding site 1. This was achieved by mutating Asp-183hPRL into Glu-183hPRL in WT hPRL and in the previously reported G129R analog (see “Discussion”). Biological studies of lactogenic hormones are most often performed using the rat Nb2 cell proliferation bioassay (30Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2433-2436PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tanaka T. Shiu R.P. Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Friesen H.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, we have previously shown that the interaction between hPRL (wild type or analogs) and the PRLR is different depending whether the receptor is from rat or human origin, making the rat Nb2 cell assay not suitable for testing antagonistic properties of hPRL analogs (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In order to test the latter in a homologous system, we developed a new bioassay by generating cells stably expressing the human PRLR cDNA and a PRL-responsive reporter gene. Culture media, fetal calf serum (FCS), Geneticin (G-418), trypsin, and glutamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Luciferin and cell lysis buffer were from Promega (Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was measured in relative light units (RLU) (Lumat LB 9501; Berthold, Nashua, NH). IODOGEN was purchased from Sigma, and carrier-free Na125I was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Salts were high grade purified chemicals purchased from Sigma or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). In this study, we used exclusively recombinant proteins: WT hPRL, the binding site 2 analog G129R (Gly-129 replaced with Arg) (26Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the zinc binding analog D183E (Asp-183 replaced with Glu), and the double mutant D183E/G129R, combining both site 1 and site 2 mutations. The pT7L expression vector has been described previously (32Paris N. Rentier-Delrue F. Defontaine A. Goffin V. Lebrun J.J. Mercier L. Martial J.A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 436-449PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant WT and mutated hPRL were produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N.

The human PRLR cDNA inserted into the pc/DNA3 eukaryotic vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) has been used and described previously (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J.

Endocrinol. 1995; 114: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The PRLR-responsive reporter gene carries the sequence encoding the luciferase gene under the control of a 6-repeat sequence of the lactogenic hormone response element (LHRE) followed by the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). LHRE is the DNA binding element of the signal transducer and activator of transcription Stat5 (34Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), one of the signaling proteins activated by dimerized PRLR (5Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified using the cesium chloride gradient procedure and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Construction of the D183E/G129R mutated hPRL cDNA was performed by the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis method using the Chameleon mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), strictly following the manufacturer's instructions. The D183E mutation was introduced into the cDNA encoding the G129R hPRL analog (26Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following mutated oligonucleotide: GAG ATA ATT CTC GAT TTT ATG (5′–3′ non-coding strand, mutated codon underlined). The D183E single mutant was obtained by substituting the Eco R I-Bgl II fragment (encoding amino acids 40–145) of WT hPRL cDNA for the corresponding fragment of the D183E/G129R cDNA. Clones containing the expected mutation were identified by DNA sequencing. Circular dichroism was performed as described previously (25Goffin V. Norman M. Martial J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1381-1392PubMed Google Scholar) using a CD6 dichrograph (Instruments SA-Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau, France), and the helicity was calculated at 222 nm (35Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Apparent molecular mass of hPRL proteins were measured by high pressure liquid gel filtration chromatography. One hundred-μl samples (500 μg/ml) were loaded on a Superose 12 molecular sieve column equilibrated in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl. Elution was performed in the same buffer at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with several molecular mass markers: dextran blue (void volume), bovine serum albumin dimers (136 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), and myoglobin (17.5 kDa). We used the human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cell line to generate a clonal cell line stably expressing the hPRLR, since this cell line has been shown to highly express cDNAs controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter (24Goffin V.

Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely cultured as described previously (36Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). They were transfected with both plasmids encoding the hPRLR and the LHRE-luciferase reporter genes (2 μg each) using the calcium-phosphate precipitate procedure (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were shifted to growth medium containing 500 μg/ml active G-418. From this step, G-418 was systematically added to all culture media. After 15–20 days, single G-418-resistant colonies were localized by microscope, picked out individually by local trypsinization, and amplified in 24-well plates before being characterized for their ability to respond to hPRL, as monitored by the induction of luciferase activity. Clones were referred to as HL (H for human PRLR, L for LHRE reporter plasmid) and numbered starting at HL1. After trypsinization, cells were counted and aliquoted in 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/100 μl/well. Plating medium contained 0.5% FCS to allow cell adhesion. Eighteen hours (overnight) after plating, 100 μl of 2-fold concentrated hormones diluted in FCS-free medium were added to each well. For assays involving ions (see below), solutions containing 4-fold concentrated hormone (50 μl) and 4-fold concentrated ion salts (50 μl) were added separately to avoid any interference of the ion concentration on hormone dilutions (e.g. protein aggregation, precipitation, etc). In addition, due to possible effects of the different salts on cell metabolism, a standard dose-response curve using WT hPRL (including non stimulated conditions) was performed separately for each ion tested. Typically, we assayed the different hormones (WT or analogs) at concentrations ranging from ∼10 ng/ml to ∼250 μg/ml (∼10 μm) in duplicate. After 18–24 h of stimulation, culture medium was aspirated and cells were lysed for at least 10 min in 50 μl of lysis buffer. Luciferase activity for each experimental condition was counted in 10–20 μl of cell lysates for 10 s. The difference between duplicates never exceeded 15% of RLU values. To investigate the effect of zinc ions on luciferase activity, we first used a zinc-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The residual concentration of zinc in this medium as estimated by atomic absorption spectroscopy was ∼0.2 μm, which is ∼10-fold lower than that of normal medium (∼2 μm). To ensure cell adhesion, functional tests required being performed in the presence of 0.25% FCS, the zinc content of which was measured as ∼0.2 μm. As shown under “Results,” the effect of zinc on biological properties of zinc-sensitive analogs required the addition of at least 5 μm zinc salts and, in agreement, we never saw any significant difference using either “zinc-free” (∼0.4 μm zinc measured, including 0.25% FCS) or normal (∼2.2 μm zinc) medium. Therefore, normal medium was used for all functional studies and was referred to as 0 μm zinc, indicating no addition of exogenous ions. The indications 5, 10, 25, and 50 μm (experimentally estimated at 54 μm zinc) correspond to the concentrations of ZnSO4 added to normal medium. The addition of EDTA to cell cultures to remove any traces of divalent ions appeared detrimental to cell attachment and metabolism, and the effect was more apparent as EDTA concentration increased. EDTA was thus only used for some experiments to reverse the effect of added zinc (see below), at a concentration of 0.1 mm that had minimal side effects on cell response (meaning absolute RLU values). -Fold induction is calculated as the ratio between the RLU of stimulated versus non-stimulated (no hormone added) cells. In order to accurately compare the biological activities of the different hormones in the various conditions tested (see “Results”), data obtained within each experiment were expressed as a percentage of the maximal -fold induction obtained with WT hPRL in the absence of ion added, and these percentages were averaged to calculate EC50 and IC50 values. One experiment representative of at least three experiments is presented in the figures. For assays of agonists, EC50 values correspond to the concentration of hormone required to reach 50% of the maximal activation of the reporter gene achieved by WT hPRL. The bioactivity of hPRL analogs is given as the ratio of its EC50 with respect to that of WT hPRL. The IC50 of self-inhibition (self-IC50) was calculated as the hormone concentration leading to 50% decrease of maximal cell response. For assays of antagonists, the IC50values were calculated as the amount of hPRL analog producing 50% inhibition of WT hPRL maximal activity. Binding experiments of hPRL analogs to the hPRLR were performed on cell homogenates, which eliminates any detrimental effect of chemicals (ions, EDTA) on intact living cells. 293 cells stably expressing the hPRLR (clone HL5) were amplified, then starved in serum-free medium for 18–24 h. Cells were scrapped, centrifuged, and resuspended in the same medium at ∼40 × 106 cells/ml. Cell homogenates were prepared by three freeze/thaw cycles, followed by homogenization using a Dounce grinder as described previously (25Goffin V. Norman M. Martial J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1381-1392PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content was quantified by the Bradford method, and cell homogenate aliquots were frozen (−80 °C). Human PRL was iodinated using IODOGEN as reported previously (25Goffin V. Norman M. Martial J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1381-1392PubMed Google Scholar). Its specific activity was in the range of 40–50 μCi/μg. For binding assays, 150–300 μg of cell homogenate proteins, corresponding to 1–2 × 106 cells, were incubated overnight at room temperature with 20,000–40,000 cpm of125I-hPRL in the presence of increasing amounts of non-labeled WT hPRL or hPRL analogs in medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (the final reaction volume was 0.5 ml). Ion content is specified for each experiment. The assay was terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation (15 min, 15000 × g). The supernatants were aspirated carefully, and the radioactivity of the pellets was counted in a γ counter. To assess the role of divalent ions on binding affinities, we systematically added 1 mm EDTA to the condition referred to as “0 μm” zinc. The condition referred to as 25 μm zinc (or other ions) corresponds to the final concentration of divalent ion salts added into the medium (ZnCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, NiSO4, CaCl2, CuSO4). Each experimental condition (hPRL analogs, divalent ions) was tested at least three times in duplicate. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between radioactivity bound in the absence (B0, maximal binding) and in the presence (nonspecific) of 2–10 μg/ml unlabeled WT hPRL. Data are presented as percentages of specific binding. Competition curves were analyzed with the LIGAND PC program (37Munson P.J. Rodbard O. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). The relative binding affinity of each mutant was calculated as the ratio of its IC50 versus the IC50 of WT hPRL. Twenty G-418-resistant clones were isolated and grown independently, then analyzed based upon the maximal -fold induction of luciferase activity in the presence of various hPRL concentrations. This value ranged from 1-fold (no induction) up to 20-fold, and we selected the HL5 clone based on that data. As previously observed using transiently transfected cells (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the maximal activation of luciferase activity was obtained at ∼1 μg/ml of hPRL. From Scatchard analysis, this HL5 clone contains 65,000 ± 13,000 hPRL receptors/cell. Depending on the experimental conditions (ions, EDTA, analogs), the time of stimulation and the number of culture passages, the levels of luciferase -fold induction were found to vary from 10- to 30-fold. Although this induction was significantly lower than the 68-fold induction obtained by transient transfection of the same plasmids (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is sufficient for reliable comparison of dose-response curves obtained with various analogs. The low amount of FCS added in the starvation medium (0.25% FCS) to allow cell adhesion was not found to rise the background of luciferase activity in non-stimulated cells. This is in agreement with the observation that the content of lactogens in 0.25% FCS as estimated from the Nb2 assay (31Tanaka T. Shiu R.P. Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Friesen H.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) is around 0.1–0.2 ng/ml (data not shown), whereas the dose-response curve of luciferase activity in HL5 clone starts rising at >1 ng/ml hPRL. This new bioassay presents three major advantages. First, it circumvents the problem of species specificity (24Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) when testing human lactogens since it involves the human PRLR. Second, the use of a clone stably expressing bot"
https://openalex.org/W2137541935,"A class IV-type, gastric alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) has been purified from frog (Rana perezi) tissues, meaning detection of this enzyme type also in nonmammalian vertebrates. However, the protein is unique among vertebrate ADHs thus far characterized in having preference for NADP+ rather than NAD+. Similarly, it deviates structurally from other class IV ADHs and has a phylogenetic tree position outside that of the conventional class IV cluster. The NADP+ preference is structurally correlated with a replacement of Asp-223 of all other vertebrate ADHs with Gly-223, largely directing the coenzyme specificity. This residue replacement is expected metabolically to correlate with a change of the reaction direction catalyzed, from preferential alcohol oxidation to preferential aldehyde reduction. This is of importance in cellular growth regulation through retinoic acid formed from retinol/retinal precursors because the enzyme is highly efficient in retinal reduction (kcat/Km = 3.4·104 mm−1min−1). Remaining enzymatic details are also particular but resemble those of the human class I/class IV enzymes. However, overall structural relationships are distant (58–60% residue identity), and residues at substrate binding and coenzyme binding positions are fairly deviant, reflecting the formation of the new activity. The results are concluded to represent early events in the duplicatory origin of the class IV line or of a separate, class IV-type line. In both cases, the novel enzyme illustrates enzymogenesis of classes in the ADH system. The early origin (with tetrapods), the activity (with retinoids), and the specific location of this enzyme (gastric, like the gastric and epithelial location of the human class IV enzyme) suggest important functions of the class IV ADH type in vertebrates.

Höög J.-O. Alcohol Alcohol. 1995; 30: 153-161PubMed Google Scholar) and probably seven (2Kedishvili N.Y. Gough W.H. Chernoff E.A.G. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Bowman K.D. Popov K.M. Bosron W.F. Li T.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7494-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or more classes according to their enzymatic and structural properties. Notably, a similar complexity is observed also for aldehyde dehydrogenase, the next enzyme in the metabolic pathway, with twelve forms presently known in humans (3Yoshida A. Rzhetsky A. Hsu L.C. Chang C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The ADH class I forms constitute the classical enzyme responsible for the liver ethanol metabolism, whereas the ADH class III form is a ubiquitous glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Both these classes are well established in structure, variability, internal architecture, origin, and function (4Danielsson O. Atrian S. Luque T. Hjelmqvist L. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4980-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), with class III as a probable ancestor and class I reflecting a duplicatory emergence at early vertebrate times (5Danielsson O. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9247-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Remaining classes are less well known in general properties or functions. All characterized forms, however, are NAD(H)-dependent. ADH class IV exhibits a unique epithelial tissue distribution (6Boleda M.D. Julià P. Moreno A. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and is the characteristic stomach ADH, where it has been suggested to function in the first-pass metabolism of ethanol (7Haber P.S. Gentry T. Mak K.M. Mirmiran-Yazdy A.A. Greenstein R.J. Lieber C.S. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 863-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More importantly, however, class IV has been ascribed a special function, based on its high activity with retinol (8Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 9Yang Z.-N. Davis G.J. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Li T.-K. Bosron W.F. Alcohol Clin. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in the regulation of retinoic acid formation and hence in regulation of cellular growth and differentiation in vertebrates (11Ang H.L. Deltour L. Hayamizu T.F. Zgombic-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9526-9534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Duester G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Its substrate pocket has been distinguished from modeling (13Moreno A. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and crystallographic (14Xie P. Parsons S.H. Speckhard D.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) studies as different from that of class I, supporting distinct properties. It is a problem that the class IV enzyme has hitherto not been characterized outside of mammals, although ascribed a wider role in retinoid metabolism (12Duester G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). If important in that function, it would be expected to be present also in nonmammalian branches. We now report the finding of an amphibian ADH that has both gastric distribution and substrate properties like a class IV enzyme. Surprisingly, however, the amphibian enzyme has a coenzyme preference for NADP(H) instead of NAD(H). This is in contrast to all other vertebrate ADHs thus far detected of MDR (medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase) type. It has implications on the origin and function of class IV-like activities and on the physiological roles of the complex vertebrate ADH system. Stomachs from Rana perezi frogs, the same species as that previously analyzed for the class I enzyme (15Cederlund E. Peralba J.M. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), were cut, cleaned, rinsed in ice-cold, distilled water, and stored at −80 °C. Prior to analysis, the stomachs were thawed, cut into small pieces, and homogenized (1:2, w/v) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The homogenates were centrifuged at 27000 × g for 1 h. Supernatants were used for ADH activity and electrophoretic analysis. Total protein was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay method, using bovine serum albumin as standard. ADH activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C with a Cary 219 instrument at 340 nm. Initially, before knowledge of the NADP(H) preference, activities were measured in the usual manner with NAD(H) as coenzyme. However, once the NADP(H) preference had been established, the proper cofactor was used. Alcohol oxidation was then determined in 0.1 m glycine/NaOH, pH 10.0, or in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 2.4 mm NAD+ or 1.2 mm NADP+, whereas aldehyde reduction was measured in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 1.33 mm NADH or 0.17 mm NADPH. Cuvette pathlength was 0.2 cm in experiments with 1.33 mm NADH and 1 cm in all other cases. One unit of activity equals 1 μmol of cofactor transformed/min, based on an absorption coefficient of 6220m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm for NADPH. Acetaldehyde was distilled immediately before use. Kinetics with retinoids were determined as reported (10Allali-Hassani A. Peralba J.M. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Parés X. Julià P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Kinetic results were processed by using the Enzfitter data analysis program (Elsevier Biosoft). Electrophoresis on starch gel was performed as described (17Moreno A. Parés X. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1128-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel slices were stained for ADH activity with 0.1 m ethanol or 0.1 m 2-buten-1-ol as substrate. Electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed the procedure of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205522) Google Scholar) with the silver stain technique. Isoelectric focusing was performed on a Miniprotean instrument (Bio-Rad) at a pH range of 3–10, with the ADH bands detected by activity as for the starch gel electrophoresis. About 18 stomachs (14 g) were homogenized and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate/NaOH, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.5, and applied to a CM-Sepharose CL-6B column (1 × 25 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing with buffer, the enzyme was eluted with 120 ml of a linear gradient of 0–150 mm NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate/NaOH, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 6.5, and applied to an AMP-agarose column (1 × 13 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The enzyme was not adsorbed under these conditions and was eluted with a further 250 ml of buffer. Proteins that bind to the column were eliminated in this step. The active fractions were concentrated, dialyzed against 100 mmHEPES, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.5, and rechromatographed on a second AMP-agarose column equilibrated in this buffer. Then, the enzyme was adsorbed and the column was washed with buffer, before elution of the enzyme with a 250-ml linear gradient of 0–100 mm NaCl. The active fractions were concentrated and stored at −80 °C. The apparent molecular mass of the enzyme was determined by gel exclusion chromatography, using a column of Sephacryl S-300 superfine (2.5 × 89 cm) in 200 mm sodium phosphate/NaOH, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.5. The enzyme preparation was reduced and14C-carboxymethylated in 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.4m Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.1 (15Cederlund E. Peralba J.M. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After removal of reagents on Sephadex G-50 (4.6 × 250 mm) in 30% acetic acid, the protein was cleaved in five different 3-nmol batches with Asp-N, Glu-C, Lys-C proteases, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, respectively, all in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, with protease:substrate ratios from 1:10 to 1:150. Peptides obtained were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on Vydac C8 (2.1 × 250 mm) and C4 (4.6 × 250 mm) columns with acetonitrile gradients. Fractions obtained were submitted to sequencer degradations in ABI 477 and 470 instruments. Poly(A)+RNA (140 μg) was isolated from 0.6 g of frog stomach using the Poly(A)tract system (Promega). A degenerate antisense oligonucleotide primer (FROG2, 5′-YTCRAAIGCYTTRTTDATYTG-3′), corresponding to amino acid residues 360–354 determined from the protein analysis, was used for specific cDNA synthesis from 2 μg of Poly(A) RNA. The Not I primer adaptor (Promega) was used for poly(A)+ RNA cDNA synthesis. The resulting cDNAs were used as templates in polymerase chain reaction amplifications with the degenerate sense oligonucleotide FROG1 (5′-TIGCITGGGARCCICAYAARC-3′, protein residues 13–20) and the antisense FROG2. The cDNA fragment obtained was cloned in pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced (AlfExpress, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To obtain the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA, a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (19Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) was performed. For the 5′-end, nested polymerase chain reaction was performed with FROG3 (5′-AAGTGGGATTACTTTGTCAC-3′) and FROG4 (5′-TTTACACAAGTCACTCC-3′) ADH-specific antisense primers (corresponding to protein residues 92–86 and 84–79, respectively). For the 3′-end, the frog ADH-specific sense primers FROG5 (5′-GACAGGTCGGTCATTGAAAGGATC-3′) and FROG6 (5′-TTGGAGGCTTTAAAGGAGAAGAAG-3′) were used, corresponding to protein residues 310–318 and 320–328, respectively. The resulting cDNA fragments were cloned in pBluescript and sequenced. Using the amino acid sequence obtained from the protein and cDNA data, phylogenetic trees relating the new ADH structure to those of other ADHs were constructed with the program Clustal W (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54898) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of the frog stomach ADH was obtained by adopting its amino acid sequence into the known conformation of the human class Iβ ADH (21Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Hamilton J.A. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8149-8153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using the program ICM (Version 2.7, 1998, Molsoft LLC, Metuchen, NJ) by a Monte Carlo procedure for energy minimization (13Moreno A. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Coenzyme docking calculations were performed (13Moreno A. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with NADP+ placed into the frog enzyme model to occupy a position as in the class I structure, after which the model was subjected to energy minimizations. The frog stomach homogenate was found to contain two ADHs separated by starch gel electrophoresis and representing different classes. One is anodic (pI: 6.2–6.5), also detectable in the liver (Fig. 1), and corresponds to class III ADH visualized by staining for formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity in the presence of glutathione (5Danielsson O. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9247-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The second is cathodic (pI: 8.6–8.9), as a three-band pattern absent in liver (Fig. 1) and different from the class I ADH previously characterized (15Cederlund E. Peralba J.M. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This new ADH was purified to homogeneity by consecutive CM-Sepharose and two AMP-agarose chromatographies. From 14 g of gastric tissue, 22 μg of enzyme was obtained, in a 2.4% yield, with a specific activity in 0.1 m glycine/NaOH, 1 m ethanol, and 1.2 mm NADP+ of 20.9 units/mg at 25 °C. Electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide reveals a single band with an Mr of 44,000, whereas gel exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 superfine results in a single peak with an apparent Mr of ∼80,000, demonstrating a dimeric structure for the new enzyme. The enzyme preparation was14C-carboxymethylated and used for sequence analysis. After protease digestions in five different batches, high performance liquid chromatography separation of the peptides obtained, and peptide sequencer degradations, the entire amino acid sequence was obtained except for the N-terminal five-residue segment and nine other positions in total. A complicating factor was the low yield of the pure enzyme (see above) which made work with mixtures necessary. The contaminating proteins were identified as 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and a homologue to protein S 47093 (Protein Identification Resource data base, corresponding to accession number Z34285 in the EBI Data Bank), which increased the number of peptides. The ADH regions were established from 86 ADH peptides of 263 peptides analyzed from all three proteins. Based on the ADH amino acid sequence, oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as primers to amplify cDNA prepared from stomach mRNA. The cDNA and protein sequences finally obtained (Fig. 2) are deposited in the EMBL data base (accession number AJ002554). Three amino acid residues, at positions 73, 134, and 142, were found to differ between the sequences determined from the protein and the cDNA. The exchanges involve related residues only (Leu/Val, Lys/Arg, and Met/Val, respectively), corresponding to 1-base changes, and are without structural and functional consequence in the interpretations with the exception of position 142, corresponding to 141 in class I enzymes. These exchanges may well be related to the fact that several bands are detected on starch gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the new enzyme was found to have Gly at position 222 (Fig. 2), the position corresponding to 223 in the class I enzymes, which in contrast is Asp in all other vertebrate ADHs. This position is essential for coenzyme specificity (22Eklund H. Samama J.-P. Jones T.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 23: 5982-5996Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and made us investigate the kinetics with both NAD+ and NADP+. The enzyme was found to be active with both NAD+ and NADP+ but was more efficient with NADP+ as predicted by the characteristics of the coenzyme binding site with a Gly-223 (see above). The cofactor specificity was determined (Table I).Km values for NAD+ were about 10-fold those of NADP+, whereas Km with NADH was about 40-fold that with NADPH. The kcat values were similar except for NAD+/NADP+ at pH 7.5, where saturation with NAD+ was not obtained because of inhibition at high cofactor concentration. Kinetic constants for alcohols and aldehydes were therefore measured with NADP(H) as the cofactor (Table II). The enzyme was also found to be active with retinoids, measured with NADP(H) (TableIII), which is of functional interest regarding the physiological role of class IV (12Duester G.

Measurements in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.02% Tween 80. Frog stomach ADH shows high Km values and relatively high kcat values with alcohols. At pH 10, kcat for ethanol is only 1.8-fold the value at pH 7.5. In contrast, Km is higher at neutral pH than at pH 10, like with typical class IV enzymes; the Kmvalue at pH 7.5 makes ethanol a poor substrate for the frog enzyme under physiological conditions, with a very low kcat/Km value (1.7 mm−1 min−1, Table II). The enzyme is more efficient with medium- and long-chain alcohols. Aldehydes are much better substrates than the corresponding alcohols, with m-nitrobenzaldehyde being the best substrate found. The enzyme is also effective in the reduction of the lipid peroxidation aldehydes hexanal and 2-hexenal. All retinoids assayed are good substrates for the enzyme (Table III). This includes 13-cis-retinal, which is not a substrate for the human class IV enzyme (10Allali-Hassani A. Peralba J.M. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and shows little activity with other human ADH forms (9Yang Z.-N. Davis G.J. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Li T.-K. Bosron W.F. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency of the frog enzyme is much higher for the retinals than for the corresponding retinols, in contrast to the opposite behavior with the human class IV enzyme (Table III). The kcat/Km value for all-trans-retinal (33750 mm−1·min−1) is the highest reported for any known vertebrate ADH with any retinoid (8Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 9Yang Z.-N. Davis G.J. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Li T.-K. Bosron W.F. Alcohol Clin. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Except for the remarkable NADP(H) specificity, the ADH from frog stomach exhibits general enzymatic features similar to those of mammalian class IV ADH. Km for alcohols in many cases has values intermediate between those of the human (23Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B. Peralba J.M. Allali-Hassam A. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and rodent (24Julià P. Farrés J. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) class IV enzymes, whereas the frog enzyme exhibits lower Kmvalues for aldehydes. The effect of the Asp/Gly exchange at position 223 (this and subsequent numbers refer to the ADH class I positions) was evaluated by modeling the present enzyme into the structure of the human class Iβ enzyme, and by subsequent docking calculations with NADP+. Similarly, a model with Asp-223 was used for docking evaluations. The modeling results show an active site similar to those in classes I and IV, consistent with the substrate specificity. The functionally important positions are compared in TableIV. The docking results (Fig.3) demonstrate that NADP+fits nicely into the coenzyme binding pocket when position 223 has Gly and that NADP+ binding is impaired with Asp-223 because of close contacts. The docking experiments are, therefore, compatible with the notion that this Asp/Gly exchange at position 223 offers a major structural explanation to the altered coenzyme specificity for NADP+ of the frog stomach enzyme versus that of all other vertebrate ADHs characterized. Asp-223 forms hydrogen bonds with the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the adenosine ribose of the coenzyme in the class I enzymes (22Eklund H. Samama J.-P. Jones T.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 23: 5982-5996Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar), conferring their specificity for NAD+ over NADP+ (25Fan F. Lorenzen J.A. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6397-6401Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The carboxylate of Asp-223 sterically and electrostatically disfavors binding of NADP+ because of the cofactor 2′-phosphate, whereas Gly-223 provides the space necessary for NADP+. The presence of hydrophilic nearby residues (Thr-224 and His-225), also unique to the present enzyme, further favors the binding of the extra phosphate.

Residue exchanges affecting substrate interactions concern several positions (Table IV). One is position 294, where a large residue, Leu-294, is consistent with a Km for ethanol (600 mm) lower than that of the rat class IV enzyme (Km: 2.4 m; Ala-294) (23Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B.

However, the human class IV enzyme with Val-294 exhibits an even lower Km (37 mm), suggesting that other exchanges also, such as that at residue 116 (Table IV), are important to explain differences in Km values for ethanol. Position 48 constitutes another position important for the space. The present enzyme has Ser-48, versus Thr in mammalian class Iγ and mammalian class IV. Despite the extra space in the active site provided by the smaller volume of Ser, secondary alcohols are poor substrates for the frog enzyme, kcat/Km for n-butanol is 1500-fold the value for 2-butanol (Table II). The present enzyme has Gly-117, like class I, but in contrast to the deletion at position 117 in the mammalian class IV enzymes, where the deletion has been interpreted to open the active site entra"

The IF-Cbl complex is degraded in lysosomes of epithelial cells of the intestine whereupon the vitamin enters portal blood associated with TC.

Acta. 1996; 1292: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The available amount of pure TC is insufficient for investigations requiring high protein quantities. An expression system has been established for IF and TC in insect cells (19Gordon M. Chokshi H. Alpers D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Quadros E.V. Sai P. Rothenberg S.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the recombinant proteins were obtained at the level of 10–100 μg. We have expressed and purified recombinant bovine TC from transformed yeast Pichia pastoris. The biological activity of the recombinant TC was confirmed by its binding to Cbl as well as to the specific receptor in the membranes of placenta. The protein sequence and the location of the intramolecular S–S bridges have been established. Spectral properties of TC-Cbl with different Co2+-coordinated groups pointed to significant deformations in the Cbl molecule and/or to its shielding from the environment when bound to TC. All salts and materials for media were purchased from Merck, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sigma, and Difco. The enzymes and kits for DNA handling were obtained from New England Biolabs , Stratagene, and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the kit for polymerase chain reaction was from HT Biotechnology LTD. Membranes for screening were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Schleicher & Schuell. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by DNA technology. The yeast expression system was purchased from Invitrogen. The affinity matrix ProBond and anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) as well as Fast Flow CM-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) have been used during the protein purification. TC was isolated from bovine milk according to the method described earlier (10Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Nexø E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 100 μg of protein was treated with 2 μg of trypsin in 100 μl of 0.04 m NH3HCO3 at 37 °C for 4 h. The peptides in 200 μl of 0.5% heptafluorobutyric acid were applied to an HPLC column and separated by elution with a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile in 0.5% heptafluorobutyric acid. Sequence of the peptides was performed on Protein Sequencer 477A (Perkin-Elmer). Purification of rabbit TC was carried out according to the method described elsewhere (21Nexø E. Olesen H. Bucher D. Thomsen J. Biochim. Boiphys. Acta. 1977; 494: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TC-specific oligonucleotides (20-mers) were synthesized on the basis of the amino acid sequence of the bovine TC fragments: NI(C)EITE, (C)VHQKRV, GYFGNVY, KSYVDLI, and EDILKNA. Human TC-cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. E. V. Quadros. The sequence of oligonucleotides for β-actin (a control of RNA quantity on a Northern blot) was deduced from comparison of the conservative stretches in cDNAs of different species: CAACGGCTCCGGCATGTGCA, CCGGCTTCGCGGGCGACGAT, AAGATGACCCAGATCATGTT, and GATGATGATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGTC. A mammary gland cDNA library cloned in vector λgt11 (CLONTECH) was plated and screened with a32P-labeled human TC cDNA probe according to the standard procedure (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 1.01-7.7.23Google Scholar). Positive clones were propagated and then rescreened with 32P-labeled bovine TC oligonucleotides corresponding to different stretches in the sequence. It resulted in identification and isolation of two cDNA clones with long overlapping TC fragments. They were subcloned into the Eco RI site of the Bluescript KS-II plasmid (Stratagene) and sequenced on ABI-Prism Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). Total RNA was isolated from different bovine tissues by ultracentrifugation in CsCl and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane according to the standard recommendations (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 1.01-7.7.23Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed with a32P-labeled bovine TC cDNA probe and the probe for β-actin. The bands were visualized after exposure with intensifying screen for 2 weeks at −70 °C. The cDNA encoding the mature TC was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pBS-TC construction using the primers with Not I and Spe I adaptors. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated at Not I and Spe I sites to the expression plasmid pPICZα-LB. It was derived in our laboratory from pPICαA (Invitrogen) by introduction of the Myc sequence, a His tag, and a factor Xa cleavage site before the protein sequence, for more details see “Results.” The expression scheme followed the general recommendations of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The verified pPIC-TC construction was linearized inside the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter by treatment with endonuclease Nsi I. The methanol-metabolizing Mut+ strain SMD 1168 of P. pastoris was transformed by electroporation and plated. The cell line with the highest level of TC synthesis was established during trial expressions. The recombinant yeast was grown for 2 days in 1 liter of buffered glycerol complex medium supplemented with 1% casamino acids and 0.5 μm aqua Cbl. Then, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 liter of induction medium (buffered methanol complex medium) containing the same additives and 1% methanol. The growth was continued for 24 h. Afterward, the suspension was centrifuged, and the cell-free supernatant was used for isolation of the recombinant bovine TC. Proteins in the obtained supernatant were precipitated by ammonium sulfate at 70% of saturation. The pellet was dissolved in 20 ml of 0.02 mPi buffer, pH 7.5, and the protein solution was dialyzed against 3 liters of the same buffer overnight at 5 °C. Then, TC was adsorbed on 2 ml of CM-Sepharose at room temperature and washed in the column by increasing concentrations of Pi buffer: 0.02m, 0.05 m, 0.1 m (pH 7.5). The protein was eluted with 2 ml of 0.5 m Pibuffer, pH 7.5, and the collected sample contained approximately 1 mg of the fusion protein mHX-TC. The sample was treated with 30 μg of factor Xa for 30 h at 37 °C to remove the service peptides from the N terminus. The preparation was applied to a 250-ml Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris, 1m NaCl, pH 8.0, at room temperature. The eluted fractions with maximal specific Cbl adsorption at 362 nm were pooled, dialyzed against 0.02 m Pi buffer, pH 7.5, and concentrated by adsorption on a small CM-Sepharose column (0.3 ml) as described above. The final preparation was stored frozen. The spectra of TC-Cbl were recorded on a M350 double beam spectrophotometer (Camspec). The TC concentration was measured at 205 nm according to the peptide bond adsorption (23Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and used for estimation of an approximate extinction coefficient of TC-Cbl-OH2 at 362 nm:E362(mg/ml) ≈ 0.65 (ε362≈ 30,000 m−1 cm−1). Substitution of the Co2+-coordinated β-group (H2O) in Cbl-OH2 and TC-Cbl-OH2 by azide was followed according to the spectral changes developing at 37 °C in 0.5 m Pi buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of different concentrations of sodium azide. The amplitudes (A363 − A330) were plotted versus time to calculate the maximal values at t → ∞. Substitution of β-H2O in TC-Cbl-OH2 by cyanide was carried out for 5 h under analogous conditions in the presence of 10 mm KCN. The excess of KCN was removed by dialysis. The amount of TC-bound Cbl was measured either by the extinction coefficient ε362 ≈ 30,000m−1 cm−1 (see “Spectral Measurements”) or by the isotope dilution method (24Nexø E. Gimsing P. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1981; 41: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) employing human IF as the binding protein. Concentration of apoTC was determined by incubation with an excess of [57Co]Cbl followed by adsorption of unbound radioactive ligand on hemoglobin-coated charcoal (25Gottlieb C. Lau K-S. Wasserman L.R. Herbert W. Blood. 1965; 25: 875-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed in an albumin solution containing 1 m NaCl to prevent artificial adsorption of bovine TC-[57Co]Cbl on charcoal. Recombinant bovine TC was depleted of endogenous Cbl by dialysis against 8 m urea as described earlier (10Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Nexø E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Nexø E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16082-16087Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and Cbl binding capacity in the obtained preparation was measured. The preparation of apoTC (1 nm) was exposed to 0.9 nm [57Co]Cbl in the incubation solution (0.1m Pi buffer, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml human serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, the sample was diluted 1:1 with the same buffer (with or without 1 μm unlabeled cyano-Cbl) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 h. The remaining protein-associated [57Co]Cbl was measured as a function of time. The radioactive tracer, containing partially purified human TC-[57Co]Cbl, was displaced from the receptor in the membranes of human placenta by different concentrations of bovine and rabbit TC-Cbl as described elsewhere (26Nexø E. Hollenberg M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 628: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the initial step, 0.5 mg of the protein in 1 ml was dialyzed against 100 ml of 8 m urea, 0.2 m Tris, pH 8, at room temperature for 2 days with one change to remove the endogenous Cbl. Radioactive iodoacetate was added for determination of possible free SH groups, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h. Urea and iodoacetate were removed by dialysis against 1 liter of 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, for 48 h with one change. The final dialyzing buffer was 0.1 macetate-pyridine, pH 6.5, whereupon the denatured TC (expected to retain the original pattern of S–S bridges) was subjected to digestion with 60 μg of thermolysin (50 °C, 4 h). The peptide mixture was separated by HPLC, and the fractions containing disulfide bonds were identified by amino acid analysis after performic acid oxidation. The detected fractions were additionally purified by HPLC, sequenced on Protein Sequencer 477A (Perkin-Elmer), and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry on BiflexTM (Bruker-Frauzer Analytik) (see Ref. 27Rasmussen J.T. Berglund L. Rasmussen M.S. Petersen T.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar for more details). TC-bound Cbl was converted to its cyano form (see “Spectral Measurements”) to prevent coordination of dithiothrietol in the form of R–S− to Co2+. Then, the sample was treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 3 h at 37 °C and dialyzed for 24 h at room temperature against 0.5 mPi buffer, pH 7.5, with 5 mm dithiothreitol. Analogous procedure was carried out with the control sample where the additive was H2O. Absorbance spectra were recorded after dialysis in both preparations. The cDNA of TC was cloned from a bovine mammary gland cDNA library and the deduced amino acid sequence of bovine TC is depicted in Fig.1. The sequence showed 71% identity with human TC, whereas similarity with HC and IF from different sources varied in the range 21–25%. Bovine TC was characterized by a positive net charge +10 because of a high number of Arg and Lys residues. The net charge of human TC was, on the contrary, negative (−6). Peptides, obtained after trypsin cleavage of the native TC-Cbl from bovine milk, showed sequences identical to those predicted by cDNA. High recovery of the peptides was observed for the protein domains 16–41 and 285–347. Northern blot analysis was performed using both the TC-specific and β-actin radioactive probes (Fig. 2). The highest expression of TC-mRNA (≈1.9 kilobases) was associated with bovine kidney followed by lymphatic nodes and the liver, whereas bovine mammary gland contained a relatively low amount of TC-mRNA. Bovine TC was expressed as a fusion protein mHX-TC and was detected by Western blot employing an anti-Myc antibody (Fig.3 A). No TC expression was found when the incubation media did not contain Cbl (data not shown). Coomassie Blue staining of the crude cell-free supernatant after SDS-electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) revealed two major bands of 50 and 46 kDa, which were present in the partially purified CM-Sepharose fractions as well (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). N-terminal sequences showed that the 50-kDa protein corresponded to the immunoreactive form mHX-TC as detected by anti-Myc antibody and the 46-kDa band corresponded to the mature TC. The 50-kDa protein was still visible in the cell-free supernatant passed through CM-Sepharose (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). The final product was obtained after cleavage of mHX fragment by factor Xa, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200, and concentration on CM-Sepharose. The preparation consisted mainly of a 46-kDa TC (Fig.3 B, lane 4). Still, the N-terminal sequence revealed the presence of two subforms: NI(C)EITEVD … and IEGRNI(C)EI …(the TC residues are underlined). The yield of the recombinant TC corresponded to 0.5–1 mg from 1 liter of the incubation medium. The absorbance spectra showed that the γ-peak in the free aqua Cbl (352 nm) shifted to longer wavelength (362 nm) and intensified after binding to TC (Fig.4 A). Conversion of TC-bound Cbl to its cyano form caused additional amplification of the γ-peak. The same effects were observed earlier for human TC-Cbl (18Quadros E.V. Rothenberg S.P. Pan Y.C. Stein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15455-15460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit TC-Cbl (21Nexø E. Olesen H. Bucher D. Thomsen J. Biochim. Boiphys. Acta. 1977; 494: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The preparation contained 1 mol of the endogenous Cbl/mol of the protein as judged from the absorbance ratio, A280/A362 ≈ 2, attributed to the saturated Cbl binders (17VanKapel J. Loef B.G. Lindemans J. Abels J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 676: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Quadros E.V. Rothenberg S.P. Pan Y.C. Stein S. J. Biol.

The stability of the TC-Cbl complex was analyzed according to the rate constant of its decomposition. A slow exponential decay of TC-Cbl* (Fig.5 A) was observed with the rate constant k ≈ 1.6 × 10−4min−1 at 37 °C. The recombinant bovine TC, saturated with Cbl, was able to bind to the specific TC receptor in membranes of human placenta (2Rothenberg S.P. Quadros E.V. Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1995; 8: 499-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Nexø E. Kräutler B. Angoni D. Golding B.T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins.

A, liberation of the radioactive ligand (Cbl*) from TC-Cbl* at 37 °C. Remaining concentration of TC-Cbl* was followed in time in the presence of a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled vitamin B12 (○) or without additives (▵). Subtraction of the first chart from the second reveals appearance of free Cbl* in the medium (•). The dependence of TC-Cbl* and Cbl* on time was fitted by equations: 0.43 × exp(−0.00017t) and 0.12 + 0.44 × (1 − exp(−0.000155t)), respectively. The rate constant of Cbl* liberation can be estimated as k ≈ 1.6 × 10−4 min−1. B, binding of the recombinant bovine TC-Cbl (▴) and rabbit TC-Cbl (⋄) to the TC-specific receptor in the membranes of human placenta. The assayed proteins displaced the radioactive tracer from the receptor at increasing concentrations of bovine TC-Cbl (bTC) and rabbit TC-Cbl (rTC).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) No free SH groups were detected in the denaturated TC as judged from the lack of an incorporated HOOCCH2 group after treatment with iodoacetate. Three pairs of the peptides connected with S–S bonds were obtained after separation of thermolysin-digested TC by HPLC. Analysis by mass spectrometry and amino acid sequence identified these peptides as: 1) NI(C) and LGTA(C), 2) FS(C) and L(C), and 3) LRAN(C)EF and ISPD(C)QA. The location of the S–S bridges along the TC sequence is shown in Fig. 6. A number of peptides were purified after treatment of the native TC isolated from bovine milk with trypsin. The following Cys-containing fragments co-eluted during HPLC: 1–15 and 218–254, 96–104 and 285–298, and 134–160 and 161–199. It indirectly testifies that they are bound together, and the pattern of S–S bridges in the native TC is the same as in the recombinant TC. Intact S–S bonds are required for retention of Cbl in the TC-Cbl complex. Dialysis of TC-Cbl-CN against dithiothreitol-containing buffer was accompanied by the removal of the endogenous Cbl, Fig.4 A. We investigated the exchange of the original Co2+-coordinated β-group (H2O) with an external ligand in TC-Cbl. Sodium azide was chosen as a possible probe for the “base-on” and “base-off” structure of Cbl (29Kräutler B. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1998: 3-43Google Scholar). Significant perturbations in the spectrum of the protein-bound Cbl upon azide coordination, accompanied by the appearance of a γ2-peak, are believed to be an evidence in favor of the base-off structure of Cbl (28Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Firth R.A. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Williams R.J.P. Jackson W.R. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2178-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Conversion of the TC-Cbl spectrum during substitution of endogenous β-H2O by external N3−developed exponentially in time (Fig. 4 B). The amplitude and t12 of the reaction increased at high concentration of azide: t12 = 15 min at N3− = 0.5 mm, t12 = 60 min at N3−= 10–70 mm (37 °C). Strong expression of the γ2-peak at 343 nm was achieved at saturating concentrations of azide. The observed process was consistent with the two step scheme where the first stage is shifted to the left (k−1/k+1 > 50) and is rate-limiting.TC­Cbl­OH2⇄k−1k+1TC­Cbl′⇄k−2k+2×N3−TC­Cbl­N3SCHEME1The form TC-Cbl′ corresponds to an intermediate capable of azide binding. Increasing concentrations of N3− reverse the balance in favor of TC-Cbl-N3, and it takes a longer time to accomplish equilibration at high N3−. The scheme simplifies to TC-Cbl-OH2 → TC-Cbl-N3 at saturating concentration of azide when the measured rate coefficient kobs = 0.012 min−1 should be close to k+1. The amplitude of the spectral changes (calculated for t → ∞) depended hyperbolically on azide concentration with the apparent dissociation constant Kd = 0.84 mm (Fig.4 D). The analogous experiment was performed with protein-free Cbl-OH2, which has a predominant base-on structure in water solution (29Kräutler B. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1998: 3-43Google Scholar). The response to the added azide occurred immediately after mixing of the reagents (t12 < 0.1 min) for all concentrations used (Fig. 4 C). The amplitude changes were much less than those for TC-Cbl, and the half-effect occurred already at N3− ≈ 0.06 mm. It was comparable to concentration of the binding sites, Cbl = 0.036 mm, and required a fit according to the “square root” equation (31Fedosov S.N. Belousova L.V. Plesner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1153: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with Kd = 0.046 mm. A TC-cDNA was obtained from a bovine mammary gland cDNA library and used for expression of the recombinant TC in yeast. The choice of the cDNA library was based on our previous observation of a high TC concentration in bovine milk (3 nm) when compared with bovine plasma (0.2 nm) (10Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Nexø E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, synthesis of the TC-mRNA in bovine mammary glands was lower than in other tissues, especially kidney, lymphatic nodes, and liver (Fig.2 A). This may suggest that TC in bovine milk does not originate from mammary glands but is transported from blood to the milk through the mammary gland epithelium.

Our data sustain conserved structure of four regions, II, III, IV, and V, according to the nomenclature used by Li et al. (33Li N. Seetharam S. Lindemans J. Alpers D.H. Arwert F. Seetharam B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All these segments are situated in the middle part of the sequence (Fig. 6) and may be responsible for Cbl binding. It is interesting that the nonconservative domains in bovine TC were particularly susceptible to trypsin (Fig. 6), suggesting that these regions are exposed to the external medium. Recombinant bovine TC was successfully expressed in yeast and the pattern of the disulfide bridges was established (Fig. 6). The organization of S–S bonds in the recombinant bovine TC was identical to that deduced for the natural TC from bovine milk. The six Cys residues, found in bovine TC and involved in S–S bonding, were present in three known IFs (36Hewitt J.E. Gordon M.M. Taggart R.T. Mohandas T.K. Alpers D.H.

Positions of these residues along the sequences varied insignificantly, and one can assume the pattern of S–S bonds between six of the Cys-residues (Cys1-Cys5, Cys2-Cys6, Cys3-Cys4) to be general for all Cbl binders. The absence of free SH groups in human IF (39Allen R.H. Mehlman C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3660-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supports the above suggestion. Three S–S bridges between the distant Cys residues embrace the possible sites of Cbl binding and may ensure extraordinary stability of the Cbl-protein complexes observed for TC, IF, and HC (1Allen R.H.

Liberation of the endogenous Cbl from bovine TC in the presence of an S–S reducing compound demonstrates functional importance of the disulfide bonds. The absorbance spectra of TC-Cbl treated with azide gave some evidence for a significant deformation in the Cbl molecule when bound to bovine TC. Remarkable perturbations in the typical absorbance spectrum of Cbl, evoked by coordination of azide to Co2+ in the upper axial position (β), are believed to be associated with substitution of dimethylbenzimidazol in the lower axial position (α) by another ligand (28Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Firth R.A. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Williams R.J.P. Jackson W.R.

Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1998: 3-43Google Scholar), which is supposed to be important for stabilization and destabilization of the functional β-group during catalysis. Disruption or weakening of the dimethylbenzimidazol–Co2+ bond may also take place in bovine TC-Cbl. The binding of Cbl to bovine TC decreased the mobility of the β-group in the Cbl molecule according to velocities of H2O ↔ azide exchange. A similar effect had been observed for another protein HC-Cbl (40Brown K.L. Brooks H.B. Behnke D. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6737-6741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Frisbie S.M. Chance M.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13886-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mechanism of protein-enforced partial immobilization of the β-group is not clear. The Cbl-binding proteins can, for example, poise some “β-stable” conformation of Cbl and restrict its transition to another “β-mobile” structure. One cannot exclude complete encapsulation of Cbl inside the protein molecule when the “open” conformation of TC-Cbl is unfavorable. Both suggestions can be described by Scheme 1, and clarification of this question requires some additional work. Anyway, the physiological role of such a protection is consistent with safe transportation of the active cofactor when circulating in blood bound to TC and HC. Another observation concerns the affinity of different β-groups to the TC-Cbl complex. Thus, the ability of azide to compete with water significantly decreased after the binding of Cbl to TC (Fig. 4 C), which may suggest Co2+-coordinated H2O to be more preferable than Co2+-coordinated N3−. In conclusion, we have expressed functional bovine TC in yeast P. pastoris and performed structural and functional analysis of the isolated recombinant protein. The established pattern of S–S bridges in bovine TC seems to be general for other known Cbl carriers. Protective influence of TC, imposed on Co2+-coordinated upper group of Cbl, was revealed during H2O ↔ azide exchange. The process was accompanied by essential spectral perturbations presumably caused by significant deformations of Cbl bound to bovine TC. We greatly appreciate the perfect technical assistance of M. S. Rasmussen and A. L. Christensen. We are grateful to A. Madsen, MD Foods Research and Development Center, Brabrand, Denmark for the supply of bovine milk samples."

Stoichiometric inhibition by P35 is correlated with cleavage of its reactive site loop (RSL) and formation of a stable P35·caspase complex through a novel but undefined mechanism. The P35 crystal structure predicts that the RSL associates with the β-sheet core of P35 positioning the caspase cleavage site at the loop's apex. Here we demonstrate that proper interaction between the RSL and the β-sheet core is critical for caspase inhibition, but not cleavage. Disruption of RSL interaction with the β-sheet by substituting hydrophobic residues of the RSL's transverse helix α1 with destabilizing charged residues caused loss of caspase inhibition, without affecting P35 cleavage. Restabilization of the helix/sheet interaction by charge compensation from within the β-sheet partially restored anti-caspase potency.

Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). P35 is a substrate-inhibitor in which cleavage at Asp87 and the formation of a stoichiometric complex with the target caspase are correlated with protease inhibition. However, the molecular mechanism of caspase inactivation and the basis for P35's potency among diverse caspases is unknown. The 2.2-Å crystal structure of P35 (299 residues) has provided insight into its anti-caspase mechanism (23Fisher A. dela Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The main core of P35 is an eight-stranded β-sheet which serves as a scaffold for adjacent functional domains (Fig. 1). The first half of P35 constitutes a β-barrel with two insertions. The largest insertion forms a solvent-exposed loop (residues 59 to 99), designated the reactive site loop (RSL),1 which protrudes above the central β-sheet and contains the caspase recognition site (84DQMD↓G88). The RSL begins with an amphipathic α-helix (α1) that traverses the β-sheet. After α1, the RSL turns upward, placing the cleavage residue Asp87 at the apex, and then extends downward to rejoin the β-barrel. The crystal structure predicts that the spatial orientation of the RSL is determined in part by its interactions with the notably flat β-sheet and the juxtaposed hairpin loop (Fig. 1). Current evidence indicates that the RSL plays a critical role in P35 function. Substitution of RSL residue Asp87 abrogated P35 cleavage and caused loss of caspase inhibition (7Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), thereby demonstrating the requirement of the P1 residue for cleavage and anti-caspase activity. Two codon Ala-Ser insertions that altered the size and conformation of the RSL also disrupted P35 anti-apoptotic activity (7Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, targeted disruption of the RSL helix α1 by substitution V71P caused loss of caspase-3 inhibition in vitro, but did not prevent cleavage by the target caspase (23Fisher A. dela Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, mutagenic distortion of the RSL converted P35 from a substrate-inhibitor to an efficient, but non-inhibitory substrate. Collectively, these findings suggested that the P35 RSL participates in both pre- and post-cleavage inhibitory events. To determine the contribution of the RSL to anti-caspase activity and thereby define the molecular mechanism of P35, we investigated the functional significance of predicted interactions between the RSL and the β-sheet core. Our genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that RSL helix α1 interacts with the main β-sheet of P35. Disruption of this interaction abrogated caspase inhibition, but not P35 cleavage. Restoration of interaction increased anti-caspase potency. Thus, proper association of the RSL with the main core of P35 is required for caspase inhibition. We also report for the first time that RSL interaction with the P35 core can occur by intra- and intermolecular mechanisms and likely accounts for the existence of P35 oligomers in vivo. Collectively, our data support a model wherein the RSL adopts a distinct spatial configuration that promotes post-cleavage events that stabilize P35-caspase association and inactivate the target caspase. The Hin dIII-Bam HI fragment of p35 from pPRM−35K-ORF (24Hershberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J.

Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate p35KORF-Nde I-Stop. Mutations in p35 were generated in either plasmid p35KORF-hr5+-Nde I-Not I by using the Kunkel method (25Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) or plasmid p35KORF-Nde I-Stop by using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction with complementary primers. Mutagenic oligonucleotides (altered nucleotides underlined) used to generate each mutation included: I15D, 5′-CACCTGACAATCTCGGATATCCGTCTGGGACACGTC-3′; ca22, 5′-CTCTCTGGTTTGTTTGGCCACCTGACAATCTCG-3′; ca41, 5′-AACATCATGAGAACGGGCGCCGTCAATTGCGTGTTCAT-3′; I67K, 5′-TTGCGCGACAGAAAAAAATCAAAAGTGGATGAACAATTT-3′ and 5′-AAATTGTTCATCCACTTTTGATTTTTTTCTGTCGCGCAA-3′; I67Y, 5′-AATTTGCGCGACAGATATAAATCAAAAGTCGAT-3′ and 5′-ATCGACTTTTGATTTATATCTGTCGCGCAAATT-3′; V71K, 5′-AGAATAAAATCAAAAAAGGATGAACAATTTGAT-3′ and 5′-ATCAAATTGTTCATCCTTTTTTGATTTTATTCT-3′. All nucleotide substitutions were verified by DNA sequencing.

Thompkins G.L. McCawley P. In Vitro. 1977; 13: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) was propagated at 27 °C in TC100 growth medium that contained 2.6% tryptose broth and 10% fetal bovine serum. For infections, cell monolayers were inoculated with the indicated plaque-forming units per cell. After 1 h, the inoculum was replaced with fresh growth medium, and the cells were incubated at 27 °C. Ac M NPV (L1 strain) recombinant vP35HA-His carrying an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope- and C-terminal His6-tagged p35 inserted under control of the Ac M NPV p10 promoter was generated by standard gene replacement procedures (6Hershberger P.A. Dickson J.A. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5525-5533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A transplacement vector was constructed by inserting a 92-base pair Bgl II fragment containing the p10 minimal promoter into the Bgl II site downstream from the p35 promoter of plasmid p35KORF-hr5+ ΔTAAG (24Hershberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA, inserted after P35 residue 205) and the C-terminal His6 tag were inserted into p35 from plasmids described previously (7Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant transplacement vector was used to insert p35 HA -His into the p35 locus of recombinant virus vΔ35K/lacZ (6Hershberger P.A. Dickson J.A. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5525-5533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by homologous recombination. The identity of recombinant vP35HA-His was verified by restriction analyses of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA of plaque-purified virus. The virus vP35 (previously called vΔ35K/poly-p35) expressed p35 from the polyhedrin promoter and was described elsewhere (24Hershberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic activity of wild-type and mutated P35 was measured by marker rescue in which integration of a functional plasmid-borne p35 restores replication of the p35-deletion mutant vΔ35K/lacZ in apoptosis-sensitive SF21 cells (7Bertin J.

In brief, SF21 cells were transfected in triplicate with plasmid p35KORF-hr5+containing wild-type or mutated p35 by using cationic liposomes (Lipofectin; Life Technologies, Inc.) or DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate)). Transfected cells were infected 16 h later with vΔ35K/lacZ (0.5 plaque forming units/cell). Extracellular virus was collected 3 days later and titered by plaque assay using SF21 cells with 100 μg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside per ml. Blue lacZ-expressing plaques representing rescued, nonapoptotic virus containing functional p35 were counted. Recombinant C-terminal, His6-tagged human caspase 3 (23Fisher A. dela Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and baculovirus P35-His6 (wild-type or mutated) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) by using the pET 22(+)b vector (Novagen). Proteins were purified by nickel (Ni2+) affinity chromatography as described previously (7Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J.

Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel analysis indicated that the proteins, except V71K-P35-His6, were >95% pure. Protein concentrations were measured by using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine IgG (Sigma) as a protein standard. Impurities that affected V71K-P35-His6 concentration determination were corrected by normalizing mutated P35 proteins to wild-type P35 by staining polyacrylamide gels with SYPRO Orange fluorimetric dye (Molecular Probes) and quantitation of protein bands with the Fluorimager 575 (Molecular Dynamics). For inhibition assays, increasing concentrations of wild-type or mutated P35-His6 were mixed with purified caspase-3-His6 (200 fmol) using reaction conditions described previously (7Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fisher A. dela Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L.

After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the tetrapeptide substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (Peptides International) was added to 10 μm and the accumulation of fluorescent product (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 465 nm) was monitored using a Biolumin 960 Kinetic Fluorescence/Absorbance microplate reader (Molecular Dynamics). Values are the averages of duplicate or triplicate assays and are reported as the rate of product formation obtained from the linear portion of the reaction curves within the first 10% of substrate depletion. For cleavage assays, purified P35-His6 (80 or 160 pmol) and caspase-3 (20 pmol) were mixed in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose and incubated at 27 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis using SDS, 10–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels followed by staining with colloidal Coomassie G-250 (Z axis). The Nde I-Bam HI fragment of p35KORF-Nde I-Stop was inserted into the yeast two-hybrid vectors pAS1 and pACTII (generously provided by S. Elledge). The resulting plasmids, pAS1-p35 and pACTII-p35, encoded proteins DBD-P35 and AD-P35 in which the Gal4 DNA-binding or activation domain, respectively, was fused to P35 residues 1 to 299. The indicated p35 mutations were inserted into plasmids pAS1-p35 or pACTII-p35. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 (MATa, his3–200, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, URA3::GAL- lacZ, LYS2::GAL-HIS3) was transformed with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using the lithium acetate-heat shock method (27Schietsl R.H.

Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), in which replica colonies were transferred to filter circles (Whatman #1), permeabilized by submersion in liquid N2, and incubated overnight in Z-Buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) containing 0.35 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside/ml. Liquid β-galactosidase activity was determined using the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (29Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Reported values are expressed in standard units (30Miller J.H. CSH Laboratory Press.

To determine the intracellular stability of mutated DBD-P35, transformed yeast were grown in selective medium, collected during log phase by centrifugation (4,000 × g), and suspended in 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 1% SDS. The cells were vortexed with 1 volume of glass beads (425–600 mm, Sigma) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), boiled, and clarified by centrifugation (4,000 × g). Equivalent amounts of total protein, as determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay, were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-P35 (α-P35NF) serum (see below). Proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes (NitroME, Micro Separations Inc.). The blots were blocked in 5% non-fat milk and incubated 1 h with a 1:10,000 dilution of α-P35NF serum (24Hershberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by 1 h with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Pierce) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. P35HAHis was detected by using a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-HA serum (BabCo) followed by a 1:10,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Proteins were imaged by using colorimetric substrates as described previously (24Hershberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SF21 cells were harvested 43 h after infection with recombinant baculoviruses vP35HA-His and vP35 and ruptured by repetitive freeze-thaw cycles. Clarified lysates (16,000 × g) were mixed with Ni2+-conjugated agarose beads (Novagen) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl) for 3 h at 16 °C. After washing with binding buffer containing 30 mm imidazole, bound proteins were eluted with binding buffer containing 1 m imidazole and subjected to immunoblot analysis by using α-P35NF and α-HA sera. For cross-linking, affinity purified P35HA-His or chicken egg albumin (Sigma) were mixed with glutaraldehyde (Acros) to give final glutaraldehyde concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1%. After 30 min at room temperature, the reactions were quenched with 350 mm Tris (pH 7.8). The products were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS, 4–20% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting with α-P35NF or by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Stained gels and immunoblots were scanned at a resolution of 300 dots/inch using a Hewlett Packard ScanJetIIcx. The resulting files were printed from Adobe Photoshop 3.0 and Illustrator 7.0 using a Tektronics Phaser 450 dye sublimation printer. Stoichiometric inhibition of caspases by P35 includes cleavage of the RSL at Asp87, the P1 residue located at the apex of the loop. The transverse helix α1 (residues 63 to 75) is an essential component of the RSL, and may contribute to proper positioning of the cleavage site. The P35 crystal structure (23Fisher A. dela Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggests that α1 interacts with the β-sheet core (Fig.1). The nonpolar residues on the bottom of α1 are accommodated by the hydrophobic environment provided by nonpolar residues of the β-sheet. Conversely, the charged or polar residues comprising the top side of α1 are solvent exposed (Fig.2 A). To investigate the significance of the interaction between α1 and the β-sheet, we tested the effect of site-specific mutations within these domains on P35 anti-caspase activity. To disrupt α1/β-sheet association, hydrophobic residues Ile67 and Val71 comprising the underlying face of α1 (Fig. 2 A) were substituted with either lysine or tyrosine. The anti-apoptotic activity of I67K-, I67Y-, or V71K-mutated P35 was first determined by marker rescue. In this assay, anti-apoptotic function is measured by the capacity of the mutated P35 to block apoptosis and thereby restore replication of a p35-deletion mutant virus in cultured, apoptosis-sensitive SF21 cells (6Hershberger P.A. Dickson J.A. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5525-5533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither I67K-P35 nor V71K-P35 exhibited anti-apoptotic activity in vivo (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the function of I67Y-P35 was comparable to that of wild-type P35. Thus, substitution of either Ile67 or Val71 with a positively charged residue disrupted P35 function, whereas substitution with an aromatic residue had no effect. These data suggested that the hydrophobic interaction between α1 and the β-sheet is required for P35 function. Consistent with this interpretation, charged-to-alanine substitutions (Fig. 2 B) of α1 solvent-exposed residues had no effect on P35 function in vivo (7Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether loss of P35 function was due to loss of caspase inhibition, we measured the capacity of I67K-P35 and V71K-P35 to inhibit purified recombinant human caspase-3 (CPP32). Each mutated P35 was purified as a C-terminal His6 fusion protein after overexpression in E. coli and tested in dose-dependent caspase inhibition assays that used the tetrapeptide DEVD-amc as substrate (Fig.3 A). As expected (7Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fisher A. dela Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), wild-type P35 stoichiometrically inhibited caspase-3, whereas D87A-P35 which lacks the requisite cleavage residue Asp87 failed to affect caspase-3 activity at all concentrations. V71K-P35 was as ineffective as D87A-P35 in inhibiting caspase-3 (Fig. 3 A). Likewise, I67K-P35 had significantly reduced (>10-fold) anti-caspase activity when compared with wild-type P35. In contrast, caspase-3 inhibition by I67Y-P35 was comparable to that of wild-type P35, a finding consistent with its normal anti-apoptotic function in vivo. Thus, the loss-of-function phenotype of P35 carrying the α1 lysine substitutions was correlated with loss of anti-caspase activity. To determine whether I67K-P35 and V71K-P35 were recognized as caspase substrates, we examined their susceptibility to cleavage by caspase-3. After mixing caspase-3 with a 4-fold molar excess of purified wild-type or mutated P35-His6, the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B). With the exception of D87A-P35, all forms of P35 were cleaved efficiently. α1-Mutated I67K- and V71K-P35 were cleaved to completion, as judged by loss of full-length protein and accumulation of their 25- and 10-kDa cleavage fragments (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 9). In contrast, wild-type and I67Y-P35 cleavage was limited as a direct result of caspase inhibition (lanes 3 and 7). Time course analysis (Fig. 3 C) indicated that I67K-P35 cleavage was rapid. I67K-P35 cleavage fragments were detected within seconds of caspase-3 addition; by 6 h >95% of the 4-fold excess I67K-P35 was cleaved. In comparison, only limited cleavage of wild-type P35 occurred during the same period (Fig. 3 C). Cleavage site substitution D87A-P35 was a poor substrate since cleavage was not detected. The finding that both I67K-P35 and V71K-P35 were efficient substrates, but ineffective caspase inhibitors, suggested that the α1/β-sheet association is required for P35 anti-caspase activity, but not cleavage. We predicted that electrostatic stabilization of the weakened interaction between mutated α1 and the β-sheet would increase the potency of I67K-P35. In the P35 crystal structure, β-sheet residue Ile15 is proximal to α1 residue Ile67 (Fig. 1). We therefore substituted Ile15with Asp to neutralize the nearby positive charge of I67K. Caspase-3 inhibition by double-mutated I15D:I67K-P35 was then measured by using in vitro dose-dependent assays (Fig.4 A). I15D:I67K-P35 was a more potent inhibitor than I67K-P35 at all concentrations tested, but less potent than single-mutated I15D-P35. On the basis of multiple experiments, the IC50 of I15D:I67K-P35 ranged from 3.0 to 5.5 nm, compared with 9.5 to 13 nm for I67K-P35. Thus, with respect to caspase inhibition, the two mutations were compensatory, not additive, when present in the same P35 molecule. Extended incubations (Fig. 4 B) demonstrated that inhibition was achieved in less than 30 min, since anti-caspase activity of I67K- and I15D:I67K-P35 was constant over a 6-h period. Thus, each mutated P35 did not exhibit delayed caspase inhibition. The increased anti-caspase potency of I15D:I67K-P35 compared with that of I67K-P35 suggested that the negative charge of substitution I15D stabilized interaction with I67K-mutated α1. These data confirmed the necessity of proper interaction between α1 and the β-sheet core for caspase inhibition. Previous studies have indicated that the yeast two-hybrid system (31Fields S.A. Ok-Kyu S. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) can detect intramolecular associations through bimolecular interaction of two independently synthesized protein domains (32Huang Z.J.

We predicted that the RSL of P35 could associate with the β-sheet of a different P35 molecule and that this intermolecular interaction could therefore be investigated using the two-hybrid system. To this end, we fused full-length P35 (residues 1 to 299) to the C terminus of the Gal4 DNA-bindin"

The first T1 copper(II) ion to be reduced in ceruloplasmin is the blue copper center of domain 6 (T1A) by ET from RSSR− of domain 5. The rate constant is 28 ± 2 s−1 at 279 K and pH 7.0.

Pecht I. Messerschmidt A. Electron Transfer Reactions in Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific Publications, Singapore1997: 355-389Google Scholar). These enzymes are widely distributed in nature, from bacteria, fungi, and plants to mammals. All contain at least 4 copper ions of the following types. (i) The blue type 1 site (T1)1 characterized by an intense charge transfer band in the 600-nm region (ε ∼ 5000m−1 cm−1) and a narrow hyperfine coupling constant (A∥ < 10−3cm−1) in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum (2Boas J.F. Lontie R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 5-62Google Scholar). (ii) A “normal” type 2 (T2) copper center characterized by a lack of intense absorption bands and ordinary EPR spectrum. (iii) A copper ion pair, called type 3 (T3), which in the oxidized state is characterized by an intense absorption in the near UV region (ε ∼ 4000 m−1 cm−1) and by strong antiferromagnetic coupling. T2 and T3 are proximal and form together a trinuclear cluster, which is the dioxygen reduction site (1Farver O. Pecht I. Messerschmidt A. Electron Transfer Reactions in Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific Publications, Singapore1997: 355-389Google Scholar). The physiological function of T1 is sequential uptake and transfer of single electrons from substrate molecules to the trinuclear center where dioxygen binds and gets reduced to water. Thus, the enzymatic process takes place by a ping-pong mechanism (1Farver O. Pecht I. Messerschmidt A. Electron Transfer Reactions in Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific Publications, Singapore1997: 355-389Google Scholar).2AH2+O2→oxidase2A+2H2OEquation 1 Intramolecular electron transfer (ET) between T1 and the trinuclear T2/T3 center is therefore expected to play a crucial role in the molecular mechanism of this class of enzymes.

The laccases are characterized by relatively low substrate specificity toward the reducing substrate, whereas ascorbate oxidase exhibits a high specificity toward l-ascorbate.

Whereas its physiological role is still debated, a consensus that hCp functions as a plasma ferroxidase is emerging. Kinetic studies have demonstrated a high affinity of hCp for transferrin bound Fe(II) 2O. Farver and L. Bendahl, unpublished results.2O. Farver and L. Bendahl, unpublished results. (12Fee J.A. Struct. Bond. 1975; 22: 1-59Crossref Google Scholar), and binding sites for divalent cations have been identified in the recent crystallographic studies (6Saitzeva I. Saitzev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Whereas the ferroxidase activity may be the primary function of ceruloplasmin, a related role in iron transport may also be envisaged. Studies on the genetic disorder aceruloplasmenia have demonstrated extensive deposition of iron in liver and brain in patients suffering from this disease (14Miyajima H. Nishimura Y. Mizoguchi K. Sakamoto M. Shimizu T. Honda N. Neurology. 1987; 37: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether hCp is also involved in active copper transport remains to be proven although the protein could act as copper reservoir as more than 80% of the copper in humans is bound to hCp (1Farver O. Pecht I. Messerschmidt A. Electron Transfer Reactions in Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific Publications, Singapore1997: 355-389Google Scholar).Early suggestions that hCp contains six copper ions (15Huber C.T. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3973-3978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that its sequence indicates the presence of three putative T1 centers (16Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) were confirmed by Lindley and co-workers (5Saitzev V. Saitzeva I. Card G. Ralph A. Bax B. Lindley P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 59: 719Crossref Google Scholar, 6Saitzeva I. Saitzev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar) based on the three-dimensional structure. Thus, ceruloplasmin is unique among the blue copper oxidases as it contains additional copper centers beyond the four required for the enzymatic function.Here we present results of kinetic and equilibrium studies of hCp, which suggest that one of the three T1 copper ions is responsible for the intramolecular ET to the trinuclear center, whereas the other T1 centers do not participate directly in the intramolecular equilibration process.RESULTSThe steady-state enzymatic activity of the hCp samples used in this study was routinely assayed both before and after pulse radiolysis. The observed oxidase turnover number was typically 2.2 s−1 using Fe(II) as reducing substrate, which demonstrates that the enzyme was highly active. Also, the spectral properties (A610/A280 = 0.047) showed that the oxidase was in an optimal state.When N2O-saturated hCp solutions (100 mmformate, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, N2O saturated) were subjected to pulses producing CO2− radicals, absorption changes at 410 nm demonstrated that a disulfide radical anion, RSSR−, is formed in a bimolecular process with a rate constant of 2.3 × 109m−1 s−1 (279 K)i.e. a rate that is essentially diffusion controlled (Fig.1 C). Reduction of T1[Cu(II)] (monitored at 610 nm) in fully oxidized molecules was further observed with a rate constant at 279 K of 28 ± 2 s−1 (Fig.1 A). This process was independent of protein concentration characterizing an intramolecular mechanism. The decay of RSSR− also occurred in a unimolecular process concomitantly with the above reduction of T1[Cu(II)] demonstrating that this process indeed takes place by intramolecular ET. Following this reduction phase partial reoxidation of T1[Cu(I)] was observed (Fig. 1 A) with the concomitant reduction of T3[Cu(II)] (monitored at 330 nm). The rate constant of this process (2.9 ± 0.6 s−1 at 279 K) was also independent of the protein concentration, which indicates that an intramolecular ET from T1 to T3 is observed. Identical results were obtained using N-methyl nicotinamide radicals as the reducing agent in argon saturated solutions with tert-butyl alcohol as OH radical scavengers.The rate constant for RSSR reduction by the pulse radiolytically produced radicals decreases with the extent of reduction of ceruloplasmin. Thus, after introduction of 1.5-electron equivalents (Fig. 1 D) the bimolecular rate reduces to 0.5 × 109m−1 s−1. Intramolecular ET from RSSR− to T1Cu(II) still occurs, but as illustrated in Fig. 1 B reoxidation of T1[Cu(I)] ceases to take place after one reducing equivalent was introduced into the enzyme molecules. The rate constant of T1[Cu(II)] reduction decreased from 28 s−1 to 3.9 ± 0.8 s−1 at 279 K (Fig. 2 A), and besides a new reduction phase could be observed at a much slower time scale (Figs.1 B and 2 A). The latter seems to be dependent on the reduction state of the enzyme and is probably a slow intermolecular ET process. This reaction pattern was clearly paralleled by the amplitudes of the different reaction phases, which decreased by almost one order of magnitude after introduction of the first electron equivalent (Fig. 2 B). It is also evident from the amplitudes that T1[Cu(I)] is only partially reoxidized and that the extent of its reoxidation depends on the redox state of the hCp molecules. At 279 K we determine an equilibrium constant for the intramolecular ET process to be 0.17.T1[Cu(I)]T2/T3[Cu(II)]=T1[Cu(II)]T2/T3[Cu(I)]SCHEME IThis corresponds to a difference in reduction potential between T1 and T2/T3 of +43 mV.Figure 2A, observed rate constants for T1[Cu(II)] reduction, T1[Cu(I)] reoxidation, and RSSR−reoxidation plotted as a function of the number of reduction equivalents introduced by CO2− or by N-methyl nicotinamide radicals.

First and foremost, its function as an oxidase is still unresolved, though its capacity to catalyze ferrous ion oxidation by dioxygen has been well established, and its involvement in iron metabolism is strongly supported by considerable physiological and genetic evidence (19Harris E.D. Nutr. Rev. 1996; 53: 170-185Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another exception is its copper content and hence the number and nature of sites that have been debated for quite some time. This has now clearly been resolved by the three-dimensional crystallographic structure determination of human ceruloplasmin and shown to contain three distinct T1 sites in addition to the trinuclear cluster (5Saitzev V. Saitzeva I. Card G. Ralph A. Bax B. Lindley P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 59: 719Crossref Google Scholar, 6Saitzeva I. Saitzev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Finally, hCp is the only mammalian member of the blue copper protein family. Human ceruloplasmin consists of a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 132 kDa folded in six domains arranged in a triangular array. A schematic view of hCp is presented in Fig. 3. Each domain comprises a β-barrel constructed in a manner typical for the cupredoxins. Three of the six copper ions are bound to T1 sites present in domains 2, 4, and 6, whereas the other three copper ions form a trinuclear cluster bound at the interface between domains 1 and 6. The spatial relation between the trinuclear center and the nearest T1 site (Fig. 3, A, in domain 6) closely resembles that found in ascorbate oxidase. This was taken to further support that ceruloplasmin has an oxidase function (5Saitzev V. Saitzeva I. Card G. Ralph A. Bax B. Lindley P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 59: 719Crossref Google Scholar, 6Saitzeva I. Saitzev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The three T1 sites are separated from each other by a distance of 1.8 nm. This was again related to the ceruloplasmin function because this distance might still allow for internal ET at reasonable rates and could also increase the probability for electron uptake. The coordination sphere of T1 in domain 4 (T1B) is identical to that of domain 6 (T1A). The third type 1 center (T1C), however, contains a nonligating Leu residue instead of the “usual” Met. Deinum and Vänngård (20Deinum J. Vänngård T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have earlier, by a combination of redox titrations, EPR, and UV-visible spectroscopy, determined that hCp contains 3 paramagnetic copper(II) ions, two T1 and one T2. The reduction potentials of the two former copper centers were determined to be 580 and 490 mV. However, their experimental accuracy did not allow for a precise determination of whether hCp contains three or four nonparamagnetic copper ions. The x-ray structure of Lindley and co-workers (5Saitzev V. Saitzeva I. Card G. Ralph A. Bax B. Lindley P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 59: 719Crossref Google Scholar, 6Saitzeva I. Saitzev V. Card G.

Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar) has now unambiguously demonstrated that hCp contains six copper ions, three T1, one T2, and one T3 pair. Studying the reduction potential of the blue T1 copper protein, azurin in which the copper ligating Met was substituted by Leu or Val, it was found that in these mutants the reduction potentials increased from 307 to 412 and 445 mV, respectively, at pH 7.0 (21Pascher T. Karlsson B.G. Nordling M. Malmström B.G. Vänngård T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Studies of hCp by x-ray absorption spectroscopy suggested that the resting oxidized enzyme contains one permanently reduced T1 center and that this site cannot be involved in the catalytic process (22Machonkin T.E. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reduction potential of this T1 center was estimated to be at least 1.0 V. So, based on the above electrochemical studies on azurin and the crystal structure we assign this high potential T1 site to T1C (the type 1 center of domain 2). This is also in line with the recent x-ray structure for fungal laccase from Coprinus cínerus (7Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Ostergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), which also has a leucine residue replacing methionine in the strongly oxidizing T1 copper(II) center.Figure 3A schematic view of hCp. The diagram shows domain numbers and indicates structural relationships between the copper ions (•). T1 coppers are labeled A, B, and C, respectively. The trinuclear center is seen on the interface between domains 1 and 6. Adopted from Ref. 6Saitzeva I. Saitzev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg.

Like in ascorbate oxidase, two of the copper ions are bound to six histidines and assigned as T3, whereas the third copper (most distant from T1) is coordinated to two histidines only and is designated as bound to the T2 site. Histidine pairs bridge two copper ions, and by further analogy to the ascorbate oxidase structure, an oxygen atom connects the two T3 coppers, whereas another one is bound to the T2 copper ion (5Saitzev V. Saitzeva I. Card G. Ralph A. Bax B. Lindley P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 59: 719Crossref Google Scholar, 6Saitzeva I. Saitzev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). An additional relevant structural feature is the domain 6 cysteine providing a thiolate ligand to T1. This residue is placed between the two sequential His residues that are coordinated to the T3 copper pair. This structural element has first been observed in ascorbate oxidase and was proposed to provide the ET path between the single T1 and the trinuclear center (3Messerschmidt A. Rossi A. Ladenstein R.

Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).A considerable body of results from activity studies of hCp has accumulated during earlier decades and is now awaiting a more meaningful analysis and interpretation using the available three-dimensional structure. Catalysis of amine oxidation by hCp, in particular biogenic ones present in plasma, cerebral, spinal, and intestinal fluids as well as of ferrous ions is probably physiologically relevant and has been studied extensively (23Avigliano L. Finazzi-Agrò A. Messerschmidt A. Electron Transfer Reactions in Multi-Copper Oxidases. World Scientific Publications, Singapore1997: 251-284Google Scholar). The mechanism of dioxygen reduction by hCp at the trinuclear center is of particular interest as the presence of three distinct T1 sites raises the question of which sites are involved in the internal ET to the single O2 reduction site.Pulse radiolysis was first applied to studying ET within this multicentered blue oxidase 25 years ago where internal ET to the T1 Cu(II) was observed from the disulfide radical ions produced upon hCp reaction with hydrated electrons (24Faraggi M. Pecht I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3146-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the transient absorption changes because of the disulfide radicals and the T1[Cu(II)] site were found to decay in unimolecular processes at identical rates of ∼900 s−1 at room temperature. The results reported here show that both CO2− and N-methyl nicotinamide radicals react with disulfide groups of hCp at diffusion controlled rates to produce the RSSR−radicals. From here the electrons are transferred intramolecularly to T1[Cu(II)] with a rate constant at 279 K of 28 ± 2 s−1. Following this step, in molecules with an oxidized T2/T3 center, an intramolecular electron equilibration (Scheme I) is observed with an equilibrium constant of 0.17 at the same temperature. After introduction of one electron equivalent into this particular T1 center, intramolecular ET to the trinuclear site ceases to take place. At the same step the rate constant for intramolecular ET from the disulfide radical to a T1[Cu(II)] is slowed down by almost a factor of 10 to be 3.9 ± 0.8 s−1. This is interpreted as ET to one of the other T1 centers; the first T1 center to be reduced is most probably the one closest to the trinuclear site (T1A), because reoxidation only takes place as long as less than one reducing equivalent is added to the hCp molecules. This could be the T1[Cu(II)] with the highest reduction potential (580 mV) because in reductive titrations the first 50% of the total absorption at 610 nm decays within 3 min, whereas the further reduction proceeds much slower (20Deinum J. Vänngård T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). From the equilibrium constant for the internal ET equilibration process (K, 0.17 at 279 K), we calculate a difference in reduction potential between T1A and T3 Cu(II)/Cu(I) of 43 mV. Now, a reduction potential for T3[Cu(II)/Cu(I)] of 537 mV can be calculated. The potential for the second (lower) T1B was reported to be 490 mV (20Deinum J. Vänngård T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This places the reduction potential of the trinuclear site midway between those of the two redox active T1 centers. Identification of T1A as the primary electron acceptor among the T1 centers is further substantiated by the analysis of the relative solvent exposure of the disulfide groups (see below) and their distance from the T1 centers.In the three-dimensional structure of hCp (5Saitzev V. Saitzeva I. Card G. Ralph A. Bax B. Lindley P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 59: 719Crossref Google Scholar, 6Saitzeva I. Saitzev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar) five disulfide bridges are found distributed evenly throughout the protein in domains 1–5 (cf. Fig. 3). All five disulfides are found near the bottom of a β-barrel, and in two domains the T1 copper centers (T1B and T1C) are placed at the opposite end of the barrels. The only domain lacking a disulfide is domain 6, which contains T1A and the trinuclear copper center. All three T1 centers are well protected from the solvent by the protein matrix. Thus, it is not surprising that only indirect copper reduction via the exposed disulfide groups is observed. In fact, this behavior is quite reminiscent of results of our studies of intramolecular ET in azurins (25Farver O. Skov L.K. Young S. Bonander N. Karlsson B.G. Vänngård T. Pecht I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5453-5454Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Farver O. Pecht I. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 387-392Google Scholar), where long range electron transfer takes place from the disulfide radical to T1[Cu(II)] over a distance of 2.45 nm. The main difference between azurin and hCp is that no direct Cu(II) reduction is observed in hCp, whereas in azurin approximately 50% of the reducing radicals react directly with the blue copper center (25Farver O. Skov L.K. Young S. Bonander N. Karlsson B.G. Vänngård T. Pecht I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5453-5454Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Farver O. Pecht I. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 387-392Google Scholar). Rate constants for ET between the disulfide radical and Cu(II) in azurin have been determined as a function of driving force (-ΔG 0), separation distance (r-r0), electronic coupling (HDA) and reorganization energies (λ), cf. Equations 2 and 3 (27Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7661) Google Scholar).k=2πℏ︀HDA2(4πλRT)1/2e−(ΔG0+λ)2/4λRTEquation 2 HDA=HDA0e−β2(r−r0)Equation 3 For hCp we may analogously calculate a driving force for intramolecular ET between disulfide radicals and the first and second T1[Cu(II)] of 0.99 and 0.90 eV, respectively. Pathway calculations, as developed by Beratan et al. (28Beratan D.N. Betts J.N. Onuchic J.N. Science. 1991; 252: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), identifying the optimal electronic couplings between the three T1 centers and disulfide radicals show that the optimal ET route connecting a disulfide with a T1 center occurs between the highly solvent exposed disulfide Cys-855/Cys-881 of domain 5 and the T1A center of domain 6, which also happens to be the T1 center adjacent to the trinuclear T2/T3 copper center. Furthermore, the domain 5 disulfide bridge is surrounded by a number of arginines, the positive charges of which make this site even more attractive for the negatively charged CO2− radicals. This pathway, shown in Fig. 4, consists of 20 covalent bonds, 3 hydrogen bonds, and one van der Waals contact connecting the disulfide group with the T1A-ligating His-975. This gives rise to a coupling decay factor of Πε = 1.0 × 10−8. Assuming similar reorganization energies as in azurin, a theoretically calculated rate constant of 10 s−1 is obtained, in good agreement with the experimentally observed rate constant of the first phase of intramolecular T1 reduction.Figure 4Results of pathway calculations connecting the disulfide bridge of domain 5 with the T1A copper ion of domain 6. The algorithm developed by Beratan et al. (28Beratan D.N. Betts J.N. Onuchic J.N.

Fig. 5). These centers are connected pairwise by 13 covalent and 2 hydrogen bonds, giving rise to an electronic decay coupling factor of 1.7 × 10−4. However, despite this relatively short distance, intramolecular ET between these sites are not expected. The high potential T1C is, as mentioned above, most likely in the reduced state even in the resting enzyme and thus not involved in ET at all. The driving force for T1A to T1B ET is very low or even negative. Indeed, no kinetic evidence for intramolecular T1 to T1 ET was observed during the pulse radiolytic experiments. As is also mentioned above and illustrated in Fig. 5, the T1A center is in close covalent connection to the T3 site; the Cys thiolate-coordinating T1[Cu] is placed between two His residues, which are both coordinated to the T3 pair. These two pathways consist of nine covalent bonds, yielding a total separation distance of 1.34 nm. An alternative pathway is provided by the carbonyl oxygen of Cys, which is hydrogen bonded to the Nδ of one of the His imidazoles. We may now calculate the relative electronic coupling between electron donor and acceptor and find a value of 0.01, i.e. a very effective coupling. Therefore, the T1A copper ion is by all probability the one engaged in ET equilibrium with the trinuclear site (Fig. 5, right side).Figure 5Results of pathway calculations connecting the three T1 copper ions and between T1 and the T3 copper pair.

To examine the potential cellular functions and physiological substrates of PTPα, a potent phosphorothioate oligonucleotide-based antisense strategy was developed that specifically depleted endogenous PTPα from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The antisense probe, αAS1, achieved PTPα depletion levels normally of ≥85% and which varied up to levels where PTPα was not detected at all. Elimination of PTPα by 85% inhibited c-Src activity by 80%. Abolishing PTPα to levels undetected did not alter the tyrosine dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate proteins. Moreover, the ability of insulin to activate ERK2 or to stimulate DNA synthesis was not altered by αAS1. It is concluded that endogenous PTPα is a key regulator of c-Src activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that PTPα is not required for the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor or the insulin receptor substrate proteins or for the regulation of several downstream insulin signaling events in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

However, at present relatively little is known regarding the cellular functions of individual PTPs. Identification of PTP substrates is of importance in defining the physiological role of PTPs. However, in vivo substrates for many of the PTPs have yet to be established. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop methods capable of establishing the specific targets and roles of individual PTPs in physiologically relevant systems. PTPα is a widely expressed receptor-like PTP characterized by a short (123 amino acids) glycosylated extracellular domain and two cytoplasmic catalytic domains (1Matthews R.J. Cahir E.D. Thomas M.L.

A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The N-terminal catalytic domain has been shown to possess a majority of PTP activity toward exogenous phosphotyrosine-containing substrates, whereas the C-terminal domain exhibits low PTP activity (3Wang Y.

PTPα has been shown to be constitutively phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues (4den Hertog J. Tracey S. Hunter T.

Thus overexpression of PTPα enhanced the activation of c-Src and the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory phosphotyrosine residue Tyr-527 of c-Src (7Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Similarly the insulin receptor (IR) was suggested as a putative substrate for PTPα since overexpression of PTPα in baby hamster kidney cells already overexpressing the IR rescued the cells from insulin-stimulated growth inhibition, and IR tyrosine phosphorylation of IR transiently overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was diminished by transiently overexpressing PTPα as well (11Møller N.P.H.

Overexpression of PTPs in cell lines may, however, lead to a shift in the expression pattern of seemingly unrelated tyrosine kinases or PTPs (see Ref. 12Lammers R. Møller N.P.H. Ullrich A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and refs therein) and may lead to nonspecific effects. Although in the case of c-Src, PTPα−/− mice have very recently been reported to contain less c-Src activity in brain and fibroblasts (9Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,10Ponniah S. Wang D.Z.N. Lim K.L. Pallen C. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), that additional mechanisms caused the altered c-Src activity was not excluded. It is important to obtain direct evidence over whether the putative cellular roles of PTPα are functions of PTPα in physiological systems and at normal expression levels. Achieving this requires the development of methods that work against native PTPα in suitable cell types. Toward this end we now describe an antisense technique that enables the specific depletion of endogenous PTPα from intact cells. Moreover, the antisense strategy works on a cell type that is highly insulin-responsive and a major model for insulin signaling, namely, 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We have applied the antisense method to dissect facets of the signaling role of endogenous PTPα. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were a kind gift from Dr. G. Gould, University of Glasgow, Scotland. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, 1 g/liter glucose, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Medium was changed at 48-h intervals. For adipocyte preparation, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were used at passage 6–9 in 22-mm dishes. At 2–3 days post-confluence cells were differentiated as described previously (14Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were kindly synthesized by Dr. M. Pickett, Dept. of Microbiology, Southampton General Hospital. ODN preparation was as described previously (14Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The phosphorothioate ODNs used were antisense αAS1 (CCA TGC TGA CCG AGC CCG) and the corresponding sense (CGG GCT CGG TCA GCA TGG), scrambled (CAC CGG GCT GAC CTC GCA), and mismatch (CAA TGA TGA ACG AGA CCG) sequences. Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to facilitate the introduction of phosphorothioate ODNs into cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were routinely transfected between days 8 and 14 post-differentiation. Lipofectin reagent was allowed to preincubate with DMEM (no additions) for 30–45 min. Appropriate dilutions of stock ODN in 100 μl of DMEM (no additions) were incubated with 100 μl of DMEM containing Lipofectin reagent (120 μg/ml) at room temperature for 15 min. During this time, cells were washed (3 × 1 ml) with prewarmed DMEM (no additions; 37 °C). Cells were then incubated with the mixture (200 μl) together with an equal volume (200 μl) of DMEM (no additions). With the no-ODN conditions, the mixture was still added to the cells, except where stated otherwise, but it contained no ODN. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the presence of Lipofectin for 24 h. The transfection medium was then replaced with DMEM (supplemented with 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin), and the ODN concentration was maintained. Additional medium changes were performed every 48 h. The ODN concentrations and incubation times utilized were routinely 15 μm and 7 days for αAS1 and corresponding control ODNs unless stated otherwise in figure legends. Cells were incubated with or without insulin at 37 °C as indicated. Cells were extracted as described previously (14Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J.

The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, monoclonal c-Src antibody, and SHP-2 antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

In addition to the PTPα band at 130 kDa, this antibody detected a band at 140 kDa in Western blots of cell homogenates (e.g. see Fig. 1 and 2); both bands were competitively removed by the peptide used for the immunization. Because the peptide sequence used for immunization is significantly conserved in PTPε, we tested whether the 140-kDa band was PTPε. Three different antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (17- or 18-mers) specific to distinct regions of the PTPε sequence depleted the 140-kDa band up to a level that was not detected, identifying the 140-kDa band as PTPε. The identification of the 140-kDa band as PTPε is supported by studies of Elson and Leder (15Elson A. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26116-26122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), who showed that PTPε is glycosylated in a tissue-specific manner, generating different molecular mass species depending on the tissue, including a major immunoreactive species of 140 kDa.

For this, anti-c-Src antibody IgG was coupled to protein A-agarose beads through a bridging layer of anti-mouse IgG (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Plates of cells were washed rapidly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted into modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate; 100 μl/well) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts from 4 identical wells were pooled and homogenized by repeated expulsion through a 25-gauge needle. 40 μl of the extract was removed for Western blotting against the anti-PTPα antibody. The remainder was centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 10 min), and the supernatant was removed, adjusted to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads coated with anti-c-Src IgG for 18 h at 4 °C with constant agitation (10 rpm). Samples were subjected to Western blotting and standard kinase assay against enolase (acid-denatured; Ref. 19Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol.

For dephosphorylation assays of the IR and IRS proteins, cells were challenged with 100 nm insulin for 15 min, then washed with DMEM (no additions; 3 × 1 ml) and incubated in DMEM (no additions; 37 °C) for the indicated times. Short time courses were performed because IR- and IRS protein dephosphorylation occurred very rapidly after the withdrawal of insulin. Reactions were stopped by immediately freezing cells in liquid N2. DNA synthesis was assayed as described previously (14Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To determine the intensity of bands on autoradiographs and Western blots, they were scanned using an Epson scanner and appropriate software. The image generated was then quantitated using Phoretix densitometry software. The antisense ODN used in this study was selected using specially designed computer programs (20Bloomfield M.R. Giles I.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 293SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) according to the criteria described by Sale et al. (14Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Modified phosphorothioate ODNs were used since they display an increased resistance to nucleases such that lower concentrations can be utilized than those required with unmodified ODNs. This was combined with the use of cationic liposomes (Lipofectin), which have been shown to enhance ODN uptake into cells and improve the subcellular distribution (21Wagner R.W. Matteucci M.D. Lewis J.G. Gutierrez A.J. Moulds C. Froehler B.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1510-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Analysis of the murine PTPα sequence (from Ref. 1Matthews R.J. Cahir E.D. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) revealed a region close to the initiation codon of low secondary structure with particular antisense potential, namely, nucleotides 12–29 of sequence 5′-CGG GCT CGG TCA GCA TGG-3′, where ATG is the initiation codon. The corresponding antisense probe, called αAS1, was of sequence 5′-CCA TGC TGA CCG AGC CCG-3′. Additionally, corresponding sense (CGG GCT CGG TCA GCA TGG), scrambled (CAC CGG GCT GAC CTC GCA), and mismatch (4 mismatches, CAA TGA TGA ACG AGA CCG) phosphorothioate ODNs were utilized. The efficiency of PTPα antisense treatment was assessed by quantitative Western blot analysis using an anti-peptide antibody against PTPα. In addition to the PTPα band at 130 kDa, this antibody detected a second band in Western blots of cell homogenates (e.g. see Fig. 1 and2); this band was of 140 kDa and was identified as the highly related PTPε (see “Experimental Procedures”). Treatment of cells with Lipofectin reagent alone had no affect on cellular levels of PTPα (data not shown). Pilot experiments showed that αAS1 was highly effective in depleting PTPα from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Time course and dose-response experiments (Fig. 1) were performed to optimize the antisense protocol. Exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to αAS1 (15 μm) caused a time-dependent reduction in levels of PTPα, with near complete depletion of PTPα after 7 days (Fig. 1, A and B). Depletion of PTPα by αAS1 (7-day incubation) occurred in a dose-dependent fashion with near complete depletion of PTPα obtained with 15 μmαAS1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus the optimum protocol for obtaining PTPα depletion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes with αAS1 was a 7-day incubation at a concentration of 15 μm, and this protocol was used hereinafter. With this protocol, the depletion of PTPα achieved from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was normally ≥85% (e.g. Fig. 1) and varied up to levels where PTPα was not detected (e.g. Fig. 6) with a mean ± S.E. depletion of 91% ± 3% for blots herein. The corresponding control ODNs (sense, scrambled, and mismatched) had no significant affect on the level of PTPα expression when compared with no-ODN controls (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that αAS1 was acting specifically in these cells. Further support for the specificity of αAS1 (also see “Discussion”) comes from observations that αAS1 treatment of cells did not significantly affect the expression of several internal control proteins. These included a number of PTPs, namely, the highly related PTPε as well as LAR and SHP-2 (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and 6). Additionally, the expression of the protein kinases ERK1, ERK2, and p90rsk (e.g. Fig. 8 and data not shown) and the levels of all other major cellular proteins as determined by densitometric scanning of amido black-stained nitrocellulose membranes were unaltered by αAS1 (levels quantitated as 99.9% ± 0.3% for αAS1, 100.9% ± 0.3% for scrambled ODN, 100.8% ± 2.1% for sense ODN, and 101.6% ± 1.7% for mismatch ODN-treated cells, where 100% was taken to be the level of protein in the no-ODN condition). Moreover, αAS1 did not affect cell morphology or cell viability and did not cause disruption of cell function, since cells exhibited the characteristic cellular responses to insulin (discussed later). The depletion of PTPα elicited by αAS1 was reversible. Washing out the αAS1 resulted in full recovery of the level of PTPα (Fig. 4). Having developed a potent antisense strategy for depleting PTPα, the strategy was then utilized to test the role of PTPα in the regulation of c-Src activity and in the control of insulin signaling.Figure 3αAS1 does not deplete LAR or SHP-2 from 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Control cells were incubated in the absence of αAS1 throughout the period; PTPα levels were unchanged in these cells. PTPα expression relative to that in the control cells at each time was determined by quantification of anti-PTPα Western blots. Values are means ± S.E., n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether endogenous PTPα plays a role in the regulation of c-Src activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, control and αAS1-treated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-c-Src antibody. Immunocomplex assays showed that c-Src activity from cells treated with αAS1 was reduced by 80% compared with that in no-ODN control cells (Fig.5). The level of c-Src recovery in the immunocomplexes was not affected by αAS1 treatment (Fig.5). Western blotting of whole cell lysates from the same cells showed that αAS1 had caused significant inhibition of PTPα expression (∼85% depletion of PTPα protein) when compared with no-ODN controls (Fig. 5). Experiments with control ODNs confirmed that they did not affect PTPα expression or c-Src phosphorylation (see above and data not shown). These results indicate that PTPα plays an important role in the regulation of c-Src activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The IR is an insulin-activated tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its β-subunit (reviewed in Ref. 22Sale G.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 897-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation results in activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and leads to the phosphorylation of endogenous substrates (23Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PTPs have been postulated to be important for the regulation of insulin signaling because the IR does not possess autodephosphorylation activity (24Sale G.J. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1991; 6: 159-186Google Scholar, 25Sale G.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Goldstein B.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, dephosphorylation of the IR by cellular PTPs has been shown to return insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity to basal levels, with the tyrosine 1150 domain of the IR β-subunit in tris-phosphorylated form being exquisitely sensitive to PTP action (27King M.J. Sale G.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,28King M.J. Sharma R.P. Sale G.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, PTPs can potentially regulate insulin signaling at the level of the IR substrates. These include IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc, whose dephosphorylation modulates the post-receptor pathways of insulin action by impairing the docking and activation of SH2-containing proteins. IRS-1 and IRS-2, which comigrate on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and are collectively termed “IRS proteins” stand out as a well characterized major band of 185 kDa on anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots of insulin-stimulated cells (29Sun X.-J. Rothenburg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Azaki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the IRS proteins is closely regulated in vivo (26Goldstein B.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar), but the PTPs responsible for the dephosphorylation of the IRS proteins have not yet been identified. A role for PTPα in the negative regulation of insulin signaling has been suggested by studies using overexpression systems (11Møller N.P.H. Møller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Lammers R. Møller N.P.H. Ullrich A.

Commun. 1998; 242: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, this potential role has not yet been investigated in the major insulin-sensitive tissues or at endogenous levels of PTPα expression. To this end, the effect of PTPα depletion on several well characterized insulin responses was examined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To rigorously test whether the IR and the IRS proteins are substrates for PTPα in vivo, the effect of PTPα depletion on both their rate of tyrosine dephosphorylation after removal of insulin and on their steady state tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of insulin were determined. To study the effect of PTPα depletion on the rate of dephosphorylation of the IR β-subunit and IRS proteins after the removal of insulin, cells were transfected as before prior to challenging with 100 nm insulin for 15 min. A time course of dephosphorylation of the IR β-subunit and IRS proteins was performed by withdrawal of insulin from all cells and incubating them in DMEM (no additions) for specified lengths of time. Preliminary experiments indicated that dephosphorylation of both the IR and IRS proteins was very rapid in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (within 5 min). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR and IRS proteins was determined by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting. In no-ODN control cells, tyrosine dephosphorylation of the IR β-subunit occurred very rapidly, with a majority of tyrosine phosphorylation lost after 1 min of insulin withdrawal and with maximum dephosphorylation being reached after 2 min (Fig.6 A). This profile of IR β-subunit dephosphorylation is in agreement with a previous study using permeablized rat adipocytes (30Mooney R.A. Anderson D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6850-6857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the rate of tyrosine dephosphorylation of the IRS proteins was rapid, with a majority of dephosphorylation occurring within 2 min (Fig.6 B). A comparison of the rate of dephosphorylation of the IR β-subunit and IRS proteins in no-ODN control cells indicated that the IR β-subunit was dephosphorylated more rapidly than the IRS proteins after insulin withdrawal. Depletion of a PTP, which plays a negative regulatory role at the level of the IR or IRS proteins, would be expected to slow the rate of dephosphorylation of these proteins. However, in cells treated with αAS1, dephosphorylation of the IR β-subunit was extremely rapid (a majority of phosphotyrosine was lost after 1 min), at a rate similar to that in the no-ODN and scrambled-ODN controls (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, αAS1-treatment of cells had no significant effect on the dep"

If pausing also induces slippage, the occurrence within the repeat tract of DNA damage that blocks DNA replication could profoundly effect TRE. Studies of replication of DNA template-primers in vitro with DNA polymerase alone are important for their potential ability to uncover mutation mechanisms.

Here, we report the effects of tract length, tract sequence, and DNA damage on TRE during DNA replication in vitro. The abasic site analog tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as the model DNA damage lesion. Abasic sites and THF block DNA replication (reviewed in Refs. 30Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar and 31Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), and the abasic site is one of the most common lesions that arise in cellular DNA (32Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 362: 709-715Crossref Scopus (4325) Google Scholar). THF was synthesized in the triplet-repeat tracts separately in the template and in the primer strands. Replication using E. coli Klenow pol I as the model polymerase and primed from within the repeat tract demonstrated that THF in the template strand greatly enhanced TRE during DNA synthesis. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligonucleotides) were synthesized by the Lineberger DNA synthesis facility using an Applied Biosystems automated synthesizer. Oligonucleotides were synthesized as templates for DNA replication. The templates contained ACTGTGTCTGTC (Ua) at the 5′ end and GCGACCTGATCC (Ub) at the 3′ end, surrounding the triplet repeats (ATT)10, (ATT)20, (AAT)10, (AAT)20, (CTG)10, (CTG)20, (CAG)10, and (CAG)20, as indicated in figure legends. Templates containing 10-repeat tracts were also synthesized to contain the abasic site analog THF (phosphoramidite purchased from Glen Research) in place of the last base at the 5′ end of the repeat tract. Primers were synthesized to be complementary to either Ub or to the repeat tract. The latter were three repeats in length. To study the effect of THF placement, THF was also placed at the beginning of the fourth repeat of (ATT)10 in place of A, Ua(ATT)3(FTT)(ATT)6Ub, where F is THF. THF was also synthesized in place of the middle residue of the primer to give AATAFTAAT. All of the templates were synthesized to contain a three-carbon spacer (Glen Research) at their 3′ terminus that can not be removed or extended by DNA polymerase (not shown). The replication reaction contained 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), either 0.3 mm or 0.5 mmMgSO4, as indicated in the figure legends, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm of all four dNTPs, 5 μm of the primer and template, and either 0.1 unit/μl or 0.2 unit/μl of Klenow pol I (Promega). For annealing, primer and template were mixed, incubated at 90 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl and MgSO4, and allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction was started by addition of dithiothreitol, dNTPs, and polymerase and was incubated at the indicated temperatures for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 23 mm and by cooling to 4 °C. Reaction products were resolved by either 2% agarose native or alkaline gel electrophoresis. The gels were either stained with ethidium bromide or, if radiolabeled substrates were used, analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All of the templates and primers were tested individually for their ability to support expansion under the above reaction conditions. Only primed templates supported TRE under our reaction conditions. To determine the sequences of the TREs, the expanded primers were extended to the end of the template 5′-terminal unique sequence (Ua). For reactions involving abasic sites, the reaction products were melted and reannealed twice. First, the reaction products were melted and the extended primers were reannealed to templates identical to the reaction templates but lacking the abasic site. The new annealed template-primers were extended with Klenow polymerase to the end of the template downstream 5′ unique sequence (Ua). Second, the extended primer strand was melted and reannealed to complementary sequencing primer for sequencing by automated methods. Restriction enzymes Bbv I (New England Biolabs), which recognizes and cleaves the sequence GCAGC(8/12), and Aci I, Bsg I, Mbo II, Mnl I, Nla III, and Pst I (New England Biolabs), and Tha I (Life Technologies, Inc.), which recognize variants of the CTG repeat, were used according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions. We analyzed the effect of THF on TRE during DNA replication in vitro. Template-primers were constructed to contain a repeat tract flanked by two different unique sequences (Uaand Ub in Fig. 1). The 3′ ends of the templates were blocked by a three-carbon spacer (Glen Research), which blocks extension by polymerase (not shown). Primers were constructed to be complementary to either the triplet-repeat tract (floating primer) or the unique flanking sequence 3′ to the repeat tract (fixed primer). The former mimics the sliding model (6Richards R.I. Sutherland G.R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 7Eichler E.E. Holden J.J.A. Popovich B.W. Reiss A.L.

Topal M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The presence of unique sequences flanking the repeat tract, however, significantly reduces the amount of TRE. Control experiments, using end-labeled template and primer, demonstrated that templates and primers by themselves did not support DNA synthesis by Klenow polymerase (not shown). DNA synthesis and TRE were detectable only when annealed primer-template was used for DNA replication. The model abasic site analog THF (Fig. 1 A) was introduced at a single position at the 5′ end of the 10-repeat tract just before the unique flanking sequence (Fig. 1 B). Replication with both floating and fixed primers is portrayed in Fig. 1 B, 1 and 2, respectively. The presence of THF at the end of the repeat tract gave significant TRE with the primer:template (AAT)3:U(FTT)(ATT)9U (Fig.2), whereas there was little expansion in the absence of THF under these conditions. The conditions used previously to observe significant amounts of spontaneous TRE during DNA replication in vitro lacked unique sequences flanking the template repeat (26Schlötterer C. Tautz D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 27Ji J. Clegg N.J. Peterson K.R. Jackson A.L. Laird C.D. Loeb L.A.

The amount of THF-induced expansion that occurred at 42 °C increased with increased reaction time to approximately 1500 bases for primer AAT after 4 h (Fig. 2). Significant THF-induced expansion was also observed at 37 °C (Fig.3, lane 3). Shifting the position of THF to the middle of the repeat tract (see “Experimental Procedures” for sequence) decreased the amount of expansion observed at 37 and 42 °C. The result is consistent with effectively shortening the length of the repeat tract in the template (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 9). Placing THF in the middle of the primer did not enhance TRE (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 10) and instead appeared to reduce the amount of fill-in replication product as measured by the intensity of the lowest molecular weight band (lanes 5 and 10).Figure 3Comparison of effect on TRE of THF in the middle versus the 5′ end of the template repeat and in the primer strand. Lanes 1 and 6, base pair markers; lanes 2 and 7, no THF; lanes 3 and 8, THF located at the 5′ end of the repeat tract (e); lanes 4 and 9, THF located in the middle of the template repeat tract (m); lanes 5 and 10, THF located in the middle of the primer (p). Assay conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures,” and incubation was at 37 and 42 °C, as indicated, for 2 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Replications of all four of the 10-repeat templates with and without THF were compared under identical reaction conditions. The order of primer repeat expansion induced by THF, located at the 5′ end of the template repeat tract, was ATT ≥ AAT > CAG > CTG (summarized in Fig. 4). A small fraction of longer replication products in the absence of THF is visible in Fig.4, lanes 2 and 4. These products appear to be the product of processive replication, since only a small fraction of substrate is extended to long product. Alternatively, the THF results imply that a low level of oligonucleotide with contaminating damage within the repeat could be responsible for the small background of long products visible in Fig. 4. Sequencing of the expanded ATT- and CAG-repeat primer DNA strands (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed that the expansion sequences mimicked the primer repeat (not shown). CAG expansion products, from reactions in which the primer and template strands were separately labeled, were analyzed on alkaline gels. The results demonstrated that only the primer strand (and only from floating primers) was expanded (Fig. 5). The labeled products were also digested with restriction enzymes and analyzed on denaturing gels (Fig.5, lanes 3 and 6). Both strands of the expansion products were cleaved by Bbv I (GCAGC8/12) but not by enzymes that recognize variants of the CAG repeat (Aci I, Bsg I, Mbo II, Mnl I, Nla III, Pst I, and Tha I) (not shown). The presence of multiple bands in lane 4 (template only) is probably due to residual secondary structure caused by hairpin formation by CTG repeats (14Chen X. Mariappan S.V.S. Catasti P. Ratliffe R.

Strand breakage caused by the THF site would have given a band in Fig. 5 corresponding to a labeled 12- or 13-mer (Fig. 5, lane 4). Using agarose gel electrophoresis, we analyzed the effects of temperature and tract length on replication of CTG template repeat tracts. Ten- and twenty-repeat tracts with and without THF were replicated. Only floating primers (i.e. primers complementary to the repeat tract) gave detectable levels of expansion. Increasing temperature increased TRE both with and without THF. The presence of THF in the template repeats enhanced expansion of triplet repeats over that without THF at all temperatures studied (Fig.6). 20-repeat tracts reproducibly gave significantly more TRE than 10-repeat tracts. This was true at all temperatures studied whether or not THF was present. The difference between TRE with and without THF in 20-repeat tracts was not as dramatic as that for 10-repeat tracts. This was because of the large amount of “spontaneous” TRE for 20-repeat tracts. Similar increases in TRE with increasing repeat-tract length were found for all of the template-primers (not shown). The effects of an abasic site in the triplet-repeat tract on the occurrence of TRE during DNA replication in vitro were determined. The model abasic site THF blocks DNA replication (33Miller H.

Introduction of THF into a triplet-repeat tract was found to dramatically increase TRE during replicative synthesis in vitro. Low Mg2+ concentration was used to generate dramatic TRE (29Lyons-Darden T. Topal M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) similar to the type II TREs observed in Fragile X syndrome and myotonic dystrophy (1Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 2Ashley C.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev.

Although the Mg2+concentration was less than that assumed to be at the replication fork in vivo, it served to destabilize the DNA so that DNA slippage is amplified enabling us to study factors that effect its occurrence in vitro. The expansions were only detected when a primer was used complementary to the repeat-tract sequence, rather than complementary to the unique upstream flanking sequence. Expansion by priming within the repeat tract was seen also in the absence of THF but to a much lesser extent. A sliding primer could occur in vivo by location of an Okazaki primer entirely within the repeat tract (6Richards R.I. Sutherland G.R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 7Eichler E.E. Holden J.J.A. Popovich B.W. Reiss A.L. Snow K. Thibodeau S.N. Richards C.S. Ward P.A. Nelson D.L. Nature Genetics. 1994; 8: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DNA damage or repair could produce a nick in the growing strand within the repeat tract, while the growing-strand end is located within the repeat tract. This would be more likely if replication were stalled within the repeat tract because of a blocking DNA lesion. Moreover, abasic sites may stimulate slippage by keeping the replication complex within the “slippery surface” of the triplet repeat. Characterization of the expansion products showed that only the primer strand was expanded. DNA sequencing showed that the AAT and CAG expansions were the same sequence as the starting repeat tracts. Restriction enzyme digestion of the CAG TRE products with and without THF showed that the template strands as well as the primer strands were digested. Digestion of the template strand means that it was not displaced from the primer strand as would occur if expansion were caused by a strand-switching mechanism. In addition, digestion of the primer strand confirmed that the triplet-repeat sequence was uniform over the entire expanded tract as shown by direct sequencing. Moving the abasic lesion from the end to the middle of the repeat tract reduced the amount of TRE. Moving the lesion, which blocks replication, closer to the beginning of the repeat effectively reduces the size of the repeat tract available to polymerase. We showed that under our conditions, longer triplet repeats are more susceptible to TRE than shorter triplet repeats. This is consistent with results in vivo (1Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 2Ashley C.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev.

Nature Genetics. 1994; 8: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and with our understanding of DNA slippage (4Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 20Harvey S.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3047-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Placing the lesion in the primer instead of the template gave no detectable TRE and decreased the intensity of the filled-in template-primer band. The result implies that THF in the primer interfered with replication priming probably by destabilizing the template-primer duplex. It has been suggested that DNA slippage should be enhanced by an idling polymerase at a pause site caused by a DNA structure or bound protein (12Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27014-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The suggestion, if correct, leads to the hypothesis that DNA damage that blocks replication could have profound effects on TRE. To test the hypothesis in vitro, we introduced the abasic site analog THF into triplet-repeat tracts and demonstrated that its presence dramatically increased the occurrence of expansion. This demonstration only has importance in vivo if abasic sites occur within repeat tracts with a high enough frequency to have meaningful impact. Abasic sites arise spontaneously through hydrolysis of DNA N-glycosyl bonds (37Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) and are estimated to occur at a rate of 10,000 abasic sites/cell/day under physiological conditions (37Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). The steady-state levels of abasic sites vary with the tissue sampled from a low of ∼1 abasic site per 106 nucleotides to a high of 35 abasic sites per 106 nucleotides (38Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical exposures of cells in culture induced higher levels (38Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, given triplet-repeat tracts of 102 nucleotides and spontaneous steady-state levels of abasic sites, we would expect 0.0001–0.0035 abasic sites per given repeat tract. Assumption that the presence of an abasic site in the triplet-repeat tract results in a 104-fold (it could be significantly higher) increase in TRE per replicative event gives up to a 35-fold increase in TRE rates at that repeat tract. This calculation assumes that the repeat tract is a target for DNA damage equivalent to the bulk DNA. The latter assumption may underestimate levels of damage to triplet repeat tracts. Some repeats show mobilities during gel electrophoresis different from unique sequence DNA of the same size, indicative of unique structures (39Chastain P.D., II Eichler E.E. Kang S. Nelson D.L. Levene S.D. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16125-16131Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is possible that repetitive DNA is a better target for DNA damage than unique sequence DNA. In addition, DNA lesions induced by endogenous and exogenous sources increase abasic sites by spontaneous depurination and by removal of damaged bases by DNA glycosylases (reviewed in Ref. 30Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). The experiments described here offer the first indications, to our knowledge, that DNA damage can induce large expansions of triplet repeats. The results imply that DNA damage plays a role in TRE diseases such as myotonic dystrophy and Fragile X syndrome."

The purified RecA protein will promote a variety of DNA pairing reactions that presumably reflect in vivo recombination functions. The most extensively investigated DNA pairing activity is the ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction in which a circular ssDNA1 molecule and a homologous linear dsDNA molecule are recombined to yield a nicked circular dsDNA molecule and a linear ssDNA molecule. This reaction proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, the circular ssDNA substrate is coated with RecA protein to form a presynaptic complex; this complex will catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. In the second phase, the presynaptic complex interacts with a dsDNA molecule, the homologous sequences are brought into register, and pairing between the circular ssDNA and the complementary strand from the dsDNA is initiated. In the third phase, the complementary linear strand is completely transferred to the circular ssDNA by unidirectional branch migration to yield the nicked circular dsDNA and displaced linear ssDNA products (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of the RecA protein indicates that the phosphate groups of the nucleotide cofactor, ATP, are bound by a loop consisting of amino acids 66 through 73 (2Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The sequence of this loop (66GPESSGKT73) corresponds to a variation of the well known phosphate binding loop (P-loop) consensus sequence (G XXXX GK[T/S]) found in many NTP-binding proteins (3Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The invariant lysine and threonine/serine residues in the P-loop motif are generally found to interact directly with the β and γ phosphates of ATP and have been shown for the RecA protein (as well as many other proteins) to be directly involved in the catalysis of phosphoryl transfer (4Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the four variable residues (XXXX) in this sequence can differ widely in different classes of proteins, the specific sequence, G PESS GKT, is highly conserved in over sixty different bacterial RecA proteins (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As part of an investigation of the role of the P-loop in ATP hydrolysis, we prepared a mutant RecA protein in which the serine residue at position 69 was replaced by a glycine. The biochemical properties of the [S69G]RecA protein provide new insight into the coupling of NTP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange and are described in this report. Wild type RecA protein was prepared as described previously (5Cotterill S.M. Satterthwait A.C. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). rATP was from Sigma; dATP, ddATP, [α-32P]rATP, [α-32P]dATP, and [α-32P]ddATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.E. coli SSB was from Promega. Circular ϕX ssDNA ((+)-strand) and circular ϕX dsDNA were from New England Biolabs; linear ϕX dsDNA was prepared from circular ϕX dsDNA as described (6Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Single- and double-stranded DNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm using the conversion factors 36 and 50 μg/ml/A260, respectively. All DNA concentrations are expressed as total nucleotides. The mutant [S69G]RecA gene, in which the nucleotide sequence coding for serine 69 was replaced with a nucleotide sequence coding for glycine, was produced using the QuickChangeTM protocol (Stratagene). The mutagenesis template consisted of pET21a(+) vector (Novagen) containing the wild type recA gene cloned into a Nde I/Hin dIII site. The mutagenesis primers were 5′-ATCTACGGACCGGAAGGCTCCGGTAAAACCACG-3′ and 5′-CGTGGTTTTACCGGAGCCTTCCGGTCCGTAGAT-3′ (the codon for serine 69 is underlined, and the nucleotide mismatch is in bold). The entire [S69G]RecA gene was sequenced to confirm that only the desired changes had been introduced during the mutagenesis procedure. The expression plasmid, pETRecA(S69G), was introduced into the E. coli recA deletion strain, BLR(DE3) (Novagen). The expression of the [S69G]RecA protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration) at A600 0.6 followed by a 3-h incubation at 37 °C. The [S69G]RecA protein was then purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by methods that have been described previously (5Cotterill S.M. Satterthwait A.C. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purified [S69G]RecA protein is shown in Fig. 1. The ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of structurally related nucleoside triphosphates, ATP, dATP, and ddATP, by the wild type and [S69G]RecA proteins was analyzed at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. The reaction solutions contained 30 μm ϕX ssDNA and 1 μm wild type or [S69G]RecA protein; these conditions ensured that there was sufficient ssDNA to bind all of the RecA protein present. The dependence of the rate of NTP hydrolysis on NTP concentration is shown in Fig. 2, and the steady-state kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of each nucleoside triphosphate are presented in Table I.Table IKinetic parameters for wild type and [S69G]RecA protein-catalyzed NTP hydrolysisNTPVmax/[Et]S0.5min−1μmWild typeATP2040dATP2420ddATP2412[S69G]ATP1020dATP3617ddATP209These steady-state kinetic parameters were derived from the data presented in Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab These steady-state kinetic parameters were derived from the data presented in Fig. 2. The wild type RecA protein catalyzed the hydrolysis of the three nucleoside triphosphates at similar rates, with turnover numbers (Vmax/[Et]) of 20, 24, and 24 min−1 for ATP, dATP, and ddATP, respectively. The S0.5 values for each of these nucleoside triphosphates were also similar (12–40 μm) under these reaction conditions. 2S0.5 is the substrate concentration required for half-maximal velocity. The [S69G]RecA protein also catalyzed the hydrolysis of each of the three nucleoside triphosphates. In contrast to the wild type protein, however, the rate of the [S69G]RecA protein-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction depended on the identity of the nucleoside triphosphate, with turnover numbers of 10, 20, and 36 min−1 for ATP, ddATP, and dATP, respectively. Although the turnover numbers differed, the S0.5 values for the three nucleoside triphosphates were similar (9–20 μm) to those determined for the wild type protein. The three-strand exchange activities of the wild type and [S69G]RecA protein were evaluated in the presence of either ATP, dATP, or ddATP. In the three-strand exchange assay, a circular ϕx ssDNA molecule and a linear ϕX dsDNA molecule are recombined to form a nicked circular dsDNA molecule and a linear ssDNA molecule; the substrates and products of this reaction are readily monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis (6Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the wild type RecA protein was able to promote strand exchange in the presence of either ATP, dATP, or ddATP. At early times in the reaction, partially exchanged intermediates are visible. In later time points, these intermediates are replaced by the fully exchanged circular dsDNA product. The rates for the formation of the intermediate structures and the final circular dsDNA products that were obtained with ATP, dATP, and ddATP were similar, indicating that the wild type RecA protein uses these nucleoside triphosphates equally efficiently as cofactors for the strand exchange reaction. The [S69G]RecA protein was also active in the three-strand exchange reaction (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to the wild type protein, however, the rate of the [S69G]RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction varied depending on the nucleoside triphosphate that was supplied as the cofactor. The strand exchange reaction was fastest with dATP and slowest with ATP, with ddATP giving an intermediate rate. Thus, the rates of the [S69G]RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction appeared to parallel the turnover numbers that were measured for the hydrolysis of each of these nucleoside triphosphates by the [S69G]RecA protein (Table I). In order to quantify the rates of the wild type and [S69G]RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reactions, the intensity of the agarose gel bands corresponding to the linear dsDNA substrate, the strand exchange intermediates, and the circular dsDNA strand exchange product at each time point in the reactions shown in Fig. 3 A was measured by scanning densitometry. The percentage of the linear dsDNA substrate that had been converted to the circular dsDNA product was then plotted as a function of time in order to generate time courses for the strand exchange reactions (Fig. 3 B). The rates of strand exchange were then determined from these time course both by 1) determining the time at which the circular dsDNA product first appears (this represents the minimal time required to generate the strand exchange product and provides an estimate of the intrinsic rate of strand exchange), and by 2) determining the time required for each of the strand exchange reactions to reach near-completion (defined operationally as when the level of the circular dsDNA product reaches 80% of the maximal value). The rate of strand exchange by the wild type RecA protein in the presence of ATP, as determined by either of these methods, was assigned a relative rate of 1, and the rate of strand exchange by the wild type protein in the presence of the other nucleoside triphosphates (dATP, ddATP), and the rate of strand exchange by the [S69G]RecA protein in the presence of all three nucleoside triphosphates, were expressed relative to the rate of the wild type RecA/ATP reaction (Table II).Table IIRates of wild type and [S69G]RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchangeNTPTime2-aTime required for the first appearance of the circular dsDNA product (in min).Relative rate2-bTime required for the first appearance of circular dsDNA product, expressed relative to that for the wild type protein reaction in the presence of ATP.Time2-cTime required for the level of the circular dsDNA product to reach 80% of the maximal value (in min).Relative rate2-dTime required for the level of circular dsDNA product to reach 80% of the maximal value, expressed relative to that for the wild type protein reaction in the presence of ATP.minminWild typeATP91161dATP91161ddATP71.3141.1[S69G]ATP110.8270.6dATP51.8101.6ddATP91180.9Relative rates of DNA strand exchange were derived from the data presented in Fig. 3 B.2-a Time required for the first appearance of the circular dsDNA product (in min).2-b Time required for the first appearance of circular dsDNA product, expressed relative to that for the wild type protein reaction in the presence of ATP.2-c Time required for the level of the circular dsDNA product to reach 80% of the maximal value (in min).2-d Time required for the level of circular dsDNA product to reach 80% of the maximal value, expressed relative to that for the wild type protein reaction in the presence of ATP. Open table in a new tab Relative rates of DNA strand exchange were derived from the data presented in Fig. 3 B. As shown in Fig. 3 B and Table II, the strand exchange reaction of the wild type RecA protein proceeded at a similar rate (relative rates ∼ 1) in the presence of either ATP, dATP, or ddATP. In contrast, the strand exchange reaction of the [S69G]RecA protein proceeded at approximately the same rate as the wild type protein reaction in the presence of ddATP (relative rate = 0.9–1.0), slower than the wild type reaction in the presence of ATP (relative rate = 0.6–0.8) and faster than the wild type reaction in the presence of dATP (relative rate = 1.6–1.8). The relative rates of strand exchange were essentially independent of whether the rates were based on the minimal time required for the fully exchanged reaction products to appear or on the time required for the strand exchange reaction to reach near-completion (Table II). In Fig. 4, the relative rates of strand exchange that were determined for the wild type and [S69G]RecA protein with each of the three nucleotide cofactors (TableII) are plotted versus the turnover numbers for the wild type RecA or [S69G]RecA protein-catalyzed hydrolysis of each cofactors (Table I). It is evident from this plot that the observed rate of strand exchange is directly proportional to the rate of hydrolysis of each of the cofactors. This result suggests that the strand exchange reaction is coupled to the hydrolysis of the nucleoside triphosphate cofactor. Although it is well established that the RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction requires ATP, a coupling of ATP hydrolysis to strand exchange has yet to be demonstrated. In a recent study, Cox and co-workers (7Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that the RecA protein-promoted ATP hydrolysis and strand exchange reactions have a similar dependence on temperature over the range of 25–45 °C, a finding that is consistent with a coupling of strand exchange to ATP hydrolysis. Our results with the [S69G]RecA protein, which show that the rate of strand exchange is directly proportional to the turnover number for hydrolysis of the nucleoside triphosphate that is provided as a cofactor, provide additional support for the existence of a coupling of strand exchange to NTP hydrolysis. The role of ATP hydrolysis in the strand exchange reaction is unclear and controversial. It has been shown that the RecA protein is able to promote a limited amount of strand exchange (generally about 1 kb) in presence of the poorly hydrolyzed ATP analog, ATPγS, indicating that nucleotide hydrolysis may not be absolutely required for strand exchange (8Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis, however, has been shown to be required for the strand exchange reaction to proceed in a unidirectional manner and to permit the strand exchange reaction to proceed past lesions, mismatches, and heterologous inserts (9Cox M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 217-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To account for these findings, it has been suggested that in the presence of ATP, an initial pairing reaction may occur in an ATP hydrolysis-independent process, with the resulting nascent hybrid DNA (approximately 1 kb in length) being extended in a unidirectional branch migration reaction that is driven by ATP hydrolysis (10Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In our study of the [S69G]RecA protein, the ϕX DNAs that were used as strand exchange substrates are greater that 5 kb in length, and if there is an initial ATP hydrolysis-independent pairing reaction, a subsequent substantial branch migration phase would still be required in order for the fully exchanged products to be formed. Consequently, the strand exchange reactions that we employed would be expected to be dependent on the hydrolysis of the nucleotide cofactor. Although our results strongly suggest that strand exchange is coupled to the hydrolysis of the nucleoside triphosphate cofactor, they do not specifically define the mechanistic nature of the coupling. Two general models for the role of ATP hydrolysis in the RecA protein strand exchange reaction have been advanced. Cox and co-workers (9Cox M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 217-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have proposed a facilitated diffusion model in which ATP hydrolysis is coupled to a coordinated rotation of the DNA substrates, which in turn results in DNA branch movement. Kowalczykowski and co-workers (11Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on the other hand, have argued that ATP hydrolysis is required only for a dissociation and redistribution of RecA monomers during the exchange of longer DNA substrates and during the bypass of structural barriers in the DNA substrates. Both of these models predict that the rate of strand exchange will be related to the rate of NTP hydrolysis and, therefore, are consistent with the results presented in this paper."

Surprisingly, ATP also had an impact on the 95-kDa subunit, a component of the V0 sector of the V-ATPase. Although the presence of divalent cations had no impact on the V1 sector, the rate of trypsinization of the 95-kDa subunit was greatly enhanced.

Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Organellar acidification is essential for a variety of cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, processing and proteolysis of proteins, intracellular degradation of ingested pathogens and proton-coupled transport of small molecules. The V-ATPase complex contains two distinct structural sectors, a peripheral catalytic complex (V1) mediating ATP hydrolysis and a membrane-associated complex (V0) defining the proton channel proper (for review, see Ref. 1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The soluble catalytic sector of the yeast V-ATPase consists of at least 8 subunits. The catalytic core is composed of a hexamer formed by alternating 69-kDa (Vma1p or A) and 60-kDa (Vma2p or B) subunits symmetrically arranged to generate a hollow core through the middle of the sphere. Vma1p and Vma2p both contain consensus sequences for ATP-binding domains; Vma1p has been ascribed a catalytic function, whereas Vma2p is thought to have a regulatory function. The hollow core formed by the ATP-binding subunits contains a central stalk, which is likely composed of the Vma4p, Vma7p, Vma8p, and Vma10p subunits (27, 14, 32, and 13 kDa, respectively) (2Tomashek J.J.

The function of the V1 subunits Vma13p (54 kDa) and Vma5p (42 kDa) is not known. The membrane-bound V0 complex is composed of at least 5 subunits. The proteolipid believed to form the proton channel (3Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is encoded by three genes, VMA3 (17 kDa), VMA11 (17 kDa), and VMA16 (23 kDa) (4Hirata R. Graham L.A. Taktsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The 100-kDa V0subunit is encoded in yeast by VPH1 (5Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and STV1 (6Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vph1p and Stv1p are functional homologues, but they are targeted to different organelles within the cell, suggesting that this subunit is involved in the differential regulation of V-ATPase activity. The function of the 36-kDa V0 subunit, Vma6p, is not known. The V-type and the mitochondrial F-type ATPases share a common structural architecture. The F-type ATPases are also defined by a bipartite structure with a hydrophilic catalytic sector (F1) and a hydrophobic proton-conducting component (F0) (7Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota III. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. III. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 57-83Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the F1ATPase sector shows the catalytic (β) and regulatory (α) subunits arranged in an alternating hexagonal circular array, with the nucleotide binding sites localized to the β-α interface (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). The catalytic binding sites are located in the β-subunit with the noncatalytic sites restricted to the α-subunit. Because of the structural similarity between the ATPases, the catalytic and noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites in the V1 sector are likely to be similarly arranged. Several lines of evidence substantiate that the A subunit of the V-ATPases contains the catalytic binding sites. The A subunit contains all the consensus loops, including a glycine-rich loop region (9Hirata R. Ohsumk Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that was identified as critical for ATP hydrolysis in the β-subunit of the F-ATPases. In addition, the inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oza-1,3-diazole label the A subunit by covalently modifying a critical cysteine residue in the ATP binding site (10Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of a single cysteine residue within the glycine-rich loop yields a fully active protein resistant to both inhibitors (12Taiz L. Nelson H. Maggert K. Morgan L. Yatabe B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11750-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Finally, photolabeling of the A subunit with 2-azido-[32P]ATP correlates directly with inhibition of ATPase activity (14Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Current experimental evidence suggests that the nucleotide binding sites within the B subunit are noncatalytic. Although modification with photoaffinity analogues (3–0-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (15Manolson M.F. Rea P.A. Poole R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12273-12279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 2-azido-[32P]ATP (14Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) has demonstrated the presence of nucleotide binding sites within the B subunit, there is little evidence to suggest that these sites are catalytic in nature. The absence of a glycine-rich consensus sequence within the B subunit supports this conclusion. The impact of nucleotide binding on the conformation of the V1 catalytic and regulatory subunits remains unclear. The available data is contradictory; some evidence suggests that ATP binding to the catalytic subunit does not induce a conformational change, as assayed by alterations in sensitivity to proteolytic degradation (16Adachi I. Arai H. Pimental R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 960-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, conditions optimal for ATP hydrolysis promote the dissociation of the peripheral sector from the membrane, suggesting that catalysis induces a conformational change within V1 that facilitates its release (17Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the yeast catalytic subunit demonstrated that loss of activity impaired removal of the peripheral complex by KNO3(19Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that the catalytic subunit alters its conformation in response to substrate binding and/or hydrolysis. Dissociation of the V1V0 complex results in a loss of proton translocation and ATP hydrolysis, with complex reassociation restoring both activities (20Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The ability to reassociate into an active complex demonstrates that both sectors are functionally interdependent although remaining structurally independent in isolation. The structural independence of the two sectors has been demonstrated in vivo (22Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants lacking a single subunit of the enzyme yielded assembled cytosolic V1 sectors in the absence of a V0 subunit, and membrane-associated assembled V0 sectors in the absence of a V1 constituent (22Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their structural autonomy, physical coupling of the two sectors is essential for activity, suggesting that protein subunits of a given sector may be responsive to conformational changes within its functional counterparts. As physical interactions between the two sectors is an absolute requirement for function, a number of structural links must exist to allow for sector interaction. To date, no such link has been identified for V-ATPases. Here, we present evidence suggesting that Vph1p is part of the structural link. The Vph1p subunit is unique to V-ATPases. Hydropathy analysis of Vph1p predicts two distinct structural domains, a hydrophilic NH2-terminal domain (∼50 kDa) and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain (∼50 kDa) that contains 6–8 putative membrane-spanning regions. Through the use of limited proteolysis of intact vacuolar membranes and immunoblotting, as well as immunofluorescence, we have unambiguously localized the NH2terminus of Vph1p to the cytosol. The disposition of the NH2-terminal Vph1p domain toward the cytosolic space would permit physical interactions of Vph1p with protein subunits of the V1 sector. Because of its unique bipartite structure and its structural responsiveness to substrate binding, we propose that Vph1p is ideally suited to serve as a structural and functional link between the two sectors of the V-ATPase. Zymolyase was purchased from ICN Biochemicals and bafilomycin A1 from Kamiya Biomedical Company. The strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiase used were the protease-deficient BJ926 (Mat a/α, trp1/+, +/his1, prc1–126/prc1–126, pep4–3/pep4–3, prb1–1122/prb1–1122, can1/can1, gal2/gal2), MM108 (Mat α vma1Δ::URA3, his4, ura3–52) bearing a disruption of the 69-kDa catalytic subunit (Vma1p), and MM53 (α ura3–52 Δvph1::LEU2), which bears a disruption of the 95-kDa V-ATPase subunit, Vph1p. The strain BJ1991 (Matα pep4–3, leu2, trp1, ura3–52, prbl-1122) was also used. The protease-deficient yeast strain PK22 (Mat α pep4–3, vma2Δ1, ura3–52, his4–519, ade6, gal2) that is disrupted for the 60-kDa regulatory subunit, Vma2p, was kindly supplied by Dr. Patricia M. Kane, State University of New York Health Science Center, Syracuse, NY. Wild type yeast cells were grown overnight in 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% dextrose (YEPD medium). The Δvma1 and Δvma2 strains were grown in YEPD adjusted to pH 5.0 with HCl, because cells lacking vacuolar ATPase activity grow optimally in acidified medium (23Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Isolation of transport-competent vacuolar membrane vesicles through flotation of intact vacuoles on Ficoll gradients was performed as described in (5Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A.

Protein concentrations of vacuolar vesicles were measured by Lowry assays. Purified vacuolar membranes were subjected to controlled trypsin proteolysis in the following manner: 20 μg of purified vacuolar membranes in 25 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.8, 25 mm KCl were incubated with varying concentrations of trypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. In addition, 5 mm of nucleotide (ATP, ADP, or ATPγS) and 5 mm divalent cation (MgCl2 or CaCl2) were included during proteolysis as indicated for each experiment. The final reaction volume was 100 μl. Trypsin proteolysis was inhibited by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm and tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone to a final concentration of 5 mmfollowed by incubation on ice for 15 min. Samples were denatured by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer, assayed by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar), and immunoblotting as described by Olmsted (25Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic digests performed in the presence of ADP or ADP·Mg were treated as described above with a final concentration of 5 mm ADP and 5 mm MgCl2. Samples prepared in the presence of bafilomycin A1 were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature. Bafilomycin A1was prepared in Me2SO and added to a final concentration of 1 μm. Control samples were corrected for the addition of Me2SO. The integrity of the purified vacuolar membranes to exogenously added proteases was assayed by the ability of protease K to cleave pro-carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) to its mature form in the absence and presence of detergent. Intact vacuoles purified from BJ1991 were resuspended at 0.5 μg/μl in 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, and 30 μg/ml protease K in the presence or absence of 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 0, 2, 10, and 20 min, respectively. Proteolytic digests were terminated at the designated times with the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 22.2 mm followed immediately by protein precipitation with ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid. Protein pellets were washed in ice-cold acetone to remove residual acid and denatured for SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to CPY, 10A5-B5 (Molecular Probes). The antigen for immunization of the rabbits was keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated via a cysteine group to the nonadecapeptide (VSEL[E → G]ELG[K → L]VQFRDLNPDV) corresponding to residues 26 to 44 of the rat 116-kDa subunit, with bolded residues changed as indicated to correspond more closely with the yeast Vph1p sequence. Each rabbit was injected with 1 mg of peptide/carrier in Freund's complete adjuvant. At days 20, 38, 45, and 60 each rabbit was re-injected with 1 mg of labeled keyhole limpet hemocyanin in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Rabbits were sacrificed at day 70. Serum was collected by incubating the rabbit's blood at 37 °C until coagulation, centrifuging the sample, and then collecting the supernatant. Immunoglobulins were precipitated from raw sera by 50% (NH4)2SO4, the pellet was resuspended to 50% of the original volume, and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.9% NaCl. Whole yeast homogenate prepared from a Δvph1 mutant strain was prepared as described (6Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was incubated with blocking buffer routinely used for immunoblotting (25Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dialysate and blot were incubated for 1 h to absorb any anti-yeast immunoglobulins with the obvious exception of anti-Vph1p antibodies. Anti-NH2 terminus Vph1p antibodies were purified using the method described by Manolson et al. (5Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase subunits were detected with one of the following antibodies: 1) a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the catalytic 69-kDa V-ATPase A subunit purified from Beta Vulgaris L. (described in Ref. 26Manolson M.F. Percy J.M. Apps D.K. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Harrison M. Clarke D.J. Poole R.J. Biochem.

Slides for immunofluorescence were prepared exactly as described by Manolson et al. (6Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were viewed with a Nikon epifluorescence Diaphot-TMD microscope. Images were photographically recorded on Kodak TMAX film with resulting pictures subsequently digitized. The primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit affinity-purified anti-Vph1p was diluted 1:50, and rabbit affinity-purified anti-NH2 terminus Vph1p was diluted 1:25. The secondary antibody used was CY3 at a dilution of 1:1,000. Currently, 9 primary amino acid sequences, deduced from cDNA, are available for the 95-kDa subunit of V-ATPase; yeast Vph1p (M89778), yeast Stv1p (V06465), rat Vpp1 (M58758), mouse TJ6 (M31226), Neurospora crassa (3929395), Caenorhabditis elegans VPP1 (211115), human (Z711460), human osteoclast (U45285), and bovine (L31770). Because multiple sequence-based secondary structure predictions are substantially more accurate (28Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar), the above sequences were aligned and used to identify putative transmembrane segments. These sequences were submitted to the PHD mail server described by Rost et al. (29Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar). The data obtained from the PHD algorithm, coupled with topological data presented in this paper, were utilized to generate a topological folding model of Vph1p. Physical coupling of the V1 and V0subunits is a requirement for catalysis and proton translocation. Consequently, structural changes within one sector likely impact on the conformation of the other sector. Moreover, dissociation of V1 from V0 is enhanced in the presence of ATP·Mg, suggesting that substrate binding results in conformational changes within the V1 sector, allowing for its release. These issues were addressed by a careful analysis of conformational changes induced within subunits of both sectors, as assayed by limited trypsin proteolysis. Analysis of conformational changes induced within the catalytic and regulatory subunits of the V-ATPase by nucleotide, cofactor, and inhibitor binding was undertaken. Limited tryptic digests of purified vacuolar membranes were performed in the presence of nucleotides (ATP or ADP) and/or magnesium. Proteolytic products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the catalytic subunit, Vma1p (Fig.1). As previously noted (16Adachi I. Arai H. Pimental R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 960-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ATP had no protective effect on the catalytic subunit. Also, neither ADP nor ADP·Mg had a protective effect on Vma1p (Fig. 1, panels B and C). In contrast, the rate of trypsinization of Vma1p was retarded in the presence of ATP·Mg (Fig. 1, panel E, lane 4). These results demonstrate that only the endogenous V-ATPase substrate can induce a conformational change in the catalytic subunit. Photolabeling experiments have identified a nucleotide binding site on Vma2p, a putative regulatory subunit of the V-ATPase complex (14Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Manolson M.F. Rea P.A. Poole R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12273-12279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Peng S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16926-16931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reconstituted recombinant subunit B can be labeled by radioactive nucleotides in a divalent cation (Mg2+ and Ca2+)-dependent manner (30Peng S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16926-16931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that ATP did not alter the pattern or rate of trypsinization of the B subunit (16Adachi I. Arai H. Pimental R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 960-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that ATP·Mg renders the catalytic subunit resistant to trypsin proteolysis and that ATP labeling of the B subunit is cation-dependent, experiments were undertaken to determine whether the presence of nucleotides and/or cations alter the proteolytic susceptibility of Vma2p. Partially purified vacuolar membranes were treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin in the absence or presence of ATP. Proteolytic products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and assayed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, panels A and B) with two different antibodies to identify the maximum number of trypsin-generated peptides. Vma2p was more sensitive than the catalytic subunit to proteolytic degradation under all conditions assayed, requiring the use of much lower trypsin concentrations (0.01 μg/ml to 0.25 μg/ml). Trypsin degradation of Vma2p was accelerated in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2, panels A and B, lanes 6–9) and further enhanced with ATP·Mg (Fig. 2, panels A and B, lanes 10–13). Particularly striking was the generation of a 30-kDa peptide in samples treated with 0.25 μg/ml trypsin in the presence of ATP·Mg (indicated by line). This peptide was not detected in samples treated with identical trypsin concentrations in the absence of nucleotide and cofactor. The 30-kDa peptide is not the result of a novel cleavage site unmasked by the presence of ATP·Mg, because an identical product was detected in samples treated with higher trypsin concentrations (>0.3 μg/ml) in the absence of nucleotide and/or magnesium. This result demonstrates increased proteolytic susceptibility of Vma2p in the presence of ATP·Mg. The question remains as to whether these nucleotide-mediated conformational effects are due to direct binding to Vma2p or a consequence of nucleotide binding to Vma1p. Efforts to restrict nucleotide binding (via photolabeling with azido-ATP) to Vma1p to determine whether labeling at the catalytic site was sufficient to render the Vma2p more proteolytically sensitive, proved inconclusive. Incubation of the V-ATPase complex with ATP·Mg leads to the dissociation of the V1 sector from the membrane-bound V0 sector (18Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of V-ATPases with N-ethylmaleimide at inhibiting concentrations prevents release of the V1 sector (11Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation, coupled with data presented here, suggests that ATP·Mg binding induces a dramatic conformational change within Vma1p and Vma2p. This structural change, once transmitted to the remaining complex, allows for dissociation of the two sectors. Thus binding of ATP·Mg to the catalytic and regulatory subunits may induce a conformational change(s) in additional subunits within the V-ATPase complex. Of particular interest are conformational changes induced within the V0 complex, demonstrating a structural interdependence between the two sectors. Our efforts focused on the 95-kDa subunit (Vph1p) for a number of reasons. Hydropathy analysis of Vph1p predicts a large hydrophilic amino-terminal domain and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain with 6–8 putative transmembrane segments (5Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the topology of Vph1p has not been elucidated, proteolytic digests and labeling with impermeant reagents have demonstrated that regions of the protein are cytosolically exposed (31Adachi I. Puopolo K. Marquez-Sterling N. Arai H. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 967-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2083164489,"The RecA protein from the Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, has been reported to catalyze dATP hydrolysis and to promote strand exchange in the presence of dATP but to have no ATP hydrolysis or ATP-dependent strand exchange activity (Lovett, C. M., Jr., and Roberts, J. W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3305–3313). The well characterized RecA protein from Escherichia coli, in contrast, catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP and dATP at similar rates and can use either ATP or dATP as a cofactor for the strand exchange reaction. To explore this reported difference in nucleotide cofactor specificity in detail, we developed an overexpression system for the B. subtilis RecA protein and purified the protein to greater than 95% homogeneity. Contrary to the previous report, we find that the B. subtilis RecA protein catalyzes the hydrolysis of both dATP and ATP and can perform strand exchange using either dATP or ATP as a cofactor. Our results suggest that the inability of previous investigators to detect the ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent strand exchange activities of the B. subtilis RecA protein may have been due to the particular assay conditions that were used in the earlier study.

The purified RecA protein will promote a variety of DNA pairing reactions that presumably reflect in vivo recombination functions. The most extensively investigated DNA pairing activity is the ATP-dependent three strand exchange reaction in which a circular ssDNA1 molecule and a homologous linear dsDNA molecule are recombined to yield a nicked circular dsDNA molecule and a linear ssDNA molecule. This reaction proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, the circular ssDNA substrate is coated with RecA protein forming a presynaptic complex that can catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi; presynaptic complex formation is stimulated strongly by the E. coli SSB protein, which melts out secondary structure in the ssDNA and allows RecA protein to assemble more efficiently on the ssDNA. In the second phase, the presynaptic complex interacts with a linear dsDNA molecule, and pairing between the circular ssDNA and the complementary strand from the linear dsDNA is initiated. In the third phase, the complementary linear strand is completely transferred to the circular ssDNA by unidirectional branch migration to yield the nicked circular dsDNA and displaced linear ssDNA products (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli RecA protein catalyzes the ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of both ATP and dATP and can use either ATP or dATP as a cofactor for the strand exchange reaction (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Menge K.L. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 3Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5871-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the RecA protein from the Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, has been reported to catalyze dATP hydrolysis and to promote strand exchange in the presence of dATP but to have no ATP hydrolysis or ATP-dependent strand exchange activity (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study this physiologically and mechanistically intriguing difference in cofactor specificity in detail, we cloned the B. subtilis recA gene from B. subtilis genomic DNA, overexpressed the protein in a recA deletion E. coli strain, and purified the B. subtilis RecA protein to greater than 95% homogeneity. In contrast to the published report, we find that the B. subtilis RecA protein can catalyze the hydrolysis of both ATP and dATP and can promote DNA strand exchange with either of these nucleotides as cofactors. E. coli RecA protein was prepared as described previously (5Cotterill S.M. Satterthwait A.C. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). E. coli SSB was provided by Dr. Roger McMacken (Johns Hopkins University). ATP, dATP, [α-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Circular ϕX ssDNA ((+)-strand) and circular ϕX dsDNA were from New England Biolabs; linear ϕX dsDNA was prepared from circular ϕX dsDNA by Pst I digestion as described (6Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Single- and double-stranded DNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm using the conversion factors 36 and 50 μg/ml/A260, respectively. All DNA concentrations are expressed as total nucleotides. Genomic DNA was isolated from the rec+ B. subtilis strain YB886 (7Marrero R. Yasbin R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 335-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using standard procedures (8Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 2.4.1-2.4.5Google Scholar). The B. subtilis recA gene was amplified from the genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The primers used (5′GGAGGCAT ATG AGTGATCGTCAGGCAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGGGATCCTTA TTATTCTTCAAATTCGAGTTCTTCTTGTGTC-3′) were complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding sequence (italics) and also contained “GA clamp” sequences (GGAGG) to facilitate the polymerase chain reaction as well as recognition sequences for the restriction enzymes Nde I and Bam HI (underlined). The blunt-ended DNA product that was obtained from the polymerase chain reaction was ligated into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli strain JM107. Plasmid DNA containing the desired insert was isolated, and the insert DNA was excised by Nde I/Bam HI digestion. The insert was ligated into pET-21a (Novagen) to give the final construct, pETrecA(BS). The coding region of the insert was sequenced by the Johns Hopkins University DNA Sequencing Facility and was found to be identical to that reported previously for the B. subtilis recA gene by Stranathan et al. (9Stranathan M.C. Bayles K.W. Yasbin R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 2The sequence that we determined for the B. subtilis recA gene is identical to that originally reported by Stranathan et al. (9Stranathan M.C. Bayles K.W. Yasbin R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and is not consistent with a revised version of the sequence that is presently in the GenBankTM data base. We feel that the revised sequence is unlikely to be correct inasmuch as the revision eliminates a highly conserved region of homology between the B. subtilis RecA protein and over 60 other bacterial RecA proteins. The B. subtilis recA gene was expressed in the recA deletion E. coli strain BLR(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Competent BLR pLysS cells were transformed with pETrecA(BS) and selected for growth on LB/carbenicillin plates. Individual BLR(DE3)pLysS/pETrecA(BS) colonies were used to inoculate LB broth (3 liters) containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml). The cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, and then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce expression of the B. subtilis RecA protein. After 3 h at 37 °C, the cells (16 g) were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 16 ml of 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 25% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The following protein purification steps were then carried out at 4 °C. The frozen cell suspension was thawed on ice, and 14 ml of lysozyme (2.5 mg/ml) was added. After 30 min, 14 ml of EDTA (25 mm) was added and the incubation was continued. After 15 min, 54 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1% Brij 35, 1 mm DTT was added, and the incubation was continued for 45 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was discarded and 1.9 ml of Polymin-P (10%, pH 7.9) was added to the supernatant. After 1 h, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was suspended in 10 ml of R buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) and 0.5 m NaCl. The suspension was centrifuged as described above, and the supernatant was again discarded. The pellet was suspended in 10 ml of R buffer, 1.0m NaCl and kept for 1 h. The suspension was centrifuged as before, and the pellet was discarded. Ammonium sulfate (0.34 g/ml final concentration) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was washed with 5 ml of R buffer, 1 m NaCl, ammonium sulfate (0.34 g/ml) and then with 5 ml of R buffer, 1 mNaCl, ammonium sulfate (0.3 g/ml). The pellet was suspended in R buffer, 0.5 m NaCl and dialyzed overnight against R buffer, 0.5 m NaCl. The dialysate was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Blue column (5 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with R buffer, 0.5 m NaCl. The column was washed with 0.5 m NaCl (40 ml), 1.0 m NaCl (40 ml), and 2.0 m NaCl (80 ml). The protein-containing fractions from the 2.0 m NaCl wash were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of R buffer, 0.1 m NaCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.42 g/ml, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in R buffer, 0.1 m NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialysate was loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin column (10 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient of R buffer, 0.1–1.0 m NaCl. The protein-containing fractions (centered at 0.28 m NaCl) were pooled and dialyzed overnight against R buffer, 20% glycerol, 0.1m NaCl to yield the final fraction (13 mg) of purified, nuclease-free B. subtilis RecA protein (Fig. 1). The concentration of the purified B. subtilis RecA protein was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using the extinction coefficient of 0.59 A280mg−1ml determined for the E. coli RecA protein (6Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar); this concentration was consistent with that determined by comparing the gel electrophoresis band intensity of the B. subtilis RecA protein with that of a known amount of E. coli RecA protein (Fig. 1). Linear matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometric analysis of the purified B. subtilis RecA protein was carried out by the Scripps Research Institute Mass Spectrometry Center. Amino-terminal protein sequencing was carried out by the Johns Hopkins Protein/Peptide Sequencing Facility. In the report from Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the B. subtilis RecA protein was purified directly from B. subtilis cells. Although mitomycin C was added to the cell culture to induce expression of the protein, the B. subtilis RecA protein represented only 0.05% of the total protein in the crude cell extract, and only 0.4 mg of purified RecA protein was obtained from 42 g of cells. To develop an improved purification procedure, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the B. subtilis recA gene from genomic B. subtilis DNA; the sequence of our amplified gene was identical to that reported previously for the B. subtilis RecA protein (9Stranathan M.C. Bayles K.W. Yasbin R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).2 We then cloned the B. subtilis recA gene into a pET21a expression vector and expressed the protein in the recA deletion E. coli strain, BLR(DE3)pLysS. With this expression system, the B. subtilis RecA protein corresponded to approximately 10% of the total protein in the crude cell extract, and we were able to obtain 13 mg of highly purified protein from 16 g of cells (Fig. 1). Although the molecular weight of the B. subtilis RecA protein calculated from the gene sequence (Mr 38,059; 348 amino acids) is similar to that of the E. coli RecA protein (Mr 37,842; 352 amino acids), the mobility of the B. subtilis RecA protein was lower than that of the E. coli RecA protein during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). This difference in mobility was also noted by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who estimated the molecular weight of the B. subtilis RecA protein to be 42,000 (this estimate was made before the gene sequence had been determined). Mass spectroscopic analysis of our purified B. subtilis RecA protein, however, yielded a molecular weight of 38,029 ± 38, in excellent agreement with the molecular weight of 38,059 that was calculated from the gene sequence. Amino-terminal protein sequencing confirmed that our preparation corresponded to the B. subtilis RecA protein. The B. subtilis RecA protein was analyzed for ssDNA-dependent ATP and dATP hydrolysis activity at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. The reaction solutions contained 1 μm B. subtilis RecA protein and 30 μm ϕX ssDNA; these conditions ensured that there was sufficient ssDNA to bind all of the B. subtilis RecA protein present, assuming that the ssDNA binding stoichiometry of the B. subtilis protein is similar to that of the E. coli protein (1 RecA monomer/3 nucleotides of ssDNA (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The dependence of the rate of ssDNA-dependent ATP and dATP hydrolysis on NTP concentration is shown in Fig. 2, and the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of each NTP by the B. subtilis RecA protein (as well as those for the E. coli RecA protein) are presented in TableI.Table IKinetic parameters for E. coli and B. subtilis RecA protein-catalyzed NTP hydrolysis (pH 7.5)NTPVmax/EtS0.5min−1μmB. subtilisATP1050dATP1440E. coliATP1845dATP2220The steady state kinetic parameters for the B. subtilis recA protein were derived from the data presented in Fig. 2.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (ATP) and Nayak and Bryant, unpublished results (dATP). As shown in Fig. 2, our preparation of the B. subtilis RecA protein catalyzed the hydrolysis of both dATP and ATP. The turnover numbers (Vmax/Et) for hydrolysis were 10 min−1 for ATP and 14 min−1for dATP, and the S0.5 values were 50 and 40 μm for ATP and dATP, respectively. 3S0.5 is the substrate concentration required for half-maximal velocity and is used in place of Km because of the cooperative dependence of RecA protein-catalyzed NTP hydrolysis on NTP concentration. Under the same conditions, the E. coli RecA protein catalyzes ATP and dATP hydrolysis with turnover numbers of 18 min−1 for ATP and 22 min−1 for dATP and with S0.5 values of 45 and 20 μm for ATP and dATP, respectively (Table I). There was no detectable hydrolysis of dATP or ATP by either the B. subtilis or the E. coli RecA protein in the absence of ssDNA (time courses not shown). Although the kinetic parameters that we determined for dATP hydrolysis are similar to those reported by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these previous investigators were unable to detect any ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity with their preparation of B. subtilis RecA protein. Our standard reaction conditions (30 μmϕX ssDNA, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT), however, differed from those used by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M.

In addition, the concentration of the B. subtilis RecA protein in our reactions (1 μm) was higher than that used by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (0.4 μm). In an effort to determine the basis for the discrepancy between our results and those of Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we measured the dATP and ATP hydrolysis activities of the B. subtilis RecA protein over a range of protein concentrations, in both our standard reaction buffer and in the reaction buffer used by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, the specific activity (defined as the observed rate of NTP hydrolysis/total RecA concentration) for ATP and dATP hydrolysis by the B. subtilis RecA protein is plotted as a function of protein concentration. In our standard reaction buffer, the specific activity of ATP and dATP hydrolysis was only slightly dependent on protein concentration with values of 7–11 min−1 (ATP) and 10–14 min−1 (dATP) over a range of 0.2 to 2.0 μm B. subtilis RecA protein. In the reaction buffer used by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at B. subtilis RecA protein concentrations of 0.4 μm and higher, the specific activity of ATP and dATP hydrolysis was again only slightly dependent on protein concentration with values of 4–5 min−1 (ATP) and 8–9 min−1 (dATP) over the range of 0.4 to 2.0 μm B. subtilis RecA protein. At protein concentrations lower than 0.4 μm, however, the specific activity of ATP and dATP hydrolysis in the Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) buffer decreased sharply with protein concentration; at 0.2 μm B. subtilis RecA protein, neither ATP nor dATP hydrolysis was detected with the Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) buffer. This loss of NTP hydrolysis activity over a narrow range of B. subtilis RecA protein concentrations below 0.4 μm (the concentration used by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) may have contributed to the inability of these investigators to detect the ATP hydrolysis activity of the B. subtilis RecA protein under their reaction conditions. The strand exchange activity of the B. subtilis RecA protein was evaluated using the same three strand exchange reaction that was used by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in their characterization of the B. subtilis RecA protein. In this reaction, which was originally developed for the E. coli RecA protein, a circular ϕX ssDNA molecule and a linear ϕX dsDNA molecule are recombined to form a nicked circular dsDNA molecule and a linear ssDNA molecule. E. coli SSB protein, which strongly stimulates the strand exchange reaction promoted by the E. coli RecA protein, is included in the reaction solution (6Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, our preparation of B. subtilis RecA protein was able to promote strand exchange in the presence of either dATP or ATP. The detection of the ATP-dependent strand exchange activity, however, was dependent on the order in which the B. subtilis RecA protein and E. coli SSB were added to the reaction solution. The reactions shown in Fig. 4 A were initiated by the addition of E. coli SSB after all other reaction components had been incubated at 37 °C. In contrast, if the reactions were initiated by the addition of B. subtilis RecA protein after all other reaction components had been incubated at 37 °C, a significant strand exchange reaction was detected with dATP but no activity was detected with ATP (Fig. 4 B). This sensitivity of the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction to the order of addition may account for the inability of Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to detect strand exchange by the B. subtilis RecA protein in the presence of ATP (the citation provided in their paper indicates that their reactions were initiated by adding B. subtilis RecA protein after the E. coli SSB). In contrast to the behavior of the B. subtilis RecA protein, the ATP- and dATP-dependent strand exchange reactions of the E. coli RecA protein proceeded with similar efficiencies regardless of whether the reactions were initiated by the addition of E. coli SSB (Fig. 4 A) or by the addition of E. coli RecA protein (Fig. 4 B). The reason for the sensitivity of the strand exchange activity of the B. subtilis RecA protein to the order in which the E. coli SSB and B. subtilis RecA proteins are added to the reaction solution is not clear. However, it has been shown that the E. coli RecA protein is able to displace E. coli SSB protein from ssDNA in the presence of either ATP or dATP (11Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast, the results in Fig. 4 B suggest that the B. subtilis RecA protein may be able to displace E. coli SSB from ssDNA in the presence of dATP but not in the presence of ATP. If this is the case, then when B. subtilis RecA protein and ssDNA are incubated in the presence of nucleotide cofactor before the reaction is initiated by the addition of SSB, the B. subtilis RecA protein may be able to form presynaptic complexes on the ssDNA and carry out strand exchange without interference from the SSB. Therefore, strand exchange is observed with both ATP and dATP when this order of addition is followed (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, when the ssDNA is incubated with E. coli SSB before the reaction is initiated by the addition of B. subtilis RecA protein, the B. subtilis RecA protein may be able to displace the E. coli SSB from the ssDNA when dATP is present but not when ATP is supplied as the cofactor. Consequently, when this order of addition is followed, strand exchange is detected with dATP but not with ATP (Fig. 4 B). To test this idea, we examined the ssDNA-dependent ATP and dATP hydrolysis activities of the B. subtilis and E. coli RecA proteins in the presence and absence of E. coli SSB. The reaction solutions contained 5.7 μmϕX ssDNA, 2.0 μm B. subtilis or E. coli RecA protein, and either 0 or 0.3 μm E. coli SSB. In all cases, the NTP hydrolysis reactions were initiated by the addition of RecA protein. Under these conditions, which simulate those used for the strand exchange reaction shown in Fig. 4 B, there is a sufficient amount of both RecA protein and E. coli SSB to completely cover all of the ssDNA present; maximal rates of ATP and dATP hydrolysis will occur when the ssDNA is completely covered by RecA protein. The time courses of ATP and dATP hydrolysis that were determined for the B. subtilis and E. coli RecA proteins in the presence and absence of E. coli SSB are shown in Fig.5. Note that in this section, the observed rates of dATP or ATP hydrolysis are reported (rather than turnover numbers), because the exact number of B. subtilis or E. coli RecA monomers that can bind to a ϕX ssDNA molecule and be activated for ATP or dATP hydrolysis is not clear. In the absence of E. coli SSB, the E. coli RecA protein catalyzed ATP and dATP hydrolysis at rates of 14 and 32 μm min−1, respectively (Fig. 5 A). Because ATP and dATP are hydrolyzed with similar turnover numbers when ssDNA is in excess relative to RecA protein (Table I), the variation in hydrolysis rates that is observed under strand exchange conditions (Fig. 5 A, where ssDNA is limiting) likely reflects differences in the degree to which the E. coli RecA protein can bind to regions of secondary structure in the ssDNA (and thereby be activated for NTP hydrolysis) in the presence of each cofactor. Under the same conditions, the B. subtilis RecA protein hydrolyzed ATP and dATP at rates of only 4 and 8 μmmin−1, respectively (Fig. 5 B). Because the turnover numbers that were measured for the B. subtilis RecA protein-catalyzed ATP and dATP hydrolysis in the presence of excess ssDNA are only 2-fold lower than those measured for E. coli RecA protein (Table I), the 4-fold lower rates of dATP and ATP hydrolysis by the B. subtilis RecA protein under strand exchange conditions (Fig. 5 B) indicate that the B. subtilis RecA protein may be less effective than the E. coli RecA protein in binding to regions of secondary structure in ssDNA, at least under these reaction conditions. In the presence of E. coli SSB, the rates of ATP and dATP hydrolysis by the E. coli RecA protein increased to 24 and 46 μm min−1, respectively (Fig.5 A, the lag in the ATP hydrolysis reaction time course likely reflects the time-dependent displacement of E. coli SSB from the ssDNA). The stimulation of E. coli RecA protein-catalyzed ATP and dATP hydrolysis by E. coli SSB has been described previously and has been attributed to the melting of secondary structure in the ssDNA by SSB, which otherwise impedes the binding of the E. coli RecA protein. In the presence of ATP or dATP, the E. coli RecA protein can then displace the E. coli SSB from the ssDNA. As a result, more E. coli RecA protein can bind to the ssDNA, and the observed rate of ATP or dATP hydrolysis increases (11Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9315-9320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with the E. coli RecA protein, the addition of E. coli SSB increased the rate of the B. subtilis RecA protein-catalyzed dATP hydrolysis reaction to 15 μmmin−1 but completely eliminated the ATP hydrolysis activity (Fig. 5 B). These results are consistent with the suggestion that the B. subtilis RecA protein can displace E. coli SSB from ssDNA in the presence of dATP but not in the presence of ATP. This, in turn, provides an explanation for why ATP-dependent strand exchange is not observed when the B. subtilis RecA protein is added to the reaction solution after the ssDNA has been incubated with E. coli SSB. Our results demonstrate that the RecA protein from B. subtilis can catalyze the ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of both dATP and ATP. The turnover numbers for ATP and dATP hydrolysis are similar and nearly independent of protein concentration when measured under our standard reaction conditions. Under the reaction conditions used by Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, there is a loss of NTP hydrolysis activity at protein concentrations below approximately 0.4 μm. This phenomenon may account for the inability of these investigators to detect the ATP hydrolysis activity of the B. subtilis RecA protein (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the B. subtilis and E. coli RecA proteins can both hydrolyze either ATP or dATP, the B. subtilis protein differs from the E. coli protein in that its ATP hydrolysis reaction is inhibited, rather than stimulated, by E. coli SSB. This inhibition, which may be due to the inability of the B. subtilis RecA protein to displace E. coli SSB from ssDNA in the presence of ATP, is apparently responsible for the sensitivity of the B. subtilis RecA-promoted strand exchange reaction to the order in which B. subtilis RecA protein and E. coli SSB are added to the reaction solutions. The inhibitory effect is such that when strand exchange is initiated by the addition of the B. subtilis RecA protein to an otherwise complete reaction, no strand exchange is detected with ATP. This effect may account for the inability of Lovett and Roberts (4Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to detect strand exchange by B. subtilis RecA protein in the presence of ATP. We show here, however, that if the B. subtilis RecA protein is incubated with the ssDNA and ATP before E. coli SSB is added, a vigorous strand exchange reaction does occur. This result demonstrates that the B. subtilis RecA protein can use ATP as a cofactor for the strand exchange reaction. 4The properties of the B. subtilis RecA protein are reminiscent of the previously described mutant E. coli RecA430 protein. The E. coli RecA430 protein competes more effectively with SSB for ssDNA binding in the presence of dATP than with ATP and as a result, shows a strong preference for dATP over ATP as a cofactor in the three strand exchange reaction (13Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The apparent differences in the ATP-dependent strand exchange activities of the E. coli and B. subtilis RecA proteins may be attributable to the fact that E. coli SSB protein was used as an accessory factor for both proteins. It is conceivable that the B. subtilis RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction would proceed more efficiently in the presence of ATP if the SSB protein from B. subtilis was used instead of the E. coli SSB protein. Although the gene for the B. subtilis SSB protein has been identified (14Kunst F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar), a purification and characterization of the B. subtilis SSB protein has not yet been reported. It may be desirable to isolate the B. subtilis SSB protein for use as a strand exchange accessory factor before a more extensive investigation of the B. subtilis RecA protein is undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W2004633365,"The spike (S) glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) plays a major role in the viral pathogenesis. It is often processed into the N-terminal S1 and the C-terminal S2 subunits that were evidently important for binding to cell receptor and inducing cell-cell fusion, respectively. As a consequence of cell-cell fusion, most of the naturally occurring infections of MHV are associated with syncytia formation. So far, only MHV-2 was identified to be fusion-negative. In this study, the S gene of MHV-2 was molecularly cloned, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The MHV-2 S protein lacks a 12-amino acid stretch in the S1 hypervariable region from amino acid residue 446 to 457 when compared with the fusion-positive strain MHV-JHM. In addition, there are three amino acid substitutions in the S2 subunit, Tyr-1144 to Asp, Glu-1165 to Asp, and Arg-1209 to Lys. The cloned MHV-2 S protein exhibited the fusion-negative property in DBT cells as the intrinsic viral protein. Furthermore, similar to the fusion-positive MHV-JHM strain, proteolytic cleavage activity was detected both in DBT cells infected with the fusion-negative MHV-2 and in the transfected cells that expressed the cloned MHV-2 S protein. Domain swapping experiments demonstrated that the 12-amino acid stretch missing in the MHV-2 S1 subunit, but not the proteolytic cleavage site, was critical for the cell-fusion activity of MHV."
