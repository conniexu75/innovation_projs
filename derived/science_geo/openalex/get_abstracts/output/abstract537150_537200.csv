https://openalex.org/W1932303130,"Neuronal conversion from human fibroblasts can be induced by lineage-specific transcription factors; however, the introduction of ectopic genes limits the therapeutic applications of such induced neurons (iNs). Here, we report that human fibroblasts can be directly converted into neuronal cells by a chemical cocktail of seven small molecules, bypassing a neural progenitor stage. These human chemical-induced neuronal cells (hciNs) resembled hiPSC-derived neurons and human iNs (hiNs) with respect to morphology, gene expression profiles, and electrophysiological properties. This approach was further applied to generate hciNs from familial Alzheimer's disease patients. Taken together, our transgene-free and chemical-only approach for direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts into neurons provides an alternative strategy for modeling neurological diseases and for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1950098865,"Recently, direct reprogramming between divergent lineages has been achieved by the introduction of regulatory transcription factors. This approach may provide alternative cell resources for drug discovery and regenerative medicine, but applications could be limited by the genetic manipulation involved. Here, we show that mouse fibroblasts can be directly converted into neuronal cells using only a cocktail of small molecules, with a yield of up to >90% being TUJ1-positive after 16 days of induction. After a further maturation stage, these chemically induced neurons (CiNs) possessed neuron-specific expression patterns, generated action potentials, and formed functional synapses. Mechanistically, we found that a BET family bromodomain inhibitor, I-BET151, disrupted the fibroblast-specific program, while the neurogenesis inducer ISX9 was necessary to activate neuron-specific genes. Overall, our findings provide a ""proof of principle"" for chemically induced direct reprogramming of somatic cell fates across germ layers without genetic manipulation, through disruption of cell-specific programs and induction of an alternative fate."
https://openalex.org/W1509412094,"Working memory (WM) enables the storage and manipulation of information in an active state. WM storage has long been associated with sustained increases in activation across a network of frontal and parietal cortical regions. However, recent evidence suggests that these regions primarily encode information related to general task goals rather than feature-selective representations of specific memoranda. These goal-related representations are thought to provide top-down feedback that coordinates the representation of fine-grained details in early sensory areas. Here, we test this model using fMRI-based reconstructions of remembered visual details from region-level activation patterns. We could reconstruct high-fidelity representations of a remembered orientation based on activation patterns in occipital visual cortex and in several sub-regions of frontal and parietal cortex, independent of sustained increases in mean activation. These results challenge models of WM that postulate disjoint frontoparietal “top-down control” and posterior sensory “feature storage” networks."
https://openalex.org/W1900557155,"Enhanced sensitivity to Wnts is an emerging hallmark of a subset of cancers, defined in part by mutations regulating the abundance of their receptors. Whether these mutations identify a clinical opportunity is an important question. Inhibition of Wnt secretion by blocking an essential post-translational modification, palmitoleation, provides a useful therapeutic intervention. We developed a novel potent, orally available PORCN inhibitor, ETC-1922159 (henceforth called ETC-159) that blocks the secretion and activity of all Wnts. ETC-159 is remarkably effective in treating RSPO-translocation bearing colorectal cancer (CRC) patient-derived xenografts. This is the first example of effective targeted therapy for this subset of CRC. Consistent with a central role of Wnt signaling in regulation of gene expression, inhibition of PORCN in RSPO3-translocated cancers causes a marked remodeling of the transcriptome, with loss of cell cycle, stem cell and proliferation genes, and an increase in differentiation markers. Inhibition of Wnt signaling by PORCN inhibition holds promise as differentiation therapy in genetically defined human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2124572694,"In real-time quantum feedback protocols, the record of a continuous measurement is used to stabilize a desired quantum state. Recent years have seen successful applications of these protocols in a variety of well-isolated micro-systems, including microwave photons and superconducting qubits. However, stabilizing the quantum state of a tangibly massive object, such as a mechanical oscillator, remains very challenging: the main obstacle is environmental decoherence, which places stringent requirements on the timescale in which the state must be measured. Here we describe a position sensor that is capable of resolving the zero-point motion of a solid-state, 4.3-megahertz nanomechanical oscillator in the timescale of its thermal decoherence, a basic requirement for real-time (Markovian) quantum feedback control tasks, such as ground-state preparation. The sensor is based on evanescent optomechanical coupling to a high-Q microcavity, and achieves an imprecision four orders of magnitude below that at the standard quantum limit for a weak continuous position measurement--a 100-fold improvement over previous reports--while maintaining an imprecision-back-action product that is within a factor of five of the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. As a demonstration of its utility, we use the measurement as an error signal with which to feedback cool the oscillator. Using radiation pressure as an actuator, the oscillator is cold damped with high efficiency: from a cryogenic-bath temperature of 4.4 kelvin to an effective value of 1.1 ± 0.1 millikelvin, corresponding to a mean phonon number of 5.3 ± 0.6 (that is, a ground-state probability of 16 per cent). Our results set a new benchmark for the performance of a linear position sensor, and signal the emergence of mechanical oscillators as practical subjects for measurement-based quantum control."
https://openalex.org/W1803619559,"Structural view of a dynamic molecular switch mechanism that governs repression and activation of the jasmonate plant hormone pathway. The signalling pathway triggered by the plant hormone jasmonate regulates plant stress responses and also growth and development. At a molecular level, the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as jasmonate co-receptors but also repress the activity of MYC transcription factors, which are required to convey the jasmonate signal. Sheng Yang He and colleagues use X-ray crystallography to address the question of how these same proteins can switch roles between transcriptional repressors and jasmonate co-receptors. Previous work had suggested that the conserved Jas motif of a JAZ repressor binds to jasmonate as a partially unwound helix. These authors find that the motif forms a complete α-helix on binding to MYC. Consequently, the Jas motif becomes an integral part of the MYC N-terminal fold resulting in a notable conformational change in MYC. This competitive binding inhibits MYC interaction with a subunit of the transcriptional Mediator complex, repressing its transcriptional activity. The plant hormone jasmonate plays crucial roles in regulating plant responses to herbivorous insects and microbial pathogens and is an important regulator of plant growth and development1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Key mediators of jasmonate signalling include MYC transcription factors, which are repressed by jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) transcriptional repressors in the resting state. In the presence of active jasmonate, JAZ proteins function as jasmonate co-receptors by forming a hormone-dependent complex with COI1, the F-box subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin E3 ligase8,9,10,11. The hormone-dependent formation of the COI1–JAZ co-receptor complex leads to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of JAZ repressors and release of MYC proteins from transcriptional repression3,10,12. The mechanism by which JAZ proteins repress MYC transcription factors and how JAZ proteins switch between the repressor function in the absence of hormone and the co-receptor function in the presence of hormone remain enigmatic. Here we show that Arabidopsis MYC3 undergoes pronounced conformational changes when bound to the conserved Jas motif of the JAZ9 repressor. The Jas motif, previously shown to bind to hormone as a partly unwound helix, forms a complete α-helix that displaces the amino (N)-terminal helix of MYC3 and becomes an integral part of the MYC N-terminal fold. In this position, the Jas helix competitively inhibits MYC3 interaction with the MED25 subunit of the transcriptional Mediator complex. Our structural and functional studies elucidate a dynamic molecular switch mechanism that governs the repression and activation of a major plant hormone pathway."

This study collected 465 published papers on heavy metal pollution rates (the ratio of the samples exceeding the Grade II limits for Chinese soils, the Soil Environmental Quality Standard-1995) in farmland soil throughout China. The results showed that Cd had the highest pollution rate of 7.75%, followed by Hg, Cu, Ni and Zn, Pb and Cr had the lowest pollution rates at lower than 1%. The total pollution rate in Chinese farmland soil was 10.18%, mainly from Cd, Hg, Cu, and Ni. The human activities of mining and smelting, industry, irrigation by sewage, urban development, and fertilizer application released certain amounts of heavy metals into soil, which resulted in the farmland soil being polluted. Considering the spatial variations of grain production, about 13.86% of grain production was affected due to the heavy metal pollution in farmland soil. These results many provide valuable information for agricultural soil management and protection in China."
https://openalex.org/W1174310744,"Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common cardiac valve disease that affects nearly 1 in 40 individuals. It can manifest as mitral regurgitation and is the leading indication for mitral valve surgery. Despite a clear heritable component, the genetic aetiology leading to non-syndromic MVP has remained elusive. Four affected individuals from a large multigenerational family segregating non-syndromic MVP underwent capture sequencing of the linked interval on chromosome 11. We report a missense mutation in the DCHS1 gene, the human homologue of the Drosophila cell polarity gene dachsous (ds), that segregates with MVP in the family. Morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish homologue dachsous1b resulted in a cardiac atrioventricular canal defect that could be rescued by wild-type human DCHS1, but not by DCHS1 messenger RNA with the familial mutation. Further genetic studies identified two additional families in which a second deleterious DCHS1 mutation segregates with MVP. Both DCHS1 mutations reduce protein stability as demonstrated in zebrafish, cultured cells and, notably, in mitral valve interstitial cells (MVICs) obtained during mitral valve repair surgery of a proband. Dchs1(+/-) mice had prolapse of thickened mitral leaflets, which could be traced back to developmental errors in valve morphogenesis. DCHS1 deficiency in MVP patient MVICs, as well as in Dchs1(+/-) mouse MVICs, result in altered migration and cellular patterning, supporting these processes as aetiological underpinnings for the disease. Understanding the role of DCHS1 in mitral valve development and MVP pathogenesis holds potential for therapeutic insights for this very common disease."
https://openalex.org/W1136490972,"smFRET is used to probe the activation mechanism of two full-length mammalian glutamate receptors, revealing that the extracellular ligand-binding domains of these G-protein-coupled receptors interconvert between three confirmations (resting, activated and a short-lived intermediate state), and that the efficacy of an orthosteric agonist correlates with the degree of occupancy of the active state. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are dimeric class C G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that modulate neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and serve as drug targets for neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and fragile X syndrome. There have been several X-ray crystal structures of GPCRs in the past few years, but our understanding of the conformational dynamics of receptor activation is incomplete. Here the authors used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to probe the activation mechanism of two full-length mammalian mGluRs. The smFRET experiments revealed that the extracellular ligand-binding domains of these GPCRs interconvert between three conformations (resting/inactive, activated, and a short-lived, inactive intermediate state) and that efficacy of an orthosteric agonist correlates with the degree of occupancy of the active state. The experimental strategy described in this paper should be widely applicable to the study of conformational dynamics in GPCRs and other membrane proteins. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane receptors in eukaryotes. Crystal structures have provided insight into GPCR interactions with ligands and G proteins1,2, but our understanding of the conformational dynamics of activation is incomplete. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are dimeric class C GPCRs that modulate neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and serve as drug targets for neurological disorders3,4. A ‘clamshell’ ligand-binding domain (LBD), which contains the ligand-binding site, is coupled to the transmembrane domain via a cysteine-rich domain, and LBD closure seems to be the first step in activation5,6. Crystal structures of isolated mGluR LBD dimers led to the suggestion that activation also involves a reorientation of the dimer interface from a ‘relaxed’ to an ‘active’ state7,8, but the relationship between ligand binding, LBD closure and dimer interface rearrangement in activation remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe the activation mechanism of full-length mammalian group II mGluRs. We show that the LBDs interconvert between three conformations: resting, activated and a short-lived intermediate state. Orthosteric agonists induce transitions between these conformational states, with efficacy determined by occupancy of the active conformation. Unlike mGluR2, mGluR3 displays basal dynamics, which are Ca2+-dependent and lead to basal protein activation. Our results support a general mechanism for the activation of mGluRs in which agonist binding induces closure of the LBDs, followed by dimer interface reorientation. Our experimental strategy should be widely applicable to study conformational dynamics in GPCRs and other membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2106667875,"Deletion of UBE3A causes the neurodevelopmental disorder Angelman syndrome (AS), while duplication or triplication of UBE3A is linked to autism. These genetic findings suggest that the ubiquitin ligase activity of UBE3A must be tightly maintained to promote normal brain development. Here, we found that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates UBE3A in a region outside of the catalytic domain at residue T485 and inhibits UBE3A activity toward itself and other substrates. A de novo autism-linked missense mutation disrupts this phosphorylation site, causing enhanced UBE3A activity in vitro, enhanced substrate turnover in patient-derived cells, and excessive dendritic spine development in the brain. Our study identifies PKA as an upstream regulator of UBE3A activity and shows that an autism-linked mutation disrupts this phosphorylation control. Moreover, our findings implicate excessive UBE3A activity and the resulting synaptic dysfunction to autism pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2114724410,"Dendritic spines are postsynaptic compartments of excitatory synapses that undergo dynamic changes during development, including rapid spinogenesis in early postnatal life and significant pruning during adolescence. Spine pruning defects have been implicated in developmental neurological disorders such as autism, yet much remains to be uncovered regarding its molecular mechanism. Here, we show that spine pruning and maturation in the mouse somatosensory cortex are coordinated via the cadherin/catenin cell adhesion complex and bidrectionally regulated by sensory experience. We further demonstrate that locally enhancing cadherin/catenin-dependent adhesion or photo-stimulating a contacting channelrhodopsin-expressing axon stabilized the manipulated spine and eliminated its neighbors, an effect requiring cadherin/catenin-dependent adhesion. Importantly, we show that differential cadherin/catenin-dependent adhesion between neighboring spines biased spine fate in vivo. These results suggest that activity-induced inter-spine competition for β-catenin provides specificity for concurrent spine maturation and elimination and thus is critical for the molecular control of spine pruning during neural circuit refinement."
https://openalex.org/W1950305586,"Regeneration of skin and hair follicles after wounding—a process known as wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN)—is a rare example of adult organogenesis in mammals. As such, WIHN provides a unique model system for deciphering mechanisms underlying mammalian regeneration. Here, we show that dsRNA, which is released from damaged skin, activates Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) and its downstream effectors IL-6 and STAT3 to promote hair follicle regeneration. Conversely, TLR3-deficient animals fail to initiate WIHN. TLR3 activation promotes expression of hair follicle stem cell markers and induces elements of the core hair morphogenetic program, including ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) and the Wnt and Shh pathways. Our results therefore show that dsRNA and TLR3 link the earliest events of mammalian skin wounding to regeneration and suggest potential therapeutic approaches for promoting hair neogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1605757439,"Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) are oocyte-specific growth factors with central roles in mammalian reproduction, regulating species-specific fecundity, ovarian follicular somatic cell differentiation, and oocyte quality. In the human, GDF9 is produced in a latent form, the mechanism of activation being an open question. Here, we produced a range of recombinant GDF9 and BMP15 variants, examined their in silico and physical interactions and their effects on ovarian granulosa cells (GC) and oocytes. We found that the potent synergistic actions of GDF9 and BMP15 on GC can be attributed to the formation of a heterodimer, which we have termed cumulin. Structural modeling of cumulin revealed a dimerization interface identical to homodimeric GDF9 and BMP15, indicating likely formation of a stable complex. This was confirmed by generation of recombinant heterodimeric complexes of pro/mature domains (pro-cumulin) and covalent mature domains (cumulin). Both pro-cumulin and cumulin exhibited highly potent bioactivity on GC, activating both SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathways and promoting proliferation and expression of a set of genes associated with oocyte-regulated GC differentiation. Cumulin was more potent than pro-cumulin, pro-GDF9, pro-BMP15, or the two combined on GC. However, on cumulus-oocyte complexes, pro-cumulin was more effective than all other growth factors at notably improving oocyte quality as assessed by subsequent day 7 embryo development.

As with all members of the TGF-β family, GDF9 and BMP15 are produced as pro-proteins, consisting of an N-terminal proregion and a receptor binding C-terminal mature region.

GDF9 and BMP15 are also functionally unusual within the TGF-β family, in that they show remarkable species differences in their activity.

Hence, the relative levels of oocyte expression of BMP15 and GDF9 vary markedly across species, whereby the mono-ovular phenotype (i.e. low fecundity) is characterized by balanced BMP15:GDF9 ratios, whereas polyovular species (high fecundity) express predominately GDF9 (14Crawford J.L.

In the current study, we hypothesized that human GDF9 and BMP15 form a stable heterodimer that has potent actions on mural GC, cumulus GC, and oocyte development. We provide the first evidence of a purified BMP15-GDF9 heterodimer. We find that both the promature form and a covalent mature form of the heterodimer are particularly potent and are dual pathway activators, signaling via the SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8 pathways. Interestingly, only the promature heterodimer is capable of improving oocyte quality, indicative of the crucial function that the prodomain plays in the functioning of these proteins. In deference to its potent activation of cumulus cells and to align with the existing nomenclature for the other major reproductive TGF-β superfamily heterodimer, inhibin, we have called this new heterodimer cumulin. Expression cassettes encoding wild type human GDF9 or BMP15 or mouse GDF9 (mGDF9) were synthesized (Genscript USA, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) incorporating the rat serum albumin signal sequence at the 5′ end followed by sequences encoding for His8 and StrepII affinity tags at the N terminus of the respective proregion. The various human GDF9 and BMP15 Ser-Cys mutants (Ser418 in GDF9 and Ser356 in BMP15) used in this study were derived from expression cassettes (Genscript USA, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) incorporating the glutamate receptor GluR-D subunit signal sequence(MRIICRQIVLLFSGFWGLAMG) at the 5′ end followed by sequences encoding for the FLAG tag (a design based on Kuusinen et al.

Cells producing pro-GDF9, pro-mGDF9, pro-BMP15, pro-cumulin, or covalent cumulin were grown to near confluence, and growth medium was then replaced by production media containing DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX, 0.1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma), 25 IU/ml Fragmin (Pfizer), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). After 48 h of incubation, the conditioned culture medium was collected. Production medium containing pro-GDF9, pro-BMP15, or pro-cumulin was modified to include 10 mm imidazole, 500 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific), 500 μl of phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, Alexandria, Australia) and subsequently adjusted to pH 7.4. Invitrogen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin was incubated with conditioned medium on a rotary agitator at 4 °C for 2 h and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. The His-tagged target protein was eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose using elution buffer (PBS/500 mm imidazole) and stored in LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at −80 °C. Cumulin (the covalently stabilized form) was produced and purified as above, with the exception that the mature region was eluted from the IMAC resin via a 7 m urea wash. This material was then loaded onto a reverse phase HPLC column equilibrated with 0.1% TFA, and the different mature region forms (i.e. GDF9, cumulin and finally BMP15) were eluted via a linear gradient of acetonitrile. The fractions were stored in LoBind tubes at −80 °C. Fractions from the cumulin reverse phase HPLC were prepared for electrophoresis by lyophilizing 5 μl and resuspending in SDS-PAGE loading buffer ± DTT. All samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then loaded onto a MiniPROTEAN TGX 4–15% gel (Bio-Rad). After 40 min at 150 V, the gels were used for silver staining or Western blotting.

https://openalex.org/W2130775876,"Zinc transporter ZIP12 expression is increased in many cell types in remodelled mammalian pulmonary arterioles in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a serious disease triggered by chronic hypoxia. Lan Zhao and colleagues now link a zinc transporter to this disease in rats. The Fischer 344 rat strain is naturally resistant to hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and the authors use a congenic breeding program and comparative genomics to establish that a mutation in the zinc transporter ZIP12 underlies the resistance to this disease. ZIP12 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells is hypoxia dependent, and genetic disruption of ZIP12 can prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension in rats housed in a hypoxic atmosphere. The results suggest that ZIP12 might be a viable drug target for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. The typical response of the adult mammalian pulmonary circulation to a low oxygen environment is vasoconstriction and structural remodelling of pulmonary arterioles, leading to chronic elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (pulmonary hypertension) and right ventricular hypertrophy. Some mammals, however, exhibit genetic resistance to hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension1,2,3. We used a congenic breeding program and comparative genomics to exploit this variation in the rat and identified the gene Slc39a12 as a major regulator of hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodelling. Slc39a12 encodes the zinc transporter ZIP12. Here we report that ZIP12 expression is increased in many cell types, including endothelial, smooth muscle and interstitial cells, in the remodelled pulmonary arterioles of rats, cows and humans susceptible to hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. We show that ZIP12 expression in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells is hypoxia dependent and that targeted inhibition of ZIP12 inhibits the rise in intracellular labile zinc in hypoxia-exposed pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and their proliferation in culture. We demonstrate that genetic disruption of ZIP12 expression attenuates the development of pulmonary hypertension in rats housed in a hypoxic atmosphere. This new and unexpected insight into the fundamental role of a zinc transporter in mammalian pulmonary vascular homeostasis suggests a new drug target for the pharmacological management of pulmonary hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1520125945,"The sudden appearance of the neural crest and neurogenic placodes in early branching vertebrates has puzzled biologists for over a century. These embryonic tissues contribute to the development of the cranium and associated sensory organs, which were crucial for the evolution of the vertebrate ""new head"". A previous study suggests that rudimentary neural crest cells existed in ancestral chordates. However, the evolutionary origins of neurogenic placodes have remained obscure owing to a paucity of embryonic data from tunicates, the closest living relatives to those early vertebrates. Here we show that the tunicate Ciona intestinalis exhibits a proto-placodal ectoderm (PPE) that requires inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and expresses the key regulatory determinant Six1/2 and its co-factor Eya, a developmental process conserved across vertebrates. The Ciona PPE is shown to produce ciliated neurons that express genes for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a G-protein-coupled receptor for relaxin-3 (RXFP3) and a functional cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA), which suggests dual chemosensory and neurosecretory activities. These observations provide evidence that Ciona has a neurogenic proto-placode, which forms neurons that appear to be related to those derived from the olfactory placode and hypothalamic neurons of vertebrates. We discuss the possibility that the PPE-derived GnRH neurons of Ciona resemble an ancestral cell type, a progenitor to the complex neuronal circuit that integrates sensory information and neuroendocrine functions in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1730652896,"The precise control of miR-17∼92 microRNA (miRNA) is essential for normal development, and overexpression of certain miRNAs from this cluster is oncogenic. Here, we find that the relative expression of the six miRNAs processed from the primary (pri-miR-17∼92) transcript is dynamically regulated during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Pri-miR-17∼92 is processed to a biogenesis intermediate, termed ""progenitor-miRNA"" (pro-miRNA). Pro-miRNA is an efficient substrate for Microprocessor and is required to selectively license production of pre-miR-17, pre-miR-18a, pre-miR-19a, pre-miR-20a, and pre-miR-19b from this cluster. Two complementary cis-regulatory repression domains within pri-miR-17∼92 are required for the blockade of miRNA processing through the formation of an autoinhibitory RNA conformation. The endonuclease CPSF3 (CPSF73) and the spliceosome-associated ISY1 are responsible for pro-miRNA biogenesis and expression of all miRNAs within the cluster except miR-92. Thus, developmentally regulated pro-miRNA processing is a key step controlling miRNA expression and explains the posttranscriptional control of miR-17∼92 expression in development."

However, the complex changes in lipid metabolites and metabolism that occur in patients with these conditions are incompletely understood. We performed lipid profiling to identify alterations in lipid metabolism in patients with angina and myocardial infarction (MI). Global lipid profiling was applied to serum samples from patients with CAD (angina and MI) and age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched healthy subjects using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis. A multivariate analysis showed a clear separation between the patients with CAD and normal controls. Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE) species containing unsaturated fatty acids and free fatty acids were associated with an increased risk of CAD, whereas species of lysoPC and lyso-alkyl PC containing saturated fatty acids were associated with a decreased risk. Additionally, PC species containing palmitic acid, diacylglycerol, sphingomyelin, and ceramide were associated with an increased risk of MI, whereas PE-plasmalogen and phosphatidylinositol species were associated with a decreased risk. In MI patients, we found strong positive correlation between lipid metabolites related to the sphingolipid pathway, sphingomyelin, and ceramide and acute inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein). The results of this study demonstrate altered signatures in lipid metabolism in patients with angina or MI. Lipidomic profiling could provide the information to identity the specific lipid metabolites under the presence of disturbed metabolic pathways in patients with CAD."
https://openalex.org/W1695628563,"Accumulating evidence suggests that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in nondiabetic individuals. To date, there are very limited data on this topic in patients with type 2 diabetes and it remains uncertain whether NAFLD is independently associated with the presence of LVDD in this patient population. We performed a liver ultrasonography and trans-thoracic echocardiography (with speckle-tracking strain analysis) in 222 (156 men and 66 women) consecutive type 2 diabetic outpatients with no previous history of ischemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, valvular diseases and known hepatic diseases. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between NAFLD and the presence/severity of LVDD graded according to the current criteria of the American Society of Echocardiography, and to identify the variables that were independently associated with LVDD, which was included as the dependent variable. Patients with ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD (n = 158; 71.2% of total) were more likely to be female, overweight/obese, and had longer diabetes duration, higher hemoglobin A1c and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) than those without NAFLD. Notably, they also had a remarkably greater prevalence of mild and/or moderate LVDD compared with those without NAFLD (71% vs. 33%; P<0.001). Age, hypertension, smoking, medication use, E/A ratio, LV volumes and mass were comparable between the two groups of patients. NAFLD was associated with a three-fold increased odds of mild and/or moderate LVDD after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, eGFR, LV mass index and ejection fraction (adjusted-odds ratio 3.08, 95%CI 1.5-6.4, P = 0.003). In conclusion, NAFLD is independently associated with early LVDD in type 2 diabetic patients with preserved systolic function."
https://openalex.org/W2161181058,"Voters prefer leaders with lower-pitched voices because they are perceived as stronger, having greater physical prowess, more competent, and having greater integrity. An alternative hypothesis that has yet to be tested is that lower-pitched voices are perceived as older and thus wiser and more experienced. Here the relationships between candidate voice pitch, candidate age, and electoral success are examined with two experiments. Study 1 tests whether voters discriminate on candidate age. The results show that male and female candidates in their 40s and 50s, the time in the lifecycle when voice pitch is at its lowest, are preferred over candidates in their 30s, 60s, and 70s. Study 2 shows that the preference for leaders with lower-pitched voices correlates with the perception that speakers with lower voices are stronger, more competent, and older, but the influence of perception of age on vote choice is the weakest of the three."

Here, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which catecholamines induce inflammation by increasing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in ovarian cancer cells. Metabolic changes in tumors isolated from patients with depression and mice subjected to restraint stress showed elevated PGE2 levels. Increased metabolites, PTGS2 and PTGES protein levels were found in Skov3-ip1 and HeyA8 cells treated with norepinephrine (NE), and these changes were shown to be mediated by ADRB2 receptor signaling. Silencing PTGS2 resulted in significantly decreased migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cells in the presence of NE and decreased tumor burden and metastasis in restraint stress orthotopic models. In human ovarian cancer samples, concurrent increased ADRB2, PTGS2 and PTGES expression was associated with reduced overall and progression-free patient survival. In conclusion, increased adrenergic stimulation results in increased PGE2 synthesis via ADRB2-Nf-kB-PTGS2 axis, which drives tumor growth and metastasis."

Data about anthropometrics, demographics, autoantibodies to Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GADA) and to Islet Antigen 2 (anti-IA2), HbA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure were extracted. LADA was diagnosed according to GADA and/or anti-IA2 positivity and time to insulin therapy.437 (2.6%) patients were identified as LADA and 34 (0.2%) as classical type 1 diabetes in adults. Mean age at diagnosis, BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and HbA1c significantly differed between, LADA, type 2 and type 1 diabetes, LADA showing halfway features between type 2 and type 1 diabetes. A decreasing trend for age at diagnosis and waist circumference was found among LADA subjects when subdivided by positivity for anti-IA2, GADA or for both antibodies (p=0.013 and p=0.011 for trend, respectively). There was a gradual downward trend in autoantibody titre in LADA subjects requiring insulin within the first year from diagnosis to subjects not requiring insulin after 10 years of follow-up (p<0.001).This is the first study describing the clinical features of LADA in the UAE, which appear to be different from both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W1932381524,"The loss of ITGA2 plays an important role in cancer metastasis in several solid cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of ITGA2 loss in primary cancers remains unclear. In this study, we found that a lower ITGA2 protein level was observed in breast cancers compared to adjacent non-cancerous breast tissues. Interestingly, the reduction degree of ITGA2 at the protein level was far more than that at the mRNA level. We further showed that the translation of ITGA2 mRNA was directly inhibited by miR-373 through binding to ITGA2-3'UTR. Silencing of ITGA2 detached cell-cell interactions, induced the deploymerization of stress fiber F-actin and stimulated cancer cell migration, similar to the effect of miR-373 over-expression. The co-expression of ITGA2, not ITGA2-3'UTR, could abrogate miR-373-induced cancer cell migration because that the expression of ITGA2-3'UTR was inhibited by co-transfected miR-373. ITGA2 protein level was inversely associated with miR-373 level in breast cancers (r = -0.663, P<0.001). 73.33% of breast cancer patients with high miR-373 and low ITGA2 expression exhibited the lymph node-positive metastases.

Here, we asked whether the mitochondrial protein VDAC1 mediates apoptosis independently of Bax/Bak. Upon screening a fungal secondary metabolite library for compounds inducing apoptosis in Bax/Bak-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we identified cyathin-R, a new cyathane diterpenoid compound able to activate apoptosis in the absence of Bax/Bak via promotion of the VDAC1 oligomerization that mediates cytochrome c release. Diphenylamine-2-carboxilic acid, an inhibitor of VDAC1 conductance and oligomerization, inhibited cyathin-R-induced VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis. Similarly, Bcl-2 overexpression conferred resistance to cyathin-R-induced apoptosis and VDAC1 oligomerization. Silencing of VDAC1 expression prevented cyathin-R-induced apoptosis. Finally, cyathin-R effectively attenuated tumor growth and induced apoptosis in Bax/Bak-deficient cells implanted into a xenograft mouse model.

https://openalex.org/W1946857290,"The unique characteristic of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is that local invasion rather than distant metastasis is the major route for dissemination. Therefore, targeting the locally invasive cancer cells is more important than preventing systemic metastasis in HNSCC and other invasive-predominant cancers. We previously demonstrate a specific mechanism for HNSCC local invasion: the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator Twist1 represses microRNA let-7i expression, leading to the activation of the small GTPase Rac1 and engendering the mesenchymal-mode movement in three-dimensional (3D) culture. However, targeting the EMT regulator is relatively difficult because of its transcription factor nature and the strategy for confining HNSCC invasion to facilitate local treatment is limited. Imipramine blue (IB) is a newly identified anti-invasive compound that effectively inhibits glioma invasion. Here we demonstrate that in HNSCC cells, a noncytotoxic dose of IB represses mesenchymal-mode migration in two-and-a-half-dimensional/3D culture system. IB suppresses EMT and stemness of HNSCC cells through inhibition of Twist1-mediated let-7i downregulation and Rac1 activation and the EMT signalling. Mechanistically, IB inhibits reactive oxygen species-induced nuclear factor-κB pathway activation. Importantly, IB promotes degradation of the EMT inducer Twist1 by enhancing F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 14 (FBXL14)-mediated polyubiquitination of Twist1. Together, this study demonstrates the potent anti-invasion and EMT-inhibition effect of IB, suggesting the potential of IB in treating local invasion-predominant cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1167529455,"Novel drugs like Abiraterone or Enzalutamide, which target androgen receptor (AR) signaling to improve androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), have been developed during the past years. However, the application of these drugs is limited because of occurrence of inherent or acquired therapy resistances during the treatment. Thus, identification of new molecular targets is urgently required to improve current therapeutic prostate cancer (PCa) treatment strategies. PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-1)) is known to be an important cell cycle regulator and PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation is essential for DNA repair. In this context, elevated PIAS1 expression has already been associated with cancer initiation. Thus, in the present study, we addressed the question of whether PIAS1 targeting can be used as a basis for an improved PCa therapy in combination with anti-androgens. We show that PIAS1 significantly correlates with AR expression in PCa tissue and in cell lines and demonstrate that high PIAS1 levels predict shorter relapse-free survival. Our patient data are complemented by mechanistic and functional in vitro experiments that identify PIAS1 as an androgen-responsive gene and a crucial factor for AR signaling via prevention of AR degradation. Furthermore, PIAS1 knockdown is sufficient to decrease cell proliferation as well as cell viability. Strikingly, Abiraterone or Enzalutamide treatment in combination with PIAS1 depletion is even more effective than single-drug treatment in multiple PCa cell models, rendering PIAS1 as a promising target protein for a combined treatment approach to improve future PCa therapies."

Novel preclinical imaging methods also have the potential to quantify functional tumour characteristics in vivo, with potential relevance for monitoring response to therapy.After orthotopic injection with luc-expressing endometrial cancer cells, eleven mice developed disease detected by weekly bioluminescence imaging (BLI). In parallel the same mice underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing 18F-fluorodeoxyglocose (18F-FDG) or 18F- fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) and contrast reagent, respectively. The mice were sacrificed when moribund, and post-mortem examination included macroscopic and microscopic examination for validation of growth of primary uterine tumours and metastases. PET-CT was also performed on a patient derived model (PDX) generated from a patient with grade 3 endometrioid endometrial cancer.Increased BLI signal during tumour growth was accompanied by increasing metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and increasing MTV x mean standard uptake value of the tumour (SUVmean) in 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT PET-CT, and MRI conspicuously depicted the uterine tumour. At necropsy 82% (9/11) of the mice developed metastases detected by the applied imaging methods. 18F-FDG PET proved to be a good imaging method for detection of patient derived tumour tissue.We demonstrate that all imaging modalities enable monitoring of tumour growth and metastatic spread in an orthotopic mouse model of endometrial carcinoma. Both PET tracers, 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT, appear to be equally feasible for detecting tumour development and represent, together with MRI, promising imaging tools for monitoring of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cancer models."
https://openalex.org/W1690182319,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumour. The neoplasms are difficult to resect entirely because of their highly infiltration property and leading to the tumour edge is unclear. Gliadel wafer has been used as an intracerebral drug delivery system to eliminate the residual tumour. However, because of its local low concentration and short diffusion distance, patient survival improves non-significantly. Axl is an essential regulator in cancer metastasis and patient survival. In this study, we developed a controlled-release polyanhydride polymer loading a novel small molecule, n-butylidenephthalide (BP), which is not only increasing local drug concentration and extending its diffusion distance but also reducing tumour invasion, mediated by reducing Axl expression. First, we determined that BP inhibited the expression of Axl in a dose- and time-dependent manner and reduced the migratory and invasive capabilities of GBM cells. In addition, BP downregulated matrix metalloproteinase activity, which is involved in cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BP regulated Axl via the extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is related to epithelial cells in the invasive migratory mesenchymal cells that underlie cancer progression; we demonstrated that BP reduced the expression of EMT-related genes. Furthermore, we used the overexpression of Axl in GBM cells to prove that Axl is a crucial target in the inhibition of GBM EMT, migration and invasion. In an in vivo study, we demonstrated that BP inhibited tumour growth and suppressed Axl expression in a dose-dependent manner according to a subcutaneous tumour model. Most importantly, in an intracranial tumour model with BP wafer in situ treatment, we demonstrated that the BP wafer not only significantly increased the survival rate but also decreased Axl expression, and inhibited tumour invasion. These results contribute to the development of a BP wafer for a novel therapeutic strategy for treating GBM invasion and increasing survival in clinical subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1921117934,"Background Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a disorder of chronic self-motion perception that occurs though entrainment to rhythmic background motion, such as from sea voyage, and involves the perception of low-frequency rocking that can last for months or years. The neural basis of this persistent sensory perception abnormality is not well understood. Methods We investigated grey matter volume differences underlying persistent MdDS by performing voxel-based morphometry on whole brain and pre-specified ROIs in 28 individuals with MdDS and comparing them to 18 age, sex, and handedness matched controls. Results MdDS participants exhibited greater grey matter volume in the left inferior parietal lobule, right inferior occipital gyrus (area V3v), right temporal pole, bilateral cerebellar hemispheric lobules VIII/IX and left lobule VIIa/VIIb. Grey matter volumes were lower in bilateral inferior frontal, orbitofrontal, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) and left superior medial gyri (t = 3.0, p<0.005uncorr). In ROI analyses, there were no volume differences in the middle occipital gyrus (region of V5/MT) or parietal operculum 2 (region of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex). Illness duration was positively related to grey matter volume in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (IFG/AI), right posterior insula, superior parietal lobule, left middle occipital gyrus (V5/MT), bilateral postcentral gyrus, anterior cerebellum, and left cerebellar hemisphere and vermian lobule IX. In contrast, illness duration was negatively related to volume in pgACC, posterior middle cingulate gyrus (MCC), left middle frontal gyrus (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-DLPFC), and right cerebellar hemispheric lobule VIIIb (t = 3.0, p<0.005uncorr). The most significant differences were decreased volume in the pgACC and increased volume in the left IFG/AI with longer illness duration (qFDRcorr <0.05). Concurrent medication use did not correlate with these findings or have a relationship with duration of illness. MdDS participants showed positive correlations between grey matter volume in pgACC and bilateral cerebellar lobules VIII/IX, which was not seen in controls. Conclusions Individuals with MdDS show brain volume differences from healthy controls as well as duration of illness dependent volume changes in (a) visual-vestibular processing areas (IPL, SPL, V3, V5/MT), (b) default mode network structures (cerebellar IX, IPL, ACC), (c) salience network structures (ACC and IFG/AI) (d) somatosensory network structures (postcentral gyrus, MCC, anterior cerebellum, cerebellar lobule VIII), and (e) a structure within the central executive network (DLPFC). The identification of these associations may enhance future investigations into how exposure to oscillating environments can modulate brain function and affect motion perception as well cognitive and affective control."
https://openalex.org/W1916415070,"p21-activated kinases (Paks) are Cdc42/Rac-activated serine–threonine protein kinases that regulate several key cancer-relevant signaling pathways, such as the Mek/Erk, PI3K/Akt and Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways. Pak1 is frequently overexpressed and/or hyperactivated in different human cancers, including human breast, ovary, prostate and brain cancer, due to amplification of the PAK1 gene in an 11q13 amplicon. Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of Pak1 has been shown to reduce proliferation of different cancer cells in vitro and reduce tumor progression in vivo. In this work, we examined the roles of Pak1 in cellular and animal models of PAK1-amplified ovarian cancer. We found that inhibition of Pak1 leads to decreased proliferation and migration in PAK1-amplified/overexpressed ovarian cancer cells, and has no effect in cell that lack such amplification/overexpression. Further, we observed that loss of Pak1 function causes 11q13-amplified ovarian cancer cells to arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This arrest correlates with activation of p53 and p21Cip and decreased expression of cyclin B1. These findings suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of Pak1 may have a therapeutic role in the ~25% of ovarian cancers characterized by PAK1 gene amplification."

Although recent publications show that NKX6.1 is hypermethylated and downregulated during tumorigenesis, the function of NKX6.1 in carcinogenesis remains elusive. Here, we address the metastasis suppressor function of human NKX6.1 using cell, animal and clinical analyses. Our data show that NKX6.1 represses tumor formation and metastatic ability both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NKX6.1 suppresses cell invasion by inhibiting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). NKX6.1 directly enhances the mRNA level of E-cadherin by recruiting BAF155 coactivator and represses that of vimentin and N-cadherin by recruiting RBBP7 (retinoblastoma binding protein 7) corepressor. Clinical cancer tumors with metastasis show low NKX6.1 protein expression coinciding with low E-cadherin and high vimentin expression. Our results demonstrate that NKX6.1 functions as an EMT suppressor by interacting with different epigenetic modifiers, making it a potential novel therapeutic option."

https://openalex.org/W1110059699,"The steroid hormone ecdysone, which controls insect molting and metamorphosis, is synthesized in the prothoracic gland (PG), and several steroidogenic enzymes that are expressed specifically in the PG are involved in ecdysteroidogenesis. In this study, we identified new regulators that are involved in the transcriptional control of the silkworm steroidogenic enzyme genes. In silico analysis predicted several potential cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for the homeodomain transcription factors Antennapedia (Antp) and POU-M2 in the proximal promoters of steroidogenic enzyme genes. Antp and POU-M2 are expressed dynamically in the PG during larval development, and their overexpression in silkworm embryo-derived (BmE) cells induced the expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes. Importantly, luciferase reporter analyses, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Antp and POU-M2 promote the transcription of the silkworm steroidogenic enzyme gene Phantom (Phm) by binding directly to specific motifs within overlapping CREs in the Phm promoter. Mutations of these CREs in the Phm promoter suppressed the transcriptional activities of both Antp and POU-M2 in BmE cells and decreased the activities of mutated Phm promoters in the silkworm PG. In addition, pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Antp can interact with POU-M2. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of either Antp or POU-M2 during silkworm wandering not only decreased the ecdysone titer but also led to the failure of metamorphosis. In summary, our results suggest that Antp and POU-M2 coordinate the transcription of the silkworm Phm gene directly, indicating new roles for homeodomain proteins in regulating insect ecdysteroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1939792382,"Oncolytic human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) shows promising treatment efficacy in late-stage clinical trials. The anticancer activity of oncolytic viruses relies on deregulated pathways in cancer cells, which make them permissive to oncolysis. To identify pathways that restrict HSV-1 KM100-mediated oncolysis, this study used a pooled genome-wide short hairpin RNA library and found that depletion of the splicing factor arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) leads to enhanced cytotoxicity of breast cancer cells by KM100. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are a family of RNA-binding phosphoproteins that control both constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Further characterization showed that KM100 infection of HS578T cells under conditions of low SRSF2 leads to pronounced apoptosis without a corresponding increase in virus replication. As DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors can limit the phosphorylation of SRSF2, we combined a topoisomerase I inhibitor chemotherapeutic with KM100 and observed synergistic anticancer effect in vitro and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1910119459,"A striking characteristic of endemic Antarctic brown algae is their broad vertical distribution. This feature is largely determined by the shade adaptation in order to cope with the seasonal variation in light availability. However, during spring-summer months, when light penetrates deep in the water column these organisms have to withstand high levels of solar radiation, including UV. In the present study we examine the light use characteristics in parallel to a potential for UV tolerance (measured as content of phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity and maximum quantum yield of fluorescence) in conspecific populations of four Antarctic brown algae (Ascoseira mirabilis, Desmarestia menziesii, D. anceps and Himantothallus grandifolius) distributed over a depth gradient between 5 and 30 m. The main results indicated that a) photosynthetic efficiency was uniform along the depth gradient in all the studied species, and b) short-term (6 h) exposure to UV radiation revealed a high tolerance measured as chlorophyll fluorescence, phlorotannin content and antioxidant capacity. Multivariate analysis of similarity indicated that light requirements for photosynthesis, soluble phlorotannins and antioxidant capacity are the variables determining the responses along the depth gradient in all the studied species. The suite of physiological responses of algae with a shallower distribution (A. mirabilis and D. menziesii) differed from those with deeper vertical range (D. anceps and H. grandifolius). These patterns are consistent with the underwater light penetration that defines two zones: 0-15 m, with influence of UV radiation (1% of UV-B and UV-A at 9 m and 15 m respectively) and a zone below 15 m marked by PAR incidence (1% up to 30 m). These results support the prediction that algae show a UV stress tolerance capacity along a broad depth range according to their marked shade adaptation. The high contents of phlorotannins and antioxidant potential appear to be strongly responsible for the lack of clear depth patterns in light demand characteristics and UV tolerance."

In higher eukaryotes, cytoplasmic dynein is a ∼1.6-MDa multisubunit protein complex that moves along microtubules using its motor domain and transports cargos associated with its cargo attachment domain. The motor domain, part of the heavy chain subunit, includes the ATPase activity that generates force to drive dynein motion.

Because Saccharomyces cerevisiae dynein has structural and functional differences from Drosophila dynein, we sought in these studies to compare and contrast the consequences of dynactin and light chain binding on intermediate chain structure in the two species. In yeast, the single nonessential function of dynein is positioning the mitotic spindle into the mother/bud neck during mitosis (9Adames N.R. Cooper J.A.

Also, the yeast cargo attachment domain has a simpler subunit composition. Although higher eukaryotes have one copy each of the three different light chains, yeast has two copies of one light chain, Dyn2, the LC8 ortholog. Disrupting Dyn2 binding impairs dynactin recruitment (10Stuchell-Brereton M.D. Siglin A. Li J. Moore J.K. Ahmed S. Williams J.C. Cooper J.A.

In Drosophila, the specific binding of dynein to dynactin involves protein-protein interactions of IC and p150Glued, a domain of the largest subunit of dynactin.

The proteins were refolded by stepwise dilution in refolding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 500 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium azide) to a urea concentration of 1 m followed by dialysis into the same buffer with 0 m urea. The His6 tag was cleaved using tobacco etch virus protease followed by purification on a SuperdexTM 75 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column, resulting in purity of >95%. Dyn2 and Nip100 CC1B were purified under native conditions. The SUMO tag was cleaved from Dyn2 using SUMO protease (Cornell University). Nip100 CC1B was lysed in the affinity buffer containing 2 m urea to prevent aggregation and improve its interactions with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Protein concentrations were determined from absorbances at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficient values (Pac11 1–87, 2980 m−1 cm−1; Pac11 1–87Δ66–73, 1490 m−1 cm−1; Dyn2, 12950 m−1 cm−1; Nip100 CC1B, 8940 m−1 cm−1) computed with the ProtParam tool at the ExPASy website. Protein complex formation was assessed by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300; GE Healthcare) at 0.2 ml/min in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium azide, pH 7.2. In each run, 100-μl protein samples were loaded at concentrations of 100 μm for Nip100 CC1B, Pac11 1–87, and Pac11 1–87Δ66–73, and of 200 μm for Dyn2. Protein (complex) markers were selected to facilitate comparison to expected complexes of similar molecular masses: markers show elution volumes for the 114-kDa complex of ICTL7-Tctex1-LC8-LC7 (16Hall J. Song Y. Karplus P.A. Barbar E. The crystal structure of dynein intermediate chain-light chain roadblock complex gives new insights into dynein assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22566-22575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 35 kDa for β-lactoglobulin, and 13.7 kDa for ribonuclease A. Computed molecular masses of assigned complexes were derived using the molecular masses of Pac11 1–87 monomer (10.6 kDa), Dyn2 dimer (20.8 kDa), and Nip100 CC1B dimer (42.8 kDa). Experimental molecular masses were determined using multi-angle light scattering (MALS). SDS-PAGE was used to examine protein content in the eluted fractions. Spectra were recorded on a JASCO 720 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm cell at a concentration of 20 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6, and at 25, 15, and 5 °C. ITC experiments of Pac11 with Dyn2 and Nip100 CC1B were performed using a Microcal (North Hampton, MA) VP-ITC microcalorimeter at 25 °C in buffer composed of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm sodium azide. Experimental conditions were identical for Pac11 1–87 and for Pac11 1–87Δ66–73, in which residues 66–73 are deleted. In Dyn2 experiments, an initial 2-μl injection was followed by 26 injections of 10-μl Dyn2 samples (250–400 μm) into 15–28 μm Pac11 1–87 (see Fig. 2A) or into Pac11 1–87Δ66–73 (see Fig. 2B) in the sample cell. An initial 2-μl injection was followed by 26 injections of 10 μl of Pac11 1–87 (350–500 μm) into Nip100 CC1B (36–50 μm) in the sample cell. All experiments were accompanied by a constant stirring rate of 351 rpm. Protein samples and buffer were degassed prior to data collection. The data were processed using Origin 7.0 (Microcal) and fit to a single-site binding model. Stoichiometry was computed for number of binding sites; for example, on one Pac11 monomer, there are two Dyn2 sites, giving a stoichiometry of 1:2 for Pac11-Dyn2, and on one Pac11 monomer there is one Nip100 site, giving a stoichiometry of 1:1 for Pac11-Nip100. The recorded data are the averages of three independent experiments, with uncertainty reported as the difference between the experimental value and the average. Doubly labeled 15N/13C- and 15N-labeled proteins were prepared in buffer composed of 10 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.0 with 50 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Arg+, 10 mm Glu−, 1 mm sodium azide, 8% 2H2O, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid for 1H chemical shifts referencing. For backbone assignments, NMR spectra of Pac11 1–87 were obtained at 15 °C and a concentration of 300 μm. The dynamics data of 15N-labeled Pac11 1–87 were collected for the apo, for Pac11-Dyn2 complex at a molar ratio (Pac11: Dyn2) of 1:2.2, and for Pac11-Nip100 CC1B complex at a molar ratio (Pac11: Nip100 CC1B) of 1:1.2. Native PAGE and 1H-15N HSQC spectra were used to assay sample integrity before and after every NMR data collection. All reported data are from HSQC spectra that remain unchanged during data collection. Backbone resonance assignments for apo Pac11 1–87 were determined from a set of [15N,1H]TROSY-based (17Salzmann M. Pervushin K. Wider G. Senn H. Wüthrich K. TROSY in triple-resonance experiments: new perspectives for sequential NMR assignment of large proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Brutscher B. Recovering lost magnetization: polarization enhancement in biomolecular NMR.J. Biomol. NMR. 2011; 49: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) to reduce measurement times. A TROSY-type HAHBHN(CACO)NH (19Löhr F. Schmidt J.M. Rüterjans H. Simultaneous measurement of 3JHN, Hα and 3JHα, Hβ coupling constants in 13C,15N-labeled proteins.J. Am. Chem.

These experiments were carried out with a cryo-probe on a Bruker Avance 900-MHz spectrometer, whereas the remaining experiments (HN(CO)CACB, HNCO) employed a room temperature xyz gradient probe on a Bruker Avance 500-MHz spectrometer. Backbone resonance assignments for Dyn2-bound Pac11 1–87 (Pac11:Dyn2 at a molar ratio of 1:2.2) were determined using a similar HN(CO)CACB experiment collected on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer. Longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) 15N relaxation times were determined at 600-MHz 1H frequency using standard HSQC-based pulse sequences (20Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Backbone dynamics of a free and phosphopeptide-complexed Src homology 2 domain studied by 15N NMR relaxation.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar) at 15 °C. For each series, spectra with ten different relaxation periods (three in duplicate for error estimation) were recorded in an interleaved manner. Their duration varied from 10 ms to 1.3 s in T1 measurements, from 23.2 ms to 371.2 ms in T2 measurements of the free Pac11 1–87, and from 20 ms to 200 ms in T2 measurements of the complex with Dyn2 or Nip100. Steady-state 15N-{1H} NOE values resulted from application of TROSY-based pulse sequences (21Lakomek N.-A. Ying J. Bax A. Measurement of 15N relaxation rates in perdeuterated proteins by TROSY-based methods.J. Biomol. NMR. 2012; 53: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using a total recovery delay of 8 s. A train of 180° 1H pulses spaced by 22 ms was applied to protons for 6 s in the saturation experiment. NMR titrations of 15N-labeled Pac11 with unlabeled Dyn2 and Nip100 CC1B were acquired on a Bruker Avance 700 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. A series of BEST HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled Pac11 1–87 were collected with Dyn2 at final molar ratios (Pac11: Dyn2) of 1:0.1, 1:0.3, 1:0.5, 1:0.7, 1:1.3, and 1:2.2 and with Nip100 CC1B at final molar ratios (Pac11: Nip100 CC1B) of 1:0.1, 1:0.3, 1:0.5, 1:0.7, and 1:1.2. Titration experiments with Nip100 CC1B were performed at pH 7.0. The spectra of fully bound Pac11-Dyn2 (molar ratio of Pac11:Dyn2 = 1:2.2) and Pac11-Nip100 (molar ratio of Pac11:Nip100 = 1:1.2) were also collected on a Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer. All spectra were processed with TopSpin (Bruker) and analyzed using Sparky (22Goddard T. D., Kneller D. G., SPARKY3, University of California, San Francisco.Google Scholar) and NMRView (23Johnson B.A. Using NMRView to visualize and analyze the NMR spectra of macromolecules.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). Cα and Cβ chemical shifts were used to determine the secondary structure by calculating the difference from the random coil values at specified temperature and pH (24Kjaergaard M. Brander S. Poulsen F.M. Random coil chemical shift for intrinsically disordered proteins: effects of temperature and pH.J. Biomol. NMR. 2011; 49: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For Pac11-Dyn2 interactions, per-residue absolute chemical shift change was calculated using both 15N and 1H chemical shift changes in spectra of free Pac11 and Dyn2-bound Pac11 collected at 900 MHz. A scaling factor of 0.17 was used on 15N chemical shift to eliminate the differences in the 15N and 1H chemical shift ranges. For titration and dynamics experiments, peak intensities were measured as peak heights. To account for differences in concentration across the titration series, a normalization factor was determined from the signal to noise ratio of residue 1 in Pac11-Dyn2 titration or residue 87 in Pac11-Nip100 titration. Changes in peak intensities IBound/IFree were calculated as the ratios of signal intensity in spectra of the complex and free Pac11. T1, T2, and steady-state NOE values were determined as described previously (12Morgan J.L. Song Y. Barbar E. Structural dynamics and multiregion interactions in dynein-dynactin recognition.J. Biol.

Biol. 2006; 362: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An ensemble of structures for apo Pac11 1–87 was generated using the program CS-Rosetta (26Shen Y. Lange O. Delaglio F. Rossi P. Aramini J.M. Liu G. Eletsky A. Wu Y. Singarapu K.K. Lemak A. Ignatchenko A. Arrowsmith C.H. Szyperski T. Montelione G.T. Baker D. Bax A. Consistent blind protein structure generation from NMR chemical shift data.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4685-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) and chemical shift assignments for the 1Hα, 1HN, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, and 15N atoms. The CS-Rosetta calculations were carried out on the server at the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank using the chemical shifts data. The average root mean square deviation for the 10 structural models that have the lowest energy structures is 16.2 Å. This large deviation is due to the expected differences in the disordered regions. All 10 structures have similar N-terminal α-helix spanning residues 1–24 with relatively lower average root mean square deviation of 2.3 Å. Domain boundaries of Pac11 were determined using NCBI BLAST. Coiled-coil domains were predicted by the Coils program (27Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences.Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar), and secondary structure was predicted by Psipred v3.3 (28Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Scalable web services for the PSIPRED protein analysis workbench.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: W349-W357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae dynein intermediate chain Pac11 1–87 construct includes the sequence-predicted coiled-coil domain (1–24), as well as two Dyn2 recognition motifs, QT1 (45–54) and QT2 (75–84) (Fig. 1, A and D). Pac11 1–87Δ66–73 includes the same domains and is used to determine the effect of the 66–73 deletion on Dyn2 and Nip100 binding affinities. The Nip100 214–389, Nip100 CC1B, contains the coiled-coil domain identified in mammalian homolog p150Glued as sufficient to bind dynein intermediate chain (11McKenney R.J. Weil S.J. Scherer J.

Pac11 1–87 is primarily disordered with a small percentage of CD-detected helical structure indicated by negative ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 1B) and is monomeric with a MALS-determined molecular mass of 12.3 kDa (calculated MW is 10.6 kDa). Nip100 CC1B and Dyn2 are stable dimers as determined by MALS. The 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of apo Pac11 1–87 (Fig. 1C) exhibits a limited range of amide proton chemical shifts (7.90–8.85 ppm), indicating a predominantly disordered protein. Backbone assignments were determined for 82 of 84 non-proline residues. Secondary chemical shifts indicate high helix propensity for residues 1–24 and lower helix propensity for residues 66–73 (Fig. 1D). These propensities match the sequence-based algorithmic predictions of helix (28Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Scalable web services for the PSIPRED protein analysis workbench.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: W349-W357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) for apo Pac11, except the NMR-detected 66–73 helix is slightly longer and considerably weaker than the predicted 65–69 helix (Fig. 1D, top panel). Although N-terminal residues of Pac11 1–87 are predicted to form a coiled coil, they lack the hydrophobic seam found in coiled coils. Instead, the 1–24 segment is rich in highly charged residues (65.2% Arg, Lys, and Glu) (Fig. 1D), suggesting helix-stabilizing electrostatic interactions between residues i and i + 4 (e.g. Lys5–Glu9 and Lys15–Glu19) and i and i + 3 (e.g. Glu8–Arg11), characteristic of a single α-helix (SAH) domain (29Peckham M. Knight P.J. When a predicted coiled coil is really a single α-helix, in myosins and other proteins.Soft Matter. 2009; 5: 2493-2503Google Scholar). Hereafter, we refer to helix 1–24 as SAH and nascent helix 66–73 as LH (for linker helix). The linker region (helix 25–44) between SAH and QT1 is L1, and the linker region (helix 58–65) between QT1 and LH is L2. Pac11 1–87 binds dimeric Dyn2 with a stoichiometry of 1:2 (n value of 2) and an apparent Kd value of 0.04 μm (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Because the stoichiometry is computed for binding sites, 1:2 means two Pac11 monomers bind two Dyn2 dimers. In comparison, Dyn2 binding to a Pac11 peptide containing only one Dyn2 binding motif (QT2) has a Kd value of 0.62 μm and a stoichiometry of 1:1 (30Rao L. Romes E.M. Nicholas M.P. Brenner S.

Cell. 2013; 24: 2362-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Deletion of LH residues 66–73 in Pac11 does not significantly affect Dyn2 binding affinity (Table 1).TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for association of Pac11 1–87 and Pac11 1–87Δ66–73 with Dyn2 and Nip100 CC1BProteinLigandnKdΔbi]G0ΔH0−TΔSμmkcal/molPac11aThe data are the averages of duplicate ITC runs.

Pac11 denotes Pac11 1–87.b The data are the averages of duplicate ITC runs. Nip100 denotes Nip100 CC1B. Open table in a new tab Pac11 binding affinity for Nip100 is much lower than for Dyn2. The Pac11-Nip100 CC1B interaction measured by ITC has a stoichiometry of 1:1 (n value of 1; two Pac11 monomers bind one Nip100 dimer) and an apparent Kd value of 5.6 μm (Fig. 2C and Table 1). The absence of LH in Pac11 1–87Δ66–73 significantly reduces Nip100 binding affinity (Fig. 2, C and D). In NMR spectra of 15N-labeled Pac11 1–87, taken before and after addition of unlabeled Dyn2 at varying molar ratios, two titration effects are readily apparent for peaks in the amide NH spectral region (Fig. 3A); some NH peaks are attenuated, but their lost intensity is observed in a new peak at a different chemical shift, whereas other NH peaks lose intensity that is not detected elsewhere in the spectrum. Resonance assignments of all peaks were determined using standard three-dimensional experiments. Secondary chemical shifts of observable peaks in the spectrum of Dyn2-bound Pac11 (Fig. 3B, red) are the same as for apo Pac11 (Fig. 3B, black), indicating that, for residues that can be detected in Dyn2-bound Pac11, there is no change in secondary structures compared with apo Pac11 (e.g. SAH peaks 1–24). The first titration effect is illustrated in Fig. 3A, which overlays HSQC spectra of Pac11 1–87 without Dyn2 (black) and with a Pac11:Dyn2 molar ratio of 1:2.2 (red). With Dyn2, peaks of Pac11 residues 58–67 in linker region L2 are observed at a new chemical shift as shown in Fig. 3C, where chemical shift changes are quantified. Although the 58–67 chemical shifts change with added Dyn2, the combined intensity of the two peaks for each NH does not change. A second NH peak at a different chemical shift, with no loss in combined intensity, indicates slow exchange between apo and Dyn2-bound ensembles in which L2 residues experience different local"
https://openalex.org/W1902307829,"Plant evolution is characterized by frequent genome duplication events. Expansion of habitat resulted in the origin of many novel genes and genome duplication events which in turn resulted in the expansion of many regulatory gene families. The plant-specific FCS-Like Zinc finger (FLZ) gene family is characterized by the presence of a FCS-Like Zinc finger (FLZ) domain which mediates the protein-protein interaction. In this study, we identified that the expansion of FLZ gene family size in different species is correlated with ancestral and lineage-specific whole genome duplication events. The subsequent gene loss found to have a greater role in determining the size of this gene family in many species. However, genomic block duplications played the significant role in the expansion of FLZ gene family in some species. Comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa FLZ gene family revealed monocot and dicot specific evolutionary trends. The FLZ genes were found to be under high purifying selection. The spatiotemporal expression analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana FLZ gene family revealed that majority of the members are highly expressed in reproductive organs. FLZ genes were also found to be highly expressed during vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition which is correlated with the proposed role of this gene family in sugar signaling. The comparison of sequence, structural and expression features of duplicated genes identified lineage-specific redundancy and divergence. This extensive evolutionary analysis and expression analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana FLZ genes will pave the way for further functional analysis of FLZ genes."
https://openalex.org/W2135821062,"Evidence has shown that indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) may be alternative predictors of clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both toxins are derived from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolised in the liver. However, it is unclear whether the liver affects the production of IS and PCS. Here, we explore the association between IS and PCS levels in liver cirrhosis and a CKD-based cohort (N = 115). Liver and kidney function was assessed and classified by a Child-Pugh score (child A–C) and a modified version of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (Stages 1–4), respectively. An animal model was also used to confirm the two toxin levels in a case of liver fibrosis. In patients with early liver cirrhosis (child A), IS and PCS were significantly associated with CKD stages. In contrast, serum IS and PCS did not significantly change in advanced liver cirrhosis (child C). A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis also showed that T-PCS was significantly associated with stages of liver cirrhosis after adjusting for other confounding factors (B = -2.29, p = 0.012). Moreover, the serum and urine levels of T-PCS and T-IS were significantly lower in rats with liver failure than in those without (p<0.01, p<0.05 and p<0.01, p<0.05, respectively). These results indicated that in addition to the kidneys, the liver was an essential and independent organ in determining serum IS and PCS levels. The production rate of IS and PCS was lower in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W2124898289,"Objective Cardiovascular response to passive leg raising (PLR) is useful in assessing preload reserve, but it has not been studied longitudinally during pregnancy. We aimed to investigate gestational age associated serial changes in maternal functional hemodynamics and establish longitudinal reference ranges for the second half of pregnancy. Materials and Methods This was a prospective longitudinal study on 98 healthy pregnant women who were examined 3–5 times during 20–40 weeks of gestation (a total of 441 observations). Maternal cardiac function and systemic hemodynamics were assessed at baseline and 90 seconds after PLR using impedance cardiography (ICG). The main outcome measures were gestational age specific changes in ICG-derived variables of maternal cardiovascular function and functional hemodynamic response to PLR. Results Hemodynamic response to PLR varied during pregnancy. PLR led to an insignificant increase in stroke volume during 20+0 to 31+6 weeks, but later in gestation the stroke volume was slightly lower at PLR compared to baseline. PLR caused no significant change in cardiac output between 20+0 and 23+6 weeks and a significant decrease after 24+0 weeks. A decrease in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac contractility was observed during PLR throughout the second half of pregnancy. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by PLR up to 32+0 weeks, but increased slightly thereafter. Conclusion Healthy pregnant women appear to have limited preload reserve and reduced cardiac contractility, especially in the third trimester, which makes them vulnerable to fluid overload and cardiac failure."
https://openalex.org/W1916843094,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the three leading causes for cancer mortality. CRC kills over 600,000 people annually worldwide. The most common cause of death from CRC is the metastasis to distant organs. However, biomarkers for CRC metastasis remain ill-defined. We compared primary and metastatic CRC cell lines for their angiogenesis-protein profiles and intracellular signaling profiles to identify novel biomarkers for CRC metastasis. To this end, we used primary and metastatic CRC cell lines as a model system and normal human colon cell line as a control. The angiogenesis profiles two isogenic CRC cell lines, SW480 and SW620, and HT-29 and T84 revealed that VEGF was upregulated in both SW620 and T84 whereas coagulation factor III, IGFBP-3, DPP IV, PDGF AA/AB, endothelin I and CXCL16 were downregulated specifically in metastatic cell lines. Furthermore, we found that TIMP-1, amphiregulin, endostatin, angiogenin were upregulated in SW620 whereas downregulated in T84. Angiogenin was downregulated in T84 and GM-CSF was also downregulated in SW620. To induce CRC cell metastasis, we treated cells with pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Upon IL-6 treatment, epithelial-mesenchymal transition was induced in CRC cells. When DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were treated with IL-6; Akt, STAT3, AMPKα and Bad phosphorylation levels were increased. Interestingly, SW620 showed the same signal activation pattern with IL-6 treatment of HT-29 and DLD-1. Our data suggest that Akt, STAT3, AMPKα and Bad activation can be biomarkers for metastatic colorectal cancer. IL-6 treatment specifically reduced phosphorylation levels of EGFR, HER2 receptor, Insulin R and IGF-1R in receptor tyrosine kinase array study with HT-29. Taken together, we have identified novel biomarkers for metastatic CRC through the angiogenesis-antibody array and intracellular signaling array studies. Present study suggests that those novel biomarkers can be used as CRC prognosis biomarkers, and as potential targets for the metastatic CRC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2403260823,"Malignant glioma is characterised by a rapid growth rate and high capacity for invasive infiltration to surrounding brain tissue; hence, diagnosis and treatment is difficult and patient survival is poor. Aptamers contribute a promising and unique technology for the in vitro imaging of live cells and tissues, with a potentially bright future in clinical diagnostics and therapeutics for malignant glioma. The binding selectivity, uptake capacity and binding target of two DNA aptamers, SA43 and SA44, were investigated in glioma cells and patient tissues. The binding assay showed that SA43 and SA44 bound with strong affinity (Kd, 21.56 ± 4.60 nM and Kd, 21.11 ± 3.30 nM respectively) to the target U87MG cells. Quantitative analysis by flow cytometry showed that the aptamers were able to actively internalise in U87MG and 1321N1 glioma cells compared to the non-cancerous and non-glioma cell types. Confocal microscopy confirmed staining in the cytoplasm, and co-localisation studies with endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and lysosomal markers suggested internalisation and compartmentalisation within the endomembrane system. Both aptamers selectively bound to Ku 70 and Ku 80 DNA repair proteins as determined by aptoprecipitation (AP) followed by mass spectrometry analysis and confirmation by Western blot. In addition, aptohistochemical (AHC) staining on paraffin embedded, formalin fixed patient tissues revealed that the binding selectivity was significantly higher for SA43 aptamer in glioma tissues (grade I, II, III and IV) compared to the non-cancerous tissues, whereas SA44 did not show selectivity towards glioma tissues. The results indicate that SA43 aptamer can differentiate between glioma and non-cancerous cells and tissues and therefore, shows promise for histological diagnosis of glioma."
https://openalex.org/W1574389657,"The cystine-glutamate antiporter (system xc-) is a Na+-independent amino acid transporter that exchanges extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate. It is thought to play a critical role in cellular redox processes through regulation of intracellular glutathione synthesis via cystine uptake. In gliomas, system xc- expression is universally up-regulated while that of glutamate transporters down-regulated, leading to a progressive accumulation of extracellular glutamate and excitotoxic cell death of the surrounding non-tumorous tissue. Additionally, up-regulation of system xc- in activated microglia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders mediated by excess glutamate. Consequently, system xc- is a new drug target for brain cancer and neuroinflammatory diseases associated with excess extracellular glutamate. Unfortunately no potent and selective small molecule system xc- inhibitors exist and to our knowledge, no high throughput screening (HTS) assay has been developed to identify new scaffolds for inhibitor design. To develop such an assay, various neuronal and non-neuronal human cells were evaluated as sources of system xc-. Human glioma cells were chosen based on their high system xc- activity. Using these cells, [14C]-cystine uptake and cystine-induced glutamate release assays were characterized and optimized with respect to cystine and protein concentrations and time of incubation. A pilot screen of the LOPAC/NINDS libraries using glutamate release demonstrated that the logistics of the assay were in place but unfortunately, did not yield meaningful pharmacophores. A larger, HTS campaign using the 384-well cystine-induced glutamate release as primary assay and the 96-well 14C-cystine uptake as confirmatory assay is currently underway. Unexpectedly, we observed that the rate of cystine uptake was significantly faster than the rate of glutamate release in human glioma cells. This was in contrast to the same rates of cystine uptake and glutamate release previously reported in normal human fibroblast cells."

Down-regulation of class I expression is a known immune evasive mechanism used by cancer cells and viruses. Moreover, recent observations suggest that even minor differences in expression levels may influence the course of viral infections and the frequency of complications to stem cell transplantation. We have shown that some human multipotent stem cells have high expression of HLA-A while HLA-B is only weakly expressed, and demonstrate here that this is also the case for the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T. Using quantitative flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction we found expression levels of endogenous HLA-A3 (median 71,204 molecules per cell) 9.2-fold higher than the expression of-B7 (P = 0.002). Transfection experiments with full-length HLA-A2 and -B8 encoding plasmids confirmed this (54,031 molecules per cell vs. 2,466, respectively, P = 0.001) independently of transcript levels suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. Using chimeric constructs we found that the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane region had no impact on the differential cell surface expression. In contrast, ~65% of the difference could be mapped to the six C-terminal amino acids of the alpha 2 domain and the alpha 3 domain (amino acids 176-284), i.e. amino acids not previously shown to be of importance for differential expression levels of HLA class I molecules. We suggest that the differential cell surface expression of two common HLA-A and-B alleles is regulated by a post-translational mechanism that may involve hitherto unrecognized molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1934133859,"Background Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are a rare group of genetic diseases which can lead to several serious long-term complications in newborns. In order to address these issues as early as possible, a process called tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can be used as it allows for rapid and simultaneous detection of the diseases. This analysis was performed to determine whether newborn screening by MS/MS is cost-effective in Thailand. Method A cost-utility analysis comprising a decision-tree and Markov model was used to estimate the cost in Thai baht (THB) and health outcomes in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The results were also adjusted to international dollars (I$) using purchasing power parities (PPP) (1 I$ = 17.79 THB for the year 2013). The comparisons were between 1) an expanded neonatal screening programme using MS/MS screening for six prioritised diseases: phenylketonuria (PKU); isovaleric acidemia (IVA); methylmalonic acidemia (MMA); propionic acidemia (PA); maple syrup urine disease (MSUD); and multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD); and 2) the current practice that is existing PKU screening. A comparison of the outcome and cost of treatment before and after clinical presentations were also analysed to illustrate the potential benefit of early treatment for affected children. A budget impact analysis was conducted to illustrate the cost of implementing the programme for 10 years. Results The ICER of neonatal screening using MS/MS amounted to 1,043,331 THB per QALY gained (58,647 I$ per QALY gained). The potential benefits of early detection compared with late detection yielded significant results for PKU, IVA, MSUD, and MCD patients. The budget impact analysis indicated that the implementation cost of the programme was expected at approximately 2,700 million THB (152 million I$) over 10 years. Conclusion At the current ceiling threshold, neonatal screening using MS/MS in the Thai context is not cost-effective. However, the treatment of patients who were detected early for PKU, IVA, MSUD, and MCD, are considered favourable. The budget impact analysis suggests that the implementation of the programme will incur considerable expenses under limited resources. A long-term epidemiological study on the incidence of IEM in Thailand is strongly recommended to ascertain the magnitude of problem."

The aim of this study was to explore a protein-based strategy to induce differentiation of human biliary tree stem cells (hBTSCs) towards β-pancreatic cells. A plasmid containing the sequence of the human pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) has been expressed in E. coli. Epithelial-Cell-Adhesion-Molecule positive hBTSCs or mature human hepatocyte cell line, HepG2, were grown in medium to which Pdx1 peptide was added. Differentiation toward pancreatic islet cells were evaluated by the expression of the β-cell transcription factors, Pdx1 and musculoapo-neurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A, and of the pancreatic hormones, insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, investigated by real time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, light microscopy and immunofluorescence. C-peptide secretion in response to high glucose was also measured. Results indicated how purified Pdx1 protein corresponding to the primary structure of the human Pdx1 by mass spectroscopy was efficiently produced in bacteria, and transduced into hBTSCs. Pdx1 exposure triggered the expression of both intermediate and mature stage β-cell differentiation markers only in hBTSCs but not in HepG2 cell line. Furthermore, hBTSCs exposed to Pdx1 showed up-regulation of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin genes and formation of 3-dimensional islet-like structures intensely positive for insulin and glucagon. Finally, Pdx1-induced islet-like structures exhibited glucose-regulated C-peptide secretion. In conclusion, the human Pdx1 is highly effective in triggering hBTSC differentiation toward functional β-pancreatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2169475162,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a small subset of dendritic cells and the main producers of type I interferons. Besides their contribution to tolerance, they are known to be involved in autoimmune diseases and have recently been implicated in atherosclerosis. However, their precise involvement, particularly in advanced lesion development, remains elusive. Hence, we investigated the role of pDCs in atherogenesis vs atheroprogression by specifically depleting this cell population using the BDCA2-DTR mouse model bred to Apolipoprotein E (Apoe-/-) deficient mice.Our results revealed that continuous diphtheria toxin-induced pDC depletion in Apoe-/- BDCA2-DTR mice receiving a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks did not alter lesion size or composition. Instead, these mice displayed increased B cell numbers and altered levels of inflammatory cytokines. Analysis of depletion efficiency showed that complete pDC depletion could only be sustained for one week and reoccurring pDCs sorted after 4 weeks did not express DTR anymore. Consequently, we analyzed lesion development in a model of partial carotid ligation, inducing established lesions after 5 weeks of HFD feeding, and only depleted pDCs during the last week of 5 weeks HFD feeding. Despite short-term, but efficient pDC depletion, we observed no differences in atherosclerotic lesion development, but changes in inflammatory cytokine titers. To assure the functionality of the BDCA2-DTR model in acute settings, we additionally examined the effect of pDC depletion in an indirect acute lung injury (iALI) model. This time, efficient pDC depletion resulted in a significantly reduced macrophage and neutrophil accumulation in the lung 12 hours after LPS challenge, underlining a pro-inflammatory role of pDCs in the innate immune response in iALI.Taken together, the BDCA2-DTR mouse model only allows efficient pDC depletion for one week, which subsequently restricts its usability to more acute but not chronic inflammatory disease models."
https://openalex.org/W2126125452,"As a negative regulator of muscle size, myostatin (Mstn) impacts the force-production capabilities of skeletal muscles. In the masticatory system, measures of temporalis-stimulated bite forces in constitutive myostatin KOs suggest an absolute, but not relative, increase in jaw-muscle force. Here, we assess the phenotypic and physiologic impact of postnatal myostatin inhibition on bite mechanics using an inducible conditional KO mouse in which myostatin is inhibited with doxycycline (DOX). Given the increased control over the timing of gene inactivation in this model, it may be more clinically-relevant for developing interventions for age-associated changes in the musculoskeletal system. DOX was administered for 12 weeks starting at age 4 months, during which time food intake was monitored. Sex, age and strain-matched controls were given the same food without DOX. Bite forces were recorded just prior to euthanasia after which muscle and skeletal data were collected. Food intake did not differ between control or DOX animals within each sex. DOX males were significantly larger and had significantly larger masseters than controls, but DOX and control females did not differ. Although there was a tendency towards higher absolute bite forces in DOX animals, this was not significant, and bite forces normalized to masseter mass did not differ. Mechanical advantage for incisor biting increased in the DOX group due to longer masseter moment arms, likely due to a more anteriorly-placed masseter insertion. Despite only a moderate increase in bite force in DOX males and none in DOX females, the increase in masseter mass in males indicates a potentially positive impact on jaw muscles. Our data suggest a sexual dimorphism in the role of mstn, and as such investigations into the sex-specific outcomes is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1481380232,"Transmembrane topology of polytopic membrane proteins (PMPs) is established in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the ribosome Sec61-translocon complex (RTC) through iterative cycles of translocation initiation and termination. It remains unknown, however, whether tertiary folding of transmembrane domains begins after the nascent polypeptide integrates into the lipid bilayer or within a proteinaceous environment proximal to translocon components. To address this question, we used cysteine scanning mutagenesis to monitor aqueous accessibility of stalled translation intermediates to determine when, during biogenesis, hydrophilic peptide loops of the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel are delivered to cytosolic and lumenal compartments. Results showed that following ribosome docking on the ER membrane, the nascent polypeptide was shielded from the cytosol as it emerged from the ribosome exit tunnel. Extracellular loops followed a well defined path through the ribosome, the ribosome translocon junction, the Sec61-translocon pore, and into the ER lumen coincident with chain elongation. In contrast, intracellular loops (ICLs) and C-terminalresidues exited the ribosome into a cytosolically shielded environment and remained inaccessible to both cytosolic and lumenal compartments until translation was terminated. Shielding of ICL1 and ICL2, but not the C terminus, became resistant to maneuvers that disrupt electrostatic ribosome interactions. Thus, the early folding landscape of polytopic proteins is shaped by a spatially restricted environment localized within the assembled ribosome translocon complex.

https://openalex.org/W2195984805,"In constructing and visualizing a virtual three-dimensional forest scene, we must first obtain the vegetation distribution, namely, the location of each plant in the forest. Because the forest contains a large number of plants, the distribution of each plant is difficult to obtain from actual measurement methods. Random approaches are used as common solutions to simulate a forest distribution but fail to reflect the specific biological arrangements among types of plants. Observations show that plants in the forest tend to generate particular distribution patterns due to growth competition and specific habitats. This pattern, which represents a local feature in the distribution and occurs repeatedly in the forest, is in line with the “locality” and “static” characteristics in the “texture data”, making it possible to use a sample-based texture synthesis strategy to build the distribution. We propose a vegetation distribution data generation method that uses sample-based vector pattern synthesis. A sample forest stand is obtained first and recorded as a two-dimensional vector-element distribution pattern. Next, the large-scale vegetation distribution pattern is synthesized automatically using the proposed vector pattern synthesis algorithm. The synthesized distribution pattern resembles the sample pattern in the distribution features. The vector pattern synthesis algorithm proposed in this paper adopts a neighborhood comparison technique based on histogram matching, which makes it efficient and easy to implement. Experiments show that the distribution pattern synthesized with this method can sufficiently preserve the features of the sample distribution pattern, making our method meaningful for constructing realistic forest scenes."
