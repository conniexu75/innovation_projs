https://openalex.org/W2151400960,"Cranial radiation therapy causes a progressive decline in cognitive function that is linked to impaired neurogenesis. Chronic inflammation accompanies radiation injury, suggesting that inflammatory processes may contribute to neural stem cell dysfunction. Here, we show that neuroinflammation alone inhibits neurogenesis and that inflammatory blockade with indomethacin, a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, restores neurogenesis after endotoxin-induced inflammation and augments neurogenesis after cranial irradiation."

https://openalex.org/W2026474458,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves cognitive control: the ability to coordinate thoughts or actions in relation with internal goals. Its functional architecture, however, remains poorly understood. Using brain imaging in humans, we showed that the lateral PFC is organized as a cascade of executive processes from premotor to anterior PFC regions that control behavior according to stimuli, the present perceptual context, and the temporal episode in which stimuli occur, respectively. The results support an unified modular model of cognitive control that describes the overall functional organization of the human lateral PFC and has basic methodological and theoretical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2053998703,"Nova proteins are neuron-specific antigens targeted in paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia (POMA), an autoimmune neurologic disease characterized by abnormal motor inhibition. Nova proteins regulate neuronal pre-messenger RNA splicing by directly binding to RNA. To identify Nova RNA targets, we developed a method to purify protein-RNA complexes from mouse brain with the use of ultraviolet cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP).Thirty-four transcripts were identified multiple times by Nova CLIP.Three-quarters of these encode proteins that function at the neuronal synapse, and one-third are involved in neuronal inhibition.Splicing targets confirmed in Nova-/- mice include c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2, neogenin, and gephyrin; the latter encodes a protein that clusters inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine receptors, two previously identified Nova splicing targets.Thus, CLIP reveals that Nova coordinately regulates a biologically coherent set of RNAs encoding multiple components of the inhibitory synapse, an observation that may relate to the cause of abnormal motor inhibition in POMA."
https://openalex.org/W1969509464,"Among nonhuman primates, females often form strong bonds with kin and other group members. These relationships are thought to have adaptive value for females, but direct effects of sociality on fitness have never been demonstrated. We present 16 years of behavioral data from a well-studied population of wild baboons, which demonstrate that sociality of adult females is positively associated with infant survival, an important component of variation in female lifetime fitness. The effects of sociality on infant survival are independent of the effects of dominance rank, group membership, and environmental conditions. Our results are consistent with the evidence that social support has beneficial effects on human health and well-being across the life span. For humans and other primates, sociality has adaptive value."

https://openalex.org/W1994326378,"By 2050, the human population will probably be larger by 2 to 4 billion people, more slowly growing (declining in the more developed regions), more urban, especially in less developed regions, and older than in the 20th century. Two major demographic uncertainties in the next 50 years concern international migration and the structure of families. Economies, nonhuman environments, and cultures (including values, religions, and politics) strongly influence demographic changes. Hence, human choices, individual and collective, will have demographic effects, intentional or otherwise."

https://openalex.org/W1970708724,"The resistance of a homogeneous semiconductor increases quadratically with magnetic field at low fields and, except in very special cases, saturates at fields much larger than the inverse of the carrier mobility, a number typically of the order of 1 T (refs 1, 2). A surprising exception to this behaviour has recently been observed in doped silver chalcogenides, which exhibit an anomalously large, quasi-linear magnetoresistive response that extends down to low fields and survives, even at extreme fields of 55 T and beyond. Here we present a simple model of a macroscopically disordered and strongly inhomogeneous semiconductor that exhibits a similar non-saturating magnetoresistance. In addition to providing a possible explanation for the behaviour of doped silver chalcogenides, our model suggests potential routes for the construction of magnetic field sensors with a large, controllable and linear response."

https://openalex.org/W1487100945,"We have synthesized inorganic micron-sized filaments, whose microstucture consists of silica-coated nanometer-sized carbonate crystals, arranged with strong orientational order. They exhibit noncrystallographic, curved, helical morphologies, reminiscent of biological forms. The filaments are similar to supposed cyanobacterial microfossils from the Precambrian Warrawoona chert formation in Western Australia, reputed to be the oldest terrestrial microfossils. Simple organic hydrocarbons, whose sources may also be abiotic and indeed inorganic, readily condense onto these filaments and subsequently polymerize under gentle heating to yield kerogenous products. Our results demonstrate that abiotic and morphologically complex microstructures that are identical to currently accepted biogenic materials can be synthesized inorganically."

https://openalex.org/W2000427041,"We fabricated a device that controls the motion of flux quanta in a niobium superconducting film grown on an array of nanoscale triangular pinning potentials. The controllable rectification of the vortex motion is due to the asymmetry of the fabricated magnetic pinning centers. The reversal in the direction of the vortex flow is explained by the interaction between the vortices trapped on the magnetic nanostructures and the interstitial vortices. The applied magnetic field and input current strength can tune both the polarity and magnitude of the rectified vortex flow. Our ratchet system is explained and modeled theoretically, taking the interactions between particles into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2035898274,"Assuming no radical transformation in human behavior, we can expect important changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services by 2050. A considerable number of species extinctions will have taken place. Existing large blocks of tropical forest will be much reduced and fragmented, but temperate forests and some tropical forests will be stable or increasing in area, although the latter will be biotically impoverished. Marine ecosystems will be very different from today's, with few large marine predators, and freshwater biodiversity will be severely reduced almost everywhere. These changes will not, in themselves, threaten the survival of humans as a species."

https://openalex.org/W2171597027,"ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1) is widely expressed in mammals, but its biological role is unknown. We show here by gene targeting that ADAR1 selectively edits in vivo two of five closely spaced adenosines in the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 2C receptor pre-mRNA of nervous tissue; and hence, site-selective adenosine-to-inosine editing is indeed a function of ADAR1. Remarkably, homozygosity for two different null alleles of ADAR1 caused a consistent embryonic phenotype appearing early at embryonic day 11 and leading to death between embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5. This phenotype manifests a rapidly disintegrating liver structure, along with severe defects in definitive hematopoiesis, encompassing both erythroid and myeloid/granuloid progenitors as well as spleen colony-forming activity from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and fetal liver. Probably as a consequence of these developmental impairments, ADAR1-deficient embryonic stem cells failed to contribute to liver, bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and blood in adult chimeric mice. Thus, ADAR1 subserves critical steps in developing non-nervous tissue, which are likely to include transcript editing.

Thus, ADAR1 subserves critical steps in developing non-nervous tissue, which are likely to include transcript editing. From Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of primary transcripts in the nucleus recodes exonic information and can lead to structural and functional changes in the encoded protein, thereby enlarging the protein space encoded by the transcriptome (1Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In mammals, only few edits have been identified, all by serendipity and all in brain-expressed transcripts. Two sequence-related genes encode candidate enzymes for A-to-I editing, termed ADAR1 and ADAR2, each endowed with regions for binding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNAdouble-stranded RNA5-HT2C5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 2CESembryonic stemEembryonic day(s)CFU-Ecolony-forming unit-erythroid, BFU-E, burst-forming unit-erythroidCFU-M/Gcolony-forming unit-myeloid/granuloidCFU-Scolony-forming unit(s)-spleenAGMaorta-gonad-mesonephrosSNPsingle nucleotide polymorphismTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. and an enzyme domain distantly related to bacterial cytidine deaminase (1Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). A third protein, RED2 (dsRNA-specific editase-2), which meets the sequence requirements for a candidate A-to-I editing enzyme, has no editing activity on synthetic dsRNA (2Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Higuchi M. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31795-31798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), rendering its candidate status questionable. double-stranded RNA 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 2C embryonic stem embryonic day(s) colony-forming unit-erythroid, BFU-E, burst-forming unit-erythroid colony-forming unit-myeloid/granuloid colony-forming unit(s)-spleen aorta-gonad-mesonephros single nucleotide polymorphism terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. The single instance in which an ADAR protein could be assigned to a particular edit concerns ADAR2 and the transcript for the glutamate receptor subunit GluR-B, which is edited to nearly 100% in a particular codon for a critical ion channel determinant (3Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). ADAR2-deficient mice die early from a neurological syndrome, but appear normal when the edited codon (CGG) replaces the unedited CAG version in both gluR-B alleles (4Kask K. Zamanillo D. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13777-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This is the only example where editing is necessary for survival, whereas for the other known edited transcripts, site-selective A-to-I conversion may serve to fine-tune the function of the encoded proteins (5Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 2002; 35: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The biological function of ADAR1 and its involvement in transcript editing are still unresolved and have become even enigmatic with a report that haploinsufficiency of ADAR1 leads to defects in the hematopoietic system and an embryonic lethal phenotype (6Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). ADAR1 exhibits several features that set it apart from the other two, more closely related ADAR proteins. These comprise two putative Z-DNA-binding domains (7Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), a third dsRNA-binding region, more widespread expression (8Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 9O'Connell M.A. Krause S. Higuchi M. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Jenny A. Keller W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and an additional promoter for interferon-inducible transcripts encoding an ADAR1 version with altered amino-terminal sequence (10George C.X. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4621-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These features might indicate that the biological functions of ADAR1 exceed transcript editing. However, as of today, no molecular process with ADAR1 participation has been delineated in mammals, nor has ADAR1 been convincingly shown to edit any of the known sites in brain-expressed transcripts, although two observations provide suggestive evidence for at least one transcript. In ADAR2-deficient mice, two sites in the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor transcript change little in editing status (3Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), but show decreased editing in adar1+/- embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived teratomas (6Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To gain better insight into the biological role of ADAR1, we generated mice with adar1 null alleles. These alleles, in combination with an adar2 null allele, permitted us to use a genetic approach in the mouse to assign different, closely spaced edits in 5-HT2C receptor transcripts unambiguously to either ADAR1 or ADAR2 activity, thus demonstrating that site-selective A-to-I editing is indeed a biological function of ADAR1. Heterozygosity in mice for differently configured adar1 null alleles is compatible with survival and a normal appearance, in stark contrast to the embryonic lethality claimed for haploinsufficiency of ADAR1 (6Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). With homozygosity for our adar1 null alleles, however, embryos at mid-gestation developed a severe liver defect and died between E11.5 and E12.5. Remarkably, the defect involved cells of both the hematopoietic and hepatic lineages, as further suggested by analysis of mouse chimeras derived from ADAR1-deficient ES cells. Hence, ADAR1 has a critical role in non-nervous tissue, but edited transcripts remain to be identified. adar1 Gene Targeting—The targeting vector for Cre/loxP-mediated functional ablation of the murine adar1 gene contained 6.9 kb of 5′-homology sequence including exons 3-6 and a pgk-neo gene flanked by two loxP511 elements (11Hoess R.H. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 12Lee G. Saito I. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) cloned into an SmaI site and 3.3 kb including exons 7-11 as 3′-homology sequence with a third loxP511 element inserted into an MscI site in intron 9 (Fig. 1). The linearized targeting vector was electroporated in R1 ES cells (13Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar), and PCR-mediated screening of 540 G418 (aminoglycoside antibiotic)-resistant clones yielded one clone with a correctly targeted adar1 allele, as confirmed by Southern analyses. Chimeric mice generated by injection of the targeted ES cell clone into C57BL/6-derived blastocysts transmitted the loxP-flanked (floxed) adar1f7-9 allele through the germ line. The adar1Δ7-9 allele was generated by breeding adar1f7-9 mice with Cre-deleter mice (14Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The modified loxP511 elements were used to permit allele-specific Cre-mediated recombination in the presence of an adar2 allele floxed with canonical loxP sites. The recombination efficiency of loxP511 in adar1+/f7-9 mice was comparable with that of the floxed adar2 allele. 2M. Higuchi, unpublished data. Cre-positive adar1f7-9 mice were backcrossed to eliminate the cre transgene, and germ line excision of the floxed adar1 gene segment was verified by Southern analyses and sequencing of genomic DNA from adar1Δ7-9 mice. The adar1Δ2-13 allele was created by replacing exons 2-13 of the adar1 gene with a pgk-neo gene, 1.1 kb of intron 1A generated by PCR as 5′-homology sequence, and a cloned 6-kb genomic fragment containing exons 14 and 15 as 3′-homology sequence. Electroporation of the linearized targeting vector into R1 ES cells and PCR-based screening of 1602 G418-resistant clones for homologous recombination events in the adar1 locus yielded three clones with a correctly targeted adar1Δ2-13 allele, as confirmed by Southern analyses. Two clones were injected into C57BL/6-derived blastocysts and contributed to viable chimeric offspring. Highly chimeric mice backcrossed to either NMRI or C57BL/6 wild-type mice transmitted the adar1Δ2-13 allele through the germ line. Embryo Dissection and Genotyping—Embryos were derived from timed matings of adar1+/Δ7-9 or adar1+/Δ2-13 mice, with noon of the vaginal plug day defined as E0.5, and carefully staged by somite counts in combination with morphological criteria (15Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). Embryos were genotyped by multiplex PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from yolk sacs or tail snips with adar1 allele-specific oligonucleotide combinations: 5′-CTGTTGGGCCAGTGGTTCAGTAGTCC-3′ (adar1+ allele), 5′-GCGTACGTCGACGGTATCGA-3′ (adar1Δ7-9 allele), 5′-GCCACTTCTCCCTGACTCCTG-3′ (common downstream primer), 5′-CCTGCACATGCCGTGATCAGC-3′ (common upstream primer), 5′-GGGTGGACAAGTACCACCTG-3′ (adar1+ allele), and 5′-TAGATCTATAGATCTCTCGTGGGATC-3′ (adar1Δ2-13 allele). 5-HT2CReceptor Transcript Editing in Primary Neuronal Cultures—Single cell suspensions of four to eight brains from E12 embryos for each genotype were individually plated on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated culture dishes and cultured for 3 weeks in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) under appropriate conditions (37 °C, 5% (v/v) CO2, and >95% humidity). After culturing, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was extracted with TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random primers. PCR products containing the five editing sites were generated with 5-HT2C receptor cDNA-specific oligonucleotides (5′-GGCCAGCACTTTCAATAGTCGTG-3′ and 5′-CAATCTTCATGATGGCCTTAGTCC-3′) and sequenced directly with a nested primer (5′-GGCGAATTCCATTGCTGATATGCTGGTG-3′). The approximate extent of editing was derived from the different peak heights for the two purines occurring in the five editing positions in DNA sequence chromatograms. Hematoxylin/Eosin Staining and Immunohistochemistry—Procedures were as described (16Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Paraffin sections (5 μm) of embryos fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma) were processed for histology and stained with Gill's hematoxylin 3 (Polysciences, Inc.) and eosin Y (Polysciences, Inc.). Sections processed for immunohistochemistry were incubated with antibody to TER-119 (3 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) or α-fetoprotein (4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and stained with biotin-conjugated IgG (2 μg/ml; Vector Labs, Inc.) directed against the primary antibody using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Labs, Inc.). Nuclear counterstaining was carried out with Gill's hematoxylin 3. Methylcellulose Culture—Single cell suspensions of yolk sac (104 cells), fetal liver (104 cells), and peripheral blood (105 cells) were cultured in duplicate in 0.9% (w/v) methylcellulose (M3234, Stemcell Technologies) supplemented with interleukin-3 (10 ng/ml) and erythropoietin (4 units/ml) to stimulate the growth of erythroid colonies or with 2% pokeweed mitogen murine spleen cell-conditioned medium to promote myeloid/granuloid colony growth. Colonies were counted 3 days (colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E)), 5 days (burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E)), and 9 days (colony-forming unit-myeloid/granuloid (CFU-M/G) post-seeding. For numbers of tissues analyzed, see Fig. 5B. Flow Cytometry—Single cell suspensions (2 × 105 cells) of livers from two wild-type, two adar1+/-, and six adar1-/- E11.5 embryos were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody against c-Kit (clone Ack4, DPC Biermann), recorded in a FACSCalibur, and analyzed with CellQuest software. Colony-forming Unit-Spleen (CFU-S) Analysis—Single cell suspensions of 61 aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) regions and 62 fetal livers from wild-type E11 embryos and of 35 AGM regions and 37 fetal livers from adar1-/- E11 embryos (37-45 somite pairs) were injected into the lateral tail veins of sublethally irradiated (11.5-12.5 grays) adult female NMRI and C57BL/6 mice. Single macroscopic CFU-S colonies were isolated from the recipient spleens 11 days after injection, and genomic DNA was prepared. Male wild-type and mutant ADAR1 embryo-derived colonies were identified by PCR analysis with adar1 allele-specific (see above) and Y chromosome-specific (pYMT2/B; GenBank™/EBI accession number X05260; 5′-GTACTGGAGCTCTACAGTGATG-3′ and 5′-CAACACATCACTGTCATCTCCTG-3′) oligonucleotides. adar1-/-ES Cells—An adar1+/Δ2-13 ES cell clone was plated and selected in high G418 concentrations (2.5 mg/ml) for cells with two adar1 null alleles. PCR-based screening of 240 G418-resistant colonies with adar1 allele-specific oligonucleotides (see above) yielded three adar1Δ2-13/Δ2-13 clones, as confirmed by Southern analyses. Chimera Analysis—Chimeric mice were generated by injection of two independent adar1Δ2-13/Δ2-13 ES cell clones (129/Sv background) into wild-type blastocysts (C57BL/6 × NMRI background), followed by implantation in pseudopregnant foster mice. Genomic DNA was prepared from 15 tissues of four adult (postnatal day 50) chimeric mice, and the contribution of adar1-/- ES cells to these tissues was evaluated by two PCR-based analyses. An adar1 allele-specific PCR (primer sequences are given above) documented the presence of wild-type and null alleles. The extent of tissue colonization by the ADAR1-deficient ES cells was quantified from the sequences of PCR products containing a particular single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; mm3_snpNih_rs3724839, the particular SNP in the SNP database of the National Institutes of Health) on chromosome 3 to distinguish the “parental” mouse strains (T for 129/Sv and C for NMRI and C57BL/6). PCR products containing the SNP were generated with oligonucleotides 5′-GGGGAAGGTGAAGTCACCACTG-3′ and 5′-CTCAAAGCTAGCACATGTTGTGCTG-3′ and sequenced directly with a nested primer (5′-CCCCTGGTTAGTGTGATAGAGTG-3′). Different adar1 null alleles Produce the Same Embryonic Phenotype—We constructed a targeting vector for Cre/loxP-mediated functional ablation of the murine adar1 gene by introducing a pgk-neo gene flanked by two modified loxP elements (see “Experimental Procedures”) into intron 6 and a third such element into intron 9 of cloned adar1 genomic sequence (Fig. 1). The loxP-flanked (floxed) sequence encodes residues 707-870 of the interferon-inducible form of ADAR1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number AAK16102), including essential regions for editing activity in vitro (Fig. 1) (17Lai F.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) into C57BL/6-derived blastocysts transmitted the floxed adar1f7-9 allele through the germ line, and adar1+/f7-9 mice were bred with Cre-deleter mice (14Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) for germ line excision of the floxed gene segment. Heterozygous adar1+/Δ7-9 mice were phenotypically normal, but adar1+/Δ7-9 intercrosses produced no homozygous offspring among 119 pups (83 heterozygous and 36 wild-type), indicating interference of ADAR1 deficiency with embryonic development. The normal appearance of adar1+/Δ7-9 mice was unexpected based on a report on lethality in chimeric embryos caused by a large population of cells heterozygous for a particular adar1 null allele (6Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), which as we surmised may have exerted a dominant-negative effect. By the same token, the phenotypic resemblance of adar1Δ7-9/Δ7-9 embryos (see below) to the reported chimeric embryos (6Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) might indicate milder functional interference by our adar1Δ7-9 allele. To minimize the potential for interfering products, we constructed a new null allele (Fig. 1) in which exons 2-13, encoding residues 11-1054, which comprise all three dsRNA-binding domains, two putative Z-DNA-binding domains (7Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and most of the catalytic domain of ADAR1, were replaced with a pgk-neo gene. Highly chimeric mice derived from two independent ES cell clones transmitted this severely truncated adar1Δ2-13 allele through the germ line and produced phenotypically normal heterozygous adar1+/Δ2-13 mice, in congruence with adar1+/Δ7-9 mice. In further congruence, no homozygous offspring came from adar1+/Δ2-13 intercrosses, whereas heterozygous and wild-type pups were born at expected frequency. Hence, differently configured adar1 null alleles cause embryonic death upon homozygosity, but not heterozygosity. Selective Loss of RNA Editing by ADAR1 Deficiency—As ADAR1 is thought to be involved in site-selective A-to-I editing (1Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of ADAR1 deficiency on the editing status of the neuronal 5-HT2C receptor transcript, for which ADAR1-mediated editing had been suggested (3Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 6Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We found that at E12, when adar1-/- embryos die (see below), this transcript was spliced such that exon 5 containing the editing sites (20Wang Q. O'Brien P.J. Chen C.X. Cho D.S. Murray J.M.

Use of this procedure was validated by our observation that cultured neurons from wild-type embryos exhibited extents of editing at the 25 known sites (not documented) that were generally within 10-20% of those determined for postnatal brain (3Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). This further demonstrated that the transcripts undergoing editing in the brain were correctly edited after extensive culturing (<3 weeks) of neurons derived from mid-gestation embryos. 5-HT2C receptor transcripts are edited to different levels at five positions within a stretch of five codons, affecting three amino acid positions involved in G protein coupling (Fig. 2) (21Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). ADAR1 deficiency had a remarkably selective effect at sites A and B, at which editing dropped from 80-90% in the wild type to undetectable levels, indicating that these sites are edited exclusively by ADAR1. Site C, only five nucleotides downstream of site B, was unaffected by loss of ADAR1. Editing at site C′, which is the least edited site in vivo (20Wang Q. O'Brien P.J. Chen C.X. Cho D.S. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and site D was elevated relative to the wild type, which may reflect easier access by ADAR2 in the absence of ADAR1. Collectively, these findings identify site-selective A-to-I conversion in pre-mRNA as an in vivo function of ADAR1, previously only shown for ADAR2 (3Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). They further indicate that the two ADAR proteins edit distinct subsets of closely spaced adenosines. We also studied the effect of dual ADAR deficiency on the editing sites in 5-HT2C receptor transcripts, again employing cultured neurons from E11.5 brains of the appropriate genotypes. Because ADAR2-deficient mice die within a few weeks after birth (3Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), we used mice in which lethality was overcome by “Q/R site-edited” gluR-B alleles (4Kask K. Zamanillo D. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13777-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Selective ADAR2 deficiency affected the extent of editing least at sites A and B, again confirming that these are edited by ADAR1. Importantly, we failed to detect any A-to-I conversion in 5-HT2C receptor transcripts in neurons with dual ADAR deficiency (Fig. 2); and hence, the combined activities of ADAR1 and ADAR2 mediate all known A-to-I editing in transcripts for this receptor. ADAR1-deficient Embryos—To define the time and nature of the embryonic death resulting from loss of ADAR1, we inspected and genotyped embryos derived from both adar1+/Δ7-9 (data not shown) and adar1+/Δ2-13 (Table I) intercrosses at different developmental stages. We obtained indistinguishable results for both ADAR1-deficient mouse lines in two different strains (C57BL/6 and NMRI), hereafter referred to as adar1-/- mice. Viable adar1-/- embryos, defined as those with beating hearts at the time of dissection, were identified at mendelian frequency between E8.5 and E11.5. However, whereas most adar1-/- embryos (70%) were alive at E12.0, none survived E12.5. We conclude that ADAR1-deficient embryos die in utero between E11.5 and E12.5.Table IEmbryos derived from adar1+/−intercrossesStageLittersEmbryos+/++/−−/−Live −/−E13.044172680E12.591063449231E12.01313427733423E11.527291661566968E11.023267701356261 Open table in a new tab Beginning at E11.25-11.5 and as strikingly apparent by E12, adar1-/- embryos exhibited a significant reduction in fetal liver size, which preceded a progressively pale yolk sac and an often pale embryo proper compared with wild-type embryos (Fig. 3, A-C). The size of adar1-/- fetal livers was normal until E11.0-11.25, but did not increase further, whereas wild-type and adar1+/- livers gained ∼50% in size between E11.5 and E12.5. At this time, ADAR1-deficient fetal liver had an intact Glisson capsule, but became transparent. Shortly before death, adar1-/- embryos were slightly retarded in development (6-12 h), as shown by morphological criteria and somite numbers compared with age-matched wild-type embryos, although development appeared otherwise normal (Fig. 3B). Microscopic examination of adar1-/- embryos (Fig. 3D) revealed in fetal liver from E11.5 onward a significantly reduced cell density and often blood accumulation in pathologically enlarged spaces, perhaps resulting from massive cell death. The examination failed to detect morphological abnormalities in other tissues, including the neuroepithelium, heart, branchial arches, placenta, and yolk sac. adar1-/- yolk sacs, even when pale, exhibited properly formed blood islands and vessels containing nucleated erythrocytes. Furthermore, staining of endothelial cells in adar1-/- yolk sacs with antibody to platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (22Vecchi A. Garlanda C. Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Matteucci C. Stoppacciaro A. Schnurch H. Risau W. Ruco L. Mantovani A. Dejana E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar) indicated normal organization of the vasculature, and the vitellin vessels connecting the yolk sac and embryo proper appeared intact (data not shown). We did not find in adar1-/- embryos at E12 any sign of hemorrhaging into body cavities such as brain ventricles, pericardium, and peritoneum. Cell proliferation in adar1-/- embryos was comparable with that in wild-type embryos at E11.0-11.25, including fetal liver, as revealed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Slightly later, at E11.5, reduced numbers of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells (30% of the wild type) were found in ADAR1-deficient fetal livers, although bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells were readily detectable in other tissues (data not shown). Lack of Hematopoietic Cells in adar1-/-Fetal Livers—Around E11, the fetal liver becomes the major hematopoietic tissue, giving rise to the blood cell lineages found in the adult until, shortly before birth, hematopoiesis shifts to spleen and bone marrow (23Dzierzak E. Medvinsky A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). At E11.5 (but not yet at E10.5), cell numbers in ADAR1-deficient embryonic hematopoietic tissues were significantly reduced in the yolk sac (to 52 ± 8%, n = 19), fetal liver (to 42 ± 9%, n = 19), and peripheral blood (to 63 ± 9%, n = 11) compared with adar1+/- and wild-type embryos. ADAR1-deficient fetal livers displayed from E11.25 onward a pronounced scarcity of hematopoietic cells with characteristically dark-staining nuclei, which were readily detectable in large numbers in wild-type liver (Fig. 3E). Moreover, many cells appeared with pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 3E) containing fragmented DNA, indicative of apoptotic cell death, as supported by TUNEL assays (data not shown). The majority of hematopoietic progenitors present in fetal liver around E11-13 differentiates into erythroid cells (24Johnson G.R. Moore M.A. Nature. 1975; 258: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed in wild-type liver, beginning at E11.25, a dramatic increase in the number of TER-119-expressing erythroid cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, only a few erythroid cells, most of them diagnosed as yolk sac-derived nucleated erythrocytes, were identified in ADAR1-deficient fetal livers at E11.25-11.5 (Fig. 4). Early hepatogenesis appeared intact in adar1-/- embryos, as judged by normal numbers of hepatoblasts expressing α-fetoprotein at E11.0-11.25 (Fig. 4). Moreover, semiquantitative analysis by reverse"

Calcitonin is essential for calcium balance, whereas CGRP and ADM are important for neurotransmission and cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we identified intermedin as a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family. Analysis of intermedin expression indicated that intermedin is expressed primarily in the pituitary and gastrointestinal tract. Intermedin increased cAMP production in SK-N-MC and L6 cells expressing endogenous CGRP receptors and competed with labeled CGRP for binding to its receptors in these cells. In addition, treatment of 293T cells expressing recombinant calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and one of the three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) showed that a CRLR/RAMP receptor complex is required for intermedin signaling. In contrast to CGRP and ADM, which exhibited a preferential stimulation of CRLR when co-expressed with RAMP1 and RAMP2 or RAMP3, respectively, intermedin represents a nonselective agonist for the RAMP coreceptors. In vivo studies demonstrated that intermedin treatment led to blood pressure reduction in both normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats via interactions with the CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes. Furthermore, in vivo treatment in mice with intermedin led to suppression of gastric emptying activity and food intake. Thus, identification of intermedin as a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family capable of signaling through CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes provides an additional player in the regulation of peripheral tissues by CRLR and will allow development of new therapeutic agents for pathologies associated with diverse vascular and gastrointestinal disorders.

Jonas V. Rosenfeld M.G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 1982; 298: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Among these tissue-specific peptides, ADM and CGRP are important endocrine and neurocrine integrators of homeostasis in the vascular and respiratory systems, whereas amylin is essential for optimal glucose metabolism. The biological actions of these peptides are mediated via binding to two closely related type II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the calcitonin receptor, and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) (4Christopoulos G.

Although the calcitonin receptor is the main mediator for calcitonin action, it also binds amylin. Recent cloning and functional studies have shown that CGRP, ADM, and, to a lesser extent, amylin interact with different combinations of CRLR and the three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) (5Poyner D.R.

Studies using mutant mice deficient in α-CGRP, ADM, or amylin have indicated that CRLR could be important for cardiovascular morphogenesis, sensory neurotransmission, inflammatory reactions, nociceptive behavior, and glucose homeostasis (7Hay D.L.

Thus, the physiological functions of the peptides in this family are determined by receptor-binding specificity and the tissue expression profiles of individual ligands. Because the expression of CGRP and its binding sites does not overlap in the brain (13Kruger L. Mantyh P.W. Sternini C. Brecha N.C. Mantyh C.R. Brain Res. 1988; 463: 223-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we hypothesized the existence of additional calcitonin/CGRP family peptides. Using a phylogenetic profiling approach to analyze the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank, we identified a novel calcitonin/CGRP family peptide, intermedin, from the genomes of human and other vertebrates. Sequence analysis of the prepropolypeptides of different family genes indicated that the sequence homology between intermedin and the paralogous peptides is restricted to the mature peptide and that the intermedin gene evolved during early vertebrate evolution. Pharmacological analyses showed that intermedin signals through CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes and activates the cAMP-dependent pathway in transfected cells. We show that intermedin signals through the CRLR signaling system to regulate vascular and gastrointestinal functions in vivo. Cloning, Phylogenetic Analysis, and Expression Profiles of Human Intermedin—Human intermedin was initially identified from an expressed sequence tag and a genomic sequence (AK024788 and AL096767 in GenBank™), and its identity was verified by PCR amplification using a human Marathon-Ready pituitary cDNA library (Clontech). For analysis of intermedin mRNAs in the human digestive system, normalized first strand cDNA preparations were obtained from Clontech. The putative intermedin peptides from fish were deduced based on a zebrafish expressed sequence tag sequence (AW421384) and puffer fish genomic sequences (Fugu rubripes; Scaffold_1011). The rat and mouse intermedin sequences were deduced based on expressed sequence tags BQ192607 and BG918210, respectively. Putative puffer fish α-CGRP, β-CGRP, ADM, and amylin sequences were deduced based on puffer fish sequences Scaffold_9445, Scaffold_6549, JGI_28042, and JGI_8403, respectively. 2Available at www.jgi.doe.gov/fugu/index.html. The BLOCK MAKER program 3Available at blocks.fhcrc.org. was used to align the mature peptides from different species. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using a routine in ClustalW. 4Available at blocks.fhcrc.org/blocks. The consensus secondary structure of calcitonin/CGRP family peptides was predicted using the Network Protein Sequence Analysis server. 5Available at pbil.ibcp.fr/. For Northern blot analysis of intermedin expression, pituitary RNAs were extracted from pituitary glands obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Following extraction using TRIzol solution, total RNA was resolved on formaldehyde-agarose gels and hybridized with a 32P-labeled rat intermedin cDNA probe. The x-ray film was exposed at -80 °C for 1 week with intensifying screens. Peptide Synthesis—Intermedin-related peptides were synthesized based on the solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocol and analyzed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with a Vydac C18 analytical column and by mass spectrometry using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight Voyager-DE RP workstation. Synthetic ADM, β-CGRP, and related peptides were obtained from Sigma), AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, CA), and Bachem (Torrance, CA). Radiolabeled 125I-CGRP (2000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Stocks of different hormones were prepared in distilled water and diluted in culture medium. Immunoanalysis—Rabbit anti-intermedin antibodies were generated using synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 28-47 (MGPAGRQDSAPVDPSSPHSY) of human intermedin (Strategic Biosolutions, Ramona, CA). This peptide antigen was selected based on the high sequence identity (85%) found in this region of human and rodent intermedins and the negligible similarity to other family peptides. The intermedin peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride before immunization. Antibodies were purified using antigen-conjugated affinity columns. In immunoblot analysis, the anti-human intermedin antibody cross-reacted with synthetic intermedin counterparts from different vertebrates, but not with paralogous peptides, including calcitonin, CGRP, ADM, and amylin. For immunohistochemical analysis, tissues were obtained from adult rats, mice, and bullfrogs and analyzed as described (14Hsu S.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2163-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the intermedin transcript encodes the predicted intermedin mature peptide, full-length human intermedin cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. For Western blot analysis of intermedin in culture medium, 293T cells were transfected with the intermedin expression vector using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the serum-free culture medium was harvested and concentrated using a Centricon-3 column. After concentration, the supernatant was boiled for 5 min in denaturing buffer with 100 mm dithiothreitol before SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-intermedin antibodies. Stimulation of cAMP Production in SK-N-MC and L6 Cells by Intermedin and Related Peptides—Human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells and rat L6 skeletal myoblast cells expressing endogenous CRLR were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. To estimate adenylyl cyclase activation, SK-N-MC and L6 cells (2 × 105 viable cells/well) were plated in 24-well culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 1 day before treatment. Following a 2-h incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12, cells were treated with testing reagents for 30 min in medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 2.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) to prevent hydrolysis of cAMP by phosphodiesterases. Following treatment, cells were lysed, and cAMP content was determined by a specific radioimmunoassay (15Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Activation of CRLR/RAMP Receptor Complexes by Intermedin in Transfected 293T Cells—To study the interaction between intermedin and the CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes, we cloned human CRLR, RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3 (accession numbers NP_005786, NP_005846, NP_005845, and O60896, respectively) cDNAs by PCR from human Marathon-Ready cDNA libraries using two sets of primers flanking the full-length coding sequences of each gene. Each cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. To allow the detection of cell-surface expression of these proteins, CRLR and RAMPs were tagged at the N terminus of the mature protein with a FLAG epitope. Because it has been shown that epitope tagging affects the RAMP1 protein signaling (16Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we used the wild-type RAMP1 construct for analysis of intermedin signaling. HEK293T cells were maintained in 35-mm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of CRLR and/or 10 μg of RAMP expression plasmid using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, harvested from culture dishes, and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. To determine the level of expression of CRLR and RAMP on the cell surface, the resuspended cells (2 × 106/tube) were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody M1 (50 mg/ml; Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 mm CaCl2 (assay buffer) for 4 h at room temperature in siliconized tubes. Cells were then washed twice with 1 ml of assay buffer after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 s. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (sheep anti-mouse IgG) was added to the resuspended cell pellets and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of assay buffer by repeated centrifugation before determination of horseradish peroxidase activity in cell pellets using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and a Lumimark microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Background binding was determined by adding excess amounts of the synthetic FLAG peptide (Sigma) at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. For the assay of adenylyl cyclase activation in transfected cells, cells (2 × 105/ml) were placed in 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 2.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine before hormonal treatment for 4 h. Receptor Binding Assay—Ligand binding assays were done in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes at 37 °C for 2 h. Intact SK-N-MC and L6 cells were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) with 0.06 μg of 125I-CGRP and various concentrations of nonradioactive peptides. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the cell-associated ligand was estimated (15Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined using a γ-counter (EG&G Wallace, Gaithersburg, MD). Effects of Intermedin on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Normal and Hypertensive Rats—Blood pressure measurements were made in conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs; 7-9 weeks of age) pre-adapted to the measurement procedure. Indirect systolic pressure was determined by a programmable non-invasive blood pressure system using the tail-cuff method (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Following attachment of the pressure transducer, rats were left undisturbed for 10 min before base-line measurements that spanned a 15-min interval. Following base-line measurements, rats were injected intraperitoneally with varying doses of hormones. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored for 40 min at 20-s intervals. Changes in blood pressure were calculated as the average of 30 measurements performed within each 10-min interval. Effects of Intermedin on Gastric Emptying Activity—Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice deprived of food for 20 h were given food pellets for 90 min before intraperitoneal injection with different hormones or saline. After treatment, mice were deprived of food again and killed 90 min later. The stomach was excised at the pylorus and cardia before weighing. Gastric emptying was calculated by comparing the stomach weight of treated mice with the stomach weight of control mice killed at the time of hormone injection. Analysis of Ingestive Behavior—Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were housed individually in a regulated environment. Before intraperitoneal injection with testing reagents, mice were deprived of food for 20 h with free access to water. Food intake was measured by placing pre-weighed pellets in the cage and weighing uneaten pellets at 1, 2, and 4 h after treatment. Statistical Analysis—Differences between treatment groups were analyzed by analysis of variance and Student's t test. Intermedin as a Calcitonin/CGRP Family Peptide—We searched the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank for sequence motifs with unique primary and secondary structures shared by all calcitonin/CGRP family peptides using a phylogenetic profiling approach that has been used to identify novel corticotropin-releasing hormone family peptides (15Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Candidate sequences were screened for the presence of proteolytic cleavage sites flanking the putative mature region of the precursor proteins. Based on these criteria, we identified intermedin genes from mammals and teleosts, including zebrafish and a Japanese puffer fish (Takifugu rubripes). Human intermedin encodes a preproprotein of 148 amino acids with a signal peptide for secretion at the N terminus (Fig. 1A). Although the overall amino acid sequence of intermedin shows no similarity to known proteins, a stretch of 47 residues at the C terminus is flanked by dibasic proteolytic cleavage sites at the N terminus and an α-amidation donor residue at the C terminus. The putative mature region of intermedin shares ∼28% sequence identity with ADM and <20% with CGRP (Fig. 1B). Importantly, the predicted mature region adopts an N-terminal disulfide-bonded loop leading into an α-helix, followed by a disordered structure that is shared by all calcitonin/CGRP family peptides (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, sequence alignment of intermedin precursors from mammals and teleosts indicated that sequence conservation in orthologous intermedins is restricted to the mature region. The mature intermedins of human and fish share >60% similarity, whereas human and rodent intermedins are 87% identical (Fig. 1B). In addition, the mouse and rat intermedin peptides appear to differ by only one amino acid. Furthermore, analysis of orthologous intermedins indicated that the positions of N-terminal dibasic cleavage sites vary by a few amino acids among different species, whereas an arginine residue seven amino acids downstream of the dibasic cleavage motif of human intermedin is conserved in all species, suggesting that the mature intermedin from human and other species could be a 40-amino acid peptide. On the basis of these sequence analyses, we predicted that a 47-amino acid mature peptide (intermedin-long (IMDL)) and a shorter 40-amino acid intermedin (intermedin-short (IMDS)) could be generated by proteolytic cleavage at the N-terminal proximate basic residues followed by an amidated C terminus. Because the putative preproregion of intermedin from diverse vertebrates is not conserved, intermedin is unlikely to encode additional active peptides such as the pro-ADM N-terminal 20-amino acid peptide found in the ADM precursor (17Washimine H. Kitamura K. Ichiki Y. Yamamoto Y. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of 12 CGRP family peptides from fish and mammals suggested an ancient evolution for three subgroups of these peptide hormones, with mammalian and teleost intermedins clustered in a separate branch with ADM and CGRP (Fig. 1C). Thus, intermedin and other family peptides evolved before the emergence of modern teleosts and tetrapods. Genomic analysis showed that intermedin is located on the distal arm of human chromosome 22q13 and syntenic mouse chromosome 15. In both human and mouse genomes, intermedin neighbors an aldehyde reductase-like gene. In contrast, all other calcitonin/CGRP family genes cluster on human chromosomes 11 and 12. Intermedin Activates the cAMP-dependent Pathway in SK-N-MC and L6 Cells via the CGRP Receptor—Pairwise sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree building based on all GPCR sequences indicated that intermedin is closest to ADM and CGRP, whereas no orphan GPCR shares a close relatedness with CRLR, the receptor for ADM and CGRP. Thus, CRLR is a candidate receptor for intermedin. To test this hypothesis, we treated human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells and rat L6 skeletal myoblast cells, known to express different levels of CRLR and RAMPs (18Choksi T. Hay D.L. Legon S. Poyner D.R. Hagner S. Bloom S.R. Smith D.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), with synthetic intermedin peptides and then monitored cAMP production. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), treatment with the amidated IMDL (amino acids 1-47) or IMDS (amino acids 8-47) peptide resulted in dose-dependent increases in cAMP production in both cell lines. The observed activation is specific, as treatment with a nonamidated form of intermedin, a truncated amidated intermedin fragment (intermedin (IMD)-(17-47)), or a 31-amino acid peptide from the preproregion of human intermedin (prointermedin-(55-85)) had no effect in either cell line (data not shown), suggesting that α-amidation and residues 8-16 of intermedin are important for intermedin bioactivity. Consistent with earlier reports (5Poyner D.R. Sexton P.M. Marshall I. Smith D.M. Quirion R. Born W. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Foord S.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 18Choksi T. Hay D.L. Legon S. Poyner D.R. Hagner S. Bloom S.R. Smith D.M. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), both ADM and β-CGRP also stimulated cAMP production in these cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B). Of importance, the stimulatory effect of intermedin was suppressed by co-treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist (CGRP-(8-37)) in L6 cells (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that intermedin activates the cAMP-dependent pathway via the CGRP receptor (20Chiba T. Yamaguchi A. Yamatani T. Nakamura A. Morishita T. Inui T. Fukase M. Noda T. Fujita T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E331-E335PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the specific action of intermedin on cAMP production, L6 cells were co-treated with a putative intermedin C-terminal receptor-binding domain (IMD-(17-47)) or an anti-intermedin polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, IMD-(17-47) was found to be a functional antagonist of intermedin action, consistent with the observed antagonistic effect of N-terminally truncated CGRP-(8-37) (Fig. 2C) (20Chiba T. Yamaguchi A. Yamatani T. Nakamura A. Morishita T. Inui T. Fukase M. Noda T. Fujita T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E331-E335PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, co-treatment with the anti-intermedin antibody blocked the stimulatory effect of intermedin, whereas co-treatment with an antibody raised against the unrelated stresscopin-related peptide (SRP)/urocortin II had no effect (Fig. 2D). To establish a direct interaction between intermedin and CRLR, we used iodinated CGRP as the radioligand for receptor binding assays. As shown in Fig. 2 (E and F), IMDL and IMDS displaced 125I-CGRP binding to the SK-N-MC and L6 cells dose-dependently. Intermedin Is a Nonselective Agonist for CRLR/RAMP Receptor Complexes—CGRP and adrenomedullin mediate their action through the CRLR/RAMP complexes, consisting of CRLR and one of the three RAMP polypeptides. To investigate the role of CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes in intermedin signaling, we treated 293T cells expressing different combinations of recombinant CRLR and/or RAMPs with intermedin and related peptides. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of intermedin, CGRP, or ADM had no effect on cAMP production in 293T cells expressing CRLR alone, whereas calcitonin increased cAMP production dose-dependently via the endogenous calcitonin receptor. In contrast, intermedin dose-dependently stimulated cAMP production in cells expressing different CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes (Fig. 3, B-D). Consistent with earlier studies, CGRP and ADM exhibited a preferential stimulation of CRLR when co-expressed with RAMP1 and RAMP2 or RAMP3, respectively. Compared with CGRP, intermedin exhibited a greater potency in the stimulation of cAMP production in cells expressing CRLR/RAMP3, but had lower activity with CRLR/RAMP1. In contrast, intermedin had a lower potency in the activation of both CRLR/RAMP2 and CRLR/RAMP3 compared with adrenomedullin. Thus, the overall rank of potency for the stimulation of CRLR/RAMP1, CRLR/RAMP2, and CRLR/RAMP3 is CGRP > IMD = ADM, ADM > IMD = CGRP, and ADM > IMD > CGRP, respectively. Furthermore, consistent with earlier reports, the expression of CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes on the cell surface of transfected cells was found to be increased synergistically by co-expressing CRLR and RAMPs (Fig. 3E). Intermedin Expression in the Pituitary and Stomach—Initial reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the intermedin transcript is expressed in the pituitary and stomach. Northern blot analysis of rat pituitary RNA showed that two specific intermedin transcripts of ∼5 and 2.5 kb were present in the pituitary (Fig. 4A). To further characterize the expression profile of intermedin, four independent antibodies were developed using a C-terminal 20-amino acid intermedin peptide (IMD-(28-47)). As shown in Fig. 4B, the anti-intermedin antibody (C2411-2) is specific for intermedin and showed no cross-reaction with related peptides, including calcitonin, CGRP, ADM, and amylin. Using the specific anti-intermedin antibody, immunohistochemical analysis of >20 different mouse tissues confirmed intermedin expression in the pituitary and stomach. As shown in Fig. 4 (C (magnification ×100) and D (magnification ×200)), intermedin was expressed mainly in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary, with sporadic signals in the anterior lobe. In contrast, negative controls using preimmune serum or anti-intermedin antibodies presaturated with the intermedin antigen showed no specific signals (Fig. 4, E and F). Likewise, immunohistochemical analysis of pituitary sections from rats and bullfrogs showed that intermedin expression was restricted to the intermediate and anterior lobes of the pituitary (Fig. 4, G and H). Because melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH) had a similar expression pattern in the pituitary (Fig. 4I, anti-MSH staining), we tested whether the anti-intermedin antibody cross-reacts with the MSH peptide. As shown in Fig. 4J, the specific staining of intermedin in the pituitary was not abolished by preincubation with an MSH peptide. To further demonstrate that the intermedin mRNA encodes the predicted mature intermedin peptide, a human intermedin cDNA was subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1, and the expression of intermedin peptide from this construct was investigated using transfected 293T cells. Western blot analysis of concentrated culture media showed that cells transfected with the intermedin expression vector secreted an ∼5-kDa mature intermedin peptide into the culture medium, whereas the culture medium from cells transfected with the empty vector displayed no signal (Fig. 4K). To characterize the expression of intermedin in the gastrointestinal tract, a panel of human cDNAs from the gastrointestinal tract was analyzed by PCR. As shown in Fig. 5A"

They also recognize that people's individual attributes may be influenced and regulated by their group affiliations. It is not known whether such rule-governed, hierarchical classifications are specific to humans or might also occur in nonlinguistic species. Here we show that baboons recognize that a dominance hierarchy can be subdivided into family groups. In playback experiments, baboons respond more strongly to call sequences mimicking dominance rank reversals between families than within families, indicating that they classify others simultaneously according to both individual rank and kinship. The selective pressures imposed by complex societies may therefore have favored cognitive skills that constitute an evolutionary precursor to some components of human cognition."

We have analyzed three genes involved in the control of plant architecture, storage protein synthesis, and starch production from archaeological maize samples from Mexico and the southwestern United States.

Here we report radio observations of GRB 030329, the nearest burst to date, which allow us to undertake calorimetry of the explosion. Our observations require a two-component explosion: a narrow (5 degrees) ultra-relativistic component responsible for the gamma-rays and early afterglow, and a wide, mildly relativistic component responsible for the radio and optical afterglow beyond 1.5 days. While the gamma-rays are energetically minor, the total energy release, dominated by the wide component, is similar to that of other GRBs. Given the firm link of GRB 030329 with SN 2003dh our result suggests a common origin for cosmic explosions in which, for reasons not understood, the energy in the highest velocity ejecta is highly variable"

Under mildly denaturing conditions, all three types of bovine crystallin assemble into fibrillar structures in vitro. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy, dye binding assays, and x-ray fiber diffraction shows that these species have all of the characteristics of fibrils associated with the family of amyloid diseases. Moreover, the full-length proteins are incorporated into the fibrils, (i.e. no protein cleavage is required for these species to form), although for the γ-crystallins some fragmentation occurs under the conditions employed in this study. Our findings indicate that the inherent stability of the β-sheet supramolecular structure adopted by the crystallins in the eye lens and the chaperone ability of α-crystallin must be crucial for preventing fibril formation in vivo.

The ability of the crystallins to convert into fibrils under destabilizing conditions suggests that this process could contribute to the development of cataract with aging. The healthy eye lens is transparent and serves to focus light on to the retina. The predominant proteins within the lens are the crystallins, and lens transparency is thought to be maintained by a liquid-like, short range order present in highly concentrated solutions of these proteins (1Harding J.J. Cataract: Biochemistry, Epidemiology, and Pharmacology. Chapman and Hall, London1991Google Scholar). The high refractive index in the lens is aided by the absence of cellular organelles in the post-mitotic lens fiber cells. With the exception of the outer epithelial layer, there is almost no protein turnover in the lens and therefore the crystallins must be maintained in a stable structure throughout the lifespan of the organism (1Harding J.J. Cataract: Biochemistry, Epidemiology, and Pharmacology. Chapman and Hall, London1991Google Scholar). The crystallins are highly stable proteins that are organized in a supramolecular β-sheet structure within the lens (1Harding J.J. Cataract: Biochemistry, Epidemiology, and Pharmacology. Chapman and Hall, London1991Google Scholar). In mammals, there are three classes of crystallins denoted α, β, and γ, each of which has a variety of distinct subunits. α-Crystallin, the principal lens protein, is a member of the small heat shock protein family and acts as a molecular chaperone (2Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Google Scholar). In its chaperone role, α-crystallin has been shown to inhibit aberrant aggregation and insolubilization of a wide range of proteins under in vitro stress conditions generated, for example, by elevated temperature, chemical reduction, or oxidation (2Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Google Scholar, 3Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Google Scholar). α-Crystallin consists of two closely related subunits, αA and αB. αB-Cystallin is found in significant quantities in a variety of locations outside the eye lens where it is stress-inducible (3Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Google Scholar, 4Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Google Scholar, 5van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv.

Its overexpression is associated with a diversity of disease states including conditions associated with amyloid fibril deposition such as Alzheimer's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and Parkinson's diseases (2Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Google Scholar, 3Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Google Scholar, 4Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin.

Both αA- and αB-crystallins are present in the lens where one of their likely roles is to chaperone all of the crystallin proteins including themselves (9Sun T.X. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Google Scholar), thus preventing extensive protein aggregation and precipitation. The α-crystallin complex is a highly heterogeneous aggregate of 20-kDa subunits, giving rise to multimers in the mass range of ∼300–1000 kDa. The β-crystallins are smaller aggregates comprising ∼20–30 kDa subunits, giving complexes of ∼50–200 kDa, whereas the γ-crystallins are found as monomers of ∼20 kDa in mass (1Harding J.J. Cataract: Biochemistry, Epidemiology, and Pharmacology. Chapman and Hall, London1991Google Scholar). The β-crystallin subunits are structurally related to the γ-crystallins, and crystal structures are available for representative β- and γ-crystallin subunits (10Slingsby C. Clout N.J. Eye. 1999; 13: 395-402Google Scholar). No structure has yet been determined for the α-crystallin subunits. The combination of highly stable, long-lived proteins and a high concentration of molecular chaperones implies that the enclosed lens is well equipped to deal with any misfolding of its component proteins. However, the occurrence of cataract, which arises from crystallin aggregation and precipitation, reveals that there are, nonetheless, shortcomings with respect to lens protein stability. Cataract is defined as opacity of the eye lens and is the leading cause of vision impairment worldwide and is responsible for ∼40–80% of the estimated 45 million cases of blindness that occur across the globe (11Snellingen T. Evans J.R. Ravilla T. Foster A. The Cochrane Library. Issue 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002Google Scholar, 12Hiratsuka Y. Ono K. Kanai A. Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 2001; 105: 369-373Google Scholar). Despite the widespread nature of this disease, the only treatment available at present is surgical removal of the lens and replacement with a plastic intraocular lens (1Harding J.J. Cataract: Biochemistry, Epidemiology, and Pharmacology. Chapman and Hall, London1991Google Scholar, 11Snellingen T. Evans J.R. Ravilla T. Foster A. The Cochrane Library. Issue 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002Google Scholar). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cataract formation may aid the development of a therapeutic strategy that could avoid the need for surgery. Two possible mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, may cause cataract. The first is a condensation phenomenon, whereby opacity results from loss of solubility of the crystallins. For example, the point mutation R14C in human γD-crystallin causes a progressive juvenile-onset hereditary cataract and there is evidence that oxidation of R14C γD-crystallin leads to the formation of disulfide-linked oligomers, which eventually precipitate (13Pande A. Pande J. Asherie N. Lomakin A. Ogun O. King J.A. Lubsen N.H. Walton D. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1993-1998Google Scholar). In other cases, the loss of lens clarity is believed to result from spontaneous crystallization of mutant γD-crystallins (14Pande A. Pande J. Asherie N. Lomakin A. Ogun O. King J. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6116-6120Google Scholar). These mutations dramatically lower the solubility of the protein and increase the crystal nucleation rate relative to that of the wild-type protein. In the second mechanism, cataract is seen as a conformational disorder (15Harding J.J. Curr. Opin. Ophthalmol. 1998; 9: 10-13Google Scholar, 16Heon E. Priston M. Schorderet D.F. Billingsley G.D. Girard P.O. Lubsen N. Munier F.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1261-1267Google Scholar) where unfolding or destabilization of the crystallin proteins drives cataractogenesis. For example, in the case of T5P γC-crystallin, a mutant associated with a number of phenotypes including Coppock-like cataract, there appears to be a direct causal relationship between cataract and partial destabilization and unfolding of the mutant crystallin protein (17Fu L. Liang J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 213-216Google Scholar). In another example of a conformational disorder, amyloid deposition by a γBnop-crystallin mutant appears to be a cause of a murine cataract (18Sandilands A. Hutcheson A.M. Long H.A. Prescott A.R. Vrensen G. Loster J. Klopp N. Lutz R.B. Graw J. Masaki S. Dobson C.M. MacPhee C.E. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6005-6014Google Scholar). Evidence for the latter conclusion includes identification of intranuclear filamentous inclusions in vivo that stain with the amyloid-detecting dye Congo Red and the ready assembly of the mutant γBnop-crystallin into amyloid fibrils in vitro under conditions where the wild-type protein remains soluble. Formation of amyloid deposits in the eye lens would potentially disturb the short range order of the crystallins and thus lead to lens opacity and cataract. In this paper, we report that all three classes of wild-type bovine crystallin proteins, including the molecular chaperone α-crystallin, are capable of forming amyloid fibrils when subject to unfolding conditions in vitro. We show that these fibrils have the characteristic amyloid structure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 1The abbreviations used are: TEMtransmission electron microscopyAβamyloid βGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideTFEtrifluoroethanolThTthioflavin TCRCongo RedMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: TEMtransmission electron microscopyAβamyloid βGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideTFEtrifluoroethanolThTthioflavin TCRCongo RedMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. dye binding assays, and x-ray fiber diffraction.

Purification of α-, β-, and γ-Crystallin—Lenses were extracted from calf eyes obtained from an abattoir (Wollondilly Abattoirs Pty Ltd, Picton, New South Wales 2571, Australia) and stored at –20 °C. Crystallin proteins were purified from bovine lenses as described previously by standard methods via size exclusion chromatography from cows of less than two years in age (19Carver J.A. Nicholls K.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 639-647Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the purity of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. Formation of Amyloid Fibrils by Bovine α-Crystallin at pH 7.4 — Bovine α-crystallin was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated at 60 °C for 24 h with varying concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) (0.001–1 m). Formation of Amyloid Fibrils by Bovine α-Crystallin at pH 2.0 —α-Crystallin was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in 10% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE), adjusted to pH 2.0 with HCl, and incubated at 60 °C for 4 h. Formation of Amyloid Fibrils by Bovine β-Crystallin and γ-Crystallin at pH 2.0 —β-Crystallin was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in 10% (v/v) TFE, adjusted to pH 2.0 with HCl, and incubated at room temperature for 10 h. γ-Crystallin was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in 10% (v/v) TFE, adjusted to pH 2.0 with HCl, and incubated at room temperature for 1–3 weeks. Fibril formation was accelerated by elevating the temperature such that the β- and γ-crystallins formed fibrils after incubation for 3 h at 60 °C. TEM—Formvar and carbon-coated nickel electron microscopy grids were prepared by the addition of 2 μl of protein sample at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The grids were then washed with 3 × 10 μl H2O and negatively stained with 10 μl of uranyl acetate (2% (w/v), Agar Scientific). The grids were dried with filter paper between each step. Samples were viewed under 20–125-K magnifications at 120-kV excitation voltages using a Philips Tecnai transmission electron microscope, and images were analyzed by a MegaView II Soft imaging system. Congo Red Assays—Fresh solutions of Congo Red (CR) (20Glenner G.G. Eanes E.D. Page D.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1972; 20: 821-826Google Scholar) in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, were passed through a 0.2-μm filter immediately before use. The CR solutions were added to 100 μg/ml protein solutions to a final dye concentration of 0.5 μm, and the samples vortexed for 15 s. The absorption spectrum of each sample was recorded from 400 to 700 nm on a Varian Cary Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer using 1-cm path length quartz cuvettes and corrected for contributions from buffer and protein. The spectrum of CR alone was compared with that of CR solutions in the presence of protein. A red shift of the absorption band toward 540 nm and an increase in absorption were together taken to be indicative of the formation of amyloid structures. Thioflavin T Assay—The spectrum of thioflavin T (ThT) alone was compared with that of protein solutions (0.05 mg/ml) containing ThT at a final dye concentration of 50 μm in 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, adjusted to pH 7.0. An increase in the fluorescence emission intensity at 490 nm was taken to be indicative of amyloid formation (21LeVine H. II I Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Google Scholar). Fresh solutions of ThT were passed through a 0.2-μm filter immediately before use. A Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to record the spectra with 1-cm path length cuvettes (λEx = 442 nm; λEm = 460–550 nm). Fibril Purification—Pepsin was added to an α-crystallin fibril solution (1:200 w/w pepsin: α-crystallin) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (22Zurdo J. Guijarro J.I. Dobson C.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 8141-8142Google Scholar). The sample was then ultracentrifuged at 90,000 rpm for 2 h in a Beckman Coulter Optima TL-X ultracentrifuging systrem using a TLA 100 rotor. The supernatant was subsequently carefully removed, and the fibril pellet was re-suspended in minimal buffer. X-ray Fiber Diffraction—α-Crystallin samples for x-ray fiber diffraction were prepared by air-drying a 12-μl aliquot of concentrated pepsin-purified fibril solution between two wax-filled capillary ends. The capillaries were separated slowly while drying using a stretch frame apparatus to enhance alignment of the fibrils. A small stalk of fibrils protruding from the end of one of the capillaries was obtained. The sample was aligned in an x-ray beam, and diffraction images were collected using a Rigaku CuKα-rotating anode source (wavelength, 1.5418 Å) and an R-AXIS IV image plate x-ray detector. Images were analyzed by Java application “Crystal Clear” software. Samples for x-ray diffraction from β-crystallin and γ-crystallin were prepared directly from 12-μl fibril stocks (10 mg/ml) without further pepsin purification. Fibril Solubilization—Fibril samples were centrifuged at 90,000 rpm in a Beckman Coulter Optima TL-X ultracentrifuging system using a TLA 100 rotor for 2 h. The supernatant was then carefully removed from the pellet. The fibril pellet was resuspended in 90% (v/v) acetonitrile to ∼10 mg/ml and incubated at room temperature for 24 h. TEM analysis showed clearly that no detectable quantities of fibrils remained after this treatment. SDS-PAGE—Fibrils, pre-fibrillar protein, and the supernatants of the crystallin samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to investigate whether low molecular weight fragments were present. First, fibrils were solubilized according to the method described above. Protein samples were separated on a 12% NuPAGE bis-tris gel with NuPAGE MOPS buffer over 60 min at 200 V and stained with NuPAGE Simply Blue safestain. Novex Mark 12 wide-range protein standards were used for mass calibration (Invitrogen). Fibril Formation by α-Crystallin at Neutral pH—α-Crystallin was incubated at 10 mg/ml in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with varying concentrations (0.001–1.0 m) of GdnHCl as denaturant. After incubation for 24 h at 60 °C, each sample was examined by TEM. In very low concentrations of GdnHCl (0.001 m), large, roughly spherical aggregates of α-crystallin were present (Fig. 1A) with diameters of 7–15 nm. In 0.1 m GdnHCl, large asymmetric aggregates and chainlike structures with the appearance of a row of beads (Fig. 1B) were observed. The individual beads had a diameter similar to that observed for the similar structures formed in the presence of very low concentrations of GdnHCl (i.e. 7–15 nm). In higher concentrations of GdnHCl, (0.75–1.0 m) (Fig. 1, C and D), a mixture of structures was observed by TEM including long smooth fibrils in addition to the spherical aggregates and rows of beads observed previously (Fig. 1D). The α-crystallin fibrils formed in 1 m GdnHCl were ∼10 nm in diameter and 50–400 nm in length (Fig. 1, C and D) and were very similar in morphology to fibrils formed by amyloidogenic proteins such as β2-microglobulin at acidic pH (23McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Google Scholar). Although the aggregates formed at low concentrations of GdnHCl at 60 °C bound the amyloid-detecting dye ThT, the degree of binding was less than that induced by the presence of the fibrils formed in high concentrations of GdnHCl (Fig. 1E). The insert in Fig. 1E highlights the overall change in ThT binding between the aggregated and fibrillar protein. The TEM images of heated α-crystallin in the presence of low concentrations of GdnHCl (Fig. 1A) show structures of similar size to those observed previously for α-crystallin upon heat incubation in the absence of denaturant (24Burgio M.R. Bennett P.M. Koretz J.F. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 228-233Google Scholar). The bead-like structures, emerging at higher GdnHCl concentrations (0.1 m) at elevated temperatures, arise from what appears to be attractive interactions between spherical α-crystallin aggregates, which may result from an increased exposure of hydrophobic residues in the presence of denaturant. The rows of beads are similar in appearance to the aggregates that form from native α-crystallin in the absence of denaturant at temperatures above 45 °C (24Burgio M.R. Bennett P.M. Koretz J.F. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 228-233Google Scholar, 25Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1979; 28: 551-567Google Scholar, 26Augusteyn R.C. Koretz J.F. Schurtenberger P. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 2000; 268: 426-432Google Scholar) reported a tendency for these beadlike structures to transform into fibrillar structures at higher temperatures (∼70 °C), although the length of these fibrillar structures was significantly shorter (<100 nm) than the fibrils observed in this study (Fig. 1, C and D). We hypothesize that the formation of smooth long fibrils at physiological pH results from increasingly denaturing conditions at higher concentrations of GdnHCl and elevated temperatures, which cause partial unfolding of the α-crystallin subunits (29Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 969-983Google Scholar, 30Das B.K. Liang J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 370-374Google Scholar, 31Doss-Pepe E.W. Carew E.L. Koretz J.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 657-679Google Scholar) and give rise to conditions conducive to fibril formation. Indeed, we observed that at room temperature in the presence of 1 m GdnHCl, only amorphous aggregates of α-crystallin were observed over a 24-h time period (data not shown). Hence, although 1 m GdnHCl is likely to induce partial unfolding followed by self-assembly of α-crystallin, elevated temperatures are required to generate fibril assembly within 24 h. A similar phenomenon is observed for the yeast prion protein Ure2p where conversion from fibrils composed of a polymeric assembly of native-like helical Ure2p subunits into amyloid fibrils is promoted by heat stress (32Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Google Scholar, 33Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Google Scholar). In contrast to α-crystallin, β- and γ-crystallins aggregated and formed amorphous precipitates after <1 h under these conditions (i.e. 10 mg/ml, 1 m GdnHCl, 60 °C, 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.4). The tendency of β- and γ-crystallins to precipitate when subjected to destabilizing conditions (e.g. temperatures of ∼60 °C) is well recognized and is much greater than that of the molecular chaperone, α-crystallin. In fact, a common method of assessing the chaperone ability of α-crystallin, which does not precipitate upon heating to these temperatures, is to heat a mixture of the two proteins together and monitor the inhibition by α-crystallin of precipitation of β- or γ-crystallin (2Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Google Scholar). Fibril Formation by the Crystallin Proteins at Acidic pH—We next subjected the bovine crystallins to acidic pH and assessed their propensity to form amyloid fibrils under these conditions. All three classes of bovine crystallins, α-, β-, and γ, were dissolved at 10 mg/ml in 10% (v/v) TFE in H2O at pH 2.0. TFE destabilizes the native structure of α-crystallin (34Srinivas V. Santhoshkumar P. Sharma K.K. J. Protein Chem. 2002; 21: 87-95Google Scholar), and low concentrations of TFE (10–20% v/v) increase the rate of fibril formation by the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide (35Fezoui Y. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36948-36954Google Scholar). Amyloid fibril formation by other proteins is often induced in vitro by denaturation under acidic conditions (see Refs. 36Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 930-932Google Scholar and 37Dobson C.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 133-145Google Scholar). TEM showed clearly that all of the crystallins underwent major structural changes under these conditions. Thus, immediately after dissolving α-crystallin under these conditions, aggregates of average diameter ≈15–30 nm were observed by TEM (Fig. 2A), which are typical of native α-crystallin. These aggregates significantly increased the fluorescence of ThT (Fig. 3). After incubation at 60 °C for 24 h, however, fibrils were observed by TEM (Fig. 2B) and concomitantly a further increase in the fluorescence emission intensity of ThT occurred (Fig. 3). These fibrils have an average diameter of 15 nm and a length in the order of one to a few microns. There appears to be two types of α-crystallin fibril morphology, remarkably similar to the amyloid fibrils that form from the Aβ-peptide in 20% (v/v) TFE (35Fezoui Y. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36948-36954Google Scholar), i.e. long straight fibrils (Fig. 2B, ▵) and short curly elongated aggregates (Fig. 2B, ▴). It is possible that that the short curly aggregates of α-crystallin were a linear association of native subunits or that they were precursors to amyloid fibrils (“protofibrils”). The long straight fibrils (Fig. 2B, ▵) have the dimensions and a morphology clearly similar to classic amyloid fibrils formed by a wide range of peptides and proteins (38Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Google Scholar).Fig. 3ThT assay. Crystallins were dissolved to ∼10 mg/ml in H2O, 10% (v/v) TFE, adjusted to pH 2.0, and incubated at 60 °C. The average fluorescence emission intensity at 490 nm (λEx = 442 nm) was measured for ThT (50 μm) and compared with that of 50 μm ThT containing 0.05 mg/ml protein at t = 0 h and at t = 24 h in 10 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, adjusted to pH 7.0. a.u., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) β-Crystallin and γ-crystallin also formed fibrils under these solution conditions (i.e. 10 mg/ml, in 10% (v/v) TFE, pH 2.0) (Fig. 2, D and F). Following dissolution of the protein, monomeric subunits and aggregates were observed by TEM (Fig. 2, C and E) for both proteins, similar to α-crystallin. After incubation of β-crystallin for 10 h at room temperature or of γ-crystallin for 1 week at room temperature, fibril formation was evident from the TEM images (Fig. 2, D and F). As for α-crystallin, there was a relative increase in ThT fluorescence emission intensity (Fig. 3) between the pre-fibrillar (Fig. 2, C and E) and fibrillar (Fig. 2, D and F) aggregates. These fibrils of β-crystallin and γ-crystallin have an average diameter of ∼11 nm. Unlike α-crystallin, heating to high temperature (60 °C) was not required for fibril formation by either β-or γ-crystallin, indicating that β- and γ-crystallins form fibrils under milder conditions than α-crystallin. However, heating accelerated the formation of β- and γ-crystallin fibrils and well defined fibrils were visible by TEM after just 2–4-h incubation at 60 °C under the same solution conditions (data not shown). Solutions containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile at pH 2.0 were also effective at inducing fibril formation but on a time scale longer than that required in the presence of TFE, typically 1 week for β- and γ-crystallin when incubated at 60 °C (data not shown). The absorption spectra of Congo Red on binding to both pre-fibrillar aggregates (Fig. 2, A, C, and E) and fibrils (Fig. 2, B, D, and F) were measured, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table I. Each type of crystallin bound Congo Red in its pre-fibrillar and fibrillar states, a result consistent with both types of aggregate being rich in β-sheet structure; however, there was a relative increase in the absorption at 540 nm (Fig. 4, A–C), coinciding with the formation of mature fibrils as observed by TEM (Fig. 2, B, D and F).Table ICharacterization of crystallin fibrilsCongo Red bindingaThe crystallins were prepared as 10 mg/ml solutions containing 10% (v/v) TFE, 90% (v/v) H2O adjusted to pH 2.0 with HCl.

Open table in a new tab X-ray fiber diffraction was also employed to characterize the crystallin fibrils formed at pH 2.0. A high proportion of non-fibrillar aggregates is visible in the TEM images of α-crystallin samples (Fig. 1B). Prior to analysis by x-ray fiber diffraction, the α-crystallin fibrils were purified according to the method of Zurdo et al. (22Zurdo J. Guijarro J.I. Dobson C.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 8141-8142Google Scholar). No detectable quantities of non-fibrillar aggregates were observed in the TEM images of β- and γ-crystallin fibril samples; thus, no further purification was required for these specimens. Each crystallin class exhibited an anisotropic cross-β-pattern characteristic of amyloid fibrils (39Sunde M. Serpell L.C. Bartlam M. Fraser P.E. Pepys M.B. Blake C.C. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1965607297,"Prefoldins (PFDs) are members of a recently identified, small–molecular weight protein family able to assemble into molecular chaperone complexes. Here we describe an unusually large member of this family, termed URI, that forms complexes with other small–molecular weight PFDs and with RPB5, a shared subunit of all three RNA polymerases. Functional analysis of the yeast and human orthologs of URI revealed that both are targets of nutrient signaling and participate in gene expression controlled by the TOR kinase. Thus, URI is a component of a signaling pathway that coordinates nutrient availability with gene expression."

These effects are mediated by the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R). Several lines of evidence suggest that the IGF system and IGF1R are relevant to the malignant transformation of cells. Overexpression of IGF1R causes ligand-dependent transformation of fibroblasts (1Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Embryonic fibroblasts obtained from IGF1R knockout mice cannot easily be transformed by simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40T) or activated ras (2Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). When these fibroblasts are then stably transfected with IGF1R, they can be transformed by SV40T, suggesting that a functional IGF1R is required for oncogenic transformation (3Sell C. Rubini M.

The IGF system has also been implicated in maintaining the malignant phenotype. Mice with low circulating levels of IGF-I have reduced incidence of colon tumor growth and metastasis of the colon adenocarcinoma to the liver (5Wu Y. Yakar S. Zhao L. Hennighausen L. LeRoith D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1030-1035PubMed Google Scholar). When IGF-I is expressed in mammary gland of mice, these animals have increased rates of developing breast cancer (6Hadsell D.L. Greenberg N.M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, the role of IGF1R in the metastatic process is not fully defined. IGF1R consists of two covalently linked polypeptide chains each with an extracellular α-subunit that binds ligand and a transmembrane β-subunit that contains tyrosine kinase activity. The IGF1R is transported to the membrane fully assembled in the dimeric form, and after ligand binding tyrosine kinase activity is initiated. Binding of ligand results in transphosphorylation of the β-subunit of one chain by the opposite β-subunit chain. This transphosphorylation is required for activation of the receptor and activation of downstream signaling pathways (26Tollefsen S.E. Stoszek R.M. Thompson K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, to study the role of the IGF1R in the metastasis of cancer cells we have overexpressed a C-terminal-truncated IGF1R that retains the ligand binding domain but lacks the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminus. When the protein is assembled with either wild-type or truncated receptor construct such a receptor can bind ligand but not be transphosphorylated. It has been shown that a truncated IGF1R when expressed in rat fibroblasts causes inhibition of tumorigenesis (27Prager D. Li H.L. Asa S. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2181-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Dunn et al. (20Dunn S.E. Ehrlich M. Sharp N.J. Reiss K. Solomon G. Hawkins R. Baserga R. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3353-3361PubMed Google Scholar) have used the extracellular ligand binding domain of IGF1R as a soluble receptor to neutralize circulating IGFs. This soluble receptor has been reported to behave in a dominant negative manner (28D'Ambrosio C. Ferber A. Resnicoff M. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4013-4020PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibited the adhesion, motility, and metastasis of MDA-MB-435 cells (20Dunn S.E. Ehrlich M. Sharp N.J. Reiss K. Solomon G. Hawkins R. Baserga R. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3353-3361PubMed Google Scholar). In this approach it was possible that these effects were due to inhibition of circulating IGF effects on either host or tumor tissue. To directly study the effect of inhibiting IGF1R in the cancer cells and its impact on metastasis we used the MDA 435A/LCC6 cells (LCC6-WT) (29Leonessa F. Green D. Licht T. Wright A. Wingate-Legette K. Lippman J. Gottesman M.M. Clarke R. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which are a metastatic variant of the estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-435 cells (30Cailleau R. Olive M. Cruciger Q.V. In Vitro (Rockville). 1978; 14: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) derived from a patient with breast cancer. Recent reports suggest that the MDA-MB-435 cells have a gene expression pattern consistent with malignant melanomas (31Ross D.T. Scherf U. Eisen M.B. Perou C.M. Rees C. Spellman P. Iyer V. Jeffrey S.S. Van de Rijn M. Waltham M. Pergamenschikov A. Lee J.C. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Myers T.G. Weinstein J.N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 32Ellison G. Klinowska T. Westwood R.F. Docter E. French T. Fox J.C. Mol. Pathol. 2002; 55: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the LCC6-WT cells exhibit enhanced motility in response to IGF compared with the parent MDA-MB-435 cells (33Jackson J.G. Zhang X. Yoneda T. Yee D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To examine the role of IGF1R in the metastasis of breast cancer cells we transfected the C-terminal-truncated IGF1R into the LCC6-WT cells. We found that LCC6 cells stably transfected with a truncated IGF1R (LCC6-DN) failed to activate IGF1R and downstream signaling pathways in response to IGF-I. LCC6-DN cells were unable to metastasize to the lungs in a xenograft model of tumor growth. These results suggest that IGF1R, in addition to its well known role in stimulating proliferation of breast cancer cells, plays an essential role in the metastasis of these cancer cells. Moreover, these metastatic events may be regulated independently of proliferative signals. Thus, targeting IGF1R function can affect the metastasis of cancer cells, and anti-IGF therapy may inhibit several characteristics of the malignant phenotype. Reagents—All reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma, and cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise noted. IGF-I was purchased from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from BD Biosciences (Lexington, KY). Antibodies against extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-1/2 (phospho-specific and total) and Akt (phosphospecific and total) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against IRS-1 was produced by Alpha Diagnostics (San Antonio, TX), and the immune serum was affinity-purified on immobilized protein A as described previously (34Sachdev D. Li S.L. Hartell J.S. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Miller J.S. Yee D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 627-635PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody against IRS-2 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The polyclonal antibody against the β-subunit of IGF1R (IGF1Rβ) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the polyclonal antibody against hemagglutinin A (HA) was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from Amersham Biosciences. Protein A-agarose was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Acrylamide, bisacrylamide and prestained molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. Cell Lines and Culture—LCC6-WT cells were obtained from Dr. Robert Clarke at the Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington D. C. LCC6-WT and LCC6-DN cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 11.25 nm human insulin (Lilly), 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. To create the truncated receptor construct, a IGF1R cDNA truncated at codon 2929 and tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin A epitope was kindly provided by Dr. Mikhail L. Gishizky at Sugen Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The original construct was excised from a pLXSN vector by an EcoRI/BamHI resection and inserted into the pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) vector. This construct was transfected into LCC6 cells with Lipofectin (Invitrogen), and G418 resistant colonies were selected, expanded, and screened for expression of truncated IGF1R by ribonuclease (RNase) protection assay. LCC6 cells expressing the truncated IGF1R are referred to as LCC6-DN. RNase Protection Assay—RNA from cells was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (35Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.I. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). 10 μg of a plasmid encoding IGF1R was linearized and used as riboprobe in RNase protection assay. RNase protection assay was performed with a probe encompassing codons 2737-3195 as previously described (36Yee D. Lebovic G.S. Marcus R.R. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21439-21441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the levels of IGF1R mRNA, the autoradiograph was analyzed by densitometry using a video captured image and analysis software (AlphaEaseFC, AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). Cell Stimulation—LCC6-WT and LCC6-DN cells were grown in 10-cm dishes in regular growth media. 70% confluent cells were washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline and serum-deprived for 24 h in serum-free media (SFM) as described previously (37Jackson J.G. White M.F. Yee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For treatment with IGF-I, medium was replaced with SFM containing 5 nm IGF-I for 10 min. Cell Lysis—Cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice and lysed with 500 μl/10-cm dish lysis buffer TNESV (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, and soluble cellular proteins were used for experiments or stored at -20 °C. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, 40 μg of cellular proteins were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels following the Laemmli system (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Membranes were then washed 5 times with TBST for 5 min each. Expression of truncated IGF1R in LCC6-DN cells was assayed by blotting with a 1:500 dilution of HA antibody for 1 h at room temperature. To detect levels of IGF1R, membranes were blotted with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody against IGF1Rβ. Membranes were washed five times with TBST for 5 min each and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed as before, and chemiluminescence was done using SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce). For detecting phosphorylated proteins membranes were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of PY-20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed as before. Chemiluminescence was then performed as described above. Phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, phospho-p44/p42 ERK1/ERK2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and total ERK1/ERK2 antibodies were used as per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation—500 μg of total cellular proteins were first precleared with 25 μl of protein A-agarose for 30 min and then incubated overnight with 3 μl of polyclonal serum against IRS-1 or IRS-2. 25 μl of protein A-agarose was added for 4 h. All steps were done on a rocker at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times with 500 μl each of TNESV by resuspension and centrifugation. After the final wash immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of TNESV and 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 30 mg/ml dithiothreitol. Samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged, and supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. To determine whether the truncated receptor heterodimerizes with the full-length wild-type receptor, cellular proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11). 500 μg of lysate were precleared with 1 μg of normal mouse IgG and 25 μl of protein G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was then incubated overnight with 1 μg of the HA monoclonal antibody. 25 μl of protein G-agarose was added for 4 h, and immunoprecipitates were collected and washed as described above. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with an antibody generated against the C terminus of IGF1R, which only recognizes the full-length wild-type receptor. Proliferation Assays—Cells were plated in 24-well plates with 20,000 cells/well in regular growth medium. Cells were switched to SFM for 24 h and then treated as indicated in the figure legends. All treatments were done in triplicate. Growth was measured 4-5 days after treatment. Growth was assayed by the uptake of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described previously (39Twentyman P.R. Luscombe M. Br. J. Cancer. 1987; 56: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). 60 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT solution in phosphate-buffered saline was added to each well. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, wells were aspirated, and formazan crystals were lysed with 500 μl of solubilization solution (95% Me2SO + 5% Iscove's modified essential medium). Absorbance was measured with a plate reader at 570 nm using a 670-nm differential filter. Proliferation assays were repeated 3 times. Anchorage-independent Growth—Anchorage-independent growth assays were performed as described (40Figueroa J.A. Sharma J. Jackson J.G. McDermott M.J. Hilsenbeck S.G. Yee D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 1 × 104 cells per well of a 6-well plate were used. 1 ml of 0.8% SeaPlaque-agarose (BioWhittaker, Rockland, ME) in culture medium was solidified in the bottom of each well as the bottom agar. Cells in growth media with 5% serum without or with 5 nm IGF-I were mixed with 0.45% agarose. The cells mixed with agarose were overlaid on the bottom agar. After 9-10 days colonies were counted using a microscope with a grid in the eyepiece. Three randomly selected fields were counted for each well, and the average number of colonies is shown. Results shown are representative of one experiment with triplicates for each treatment. Motility Assay—Motility was assayed by a modified Boyden chamber assay using 10-well chambers (NeuroProbe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with 12 μm pores as described previously (33Jackson J.G. Zhang X. Yoneda T. Yee D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 0.4 ml of SFM with or without 5 nm IGF-I was placed in the lower wells of the chamber. A polycarbonate polyvinylpyrrolidine-free filter was placed above the lower wells. Cells were quickly trypsinized and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were suspended in SFM, and 1.5 × 105 cells in 0.3 ml of SFM were placed in each of the upper wells of the chamber above the membrane. Cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells still remaining on the upper side of the membrane were removed with a cotton-tipped applicator. The membrane was removed, and cells that had migrated to the lower side of the membrane were fixed and stained with HEMA3 (Fisher). The membrane was then mounted on a glass slide, and cells were counted in 10 random areas using a microscope. The assay was repeated 3 independent times. Tumor Growth in Athymic Mice—4-Week-old female athymic mice were used for xenograft tumor growth. 5 × 106 LCC6-WT or LCC6-DN cells in serum-free Iscove's modified essential medium were injected into the mammary fat pad on one side of each mouse. Five mice were injected with LCC6-WT, and five were injected with LCC6-DN cells. Tumor growth was measured weekly and is shown as average tumor volume for each cell line with a n = 5. Tumor growth experiments were repeated three times. At the end of the experiment mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tumor samples were homogenized in a tissue pulverizer in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Tissue homogenates were suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer, TNESV. Analysis of Tumor Metastasis—All mice injected with each cell line were sacrificed at days 21-24, and the whole animal was fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin and analyzed for metastasis by gross and microscopic examination. Lungs fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formalin were examined macroscopically for metastases. Fixed lungs were also embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined microscopically for metastatic deposits. Slides prepared from the lungs included a complete longitudinal section from the left lobe and several transverse sections through the right lobe. To confirm the presence of metastases primary xenograft tumors were resected from 2 mice in each group at day 21 after injecting cells, and mice were allowed to recover. At day 54, of the 10 mice in the experiment, 2 mice injected with LCC6-WT and 2 with LCC6-DN cells, whose tumors had been resected at day 21, were sacrificed and dissected. The whole animal was fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formalin. All organs were examined for metastasis by gross and microscopic examination. Expression of C-terminal-truncated IGF1R in LCC6 Cells—LCC6 cells were stably transfected with the construct for truncated IGF1R. Expression of the truncated IGF1R was measured by RNase protection assay (Fig. 1). The probe covers the full-length wild-type transcript (458 bp) and also extends over a natural splice site that leads to the alternately spliced transcript of 366 bp (36Yee D. Lebovic G.S. Marcus R.R. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21439-21441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated IGF1R protected a fragment of 262 bp. RNA from MCF-7 cells was used as control, and the full-length wild-type 458-bp protected fragment and the alternately spliced wild-type variant fragment of 366 bp were detected (lane 2). Similarly, the LCC6-WT cells also expressed the full-length wild-type 458 bp and alternately wild-type spliced 366-bp fragments as shown in lane 3. Neither MCF-7 nor LCC6-WT expressed the message for the truncated receptor. Individual LCC6-DN clones expressed the message for the wild-type full-length and alternately spliced fragments as shown in lanes 4-8. In addition, several clones overexpressed the message for the truncated receptor (262 bp protected fragment in lanes 4-8). Several clones expressing the message for the truncated receptor were selected for further study. While there was some minor variation in IGF1R mRNA levels in the individual clones (Fig. 1), immunoblotting revealed levels of receptor protein equivalent to the wild-type cell line (data not shown). Densitometric analysis of the truncated receptor mRNA expressed by individual clones revealed a more than 5-fold increase in levels of the truncated mRNA compared with wild-type mRNA. All of the clones behaved in a similar manner to inhibit activation of endogenous IGF1R (see Fig. 3B). In addition to the similarity in the biochemical response to IGF-I among the individually selected clones, we also found that multiple clones behaved in a similar fashion in monolayer growth assays and cell motility studies (data not shown). Thus, a single clone was selected for further characterization.Fig. 3C-terminally truncated IGF1R inhibited activation of endogenous IGF1R. 70% confluent cells were switched to serum-free medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 24 h later cells were treated with 5 nm IGF-I for 10 min, and cell lysates were examined by immunoblot (IB). A, anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) immunoblot. LCC6-WT cells (lanes 1 and 2) and LCC6-DN cells (lanes 3 and 4) were either untreated (lanes 1 and 3) or treated with 5 nm IGF-I (lanes 2 and 4). As controls lanes 5 and 6 show MCF-7 cells in which IGF-I treatment results in phosphorylation of IRS-1 (lane 6 versus 5). B, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot on several independent clones overexpressing truncated IGF1R to show that all clones overexpressing truncated IGF1R inhibit activation of endogenous IGF1R after treatment with IGF-I (lanes labeled +). C, immunoprecipitation with IRS-1 followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. D, immunoprecipitation (IP) with IRS-2 followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In panels C and D lanes 1 and 2 show LCC6-WT, and lanes 3 and 4 are LCC6-DN cells. Lanes 5 and 6 are control cells (MCF-7 in panel C and MDA-231BO in panel D), which we have used as positive controls for immunoprecipitations. Lanes 1, 3, and 5 show untreated cells and lanes 2, 4, and 6 show cells treated with IGF-I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study we used clone number 6 (Fig. 1, lane 5) and referred to as LCC6-DN cell line. The levels of the truncated protein were assayed by HA immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 2A. In the first lane, LCC6-WT cells did not express the truncated HA-tagged IGF1R, whereas in Fig. 2A, second lane, LCC6-DN cells expressed the HA-tagged truncated IGF1R at 50 kDa. Some of the higher molecular weight unprocessed receptors were also detected in Fig. 2A, second lane.

https://openalex.org/W2030333997,"A low-viscosity drop breaking apart inside a viscous fluid is encountered when air bubbles, entrained in thick syrup or honey, rise and break apart. Experiments, simulations, and theory show that the breakup under conditions in which the interior viscosity can be neglected produces an exceptional form of singularity. In contrast to previous studies of drop breakup, universality is violated so that the final shape at breakup retains an imprint of the initial and boundary conditions. A finite interior viscosity, no matter how small, cuts off this form of singularity and produces an unexpectedly long and slender thread. If exterior viscosity is large enough, however, the cutoff does not occur because the minimum drop radius reaches subatomic dimensions first."
https://openalex.org/W2012565349,"Several indices of large-scale patterns of surface temperature variation were used to investigate climate change in North America over the 20th century. The observed variability of these indices was simulated well by a number of climate models. Comparison of index trends in observations and model simulations shows that North American temperature changes from 1950 to 1999 were unlikely to be due to natural climate variation alone. Observed trends over this period are consistent with simulations that include anthropogenic forcing from increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. However, most of the observed warming from 1900 to 1949 was likely due to natural climate variation."
https://openalex.org/W2167908593,"C75, a synthetic inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (FAS), is hypothesized to alter the metabolism of neurons in the hypothalamus that regulate feeding behavior to contribute to the decreased food intake and profound weight loss seen with C75 treatment. In the present study, we characterize the suitability of primary cultures of cortical neurons for studies designed to investigate the consequences of C75 treatment and the alteration of fatty acid metabolism in neurons. We demonstrate that in primary cortical neurons, C75 inhibits FAS activity and stimulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), consistent with its effects in peripheral tissues. C75 alters neuronal ATP levels and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Neuronal ATP levels are affected in a biphasic manner with C75 treatment, decreasing initially, followed by a prolonged increase above control levels. Cerulenin, a FAS inhibitor, causes a similar biphasic change in ATP levels, although levels do not exceed control. C75 and cerulenin modulate AMPK phosphorylation and activity. TOFA, an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, increases ATP levels, but does not affect AMPK activity. Several downstream pathways are affected by C75 treatment, including glucose metabolism and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that C75 modulates the levels of energy intermediates, thus, affecting the energy sensor AMPK.

Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Google Scholar). The central nervous system (CNS) plays a critical role in the regulation of energy balance by coordinating peripheral and central signals to assess energy status and regulate feeding behavior (4Schwartz M.

FAS is a lipogenic enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to generate long-chain fatty acids (15Wakil S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Google Scholar). In the fed state, long-chain fatty acids are synthesized and stored as triglycerides, which are broken down for energy during periods of energy deficiency. C75 interferes with the binding of malonyl-CoA to the β-ketoacyl synthase domain of FAS, thus inhibiting long-chain fatty acid elongation (16Kuhajda F.P. Jenner K. Wood F.D. Hennigar R.A. Jacobs L.B.

Huang W.Y. al-Feel W. Hsu M. Abu-Elheiga L. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8695-8699Google Scholar), FAS was only recently described in brain (19Kusakabe T. Maeda M. Hoshi N. Sugino T. Watanabe K. Kukuda T. Suzuki T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 613-622Google Scholar, 9Kim E.K. Miller I. Landree L.E. Borisy-Rudin F.F. Brown P. Tihan T. Townsend C.A. Witters L.A. Moran T.H. Kuhajda F.P. Ronnett G.V. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E867-E879Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that FAS, and other enzymes required for long-chain fatty acid synthesis, are highly expressed in neurons in many brain regions, including hypothalamic neurons that regulate feeding behavior (9Kim E.K. Miller I. Landree L.E. Borisy-Rudin F.F. Brown P. Tihan T. Townsend C.A. Witters L.A. Moran T.H. Kuhajda F.P. Ronnett G.V. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E867-E879Google Scholar), thus positioning FAS to play a role in neuronal energy metabolism. In addition to inhibiting FAS (11Kuhajda F.P. Pizer E.S. Li J.N. Mani N.S. Frehywot G.L. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3450-3454Google Scholar), C75 stimulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activity in cultured adipocytes and hepatocyes by preventing malonyl-CoA-mediated inhibition of CPT-1 (10Thupari J.N. Landree L.E. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9498-9502Google Scholar). CPT-1 catalyzes the esterification of long-chain acyl-CoAs to l-carnitine for transport into the mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation (20McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar). When energy reserves and fatty acid synthesis are high, elevated levels of malonyl-CoA, the endogenous inhibitor of CPT-1, prevent the oxidation of newly formed fatty acids (20McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar, 21Eaton S. Bartlett K. Quant P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 537-539Google Scholar). Conversely, during starvation, when energy levels are low, malonyl-CoA levels fall, releasing the inhibition on CPT-1, allowing fatty acids to enter the mitochondria where they are broken down for energy. While C75 can affect FAS and CPT-1 activities in peripheral tissues, its effects on neurons are unknown. The effects of C75 on FAS and CPT-1 activities could alter energy flux through metabolic pathways in neurons. One important sensor of cellular energy balance is mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a heterotrimeric protein kinase present in most mammalian tissues, composed of a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ) (22Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Google Scholar, 23Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Google Scholar). AMPK is most commonly activated by metabolic stresses that deplete cellular ATP and lead to an elevation of the AMP/ATP ratio (22Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Google Scholar, 23Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Google Scholar), such as heat shock, exercise, ischemia/hypoxia, low glucose, and metabolic or excitotoxic insults in neurons (24Culmsee C. Monnig J. Kemp B.E. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 45-58Google Scholar). The regulation of AMPK activity is complex, and once activated, AMPK modulates many aspects of metabolism. Acutely, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates certain enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways, such as HMG-CoA reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby preventing further ATP utilization (22Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Google Scholar, 25Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Google Scholar). Additionally, AMPK stimulates catabolic processes by activating glucose uptake, glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation in an attempt to restore cellular ATP levels (27Abbud W. Habinowski S. Zhang J.Z. Kendrew J. Elkairi F.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 347-352Google Scholar, 28Kurth-Kraczek E.J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Winder W.W.

AMPK has chronic effects on these pathways via alterations in gene expression (for review see Ref. 25Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Google Scholar). Although AMPK has been shown to be expressed the brain (24Culmsee C. Monnig J. Kemp B.E. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 45-58Google Scholar, 31Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1707-1716Google Scholar), its function in neurons is unknown. We have chosen AMPK as a candidate neuronal metabolic sensor that may be affected by C75 based on its well established roles in energy sensing and the control of fatty acid metabolism in the periphery. In this study, we explored the role of FAS, CPT-1, and AMPK in neuronal energy metabolism. We utilized primary cortical neuronal cultures as a model system after demonstrating high levels of expression and activity of these key proteins, consistent with their in vivo expression patterns (9Kim E.K. Miller I. Landree L.E. Borisy-Rudin F.F. Brown P. Tihan T. Townsend C.A. Witters L.A. Moran T.H. Kuhajda F.P. Ronnett G.V. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

The effects of C75 on ATP levels and AMPK activity were then investigated, and the consequences of altered AMPK activity to energy production were determined. The work presented here demonstrates that C75, through both direct and indirect actions, alters neuronal energy metabolism in a biphasic fashion. These alterations are functionally important and suggest a role for AMPK in neuronal energy perception. Primary Cortical Neuronal Cultures—All experimental protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and all applicable guidelines from the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed. Cortices were removed from E17 Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), and were dissociated by mild trypsinization and trituration as described (33Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Bartley D. Uhl G. Snyder S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2651-2661Google Scholar). Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine coated plastic Nunclon culture dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2 in Minimum Essential Media (MEM) supplemented with horse serum, fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and the antibiotics gentamycin and kanamycin. Cells were plated onto vessels as required for each type of experiment: T-25 flasks for oxidation assays; 6-well plates for Western blots, SAMS peptide assays, and HPLC analysis; 24 well plates for FAS and CPT-1 activity assays; 4 well chamber slides for immunocytochemistry; and 96 well plates for the determination of ATP levels and cell viability assays. For standard cultures cells were treated with cytosine arabinoside on day 4, and were assayed after 7-10 days in vitro. For cultures overgrown with glia, cells were not treated with cytosine arabinoside and were used for immunocytochemistry on day 6. Drug treatments were performed with vehicle or C75 (obtained from and characterized by Craig Townsend and Jill McFadden, the Department of Chemistry at the Johns Hopkins University, and from FASgen, Inc.), resuspended in RPMI; cerulenin (Sigma) resuspended in RPMI; and 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2 Furoic Acid (TOFA) (Craig Townsend and Jill McFadden) resuspended in 100% Me2SO. Immunocytochemistry—Cortical neurons were grown as described and harvested 7 days after plating for immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA and 20% sucrose for 20 min at 4 °C, and permeated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. As these cultures normally contain less than 1% glial cells, cultures were also prepared in which glia were allowed to overgrow, as described, to better evaluate the expression of FAS and AMPK in glia. Cells were incubated in blocking solution (PBS containing 4% normal serum) for 1 h at 4 °C. Primary antibodies against the following antigens were diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C: glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Chemicon International Temecula, CA) 1:1000; neuron-specific tubulin (NST) (Bacbo, Richmond VA) 1:1000; AMPKα (2Mokdad A.H.

Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC for NST and GFAP staining, or with rhodamine for FAS and AMPK staining. Measurement of Acetate Incorporation—Cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of vehicle or C75 for 15 min in conditioned media, and then labeled with 100 μm [3H]acetic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for an additional 1.75 h as previously described (34Pizer E.S. Wood F.D. Pasternack G.R. Kuhajda F.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 1996: 745-751Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, dried under N2 and counted using a liquid scintillation counter. Measurement of ATP—Neurons were lysed on ice using TE buffer (100 mm Tris and 4 mm EDTA) and removed from the plate. ATP levels were then measured in the linear range using the ATP Bioluminescence kit CLS II (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) by following the manufacturer's protocol, and results were read by a PerkinElmer Victor2 1420. Cell Viability Assay—Cortical neurons were treated for the indicated times with the indicated doses of drug, and viability was determined using the Live/Dead Viability/Cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The conversion of the cell permeant non-fluorescent calcein AM dye to the intensely fluorescent calcein dye is catalyzed by intracellular esterase activity in live cells and is measured by detecting the absorbance at 485 nm/535 nm using the PerkinElmer Victor2 1420. HPLC—Adenine nucleotide levels in primary cortical neuron lysates were determined by HPLC analysis as previously described (35Stocchi V. Cucchiarini L. Canestrari F. Piacentini M.P. Fornaini G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 181-190Google Scholar). Briefly, each well of a 6-well plate was washed with 2 ml of ice cold PBS, and lysed with 70 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m KOH and scraped. 140 μl of H20 were added to lysates and incubated on ice for 5 min, and the pH was then adjusted to 6.5 by addition of 1 m KH2PO4. Cell lysates were spun through Microcon YM-50 centrifugal filters and stored at -80 °C for subsequent HPLC analysis. The HPLC used was an Agilent 1100 LC with a variable wavelength detector. The analysis was done using Chemstation A.10.01 software. Measurement of Fatty Acid Oxidation—Fatty acid oxidation was measured as previously described (36Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Google Scholar). Briefly, primary cortical neurons adherent to the flask were treated in triplicate with C75 at the indicated doses for the indicated times in of HAM-F10 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 0.5 μCi/ml (20 nmol) of [1-14C]palmitic acid (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) resuspended in α-cyclodextran (10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris) and 2 μm carnitine was added for the last 30 min of each treatment. Flasks were fitted with serum stoppers and plastic center wells (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) containing glass microfiber filters (presoaked in 10 μl of 20% KOH). Following the incubation, 200 μl of 2.6 N HClO4 was injected into the flasks and the 14CO2 was trapped for 2 h at 37 °C. The filters were removed and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The contents of the flasks were then hydrolyzed with 200 μl of 4 n KOH and neutralized using H2SO4. The water soluble products were extracted using CHCl3/MeOH and H2O and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The total amount of fatty acid oxidation was obtained by addition of the 14CO2 and water soluble products and represented as percent of control or as a specific activity (nmol/h/mg). Measurement of Glucose Oxidation—Glucose oxidation assays were based on previously described work (37Rubi B. Antinozzi P.A. Herrero L. Ishihara H. Asins G. Serra D. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 219-226Google Scholar). Neurons adherent to the flask were treated in triplicate with C75 at the indicated doses for the indicated times in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH buffer: 135 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm NaHO3 and 10 mm HEPES) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm d-glucose. 0.5 μCi/ml [U-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added for the last 30 min of each treatment and flasks were fitted as described for fatty acid oxidation assays. Reactions were stopped with the injection of 7% perchloric acid into the flask, and then 400 μl of benzethonium hydroxide was injected into the center well. After 2 h at 37 °C, complete oxidation was quantified by measuring the amount of 14CO2 in the center well by liquid scintillation counting, and represented as percent of control or as a specific activity (pmol/h/mg). Measurement of CPT-1 Activity—CPT-1 activity was measured using digitonin permeabilization (38Sleboda J. Risan K.A. Spydevold O. Bremer J. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1999; 1436: 541-549Google Scholar). Drugs and vehicle controls were added as indicated for each experiment. After 2 h, the medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and incubated with 700 μl of assay medium consisting of: 50 mm imidazole, 70 mm KCl, 80 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm KCN, 1 mm ATP, 0.1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 70 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 0.25 μCi l-[methyl-14C]carnitine (Amersham Biosciences), 40 μg of digitonin, with or without 100 μm malonyl-CoA. After incubation for 6 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold 4 m perchloric acid. Cells were then harvested and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed with 500 μl of ice-cold 2 mm perchloric acid and centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 800 μl of dH2O and extracted with 400 μl of butyl alcohol. The butyl alcohol phase, representing the acylcarnitine derivative, was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed using an identical method and buffer as described for the AMPK activity assay. Samples were boiled and run on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were successively probed, stripped, and reprobed with the following antibodies: anti-pAMPKα, AMPKα (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and sheep anti-FAS (39Salles J. Sargueil F. Knoll-Gellida A. Witters L.A. Shy M. Jiang H. Cassagne C. Garbay B. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 101: 52-58Google Scholar). Samples for the ACC/pACC westerns were run on separate 5% polyacrylamide gels and probed with either anti-ACC or anti-phospho-Ser-79 ACC antibodies (40Habinowski S.A. Hirshman M. Sakamoto K. Kemp B.E. Gould S.J. Goodyear L.J. Witters L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 71-79Google Scholar). Measurement of AMP-activated Protein Kinase Activity—AMPK activity was determined by performing SAMS peptide assays as previously described (41Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Google Scholar). Neurons plated on 6-well culture dishes were lysed using 350 μl of per well of Triton X-100 lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm NaPPi, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. Three wells were pooled per condition, and AMPKα was immunoprecipitated in the presence anti-AMPKα (2Mokdad A.H. Bowman B.A. Ford E.S. Vinicor F. Marks J.S. Koplan J.P.

Immunoprecipitates were then washed and resuspended in 4× assay buffer and kinase activity was assessed by measurement (for 20 min at 30 °C) of the incorporation of 32P into the synthetic SAMS peptide substrate, HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR, (Princeton Biomolecules). Samples were spotted on P81 phosphocellulose paper, washed extensively, and quantitated by Cerenkov counting. Each sample was corrected for protein concentration and reported either as percent of control or as pmol/min/mg. Electrophysiology and Miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Current (mEPSC) Analysis—Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed from cortical cultures at 14-21 days in vitro. To isolate AMPA-mediated mEPSCs, neurons were continuously perfused with artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) at a flow rate of <1 ml/min. The composition of aCSF was as follows (in mm): 150 NaCl, 3.1 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.1 dl-APV, 0.005 strychnine, 0.1 picrotoxin, and 0.001 tetrodotoxin (TTX). The osmolarity of the aCSF was adjusted to 305-310, pH was 7.3-7.4. Intracellular saline consisted of (in mm): 135 CsMeSo4, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 4 Na-ATP, and 0.1 Na-GTP.

Cox17 is implicated in providing copper ions for formation of CuA and CuB sites in the oxidase complex. To address whether Cox17 is functional in shuttling copper ions to the mitochondrion, Cox17 was tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane by a fusion to the transmembrane domain of the inner membrane protein, Sco2. The copper-binding domain of Sco2 that projects into the inter-mitochondrial membrane space was replaced with Cox17. The Sco2/Cox17 fusion protein containing the mitochondrial import sequence and transmembrane segment of Sco2 is exclusively localized within the mitochondrion. The Sco2/Cox17 protein restores respiratory growth and normal cytochrome oxidase activity in cox17Δ cells. These studies suggest that the function of Cox17 is confined to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Domain mapping of yeast Cox17 reveals that the carboxyl-terminal segment of the protein has a function within the intermembrane space that is independent of copper ion binding. The essential C-terminal function of Cox17 maps to a candidate amphipathic helix that is important for mitochondrial uptake and retention of the Cox17 protein. This motif can be spatially separated from the N-terminal copper-binding functional motif. Possible roles of the C-terminal motif are discussed.

Copper plays an essential role in the biochemistry of all aerobic organisms (1Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 7975-8115Google Scholar). This metal functions as a cofactor permitting the facile transfer of electrons in key enzymes including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase for antioxidant defense, tyrosinase for melanin synthesis, and cytochrome c oxidase for electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. When copper homeostasis is perturbed, the reactivity of copper with dioxygen may also lead to toxicity (2Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19095-19098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 3Valentine J.S. Wertz D.L. Lyons T.J. Liou L.-L. Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For this reason, specific mechanisms have evolved for the compartmentalization and trafficking of copper within cells (4Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).The mechanism of copper ion routing to cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) 1The abbreviations used are: CcOcytochrome c oxidaseIMinner membraneOMouter membraneIMSintermembrane spaceSod1superoxide dismutaseWTwild-type.1The abbreviations used are: CcOcytochrome c oxidaseIMinner membraneOMouter membraneIMSintermembrane spaceSod1superoxide dismutaseWTwild-type. within the mitochondrion is unknown. Bovine CcO consists of 13 polypeptide subunits, three of which (Cox1–Cox3) are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, and the remaining subunits are encoded by the nuclear genome (5Capaldi R.A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The three mitochondrially encoded subunits form the catalytic core of the enzyme. Cox2 requires two copper ions in the binuclear CuA site, and Cox1 requires one copper ion in the CuB site (6Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). CcO is localized within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The inner membrane (IM) differs from the outer membrane (OM) in being highly convoluted and folding into tubular cristae. Three internal spaces are created by the double membrane structure. The volume enclosed within the inner membrane is the matrix, which represents about 80% of the total mitochondrial space (7Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Develop. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The space between the inner and outer membranes is called the intermembrane space (IMS) and is interrupted by junction points in which the IM and OM are in contact. The IMS is very narrow and is separated from the third space, intracristae space, by tubular cristal junctions (8Frey T.G. Mannella C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 9Mannella C.A. Pfeiffer D.R. Bradshaw P.C. Moraru I.I. Slepchenko B. Loew L.M. Hsieh C. Buttle K. Marko M. IUBMB Life. 2002; 52: 1-7Google Scholar). The bulk of the respiratory complexes, including CcO, exist within the cristae (10Perotti M.E. Anderson W.A. Swift H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1983; 31: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, assembly of functional CcO requires transport of nuclear-encoded subunits across both mitochondrial membranes. It is unclear whether the assembly of newly synthesized subunits occurs within the cristae or on the peripheral surface of the IM.In yeast, several metallochaperones have been identified that shuttle copper ions to sites of utilization (4Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Copper insertion into Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1) in yeast requires the function of the Lys7 (CCS) metallochaperone (11Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D.

Science. 1999; 284: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Like-wise, Ccc2, a P-type ATPase copper ion transporter, receives copper ions from the Atx1 metallochaperone (15Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V.O. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 16Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Based on the necessity of Lys7 and Atx1 for shuttling copper ions to sites of utilization, the prediction is that CcO would require a specific protein involved in copper shuttling to the mitochondrion.Cox17, a 8-kDa protein conserved in eukaryotes, has several characteristics consistent with a role in copper ion trafficking to the mitochondrion (17Amaravadi R. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Human Genetics. 1997; 99: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The initial observation implicating Cox17 in metallation of CcO was the demonstration that the respiratory defect of cells harboring a non-functional cox17–1 mutant was suppressed by the addition of near toxic levels of copper ions in the growth medium (18Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Two subsequent observations consistent with this postulate were the dual localization of Cox17 in both the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space compartments and the Cu(I) binding ability of Cox17 (19Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Three cysteinyl residues present in a Cys-Cys-Xaa-Cys sequence motif are critical for in vivo Cox17 function and Cu(I) ion binding (21Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Although these observations suggest that Cox17 plays an important role in copper ion trafficking, the direct role of Cox17 in copper delivery to the mitochondria is unresolved. Cox17 may deliver Cu(I) ions to a mitochondrial OM transporter in analogy to the Atx1 routing of Cu(I) ions to the Ccc2 trans-Golgi translocase. Alternatively, Cox17 may ferry Cu(I) ions directly across the semi-porous mitochondrial OM. If the former is the case, Cox17 may have a secondary function within the IMS. If, however, Cox17 translocates the OM for Cu(I) delivery, we predict that Cox17 must contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence directing import. Proteins imported across the OM are typically synthesized as a precursor protein with an N-terminal import sequence directing import. Such proteins are taken up as unfolded proteins through the TOM complex (22Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6497-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Classical mitochondrial import sequences are enriched in cationic residues and appear to adopt an amphipathic helix (24Roise D. Theiler F. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Allison D.S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The lack of a classical mitochondrial import sequence in Cox17 does not preclude translocation across the mitochondrial OM, because a number of proteins including cytochrome c and heme lyase are imported through the TOM complex via non-cleaved internal sequence motifs (25Diekert K. Kispal G. Guiard B. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11752-11757Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Additional proteins implicated in copper ion insertion into CcO include Sco1 and Cox11 in yeast, although both of these proteins are membrane proteins localized within the IM (26Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Rentzsch N. Krummeck-WeiB G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr.

Sco1 and Cox11 are implicated in reactions of direct copper transfer to the CuA site in Cox2 and CuB site in Cox1, respectively. CuCox17 may deliver Cu(I) to both Sco1 and Cox11 for subsequent donation to the CuA and CuB sites, respectively. Yeast contains a second Sco1-like molecule, designated Sco2, that is unimportant in the CcO assembly pathway (28Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Molecular dissection of Cox17 reported here demonstrate that a C-terminal sequence motif is important for mitochondrial uptake and accumulation within the IMS. Furthermore, we show that Cox17 tethered in the IM by Sco2 is functional, suggesting that cycling of Cox17 between the cytosol and the IMS is not essential for function.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains—A cox17Δ strain (MAT a, ade2–1, his3–1,15, leu2,3,112, trp1–1, ura3–1, ΔCOX17::TRP1) kindly provided by Dr. A. Tzagoloff (18Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and its isogenic wild-type W303 strain (MAT a, ade2–1, his3–1,15, leu2,3,112, trp1–1, ura3–1) were used for all experiments. Yeast strains were cultured on plates or in liquid medium in either complete medium lacking uracil to ensure maintenance of plasmids or rich media (yeast extract and peptone) with glucose (YPD), glycerol (YPG), or galactose (YPGal) as carbon sources. Copper limiting complete medium contained 0.03 mm bathocuproine sulfonate (Sigma). DNA transformations were performed using a lithium acetate protocol.Vector Construction—All genes were cloned into a yeast low copy vector (YCpRS316) under the control of regulatable MET25 or GAL10 promoters, or under the control of the native COX17 promoter and terminated with either the CYC1 or COX17 terminator (32Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). All constructs used in CYC1 terminator except those used in Fig. 6. Maximum expression with the MET25 promoter occurs in medium lacking methionine, whereas minimal expression occurs in medium containing 0.67 mm methionine (5 × the normal Met level). Maximum expression with the GAL10 promoter occurs in medium containing 2% galactose, limited expression is observed in medium containing 3% glycerol, and minimal expression occurs in medium containing 2% glucose. Deletion mutants, termed Δ9 (lacking residues 1–8) and 59Δ (lacking residues 60–69) were generated by PCR and subcloned into pRS316 as BamHI/SalI fragments. To construct a heterologous IMS targeting sequence, the first 167 codons of the CYB2 gene were excised from vector pEB15 (33Beasley E.M. Muller S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as an EcoRI/BamHI fragment and subcloned in frame to various genes creating fusion proteins termed pCox17, pΔ9, pC57Y, and p59Δ. The IM-tethered Cox17 was constructed by amplifying the first 104 codons of SCO2 by PCR with flanking BamHI sites and inserting it in frame with COX17 or the Δ9 truncate. The resulting fusion protein consisted of the N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence and transmembrane domain of Sco2 fused to Cox17. The head-to-tail dimer of Cox17 was engineered by amplifying the C57Y mutant allele without its stop codon by PCR with flanking BamHI sites. This amplified C57Y variant allele was inserted at the 5′ end of a second mutant allele encoding a C23S/C24S double substitution. Three double mutant alleles encoding F50D/I51D, C57A/C58M, and Y61D/G62D alleles were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. All mutant genes were sequenced prior to transformation into the cox17Δ strain.Mitochondrial Isolation and Treatment—Mitochondria were isolated according to the method of Glick and Pons (34Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mitochondria protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (35Bradford N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar). Hypotonic lysis of mitochondria was performed by diluting intact mitochondria (150–250 μg) into 7 volumes of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 6.7, buffer yielding intact mitoplasts. Membrane-associated proteins were solubilized by treatment of the mitoplasts in unbuffered 0.1 m Na2CO3. Inner membrane proteins were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. Membranes were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min.Cytochrome c Oxidase Assays—Respiratory function was assayed by growth tests on synthetic complete selective plates (–Ura, complete medium) using the non-fermentable carbon source, 3% glycerol. CcO enzymatic activity in isolated mitochondria was quantified by monitoring the oxidation of 32 μm reduced bovine cytochrome c at 550 nm by mitochondrial samples (5 to 10 μg protein) in 40 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.7, 0.5% Tween 80.Westerns Analysis—Protein (10–50 μg) from the mitochondrial or post-mitochondrial (cytosolic) fraction was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel system and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membrane was subsequently probed with appropriate antibodies and proteins were visualized with ECL reagents (Pierce) following the addition of an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, secondary antibody. The antiserum against Cyb2 (soluble IMS mitochondrial protein) was kindly provided by Dr. Rosemary Stuart. Antisera to the mitochondrial OM porin (Por1) and cytosolic phosphoglycerol kinase (Pgk1) were obtained from Molecular Probes. Antiserum to the mitochondrial IM Sco1 and Cox17 were prepared as described previously (21Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To ensure equal loading of mitochondrial or post-mitochondrial protein into the gel wells, the membranes were stripped by 3 washes in stripping buffer (25 mm glycine, pH 2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20) and reprobed with either an anti-Por1 or an anti-Pgk1 antibody.Purification and Analysis of Cox17—Cox17 was expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (20Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To evaluate the quaternary structure of Cox17, analytical gel filtration was performed using a 10/30 G-75 Superdex size exclusion column equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Data were recorded using Unicorn software. Protein luminescence was monitored on a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer and analyzed using PerkinElmer Life Sciences FL1 software. Protein was quantified by amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 analyzer after hydrolysis in 5.7 n HCl containing 0.1% phenol in vacuo at 110 °C. The copper concentration of the protein samples was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Analyst 100 spectrophotometer.RESULTSThe Cox17 polypeptide sequence is conserved in eukaryotes except for the chain termini (Fig. 1). If one of these segments is important for mitochondrial import and not for other functions of the protein, sequence diversity may exist, because mitochondrial targeting sequences do not show high sequence conservation. Amino- and carboxyl-truncation mutations were constructed to test for mitochondrial targeting. The N-terminal truncate lacked the N-terminal nine residues of Cox17 (designated Δ9), whereas the C-terminal truncate lacked the C-terminal ten residues (designated 59Δ) (Fig. 1). The truncated mutants of COX17 under the control of the MET25 promoter were transformed into cox17Δ cells, and the transformants were tested for respiratory growth and cytochrome c oxidase activity. The Δ9 truncate restored wild-type growth on glycerol-containing medium and wild-type cytochrome c oxidase activity (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, the localization of Δ9 Cox17 in both the mitochondria and cytosolic fractions was similar to that of wild-type Cox17 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the N-terminal segment of Cox17 is not required for mitochondrial targeting.Fig. 1Sequence of yeast Cox17.

Glycerol growth was improved when the 59Δ truncate was overexpressed in medium lacking methionine (Fig. 2A). As expected from the glycerol growth results, CcO activity was minimal under low expression conditions (Fig. 2B). The 59Δ truncate was abundant within the cytosol, but accumulated to a lesser extent in the IMS compared with the WT Cox17 or the Δ9 truncate (Fig. 2C). Under conditions of overexpression the 59Δ truncate accumulates predominantly within the cytosol (data not shown). Consistent with the 59Δ truncate data, the non-functional C57Y mutant of Cox17 also fails to accumulate within the mitochondrial IMS (21Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).To test whether defective mitochondrial uptake of the 59Δ truncate was responsible for the slow growth on glycerol medium, DNA encoding the presequence of Cyb2 was fused to the 59Δ truncate. The presequence of Cyb2 is known to target heterologous molecules into the mitochondrial IMS (33Beasley E.M. Muller S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells with the Cyb2/59Δ Cox17 fusion showed no growth regardless of the expression levels and no oxidase activity (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cells harboring the Cyb2 presequence fused to the N terminus of full-length Cox17 and the Δ9 truncate had wild-type CcO activity (Fig. 3A). The addition of the Cyb2 presequence failed to increase quantities of 59Δ Cox17 in the IMS, even though the fusion of the Cyb2 presequence to WT Cox17 increased the IMS levels of Cox17 considerably (Fig. 3B). As expected, the addition of the Cyb2 presequence to the 59Δ Cox17 did significantly reduce the amount of Cox17 in the cytoplasm. Thus, the failure of the Cyb2/59Δ Cox17 fusion to accumulate within the IMS suggests that the C-terminal motif in Cox17 is important for IMS retention and/or stability.Fig. 3Complementation of cox17Δ cells by plasmid-borne COX17 and truncate mutants encoding the Δ9 or 59Δ proteins fused to the Cyb2 IMS targeting sequence.

The unprocessed fusion protein is predicted to have a mass of 27 kDa, whereas the IMS processed protein is predicted to be 18 kDa. The observed mass of the Cyb2/Cox17 fusion (pWT) is 18 kDa, consistent with mitochondrial processing. Pgk1 is used as a cytosolic marker and Cyb2 as a mitochondrial IMS marker. Wild-type W303 cells are included for comparison. In lane marked * the protein sample was from a cyb2Δ strain as a control to confirm the Cyb2 western band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stability of the CuCox17 protein may be impaired if the C-terminal truncation compromised Cu(I) binding. The 59Δ truncate was expressed in E. coli and purified to evaluate its copper binding properties. The truncate bound Cu(I) normally and exhibited near wild-type Cu(I) luminescence (Fig. 4, inset). The luminescence of CuCox17 arises from the binding of Cu(I) ions within a polycopper cluster (20Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our previous mutational studies suggested that Cox17 function was dependent on the tetrameric structure (20Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cox17 is predicted to exist as a tetrameric molecule within the IMS based on the established equilibrium constant of dimeric verses tetrameric states of wild-type Cox17 and the quantitation of Cox17 levels within the IMS (20Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type Cox17, the truncate showed an abnormal quaternary structure (Fig. 4). The isolated 59Δ truncate was predominantly monomeric. We demonstrated previously that Cox17 mutants that failed to oligomerize to the tetrameric state were inactive (20Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, not all C-terminal mutants are compromised in oligomerization. The C57Y mutant protein forms predominantly tetrameric species and binds Cu(I) normally (data not shown). Thus, lack of retention within the IMS in C-terminal Cox17 mutants is not primarily due to defective oligomerization or reduced Cu(I) binding. These data are consistent with the C-terminal segment of Cox17 having a role in mitochondrial retention and/or stability.Fig. 4The oligomerization distribution of purified WT Cox17 and the 59Δ truncate (equivalent to 10 μg copper) chromatographed on gel filtration is shown. The elution positions of monomers (M), dimers (D), and tetramers (T) are shown. These different oligomeric states were substantiated previously by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation (20Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochem. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The inset shows the luminescence of equivalent protein samples. The flat line is the buffer blank. Each sample contained 4 μg Cu(I) per ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the Cu(I) binding motif and the C-terminal retention motif can function independently, we constructed a head-to-tail dimer of Cox17 such that each half was compromised for one of these functions (Fig. 5A). Previously, we demonstrated that Cu(I) binding was confined to the C23CXC26 sequence motif near the central segment of the molecule. A C23S/C24S double substitution abolishes Cu(I) binding, but the mutant protein is taken into the mitochondrion normally (21Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol.

DNA encoding the non-functional C57Y allele was fused to the 5′ end of a mutant COX17 encoding the C23S/C24S double substitution that fails to bind Cu(I). The resulting head-to-tail fusion protein consisted of a N-terminal half containing a functional Cu(I) binding motif and the C-terminal half containing a functional C-terminal retention motif. Transformants of the chimeric gene, under the control of the MET25 promoter in cox17Δ cells, were cultured under low expression conditions were tested for respiratory growth on glycerol-containing medium (Fig. 5B). Whereas neither the mutant C57Y allele nor the mutant C23S/C24S allele was able to support glycerol growth, cells containing the fusion gene were competent for glycerol growth (Fig. 5B). The C57Y mutant is non-functional even if the Cyb2 presequence is fused to its N terminus to direct mitochondrial uptake (Fig. 5B, pC57Y on right). The head-to-tail chimeric protein restores CcO activity to ∼50% of WT levels (Fig. 5C). Western analysis revealed that the fusion protein was stable within the"
https://openalex.org/W1976039401,"The association of a supernova with GRB030329 strongly supports the 'collapsar' model of gamma-ray bursts, where a relativistic jet forms after the progenitor star collapses. Such jets cannot be spatially resolved because gamma-ray bursts lie at cosmological distances; their existence is instead inferred from 'breaks' in the light curves of the afterglows, and from the theoretical desire to reduce the estimated total energy of the burst by proposing that most of it comes out in narrow beams. Temporal evolution of the polarization of the afterglows may provide independent evidence for the jet structure of the relativistic outflow. Small-level polarization ( approximately 1-3 per cent) has been reported for a few bursts, but its temporal evolution has yet to be established. Here we report polarimetric observations of the afterglow of GRB030329. We establish the polarization light curve, detect sustained polarization at the per cent level, and find significant variability. The data imply that the afterglow magnetic field has a small coherence length and is mostly random, probably generated by turbulence, in contrast with the picture arising from the high polarization detected in the prompt gamma-rays from GRB021206 (ref. 18)."

https://openalex.org/W2026786156,"Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that has adapted uniquely to life in mammalian hosts. One of the host factors recognized by this yeast is hemoglobin, which binds to a specific cell surface receptor. In addition to its regulating the expression of adhesion receptors on the yeast, we have found that hemoglobin induces the expression of a C. albicans heme oxygenase (CaHmx1p). Hemoglobin transcriptionally induces the CaHMX1 gene independent of the presence of inorganic iron in the medium. A Renilla luciferase reporter driven by the CaHMX1 promoter demonstrated rapid activation of transcription by hemoglobin and (cobalt protoporphyrin IX) globin but not by apoglobin or other proteins. In contrast, iron deficiency or exogenous hemin did not activate the reporter until after 3 h, suggesting that induction of the promoter by hemoglobin is mediated by receptor signaling rather than heme or iron flux into the cell. As observed following disruption of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog, HMX1, a CaHMX1 null mutant was unable to grow under iron restriction. This suggests a role for CaHmx1p in inorganic iron acquisition. CaHMX1 encodes a functional heme oxygenase. Exogenous heme or hemoglobin is exclusively metabolized to α-biliverdin. CaHMX1 is required for utilization of these exogenous substrates, indicating that C. albicans heme oxygenase confers a nutritional advantage for growth in mammalian hosts.

CaHMX1 is required for utilization of these exogenous substrates, indicating that C. albicans heme oxygenase confers a nutritional advantage for growth in mammalian hosts. Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that has adapted uniquely to its niche in the human host (1Odds F.C. Candida and Candidosis. 2nd Ed. Bailliere Tindall, London1988Google Scholar). It is a commensal organism in the normal gastrointestinal flora but becomes pathogenic following immunosuppressive chemotherapies for cancer, organ transplantation, and in AIDS patients (2Groll A.H. Walsh T.J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2001; 7: 8-24Google Scholar). The switch from commensal colonization to invasive infection requires the exchange of specific signals between the pathogen and its host to allow survival and growth and to promote invasion of specific host tissues (1Odds F.C. Candida and Candidosis. 2nd Ed. Bailliere Tindall, London1988Google Scholar). We have identified hemoglobin (Hb) as one such host signal, based on the observation that Hb is a specific inducer of a high affinity fibronectin receptor (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar, 4Yan S. Negre E. Cashel J.A. Guo N. Lyman C.A. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2930-2935Google Scholar). This induction was specific for Hb in that other host proteins or ferroproteins were inactive. Intact Hb was required for this activity because globin or hemin did not induce the fibronectin receptor (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar). However, substitution of CoPPIX 1The abbreviations used are: CoPPIXcobalt protoporphyrin IXESTexpressed sequence tagFASferrous ammonium sulfateORFopen reading frameYNByeast nitrogen baseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographycontiggroup of overlapping clones. for the heme in globin restored activity, but coordination of CO, CN, and O2 as heme-axial ligands did not affect the activity of Hb (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar). Hb bound saturably to the surface of Candida cells, which could be quantitatively inhibited by the Hb-binding protein haptoglobin (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar). Signaling through the Hb receptor was independent of cellular iron status, because the fibronectin receptor was induced under conditions of iron sufficiency and preceded any detectable uptake of radioactive iron from Hb (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that, although heme iron can be utilized by the fungus after prolonged culture (5Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S. Dancis A. Camadro J.-M. Lesuisse E. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 579-588Google Scholar), Hb signaling through the cell surface Hb receptor is rapid and independent of iron acquisition from the protein. cobalt protoporphyrin IX expressed sequence tag ferrous ammonium sulfate open reading frame yeast nitrogen base high pressure liquid chromatography group of overlapping clones. Because sensing of Hb may help the cells to recognize specific host tissue compartments, we examined gene regulation by Hb to gain insight into which fungal cellular functions depend upon this signaling pathway. We used a differential display to identify genes specifically regulated by Hb but not by inorganic iron. This analysis identified a C. albicans heme oxygenase gene (CaHMX1) that was shown recently to be regulated by iron and necessary for the organism to survive with heme as the sole iron source (5Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S. Dancis A. Camadro J.-M. Lesuisse E. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 579-588Google Scholar). Mammalian heme oxygenases are essential for normal heme protein turnover in the body and are directly responsible for recycling of Hb iron from normal turnover of senescent red cells or release because of trauma (6Elbirt K.K. Bonkovsky H.L. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 438-447Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the α meso-edge of heme (Fig. 1). The reaction utilizes NADPH-reducing equivalents and a reductase to yield the open chain tetrapyrrole α-biliverdin, CO, and iron (7Abraham N.G. Lin J.H. Schwartzman M.L. Levere R.D. Shibahara S. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 543-558Google Scholar, 8Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Google Scholar, 9Schacter B.A. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 349-369Google Scholar). Both CO and α-biliverdin have cytoprotective activities (10Durante W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 373-382Google Scholar, 11Otterbein L.E. Soares M.P. Yamashita K. Bach F.H. Trends. Immunol. 2003; 24: 449-455Google Scholar). Heme oxygenases have also been identified in plants and several bacteria including Corynebacterium diphtheriae (HmuO) (12Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Google Scholar) and Neisseria meningitidis (HemO) (13Zhu W. Hunt D.J. Richardson A.R. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 439-447Google Scholar). Null mutants of bacterial heme oxygenase (12Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Google Scholar, 13Zhu W. Hunt D.J. Richardson A.R. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 439-447Google Scholar) as well as the CaHMX1 of C. albicans (5Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S. Dancis A. Camadro J.-M. Lesuisse E. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 579-588Google Scholar) have shown that a major role for microbial heme oxygenase is in the release of nutritional iron from heme and heme-protein complexes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae also expresses a protein containing the heme oxygenase protein signature (14Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5176-5186Google Scholar, 15Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Google Scholar), but direct enzymatic activity could not be demonstrated (16Auclair K. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 340-349Google Scholar). However, HMX1 is transcribed under conditions of iron deprivation, and its deletion leads to defects in iron accumulation and an increase in the intracellular heme pool (15Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate the transcriptional regulation of CaHMX1 by mammalian Hb and show that this activation is iron-independent. CaHMX1 activation occurs rapidly following exposure to Hb and is additive with activation by iron deficiency. We additionally show that the CaHMX1 gene encodes a functional heme oxygenase enzyme and that the product of the reaction is α-biliverdin. Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—Cell culture was conducted in a defined medium, yeast nitrogen base (YNB) with appropriate amino acid supplements (17Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 191: 1-21Google Scholar). Iron-sufficient and -deficient media were supplied with or without 1.2 μm FeCl3, respectively (Q-Biogene, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 30 °C by shaking at 250 rpm with appropriate additions as required. Bovine methemoglobin, FAS, ferrozine, fetuin, holotransferrin, apotransferrin, and casein were obtained from Sigma. Preparation and isolation of human Hb, CoPPIX-globin, and human apoglobin were described previously (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar). Hemin and biliverdin standards were obtained from Frontier Scientific Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT). Biliverdin was quantified in acidic MeOH at 377 nm using ϵ = 66.2 mm–1 cm–1 (18Saito S. Itano H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1393-1397Google Scholar). Hemin and Hb quantification have been described previously (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar). C. albicans strain YJB6284 (19Bensen E.S. Filler S.G. Berman J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 787-798Google Scholar) is a prototrophic version of BWP17 and is designated as the parental strain in this study. Both alleles of CaHMX1 were sequentially disrupted using the method of Wilson et al. (20Wilson R.B. Davis D. Mitchell A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1868-1874Google Scholar) in C. albicans strain BWP17. Arg-4 and His-1 mutagenic cassettes were constructed using the following primer sets to direct recombination to the CaHMX1 coding region: 5′-GGCTAATAGAATAAATCTTGAAACCAGATCTTTGCACGATAGAGCAGACAAGACAGTTAGTT TTCCCAGTCACGACGTT-3′ and 5′-GTGACAAACCATCTCTTTGTGGGTACATACCAGTAGCTTTGAGGACCGACGATTGTGGAATTGTGACGCGATA-3′. C. albicans strain CAMP 49, containing disruptions of both CaHMX1 alleles, was rendered prototrophic by the insertion of plasmid pCaEXP in the RP10 locus to create CAMP 50 (21Care R.S. Trevethick J. Binley K.M. Sudbery P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 792-798Google Scholar). Strain CAMP Ki-29, containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the CaHMX1 promoter, was constructed using a 1.4-kb region of the CaHMX1 promoter region. This was accomplished by PCR using primers 5′-CTGCAGATTGTATGTGTA ATGATATATG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTAATACATCGATGGC-3′ and cloning into pCR-BluntII TOPO (Invitrogen). The inserted fragment was then excised with SstI and PstI and cloned into pCRW3 (22Srikantha T. Klapach A. Lorenz W.W. Tsai L.K. Laughlin L.A. Gorman J.A. Soll D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 121-129Google Scholar) using similar sites resulting in plasmid pPt14. This plasmid was linearized at the unique KpnI site in the CaHMX1 promoter (see Fig. 2D) to enable recombination into the CaHMX1 genomic site in the C. albicans strain Red 3/6 (22Srikantha T. Klapach A. Lorenz W.W. Tsai L.K. Laughlin L.A. Gorman J.A. Soll D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 121-129Google Scholar). Recombination resulted in the placement of the Renilla Lux gene immediately downstream of the genomic CaHMX1 promoter region. This knock-in procedure was necessary because the reporter plasmid pPt14 was not functional when integrated into the Ade2 locus when introduced as an episome (data not shown). The resulting strain, CAMP Ki-29, was used for all reporter assays in this study. The correct insertion sites of the preceding constructs in the genomes of strains CAMP 50 and CAMP Ki-29 were verified by Southern blotting. Luciferase Assays—Reporter assays used C. albicans cells that were grown at 30 °C in minimal YNB medium with ammonium sulfate and 2% glucose. 5 × 107 cells were harvested, cell extracts were obtained by glass bead lysis (22Srikantha T. Klapach A. Lorenz W.W. Tsai L.K. Laughlin L.A. Gorman J.A. Soll D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 121-129Google Scholar), and luminescence was determined using coelenterazine as a substrate (Promega). Luciferase activity is defined as the number of light units using 5 × 107 cells/assay point in 200 μl of lysis buffer using a 5-μl volume for light measurement. To assess regulation of the promoter by iron, the ferrous iron chelator ferrozine was added to cell cultures in the presence of FAS to buffer iron concentrations as described (23Philpott C.C. Rashford J. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Rouault T.A. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5026-5036Google Scholar) (also see Ref. 24Chaney R.L. J. Plant Nutr. 1988; 11: 1033-1050Google Scholar). FAS added to 1 mm ferrozine at 10, 100, and 400 μm represents low, optimal, and high levels of iron, respectively. The effect of proteins other than Hb on the induction of the CaHMX1 promoter were tested using Ki-29 cells cultured for 15 min in iron-replete media containing each of the following at 1 mg/ml: Hb, CoPPIX-globin, holotransferrin, apotransferrin, fetuin, casein, and apoglobin. Molecular Biology Techniques—Total yeast RNA was prepared using the hot acid phenol method (25Köhrer K. Domdey H. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Vol. 194. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 398-405Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were carried out by the lithium acetate technique (26Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Google Scholar). Northern and Southern analyses, DNA manipulations, and sequence analysis used standard methods (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Differentially expressed genes were identified by RNA arbitrarily primed PCR following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using RNA from C. albicans strain ATCC 44807 cells grown with or without 1 mg/ml Hb. Briefly, C. albicans cells were inoculated into YNB broth with or without 62 μm (expressed as iron equivalents) hemoglobin or ferrous sulfate and grown at 26 °C for 24 h. Under these growth conditions, no germination was found upon microscopic examination. For induction of the hyphal form of C. albicans, cells grown in YNB were resuspended into RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine in the absence of hemoglobin and incubated 2 h at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. A 2-h incubation converted nearly 100% of candidal cells to hyphae or pseudohyphae by microscopic examination. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the arbitrary primers 5′-AATCTAGAGCTCCTCCTC-3′, 5′-AATCTAGAGCTCTCCTGG-3′, 5′-AATCTAGAGCTCCAGCAG-3′, and 5′-CACACGCACACGGAAGAA-3′. Differentially expressed products were analyzed by standard procedures (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). A total of 33 ESTs that exhibited increased expression in Hb cultures, but not when supplemented with an equivalent molar concentration of iron, were cloned and sequenced. Seven were ESTs from carboxypeptidase Y, 13 were multiple hits of four genes, and the remainder were from discrete ORFs. Differential expression of the genes induced by Hb was confirmed by Northern hybridization using DNA from each EST clone as a radiolabeled probe. Heme Oxygenase Procedures—Coupled oxidation of human Hb to generate biliverdin α and β isomers followed the methods of O'Carra and Colleran (28O'Carra P. Colleran E. FEBS Lett. 1969; 5: 295-298Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 mg of human Hb was made to 5 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and incubated with 20 mg of sodium ascorbate for 2 h at 37 °C with vigorous agitation. The sample was extracted twice with equal volumes of anhydrous ethyl ether to remove unreacted heme. Biliverdin in the aqueous phase was extracted with CHCl3 and concentrated by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen at room temperature. The blue-green residue was dissolved in MeOH and made to 60% with aqueous 0.1 m ammonium acetate (v/v), pH 5.2, in preparation for HPLC analysis. Coupled oxidation of heme in pyridine was used to generate all four biliverdin isomers (α, β, γ, and δ) (29Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Google Scholar). Hemin (15 mg) dissolved in 50% pyridine was added to 5 volumes 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 10 mg of ascorbate and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The mixture was then acidified with HCl and glacial acetic acid, and the biliverdin isomers were extracted twice into CHCl3 and concentrated by evaporation under nitrogen. The compounds were further purified on a C-18 Sep-Pak column (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described below. Biliverdin was extracted from cell pellets by suspension in an equal volume of MeOH, vortexing for 30 s, and centrifuging for 10 min at 5000 × g at room temperature. The supernatant of this extraction was made to 60% with aqueous 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, and loaded onto a C-18 Sep-Pak column that had been sequentially preconditioned with 5 ml of MeOH, 5 ml of H2O, and 15 ml of Buffer A (60% 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, 40% MeOH v/v). The column was then washed with 5 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, 5 ml of Buffer A, and the green-blue material was eluted with 2 ml of 100% MeOH. An equal volume of CHCl3 was added, and the mixture was then evaporated under nitrogen. Cell supernatants were extracted by adding 0.6 volumes of concentrated ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, and then making the mixture 40% in MeOH. Biliverdin was isolated on a C-18 Sep-Pak as described above. Biliverdin and hemin were quantified using a C-18 Alltech absorbosphere column (Deerfield, IL) (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm of octadecyl-silica packing) controlled by a Peak Net chromatography work station (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The mobile phase consisted of Buffer A with a gradient to 100% MeOH from 2 to 18 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance was measured at 385 nm, and peaks were analyzed using Peak Net software. Identification of CaHMX1 and Its Regulation by Hemoglobin—Genes specifically induced by Hb but not by equivalent molar concentrations of inorganic iron were identified using random arbitrarily primed PCR (Fig. 2A). RNA isolated from cells cultured for 24 h at 24 °C in the presence or absence of Hb identified a total of 33 ESTs that exhibited increased expression in Hb cultures but not when supplemented with iron. One such EST (Fig. 2A, arrow), which was verified by Northern hybridization to be induced by Hb and not by iron or hyphal differentiation (Fig. 2B), overlapped the 3′-end of the CaHMX1 gene in the C. albicans genomic data base (Fig. 2D). CaHMX1 had been identified by Santos et al. (5Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S. Dancis A. Camadro J.-M. Lesuisse E. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 579-588Google Scholar) as an iron- and hemin-regulated gene that is essential for survival with hemin as the sole iron source. We therefore characterized CaHMX1 by measuring its steady state mRNA in the presence and absence of Hb under iron sufficiency to verify the results obtained through RNA arbitrarily primed PCR screening. C. albicans SC5314 cells (30Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Google Scholar) in early stationary phase growth were transferred to Hb-containing medium, and samples were harvested for RNA isolation at the indicated times (Fig. 2C). An increased mRNA level was evident as early as 30 min after Hb addition, and the level increased 10–15-fold at 3 h (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that accumulation of CaHMX1 mRNA is increased by hemoglobin under iron sufficiency. CaHMX1 Transcription Is Regulated by Hemoglobin as well as Iron Deficiency—Accumulation of CaHMX1 mRNA within 30 min following Hb addition suggested transcriptional regulation (Fig. 2C). To measure active transcription during the early stages of Hb exposure, we constructed a luciferase reporter driven by the CaHMX1 promoter. A 1.4-kb region upstream of the CaHMX1-predicted translational start site (Fig. 2D) was cloned in the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pCRW3 (22Srikantha T. Klapach A. Lorenz W.W. Tsai L.K. Laughlin L.A. Gorman J.A. Soll D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 121-129Google Scholar). This region contained four HAP1 consensus sites (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Google Scholar) as well as a single predicted iron-responsive element (32Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D, Fe RE). The plasmid was initially introduced into the C. albicans strain Red 3/6 (22Srikantha T. Klapach A. Lorenz W.W. Tsai L.K. Laughlin L.A. Gorman J.A. Soll D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 121-129Google Scholar) by recombination into the neutral Ade2 locus. However, expression from this construct could not be detected (data not shown). We therefore recombined the reporter plasmid into the genomic CaHMX1 to generate the knock-in strain CAMP Ki-29 (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this strain, the entire genomic region upstream of the CaHMX1 ATG could serve to supply promoter elements for the introduced Renilla luciferase (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Similar knock-ins have been used successfully in C. albicans (33Srikantha T. Morrow B. Schroppel K. Soll D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 342-352Google Scholar). Strain CAMP Ki-29 was first tested for responsiveness to Hb in iron-sufficient medium. Within 2.5 min following the addition of Hb, luciferase activity increased more than 10-fold over the non-induced control, and this level was sustained almost to the end of the test period (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that Hb binding to its cell surface receptor (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar) induces a signal that rapidly increases transcription to the CaHMX1 promoter under iron-replete conditions. To ensure that this induction is specific for Hb, we tested several control proteins for their ability to stimulate luciferase activity in strain Ki-29 (Table I). The cobalt analog of Hb, CoPPIX-globin, had equivalent activity to Hb, but apoglobin was inactive. Therefore, the iron in Hb is not essential for activity, but the native conformation of globin induced by porphyrin binding is required. These results are consistent with our previous report that CoPPIX-globin stimulated expression of a fibronectin receptor in C. albicans to the same extent as Hb, whereas globin was inactive (3Pendrak M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16110-16118Google Scholar). None of the other proteins tested significantly induced luciferase activity above the control, but the ferroprotein transferrin somewhat decreased the basal activity of the CaHMX1 promoter (Table I). These proteins also failed to induce the expression of the fibronectin receptor in C. albicans (4Yan S. Negre E. Cashel J.A. Guo N. Lyman C.A. Walsh T.J. Roberts D.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2930-2935Google Scholar).Table IEffects of heterologous proteins on the induction of the CaHMX1 promoter-luciferase fusionProteinLuciferase activityNone41.7 ± 13.5Hb144.7 ± 11CoPPIX-globin161.7 ± 24Apo-globin57.6 ± 2.1Holo-transferrin20.7 ± 0.55Apo-transferrin64.4 ± 11.8Fetuin59.3 ± 5.9Casein38.6 ± 8.1 Open table in a new tab Although the iron in Hb is not required to induce CaHMX1 transcription, steady state CaHMX1 mRNA was shown previously to be increased by iron deficiency and by hemin at 5 h post-transfer to new medium (5Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S. Dancis A. Camadro J.-M. Lesuisse E. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 579-588Google Scholar). We therefore tested promoter activity over an extended time course using Hb under iron-sufficient and -deficient conditions. Hb rapidly increased promoter activity independent of the iron status of the medium (Fig. 3B, circles). Neither iron deficiency nor hemin addition increased promoter activity at the early time points, but both showed induction after a lag time of 3 h (Fig. 3B). Taken together, Table I and Fig. 3 indicate that the effects of Hb, iron deficiency, and hemin on CaHMX1 transcription are separable events. CaHMX1 was initially identified as a Hb-regulated gene by RNA arbitrarily primed PCR analysis using RNA isolated 24 h after the addition of Hb (see “Experimental Procedures”). To examine the iron dependence of the Hb response for CaHMX1 at later times, we duplicated these conditions with the CAMP Ki-29 reporter strain (Fig. 4). After cell culture for 24 h, iron-replete conditions maintained the promoter in an inactive state, but the addition of Hb stimulated activity ∼40-fold at this time (Fig. 4A). When ferrozine was added to generate iron deficiency, a similar induction of promoter activity was seen (Fig. 4A). However, ferrozine and Hb together produced an additive effect and resulted in transcriptional activity greater than either compound added alone (Fig. 4A). This additivity further indicated that Hb and iron depletion are distinct signals that regulate the CaHMX1 promoter. The presence of four HAP1 consensus sites (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Google Scholar) 5′ of CaHMX1 (Fig. 2D) suggested that hemin could play a direct role in the regulation of this promoter. However, hemin addition to CAMP Ki-29 cells increased activity only about 2-fold after 24 h, in contrast to the high activity of the combination of Hb and ferrozine (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, however, the inducing activity of Hb combined with ferrozine was suppressed by the addition of hemin and resulted in only a 2.5-fold increase in activity over the iron-replete control (Fig. 4B). Therefore, hemin is unlikely to be the mediator of CaHMX1 induction by Hb and may be a negative regulator of CaHMX1 under some conditions. CaHMX1 Is Necessary for Growth under Iron Deficiency— Acquisition of iron is clearly essential for cell survival (34Weinberg E.D. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1999; 46: 231-238Google Scholar). The interplay of iron and Hb regulation at the CaHMX1 promoter suggested a role for this gene in cellular iron metabolism. The S. cerevisiae ortholog HMX1 plays a role in the mobilization of iron from internal heme stores, indicating a direct connection of HMX1 to iron metabolism (15Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Google Scholar). To test whether cell growth depended upon CaHMX1 activity, we compared survival of parental and homozygous deletion strains under various levels of iron sufficiency. The deletion mutant grew at an equivalent rate and produced a stationary cell density equivalent to those of the parental strain in iron-replete medium (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Growth of both strains was suppressed in the presence of ferrozine to generate iron deficiency. However, titration of iron into the medium by the addition of FAS (15Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Google Scholar) permitted growth of the parental strain but not the CaHMX1 deletion mutant under iron restriction (Fig. 5). Addition of 100 μm FAS approximates optimal physiological iron conditions (35Philpott C.C. Protchenko O. Kim Y.W. Boretsky Y. Shakoury-Elizeh M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 698-702Google Scholar). Therefore, a step in iron assimilation that becomes rate-limiting only at low iron concentrations requires CaHmx1p. CaHmx1 Displays a Heme Oxygenase Signature in Its Primary Sequence—The CaHmx1p coding region has 36% identity and 49% similarity to the hypothetical heme oxygenase in S. cerevisiae (Hmx1, data not shown) (15Protchenko O. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36582-36587Google Scholar). A comparison to the human isoform-1, for which the crystal structure had been determined, showed 25% identity and 38% similarity. The landmarks comprising a heme oxygenase signature in the primary sequence were highly conserved (Fig. 6). In the heme-binding pocket in heme oxygenases, heme is positioned between the proximal and distal helices (36Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Google Scholar). The proximal region of the heme-binding pocket, which contains residues that make direct heme contact, was present in the Candida hypothetical protein (Fig. 6, filled ovals). His-25, Ala-28, Glu-29, and Phe-33 in helix 1 as well as Phe-207 located in helix 7 of the human heme oxygenase structure (36Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Google Scholar) were all positioned appropriately when aligned with the Candida se"

Although polyP had been dismissed as a molecular fossil (1Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Google Scholar), the recent introduction of novel quantitative enzymatic analytical methods (2Kornberg A. Rao N.N. Ault-Riche D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 89-125Google Scholar) has permitted reexamination of its biological functions. A study of the compartmentalization of polyP performed on various eukaryotic microorganisms has shown that each compartment contains its own type of polyP (3Vagabov V.M. Trilisenko L.V. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 349-354Google Scholar), and a correlation has been established between the basic biological processes occurring in each compartment and the structure and metabolism of polyP (3Vagabov V.M. Trilisenko L.V. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 349-354Google Scholar). Among the enzymes involved in the synthesis and utilization of polyP, exopolyphosphatases were considered as the central regulatory enzymes of its metabolism (4Kulaev I.S. Vagabov V.M. Kulakovskaya T.V. Lichko L.P. Andreeva N.A. Trilisenko L.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 271-278Google Scholar). In yeast, polyphosphatases differ from each other in their molecular masses, substrate specificity, and requirement for divalent cations (4Kulaev I.S. Vagabov V.M. Kulakovskaya T.V. Lichko L.P. Andreeva N.A. Trilisenko L.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 271-278Google Scholar). However, only one gene encoding an exopolyphosphatase has been identified so far (5Wurst H. Shiba T. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 898-906Google Scholar). In eukaryotic organisms, genetic approaches have uncovered key roles for an endopolyphosphatase and an exopolyphophatase in polyP metabolism (6Sethuraman A. Rao N.N. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8542-8547Google Scholar). polyphosphate tripolyP polyP of 28 residues pyrophosphatase procyclic forms bloodstream forms phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid vacuolar H+-ATPase vacuolar H+-PPase. polyphosphate tripolyP polyP of 28 residues pyrophosphatase procyclic forms bloodstream forms phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid vacuolar H+-ATPase vacuolar H+-PPase. In trypanosomatids and many other protozoa causing human disease, an acidic electron-dense compartment has been shown to contain the major part of the cellular polyP. This compartment, initially named the acidocalcisome in T. brucei, was shown to be implicated in storage of cations and phosphate (7Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Google Scholar), regulation of intracellular pH (8LeFurgey A. Ingram P. Blum J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 40: 77-86Google Scholar, 9Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Google Scholar), and osmoregulation (10LeFurgey A. Ingram P. Blum J.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 128: 385-394Google Scholar, 11Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Google Scholar). To better understand the relation between polyP metabolism and its cellular role, studies were performed on the polyP composition and on the characterization of enzymes involved in the metabolism of these compounds. Short- and long-chain polyP and PPi were shown to be present in the acidocalcisomes of T. brucei bloodstream forms (BF) (12Moreno B. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Bailey B.N. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28356-28362Google Scholar, 13Moreno B. Rodrigues C.O. Bailey B.N. Urbina J.A. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Oldfield E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 207-212Google Scholar). The turnover of the acidocalcisome PPi pool is low (14Urbina J.A. Moreno B. Vierkotter S. Oldfield E. Payares G. Sanoja C. Bailey B.N. Yan W. Scott D.A. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33609-33615Google Scholar), suggesting that PPi could be a product of polyP metabolism. In this work, we report the identification in acidocalcisomes of a novel type I soluble pyrophosphatase (TbVSP1). According to the divalent metal cofactor used, Mg2+ or Zn2+, TbVSP1 specifically hydrolyzes either PPi or short-chain polyP. TbVSP1 was also shown to play a central role in the regulation of polyP metabolism in acidocalcisomes and to be essential for osmoregulation and virulence in mice. Strains Used—T. brucei brucei bloodstream form host cell line 90-13, co-expressing the T7 RNA polymerase and the Tet repressor, was a gift from G. A. M. Cross (15Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in vitro in modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (16Baltz T. Baltz D. Giroud C. Crockett J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1273-1277Google Scholar). T. brucei strain 427 procyclic forms (PF) were cultured in SDM-79 medium (17Brun R. Jenni L. Tanner M. Schonenberger M. Schell K.F. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 387-390Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cloning of TbVSP1—To screen for genes encoding soluble pyrophosphatases (PPases) in T. brucei, the amino acid sequence of the yeast PPase (accession number 2781300) was used to search all available sequence databases using TBLASTN. This search yielded a 0.535-kb gene fragment (accession number AL496002), which closely resembled the region encompassed by nucleotides encoding amino acid residues 42–215 of the yeast PPase. In silico chromosome walking revealed two overlapping sequences (AQ951034 and AZ216908) encoding the N-terminal extremity of the T. brucei PPase. A genomic DNA fragment, PCR-amplified with the following set of primers, PPasePF1Nter (5′-GGGCGGCATATGAACAACACACACGGT-3′) and PPasePF1Cter (5′-GGCCGGCTCGAGCTTCTCAAATGT-3′), was used as a probe to screen a T. brucei cosmid library (18Sambrook J. Fritsh E. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. vols. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), generated into the c2X75 cosmid vector (19Campbell D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 458Google Scholar) as described previously (20Bates P. Swift R. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 137-146Google Scholar). Hinc2 fragments of the isolated cosmids were subcloned into the pUC18 vector from Appligene and screened with the genomic DNA fragment PPasePF1Nter/PPase-PF1Cter. An Hinc2 fragment of 4000 bp was isolated and sequenced using the AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, as described by the manufacturer (ABI PRISM®, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The complete gene sequence of the T. brucei PPase was obtained. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the N-terminal Domain of TbVSP1 (N-TbVSP1)—A 405-bp fragment comprising the N-terminal domain was generated by PCR. The 5′ primer PPasePF1Nter contained an 18-nucleotide linker with a NdeI restriction site to facilitate subcloning and 5′ adjacent N-terminal residues. The 3′ primer, PPasePF1Cter included an 18-nucleotide linker with a XhoI site for cloning. The PCR product was inserted into the XhoI/NdeI sites of the pET23a plasmid (Novagen). The resulting recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) from Novagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed, and the recombinant protein was purified as described previously (21Bakalara N. Santarelli X. Davis C. Baltz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8863-8871Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the rec-TbVSP1 and ΔN-TbVSP1—Genomic DNA fragments were PCR-amplified with the following set of primers: PPasePF1Nter (5′-GGGCGGCATATGAACAACACACACGGT-3′) and PPasePF2Nter (5′-GGCCGGCATATGCCGTATCACCAGCAG-3′) as the 5′ primer for the rec-TbVSP1 and ΔN-TbVSP1, respectively, and the PPasePF2Cter (5′-CCGGCCCTCGAGCAGTTCTCCCATCTTGTT-3′) as the 3′ primer for both products. The fragments were cloned into the XhoI/NdeI sites of the pET23a plasmid (Novagen). Purification of the Recombinant N-TbVSP1, rec-TbVSP1 and ΔN-Tb-VSP1, Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography—The recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli were purified from the His·Bind® column from Amersham Biosciences used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Before performing the PPase assays, the enzyme was desalted in TrisDES buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm MgCl2) on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The exclusion chromatography of the rec-TbVSP1 and ΔN-TbVSP1 proteins was performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 using a Superdex 200 HR column from Amersham Biosciences. Determination of Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) and by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. Bovine serum albumin was used as standard. Production and Western Blot Analysis of Immune Serum against the Recombinant N-TbVSP1—Rabbits were first injected with 80 μg of the N-TbVSP1 in complete Freund's adjuvant and with another 80 μg in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 15 and 30 days later. Blood was collected before the first injection (preimmune serum) and 10, 13, and 15 days following the last injection. Western blotting was performed as described (23Dutoya S. Gibert S. Lemercier G. Santarelli X. Baltz D. Baltz T. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49117-49124Google Scholar), with serum diluted 1200 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody, a 15000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), was incubated for 2 h in PBS-Tween-milk. Immunoreactive bands were revealed by washing in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, and revealed either by 0.5 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine or by the ECL™ revelation kit (Amersham Biosciences). PPase and Exopolyphosphatase Activity—0.020–2 μg of desalted recombinant PPase was incubated for 1–5 min at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, or 1 mm ZnCl2 and the indicated concentration of sodium PPi, polyP3, or polyP28. The reaction was stopped, and released Pi was quantified as described by Ref. 24Shatton J.B. Ward C. Williams A. Weinhouse S. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 114-119Google Scholar. Acetate buffer was used from pH 4.5 to 5.0, MES buffer from 5.5 to 6.5, Tris-HCl from 7.0 to 8.8, and glycine NaOH at pH 9.5. Before use, polyP28 was purified on G25 Sephadex. TbVSP1 and Ca2+ kinetic constants were determined by preincubation of the enzyme with 100 μm CaCl2. The enzyme was then diluted 100 times in the reaction buffer. Because polyP3 hydrolysis produces Pi and PPi, which could be hydrolyzed to Pi, we used the equation developed for an enzyme with two substrates, as published by Zyryanov et al. (25Zyryanov A.B. Shestakov A.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 901-906Google Scholar), to calculate the Michaelis constants. Expression of the Proteolipidic Subunit of the Vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-H+-ATPase) in T. brucei PF—The gene was amplified from AnTat genomic DNA with the two following primers: SC2 (5′-CTATATTTCGAAATGCTAAGTGACGATACCTGTCAAC-3′) and SC1 (5′-CTCCGTGGATCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGAGCAACCACCCGTATAGGA-3′) designed from the T. brucei V-H+-ATPase proteolipidic subunit and cloned in the BamH1/HindIII restriction sites of the pLEW100 vector. Cells were then transfected with that construction and selected as described previously (23Dutoya S. Gibert S. Lemercier G. Santarelli X. Baltz D. Baltz T. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49117-49124Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—For immunocytochemistry, procyclic trypomastigotes were washed with Dulbecco's PBS, fixed for 1 h in a solution containing 0.1% grade I glutaraldehyde, 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde, 0.8% picric acid, in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Fixed parasites were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and dehydrated by successive incubations of 6 min with increasing concentrations of ethanol (10, 25, 50, 75, 95, and 100%) at –20 °C. Samples were embedded in Unicryl at 4 °C by incubation with 1:1 ethanol/Unicryl for 1 h and 100% Unicryl for 1, 16, and 8 h. Embedded samples were polymerized under UV irradiation at –20 °C for 48 h. Thin sections were collected on 300 mesh nickel grids and blocked for 60 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.5% cold fish gelatin (PBS-TW-FG). Grids were incubated for 3 h with a mix of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against TbVSP1 (1:50) and a mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody (1:50), diluted in PBS-TW-FG. After washing in PBS-TW-FG, grids were incubated for 1 h with a mixture of a 10-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:75) and a 20-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:20), diluted in PBS-TW-FG. After incubations, grids were washed with 5 ml of PBS and with 5 ml of distilled water before being stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Routine and immunocytochemistry samples were observed in a Hitachi H 600 electron microscope. Double-stranded RNA Expression and Trypanosome Transfection— The inducible T7 RNA polymerase-based protein expression system developed by Wirtz et al. (15Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Google Scholar) (kindly provided by G. A. M. Cross) and the p2T7 vector (kindly provided by D. LaCount) (26LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Google Scholar) were used in this study. DNA fragments corresponding to the coding regions of TbVSP1 from nucleotides 1–462 were PCR-amplified. The 462-bp fragment was amplified using the following set of primers: DB/PP1 (5′-CGGGGCAAGCTTATGAACAACACACACGG-3′) and DB/PP2 (5′-GCCCCGGAATTCCATCGAGAAACATTTCG-3′). After precloning in the pGEMt vector (Promega), the resulting fragment was cloned between the HindIII/SacII restriction sites of p2T7 generating the p2T7PPase construction. For stable transfection of bloodstream forms, cells were harvested from a log phase culture, washed once in ZPFMG (ZPFM (Zimmerman Post Fusion Medium) and 55 mm glucose), and resuspended in ZPMG (containing 2 mm ATP and 5 mm glutathione) at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml (27Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Google Scholar, 28van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Google Scholar). 2 × 107 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of DNA at 1600 V, infinite resistance, 40 microfarads using the Eurogentech cellject machine. Surviving cells were then seeded in a microtiter plate as described by Wirtz et al. (27Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Google Scholar), and selection was applied the following day by adding phleomycin to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The genetically modified strain was named BFiTbVSP1 and induced for 4 days with 1 μg/ml of tetracycline. Several clones with identical phenotypes were obtained. Analysis of PolyP—PolyP levels were determined as described by Ruiz et al. (29Ruiz F.A. Rodriguez C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 22Google Scholar) using the recombinant exopolyphosphatase (rPPX1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. BFiVSP1 bloodstream forms were induced or not with 1 μg/ml tetracycline during 4 days. Then, 2 × 107cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS, and long- and short-chain polyP were quantified. Gene Cloning, Classification, and Sequence Analysis of T. brucei VSP1—The nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1245 bp, which encodes a protein of 415 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 47.3 kDa and a calculated pI of 5.79 (Fig. 1). A Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of a muticopy gene family (data not shown). While this manuscript was in preparation, a search in the T. brucei genome project databases (www.genedb.org) using the TbVSP1 coding sequence indicated the existence on chromosome X and XI of at least three copies of the TbVSP1. The sequence on chromosome X encodes for the pyrophosphatase we worked with. Sequences on chromosomes XI are isoforms. One sequence diverged on 11 amino acids (Fig. 1) (V52F,L55S; H56L,K362E; N373S,R378H; M380L; K381R; S434A; L442R, and M447R. Positions are given according to Fig. 1), and another one diverged on 6 of these 11 amino acids (K362E; N373S; R378H; M380L; K381R; and M447R). Sequence comparison analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) revealed that the TbVSP1 belongs to the family I PPase. The 17 polar amino acids present in the active site of yeast PPase (30Sivula T. Salminen A. Parfenyev A.N. Pohjanjoki P. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 75-80Google Scholar) are conserved in the TbVSP1 protein (Fig. 1). With respect to size and primary structure, type I PPases have been divided into three families (30Sivula T. Salminen A. Parfenyev A.N. Pohjanjoki P. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 75-80Google Scholar). The best identity was obtained with the animal/fungal (Ic) subfamily (Fig. 1). In particular, the TbVSP1 contains three of the four insertions characteristic of the animal/fungal subfamily (Fig. 1). In addition, the TbVSP1 has a large N-terminal extension domain of 160 amino acids (Fig. 1). A search of conserved domains performed by INTERPRO (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/scan.html) revealed the presence of a calcium-binding type II EF-hand domain (IPR002048) in this N-terminal region. This analysis suggested that the TbVSP1 might possess specific functions or a particular location. Therefore, in a first step toward the characterization of the TbVSP1, we analyzed its expression and its subcellular localization. Expression and Localization of TbVSP1—Immunoblotting with a specific rabbit antiserum directed against the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–160) of TbVSP1 indicated that expression levels by the mammalian host bloodstream and the insect procyclic forms were similar (Fig. 2A). To determine the localization of the TbVSP1, immunoelectron microscopy was performed on thin sections of PF parasites using the rabbit anti-N-TbVSP1 antiserum. The results obtained (Fig. 2B) indicated that TbVSP1 was located in large vesicles containing electron-dense material, a characteristic feature of acidocalcisomes (7Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Google Scholar). Co-localization studies were performed on procyclic forms expressing a His tag subunit c of the vacuolar H+-ATPase using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2B). This co-localization confirmed the presence of TbVSP1 protein in acidocalcisomes (31Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 227-233Google Scholar, 32Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Google Scholar). No reaction was detected when the primary antibodies were omitted (data not shown). To further analyze the subcellular localization of TbVSP1, we prepared acidocalcisomes from procyclic forms from a high density Percoll fraction of trypanosomes as described previously (9Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Google Scholar). TbVSP1 was detected by Western blots in this high density fraction (Fig. 2C), which was shown to contain the acidocalcisomal protein marker V-H+-PPase (9Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Google Scholar). We estimated at around 10-fold the enrichment of the acidocalcisome fraction in TbVSP1. Although some membrane-associated PPases have been shown to localize in mitochondria (33Lundin M. Baltscheffsky H. Ronne H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12168-12172Google Scholar) and chloroplast thylakoid (34Jiang S.S. Fan L.L. Yang S.J. Kuo S.Y. Pan R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 105-112Google Scholar) previously, none has been localized to a vacuolar compartment before. Substrate Specificity of TbVSP1—In the presence of Mg2+, PPases display nearly absolute PPi specificity. However, this specificity is lost when transition metal ions such as Zn2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ are used as cofactors (25Zyryanov A.B. Shestakov A.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 901-906Google Scholar). Because acidocalcisomes contain high levels of Mg2+, Zn2, and Ca2+ (35Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Google Scholar), we determined the Michaelis-Menten constants of the TbVSP1 for the three substrates polyP28, polyP3, and PPi, in the presence of Mg2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+. With 1 mm Mg2+, TbVSP1 specifically hydolyzed PPi with an optimum pH of 7.5 and a kcat value of 385 s–1 (Fig. 3A). The replacement of Mg2+ for Zn2+ in the reaction buffer resulted in the hydrolysis of polyP3 and polyP28, in addition to PPi. However, the optimum pH for hydrolysis shifted to a more acidic pH of 6.5 with kcat values of 52, 3.5, and 56 s–1, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). This effect of specificity change was discussed previously by Zyryanov et al. (25Zyryanov A.B. Shestakov A.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 901-906Google Scholar) and attributed to the fact that the Zn2+ transition metal ion allowed a more favorable positioning of the terminal phosphate group for catalysis (25Zyryanov A.B. Shestakov A.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 901-906Google Scholar). Ca2+-PPi, conversely, is an efficient competitive inhibitor of Mg2+-PPi hydrolysis. TbVSP1 was inhibited by Ca2+ with an inhibition constant value (Ki) of 14 μm, calculated for PPi hydrolysis in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2. In contrast, even when used at 200 μm, Ca2+ did not inhibit polyP3 and polyP28 hydrolysis. In conclusion, TbVSP1 substrate specificity in acidocalcisomes is regulated in a complex manner by the pH and Ca2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+ content of the compartment. Role of the N-terminal Extension in the Oligomerization and Enzymatic Activity of TbVSP1—The sequence that directs proteins to acidocalcisomes has not been identified. To analyze the potential implication of the N-terminal domain for acidocalcisome protein targeting, we constructed a chimeric protein containing this N-terminal domain and the green fluorescent protein. The resulting fusion protein expressed in T. brucei procyclic forms was not addressed to acidocalcisomes (data not shown). However, the main roles attributed to the EF-hand domain are the regulation of cellular activity, buffering/transporting Ca2+, or anchoring protein complexes (36Davis J.P. Rall J.A. Reiser P.J. Smillie L.B. Tikunova S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49716-49726Google Scholar, 37Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Google Scholar). Therefore, to further investigate the role of the N-terminal extension, we deleted it from a mutant protein (ΔN-TbVSP1). The resulting kinetic constants of ΔN-TbVSP1 for PPi hydrolysis and the Ca2+ inhibition constant did not vary (13 μm), suggesting that the EF-hand domain of this N-terminal region was not implicated in PPi hydrolysis or Ca2+ regulation. Nevertheless, whereas size analysis performed by exclusion chromatography indicated that ΔN-TbVSP1 principally existed as a dimer (Fig. 4), TbVSP1, in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, was shown to mainly exist as an hexamer. Because of the type II Ca2+ EF-hand domain, we tested the effect of Ca2+ on the enzyme oligomerization state. Exclusion chromatography showed that addition of 100 μm CaCl2 favored the formation of large complexes of around 600,000 Da (Fig. 4.). Large complexes did not show different kinetic constants for PPi (kcat = 324 s–1), polyP3 (kcat = 33.5 s–1), and polyP28 (kcat = 3.7 s–1). In conclusion, Ca2+ could regulate the oligomerization state of the enzyme by its binding to the N-terminal region. This oligomerization could be a mechanism for association of TbVSP1 with the membrane compartment (38Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Google Scholar) in which polyP is present (7Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Google Scholar). Implication of the TbVSP1 in the Regulation of PolyP Metabolism in Acidocalcisomes—We used RNA interference to produce bloodstream TbVSP1 mutants (BFiVSP1). After 4 days of double-stranded RNA expression, TbVSP1 protein completely disappeared (Fig. 5A). Concomitantly, the level of short- and long-chain polyP greatly decreased. In particular, the steady state level of long-chain polyP underwent a 60% reduction (Fig. 5B). Moreno et al. (12Moreno B. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Bailey B.N. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28356-28362Google Scholar) have reported that short-chain polyP of an average chain length of 3.3 phosphates and PPi are the most abundant phosphorus-containing compounds in acidocalcisomes. The short-chain polyP concentration in T. brucei PF has been previously reported to be around 50 mm (9Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Google Scholar). Fig. 5B shows that the concentration in BF is around 600 μm. The respective Km values for PPi and polyP3 hydrolysis in the presence of Mg2+ and Zn2+ were estimated as 19 and 373 μm (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the Km for polyP28, which is present in a much lower concentration in acidocalcisomes, was estimated as 14 μm (Fig. 3). Moreover, Km values for the same substrates and cofactors calculated for the hexameric and larger complexes were similar. Therefore, according to the Km values of TbVSP1, it appears that the TbVSP1 would work at Vmax to produce Pi from PPi and short-chain polyP. However, before it could hydrolyze PPi, TbVSP1 would require a pH increase and a calcium concentration decrease in acidocalcisomes. This conclusion suggests a central role for the enzyme in the regulation of polyP metabolism. In S. cerevisiae, polyP is hydrolyzed through the combined action of an endopolyphosphatase and an exopolyphosphatase (39Kumble K.D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5818-5822Google Scholar), which hydrolyze long- and short-chain polyP to polyP3 and PPi. In Leishmania major (40Rodrigues C.O. Ruiz F.A. Vieira M. Hill J.E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50899-50906Google Scholar) and in T. brucei (41Lemercier G. Bakalara N. Santarelli X. J. Chromatogr. B. Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 786: 305-309Google Scholar), genes encoding for exopolyphosphatases have been sequenced, but in T. brucei, we do not have evidence for its location in acidocalcisomes. This exopolyphosphatase is active at pH 7.5 and is inhibited by CaCl2 (40Rodrigues C.O. Ruiz F.A. Vieira M. Hill J.E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50899-50906Google Scholar, 41Lemercier G. Bakalara N. Santarelli X. J. Chromatogr. B. Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 786: 305-309Google Scholar). To avoid polyP3 accumulation in the cell compartment where polyP hydrolysis is occurring and to produce Pi, polyP3 should be further hydrolyzed. We hypothesize that polyP3 at acidic pH in the presence of Zn2+ is hydrolyzed by the TbVSP1 and that, following compartment alkalinization and the release of H+ and Ca2+, the exopolyphosphatase and TbVSP1 could drive the reaction by producing Pi directly from polyP3 and PPi within acidocalcisomes. The produced Pi could be either exported or further utilized for polyP synthesis. Acidocalcisomes have been shown to be involved in several biological processes after partial alkalinization (9Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Google Scholar, 29Ruiz F.A. Rodriguez C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 22Google Scholar). Alkalinization creates environmental conditions that activate TbVSP1 and the previously reported exopolyphosphatase activity (9Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Google Scholar, 29Ruiz F.A. Rodriguez C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 22Google Scholar, 32Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Google Scholar, 40Rodrigues C.O. Ruiz F.A. Vieira M. Hill J.E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50899-50906Google Scholar). Accordingly, TbVSP1 might be essential for polyP hydrolysis to occur during these processes. We therefore tested the BF mutant cells under different physiological conditions that have been shown to require polyP hydrolysis. Phenotypic Analysis of TbVSP1 BF Mutants (BFiVSP1), pH and Ca2+Homeostasis and Survival in a Deprived Phosphate Medium and under Osmotic Stress—In contrast to what we reported previously for V-H+-PPase mutated parasites (9Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Google Scholar), BFiVSP1 recovered as well as wild type cells from pH stresses (acidic or basic, data not shown). Moreover, Ca2+ release induced by nigericin, NH4Cl, or ionomycin was not altered in the induced BFiVSP1 (data not shown), whereas that amount was significantly reduced in the V-H+-PPase mutants (9Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Google Scholar). Because the polyP content was reduced by 90% in V-H+-PPase mutants, we suggest that the remaining polyP in the BFiVSP1 mutants was sufficient for these homeostatic mechanisms to take place. It has been established that polyP serves as a Pi reservoir for cellular metabolism and growth. We showed that neither induced nor non-induced BFiVSP1 mutant cells failed to overcome the effects of an incubation in a phosphate-depleted medium (data not shown). However, after 45 min of incubation in low PO4-containing medium, the percent of cell survival is about 30% for non-induced BFiVSP1 parasites and 1% for those induced (Fig. 6A). This observation indicated that induced parasites were more sensitive to a low PO4-containing medium. Ruiz et al. (29Ruiz F.A. Rodriguez C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 22Google Scholar) have demonstrated that polyP hydrolysis was induced by hyposmotic stress. LeFurgey et al. (10LeFurgey A. Ingram P. Blum J.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 128: 385-394Google Scholar) also confirmed that acidocalcisomes play a physiological role in osmoregulation. Induced BFiVSP1 forms were therefore tested for growth under hyposmotic growth conditions. Induced mutated cells did not develop under hyposmotic stress, whereas non-induced cells started to develop normally after 30 h (Fig. 6B). As a control, we found that the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 120 mm (isoosmotic conditions) was required for normal growth of induced BFiVSP1. This cellular response is not immediate since we noted a 20-h latent period before growth of the non-induced BFiVSP1. In conclusion, these results suggested that the absence of TbVSP1 largely reduced the ability of acidocalcisomes to hydrolyze polyP and recover from hyposmotic stress. TbVSP1 Is Essential for T. brucei Virulence in Mice—First, we examined whether induced BFiVSP1 grew normally in isoosmotic modified essential medium. Induced BFiVSP1 started to grow at about 120 h and then declined in numbers to an undetectable level for at least 10 days (Fig. 6C). In the absence of either tetracycline induction or doxycline treatment, BFiVSP1 parasites killed the mice after 100 h of infection. After 100 h, there were 40-fold fewer induced BFiVSP1 parasites in the blood than in the controls (non-induced and wild type) (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results indicate that the absence of TbVSP1 decreases acute virulence of T. brucei in mice such that animals survive an otherwise lethal infection with this strain. These data confirmed that TbVSP1 plays a key role in polyP metabolism and might be an alternative to exopolyphosphatase activity in eukaryotic cells. Because TbVSP1 was essential for osmoregulation and the establishment of full virulence in mice, it could be considered as a potential pharmacological target. We also have identified a gene encoding this enzyme in Leishmania amazonensis (accession number AL354096). Moreover, bisphosphonates, which are known as good trypanocides (42Montalvetti A. Bailey B.N. Martin M.B. Severin G.W. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33930-33937Google Scholar, 43Martin M.B. Grimley J.S. Lewis J.C. Heath 3rd, H.T. Bailey B.N. Kendrick H.

Chem. 2001; 44: 909-916Google Scholar), are potent inhibitors of pyrophosphatase activities (44Hyytia T. Halonen P. Salminen A. Goldman A. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4645-4653Google Scholar). Since these molecules accumulate on polyphosphate (45Schroder H.C. Kurz L. Muller W.E. Lorenz B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 296-303Google Scholar), it would be of great interest to evaluate bisphosphonate accumulation in this compartment and to test them for inhibitory effects on TbVSP1 enzymatic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2117289838,"We have isolated δ-conotoxin EVIA (δ-EVIA), a conopeptide in Conus ermineus venom that contains 32 amino acid residues and a six-cysteine/four-loop framework similar to that of previously described ω-, δ-, μO-, and κ-conotoxins. However, it displays low sequence homology with the latter conotoxins. δ-EVIA inhibits Na+ channel inactivation with unique tissue specificity upon binding to receptor site 6 of neuronal Na+ channels. Using amphibian myelinated axons and spinal neurons, we showed that δ-EVIA increases the duration of action potentials by inhibiting Na+ channel inactivation. δ-EVIA considerably enhanced nerve terminal excitability and synaptic efficacy at the frog neuromuscular junction but did not affect directly elicited muscle action potentials. The neuronally selective property of δ-EVIA was confirmed by showing that a fluorescent derivative of δ-EVIA labeled motor nerve endings but not skeletal muscle fibers. In a heterologous expression system, δ-EVIA inhibited inactivation of rat neuronal Na+ channel subtypes (rNaV1.2a, rNaV1.3, and rNaV1.6) but did not affect rat skeletal (rNaV1.4) and human cardiac muscle (hNaV1.5) Na+ channel subtypes. δ-EVIA, in the range of concentrations used, is the first conotoxin found to affect neuronal Na+ channels without acting on Na+ channels of skeletal and cardiac muscle.

Defective nerve conduction is frequently associated with neurological diseases, particularly with those causing axonal demyelinization (1Kaji R. Muscle Nerve. 2003; 27: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2Hattori N. Yamamoto M. Yoshihara T. Koike H. Nakagawa M. Yoshikawa H. Ohnishi A. Hayasaka K. Onodera O. Baba M. Yasuda H.

Nerve conduction may be facilitated by blocking voltage-gated K+ channels and by inhibiting inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Ligands that act on such channels are plentiful, but most of them lack selectivity, i.e. they affect channels present in various tissues, including nerve tissue and skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles. Voltage-dependent Na+ channels play a fundamental role in cell membrane excitability, and they are targets for a large number of animal and plant toxins (3Catterall W.A.

Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar).

Thus, the μ-conotoxins GIIIA and GIIIB selectively block tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels in skeletal muscles (6Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Zeikus R.D. Kerr L. Yoshikami D. Moczydlowski E. J.

The μ-conotoxin PIIIA also differentiates Na+ channel subtypes, i.e. toxin concentrations that block rNaV1.2 (rat brain type II/IIA) and rNaV1.4 (rat skeletal muscle) channels only slightly inhibit rNaV1.7 (rat peripheral nerve PN1) channels (12Shon K.J.

The extract was clarified twice by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 4 min), and the supernatant fluids from all extractions were pooled, applied to a column (1.8 × 76 cm) of Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted (flow rate, ∼4 ml·h-1) with 0.2 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4). δ-EVIA was further purified by three steps of reverse phase HPLC with Vydac C18 and Merck C18 columns (see Fig. 1). Amino Acid Sequencing—Aliquots of δ-EVIA were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a solution containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). They were then treated for 3 h at room temperature with 1.5 mm 4-vinylpyridine. The derivative was purified by reverse phase HPLC with a C18 Vydac column (4.6 mm x 25 cm; 5-μm particle size), and the amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 477A microsequencer. Synthesis of δ-EVIA—δ-EVIA was synthesized by solid phase synthesis methods (Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry). Folding procedures, including oxidation of the three disulfides, will be described elsewhere. The calculated Mr of synthetic δ-EVIA agreed with that determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (observed MH+ = 3,288.3; calculated MH+ = 3,288.9; data not shown). N-α-Rhodaminyl B-labeled δ-EVIA (δ-REVIA) was synthetized as described above, except that rhodamine B was used as an acetylating reagent. δ-REVIA was submitted to amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry (observed MH+ = 3,712.2; calculated MH+ = 3,712.0). Electrospray ionization mass spectra were monitored with a homemade mass spectrometer (C.E.A., Gif-sur-Yvette) comprising an electrospray ion source (Analytica, Branford, CT), a quadrupole mass analyzer (model R10-10; Nermag, France), and data analysis software (Chem-MS Chemstation; Hewlett-Packard). Bioassays—The bioassays were performed with mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis, 1.0-1.5 g) and Swiss-Webster mice (10-15 g). The fish were injected i.m., and the mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with a stereotaxic system (Harvard/ASI Apparatus, Kent, UK). The ED50 was defined as the dose producing hyperactivity in 50% of the tested mice within 2 h postinjection. Isolated frog (Rana esculenta) nerve muscle preparations were used to detect excitoxin(s) in venom fractions (excitotoxins produce spontaneous muscle contractions) and to characterize the activity of purified δ-EVIA. Electrophysiological Studies—Frogs (R. esculenta, weighing 20-25 g) were killed by double pithing. Cutaneous pectoris nerve muscle preparations were dissected and placed in a standard solution containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.1 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.25). In most experiments, excitation-contraction was uncoupled with 2 m formamide, as previously described (19Le Gall F. Favreau P. Benoit E. Mattei C. Bouet F. Menou J.L. Ménez A. Letourneux Y. Molgó J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3134-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Membrane potential and synaptic potentials were recorded at 20-22 °C, with intracellular microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl (8-12 MΩ resistance), using conventional techniques (19Le Gall F. Favreau P. Benoit E. Mattei C. Bouet F. Menou J.L. Ménez A. Letourneux Y. Molgó J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3134-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In some experiments, a dual microelectrode current-clamp technique, with the aid of an Axoclamp 2B system (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), was used to trigger and record action potentials at a membrane potential of –100 mV. Electrophysiological experiments with nodes of Ranvier were performed at 13-16 °C with single myelinated axons isolated from the frog sciatic nerve. Action potentials and Na+ currents were recorded using current- and voltage-clamp techniques, as previously described (20Benoit E. Gordon D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Na+ current recordings were performed after suppressing K+ currents with internal 110 mm CsCl and 10 mm external tetraethylammonium chloride. δ-EVIA was applied to the nodal compartment of the chamber (for details, see Ref. 20Benoit E. Gordon D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Spinal Neuron Cultures—Xenopus cultures were prepared as previously described (21Spitzer N.C. Lamborghini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1641-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 22Tabti N. Poo M.M. Banker G. Gosslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 137-154Google Scholar). Briefly, neural tubes and the associated myotomal tissue of Xenopus embryos (20-22 stage) (23Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis Daudin, 2nd Ed. Amsterdam, North Holland1967Google Scholar) were dissociated for 30-45 min in a Ca2+- and Mg2+-free solution containing 113 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm HEPES, (pH 7.8). The cells were plated in a culture medium containing (v/v): 49.5% Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen), 0.5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and 50% standard solution containing 113 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.8). The cultures were supplemented with antibiotics and used 24 h after incubation at 19 °C. Spinal neurons were voltage-clamped at 20-22 °C, using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes made from borosilicate glass and pulled on a P-87 puller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) had 1-3 MΩ tip resistances. Voltage commands and data acquisition were performed using pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments), and Na+ currents were recorded in an extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained 130 mm CsCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.22). Na+Channel Expression and Two-electrode Voltage-Clamp Assay Using Xenopus Oocytes—cRNAs encoding the α-subunits of rat skeletal muscle (rNaV1.4), human cardiac muscle (hNaV1.5), and rat brain IIa (rNaV1.2a), III (rNaV1.3), and Na6 (rNaV1.6) Na+ channels and the human auxiliary β1-subunit were transcribed in vitro, injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and analyzed by a two-electrode voltage-clamp protocol, as described (24Gordon D. Ilan N. Zilberberg N. Gilles N. Urbach D. Cohen L. Karbat I. Froy O. Gaathon A. Kallen R.G. Benveniste M. Gurevitz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.85). A stock solution of δ-EVIA (2 mm) was prepared in 50% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and was diluted 200-fold with bath solution containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). A BPS-8 perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments Inc., Westbury, NY) was used to wash the oocytes with bath solution (0.7 ml/min, flow rate; 4 p.s.i., positive pressure). Approximately 1 ml of toxin-containing solution was perfused over the oocytes mounted in a 200-μl chamber at room temperature. Exposure to the vehicle (0.25% acetonitrile) did not affect the oocytes. Binding of Radioiodinated Toxins to Synaptosomes—δ-Conotoxin TxVIA (1 nmol) was incubated for 2 min at room temperature with 0.5 mCi of carrier-free Na[125I] in potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.25) containing H2O2 (10 μl of a 1/50,000 solution) and lactoperoxidase (0.7 units, EC 1.11.1.7, from bovine milk). The monoiodotoxin was purified with a Vydac C18 column. Lqh-2 was radioiodinated as previously described (25Gilles N. Blanchet C. Shichor I. Zaninetti M. Lotan I. Bertrand D. Gordon D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8730-8739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain synaptosomes were prepared from adult rats (Sprague-Dawley; 300 g) as reported (26Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Equilibrium competition assays were performed and analyzed as before (27Hamon A. Gilles N. Sautiere P. Martinage A. Kopeyan C. Ulens C. Tytgat J. Lancelin J.M. Gordon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3920-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nonspecific toxin binding was determined in the presence of an excess of unlabeled toxin. Staining of Nerve Terminals and Confocal Microscopy—Isolated frog cutaneous pectoris nerve muscle preparations were stained (1 h, 22 °C) with 2 μm δ-REVIA dissolved in standard solution and double-labeled (15 min, 22 °C) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-BTX (diluted 1:100). After being washed several times with standard medium, the preparations were examined with a Leica TCS scanning laser confocal system (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) mounted on an upright microscope. The images were collected in the sequential acquisition mode, using a water immersion lens (×40, N.A. 0.8). Data Analysis—All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using Student's t test (p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant). Purification and Amino Acid Sequencing of δ-EVIA—Chromatography of C. ermineus venom on Sephadex G-50 leads to the profile shown in Fig. 1. Only one fraction caused spontaneous muscle contractions when applied to isolated frog neuromuscular preparations (not shown). The fraction was purified to homogeneity by successive reverse phase HPLC with C18 Vydac (Fig. 1, inset) and C18 Merck analytical columns. Gas phase automated Edman degradation and analysis of the pyridylethylated peptide gave the following unambiguous sequence: (H)-DDCIKOYGFCSLPILKNGLCCSGACVGVCADL-(NH2). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses (observed average MH+ = 3,288.3; calculated average MH+ = 3,288.9) were consistent with an amidated C terminus and three disulfide bridges. The pairing of the disulfide linkages unambiguously showed the arrangement C1-4, C2-5, and C3-6 (not shown). Therefore, δ-EVIA consists of 32 amino acid residues and three disulfide linkages forming a four-loop cysteine scaffold similar to that of other conotoxins from various families (Table I). On the basis of cDNA analysis, a 29-amino acid-long C. ermineus conotoxin (collected in the western part of Atlantic Ocean), with a deduced amino acid sequence similar to that of δ-PVIA and δ-NgVIA (15Fainzilber M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13201-13208Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and designated according to the current nomenclature of Conus peptides as E6a (encoded by clone E6.4). Interestingly, there is low homology between the amino acid sequence of this E6a peptide of unknown mechanism of action and that of our described δ-EVIA (Table I). In contrast to other δ-conotoxins, δ-EVIA possesses an aspartic acid at positions 2 and 31, a tyrosine at position 7, a glycine at position 8, a small side chain (alanine) at position 24, and a longer loop composed of 9 amino acid residues, which, however, is also observed in conotoxins with unrelated functions; i.e. ω-conotoxin PnVIA (28Kits K.S.

Open table in a new tab In Vivo Activity of Venom and δ-EVIA—2-5 min after intracerebroventricular injection, low doses of C. ermineus venom induced rapid running and jumping of mice (ED50 = 0.25 μg/g of body mass), whereas higher doses (>0.4 μg/g of body mass) caused convulsions and death within a few minutes. Intramuscular injection of venom (0.5 μg/g of body mass) into mosquito fish produced an immediate extension of the dorsal and caudal fins, a loss of balance control, and violent convulsions just prior to death. Native and synthetic δ-EVIA exhibited similar excitatory activity in mice (ED50 = 1.8 and 1.9 pmol/g of body mass, respectively). δ-EVIA (40 pmol) produced hyperactivity, rapid running, and seizures in mice 1-3 min after intracerebroventricular injection. Higher doses (1 nmol) induced convulsions and death in about 1 min. Effects of δ-EVIA on Frog Neuromuscular Preparations— Under control conditions, a single nerve stimulus elicited a single muscle action potential recorded at the junctional region of the muscle fiber (Fig. 2A, top trace). However, the addition of δ-EVIA (0.2-1 μm) to the medium induced trains of repetitive action potentials after a single nerve stimulus (Fig. 2A, middle trace), and continued nerve stimulation (0.5 Hz) revealed that the repetitive action potentials were triggered by repetitive end plate potentials (EPPs) (Fig. 2A, bottom trace). When the membrane was preset to –45 mV (to inactivate most voltage-dependent Na+ channels), a single nerve stimulus evoked a single EPP (Fig. 2B, upper trace) in the absence of the toxin. However, in the presence of δ-EVIA, a single nerve stimulus evoked trains of EPPs (Fig. 2B, lower trace) at high frequency. Similar effects and in the same range of δ-EVIA concentrations were obtained in isolated mouse phrenic-hemidiaphragm preparations (data not shown). Thus, the main effect of δ-EVIA was the enhancement of nerve terminal excitability, so that a single nerve stimulus elicited trains of repetitive EPPs, which in turn triggered trains of repetitive muscle action potentials. We then examined whether δ-EVIA affects directly elicited muscle action potentials using a dual microelectrode current-clamp technique and nerve muscle preparations equilibrated in standard medium containing 20 μm tubocurarine to block muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and neutralize the presynaptic effects of δ-EVIA. Under these conditions, δ-EVIA (0.2-2 μm) did not affect muscle excitability or modify the amplitude, overshoot, or duration of action potentials (n = 6) recorded at –100 mV (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the membrane potential of muscle fibers was not significantly affected by the range of δ-EVIA concentrations used (–88.8 ± 3.6 mV for controls and –90.7 ± 4.7 mV after toxin treatment; n = 20, four different muscles). Clearly, δ-EVIA does not act directly on the frog skeletal muscle membrane. Effects of δ-EVIA on Action Potentials and Na+Currents in Frog Myelinated Axons and Xenopus Spinal Neurons—δ-EVIA (0.2 μm) added to the medium bathing current-clamped single myelinated axons consistently prolonged action potentials without modifying the resting membrane potential or the peak amplitude (Fig. 2D). Within 1 min after toxin exposure, the duration of the axonal action potentials, measured at 50% membrane repolarization, increased from 1.2 ± 0.1 to 11.4 ± 1.3 ms (n = 3). The effect was not reversible within 30 min of superfusion with standard toxin-free solution. A similar action of δ-EVIA was observed with current-clamped spinal neurons (n = 6; data not shown). We also characterized the effects of δ-EVIA (0.2 μm) on the time dependence of tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ currents in myelinated axons (Fig. 3A) and spinal neurons (Fig. 3B). Under control conditions, all of the Na+ channels inactivated as a function of time and thus were closed at the end of depolarizing steps. δ-EVIA significantly suppressed time-dependent Na+ channel inactivation, which led to maintenance of an inward Na+ current. The sustained current, measured at the end of depolarizing steps, was 20.7 ± 1.7% (n = 6) of the peak current, and the time corresponding to 50% inactivation of the inactivatable peak current increased 3.6 ± 1.6-fold (n = 6) when compared with controls. δ-EVIA exposure did not significantly alter the amplitude of the peak current and the kinetics of current activation. δ-EVIA also altered the voltage dependence of steady-state Na+ current inactivation (Fig. 3C), as determined using a two-pulse protocol. In the presence of 0.2 μm δ-EVIA, a fraction of the Na+ current (corresponding to the sustained current described above) did not inactivate and remained constant when prehyperpolarizations were more positive than –45 mV. In addition, the toxin shifted the prepulse potential corresponding to 50% steady-state inactivation by –14.9 ± 1.9 mV (n = 4). In contrast, δ-EVIA (0.2 μm) did not affect the voltage dependence of Na+ channel activation, i.e. we did not observe a significant change in peak conductance-voltage relationships (Fig. 3C). δ-EVIA Affects Xenopus Oocyte-Expressed Mammalian Neuronal Na+Channels but Not Skeletal and Cardiac Muscle Na+Channels—The selectivity of δ-EVIA for vertebrate neuronal Na+ channels was confirmed by the results of its effects on several heterologously expressed rat neuronal Na+ channels (subtypes rNaV1.2a, rNaV1.3, and rNaV1.6) that are typical of the central nervous system. Under control conditions, Na+ currents fully inactivated, i.e. the ratio of the sustained current at the end of depolarizing steps (Is) to the peak current (Ip) was <1%. The addition of 10 μm δ-EVIA inhibited Na+ current inactivation in the three neuronal channel subtypes (Fig. 4) without affecting the amplitude of the peak current. In the presence of δ-EVIA, the Is/Ip ratios for rNaV1.2a, rNaV1.3, and rNaV1.6 were 11.1 ± 2.1% (n = 3), 3.7 ± 0.23% (n = 3), and 5.6 ± 0.14% (n = 3), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, δ-EVIA did not affect the rat skeletal muscle (rNaV1.4) and the human cardiac muscle (hNaV1.5) Na+ channel subtypes. δ-EVIA (5 μm) was also tested on rNaV1.4 channels expressed in HEK 293 cells as previously described (31Chen H. Gordon D. Heinemann S.H. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 439: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), yielding no effect in the time course of inactivation. Thus, we conclude that in the range of concentrations used, δ-EVIA has a predominant effect on neuronal Na+ channels in vertebrates. Binding Studies with Rat Brain Synaptosomes—Toxins that inhibit Na+ channel inactivation bind to either receptor site 3 or 6 of Na+ channels (4Cestèle S. Catterall W.A.

Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 269-276Google Scholar). Its double-stranded RNA genome of 6277 bp encodes two polypeptides, a major 100-kDa capsid protein (Gag) and a minor 190-kDa fusion protein (Gag-Pol) via a –1 ribosomal frameshift (2Li L. Wang A.L.

The coding region in GLV (+)-strand RNA is flanked by a 367-nucleotide (nt) 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and a 301-nt 3′-UTR. The ability of purified GLV to infect and the capability of its (+)-stranded RNA to transfect G. lamblia trophozoites, resulting in intracellular proliferation of infectious GLV particles, are the major distinguishing features of this virus among the totiviruses (1Wang A.L.

Chimeric mRNA containing a full-length firefly luciferase transcript flanked by the 367-nt GLV 5′-UTR and a 2022-nt 3′ terminus of GLV (+)-strand RNA was introduced into GLV-infected Giardia trophozoites via electroporation (4Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Wu C.H. Wang C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4867-4872Google Scholar). The chimeric mRNA thus introduced underwent vigorous replication and transcription, but only a basal level of translation ensued, resulting in an expressed luciferase activity barely above the background level (4Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Wu C.H. Wang C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4867-4872Google Scholar, 7Yu D.C. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 824-834Google Scholar). This relatively poor translation efficiency was, however, enhanced by 5000-fold when the initial 264 nts of the capsid-coding region in GLV mRNA were fused in-frame with, and upstream from, the luciferase mRNA (7Yu D.C. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 824-834Google Scholar). Extensive functional and structural analysis of the 264-nt capsid-coding region revealed several structural and sequence-specific elements that are essential for efficient translation of the chimeric transcript (6Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Botka C.W. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 151-165Google Scholar). A 13-nt downstream box (DB) sequence at position 66–78 that complements a 15-nt sequence (with two gaps) near the 3′-end of Giardia 16 S-like ribosomal RNA was found playing an essential role in translation initiation (see Fig. 8) (6Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Botka C.W. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 151-165Google Scholar). Chemical probing and mutational analysis of MFOLD-predicted secondary structure of the 264-nt sequence revealed also that stem loops I (nts 11–35), II (nts 144–164), III (nts 166–182), and IVA (nts 193–215) all play an indispensable function in translation initiation (5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar). Further-more, a pseudoknot 143 nts downstream from the initiation codon formed between a pentanucleotide sequence downstream of stem loop IVA and the loop sequence of stem loop II turned out also essential (8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar). This is a novel structure as it incorporates two additional stems in the loop region between stem II and the pseudoknot stem. Increasing or decreasing the distance between the pseudoknot and initiation codon results in complete loss of translation, suggesting that the position of AUG upstream of the secondary structure cannot be changed and still maintain optimal translation initiation (8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar). The observation suggested that initiation of translation of GLV mRNA is by a mechanism of internal ribosomal entry without ribosome scanning from the 5′-end of mRNA, and thus the 264-nt sequence could function as an element of the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). The presence of IRES elements in the 5′-UTRs of viral transcripts has been well documented in the past (9Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar, 10Jackson R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 127-184Google Scholar, 11Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Google Scholar). It was initially identified exclusively in the 5′-UTRs of transcripts of picornaviruses (12Jang S.K. Krausslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Google Scholar, 13Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Google Scholar) and subsequently in hepatitis C virus (14Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Iizuka N. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Google Scholar, 15Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Kettinen H.J. Grace K. Clarke B.E. Carroll A.R. Rowlands D.J. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6010-6020Google Scholar), classical swine fever virus (16Poole T.L. Wang C. Popp R.A. Potgieter L.N. Siddiqui A. Collet M.S. Virology. 1995; 206: 750-754Google Scholar, 17Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Google Scholar), and several other viruses (for review, see Ref. 11Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Google Scholar). Recently, IRES elements have also been identified in several mRNAs from animal cells (for review, see Ref. 18Carter M.S. Kuhn K.M. Sarnow P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 615-636Google Scholar). The long and uncapped 5′-UTRs containing IRES elements have usually complex secondary and tertiary structural features that facilitate recruitment of translation machinery by internal entry. These complex structures impair cap-mediated ribosome recruitment as they present significant obstacles to a scanning ribosome (9Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar, 11Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Google Scholar). Insertion of picornaviral 5′-UTR between the two cistrons of a dicistronic construct led to the definitive demonstration that this region was able to confer internal initiation of translation of the downstream cistron, independent of the 5′-end sequence (12Jang S.K. Krausslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Google Scholar, 13Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Google Scholar). There is, however, no requirement of the downstream picornaviral coding region for IRES function, and the 5′-UTR alone is sufficient to drive the translation of the downstream cistron (19Hunt S.L. Kaminski A. Jackson R.J. Virology. 1993; 197: 801-807Google Scholar, 20Meerovitch K. Nicholson R. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5895-5901Google Scholar). In our previous investigation, the potential involvement of the 5′-UTR of GLV mRNA in translation initiation was not clear, as it initiated little translation of the downstream reporter by itself (7Yu D.C. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 824-834Google Scholar). It remains thus possible that a portion of the 5′-UTR or the entire 5′-UTR is also a part of the GLV IRES. In this study we expressed the in vitro transcripts of dicistronic cDNA constructs in Giardia and demonstrated further inclusion of a 253-nt downstream portion of the 5′-UTR in the IRES resulting in an overall 517-nt IRES extending to both sides of the initiation codon at an approximately equal distance. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a viral IRES that extends to both sides of the initiation codon. Construction of Dicistronic Viral Vectors—In the monocistronic viral cDNA vector the reporter gene was flanked by the 367-nt GLV 5′-UTR plus the 264-nt capsid-coding region at the 5′-end and the 2022-nt 3′ terminus of GLV cDNA at the 3′-end (8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar). In the dicistronic construct a second reporter is placed downstream of the first reporter gene separated by a DNA fragment encoding the potential IRES. The wild-type monocistronic plasmid pC631-luc, containing the firefly luciferase gene (Fluc) (7Yu D.C. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 824-834Google Scholar), was replaced by the Renilla luciferase gene (Rluc) excised from pNull-Rluc (Promega) as a HindIII/XhoI fragment with an inframe fusion to the 264-nt capsid-coding region of pC631 to generate pC631Rluc. Full-length Fluc cDNA carrying varying lengths of the upstream extension from its 5′-end (the GLV 5′-UTR plus the 264-nt capsid-coding region; UTRCod) was amplified by PCR using pC631-luc as template. These amplified fragments, initially cloned in pGEM-T-easy vector and digested with XhoI/EcoRI, were each cloned into pC631Rluc downstream from the Rluc gene to generate the dicistronic plasmids. Each plasmid construct was verified by DNA sequencing. For specific mutations in the IRES, PCR amplification of the UTR-Cod-Fluc region from previously constructed mutant monocistronic plasmids was performed (5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar, 8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar). The fragments thus amplified, initially cloned into pGEM-T-easy vectors and excised as XhoI/EcoRI fragments, were each cloned into the XhoI/EcoRI site of the monocistronic pC631Rluc plasmid to generate the corresponding dicistronic plasmids. For mutations in the IRES driving the first cistron, the Fluc gene in various mutant pC631-luc monocistronic plasmids was replaced by the Rluc gene to generate the corresponding mutant monocistronic pC631Rluc plasmids. The XhoI/EcoRI UTRCod-Fluc fragment excised from the dicistronic pC631Rluc-UTRCod-Fluc was cloned into the XhoI/EcoRI site in each of the mutant pC631Rluc plasmids to generate the corresponding dicistronic plasmid. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the 5′-UTR sequence was carried out essentially as described previously (5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar) using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Individual mutations were each verified by DNA sequencing. A stem U2 disruption, mutation U2, was made by altering GG at position 101/102 to CC. This mutation in a monocistronic construct resulted in an increase of luciferase activity to 148% of the wild-type level. 2S. Garlapati and C. C. Wang, submitted for publication. Another disruptive St5 mutation in stem U5, made by substituting CC at position 317/318 with GG and AU at position 321/322 with CC, was found to decrease the luciferase activity to 0.2% of the wild-type level in a monocistronic construct. 3S. Garlapati and C. C. Wang, unpublished data. In Vitro Transcription—The monocistronic and dicistronic plasmids were each linearized with NruI at the 3′-end of GLV genomic cDNA and used as template for in vitro synthesis of transcripts using a MegaScript T7 transcription kit (Ambion). Transfection of Giardia Trophozoites—The in vitro transcripts of various GLV monocistronic and dicistronic chimeric cDNAs were each introduced into the GLV-infected WB strain of Giardia trophozoites by electroporation as described previously (4Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Wu C.H. Wang C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4867-4872Google Scholar, 5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar). Approximately 4 × 106 trophozoites were transfected with 100 μg of the in vitro transcript. Mutant and wild-type transcripts were each used in triplicates for the transfection study in duplicated experiments. Luciferase Assay—The transfected Giardia trophozoites were incubated in culture medium at 37 °C for 18 h, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously for monocistronic transcript transfectants (4Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Wu C.H. Wang C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4867-4872Google Scholar). For the dicistronic transcript transfectants, Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and firefly luciferase (Fluc) activities were assayed using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two enzyme activities from each transfectant in triplicates from two to three independent transfection experiments were examined and compared with the respective control transfectant. Luciferase activity was calculated in relative light units (RLU)/μg of crude lysate protein determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from the transfected G. lamblia GLV-infected WB trophozoites 18 h post-transfection as described previously (22Furfine E.S. White T.C. Wang A.L. Wang C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7453-7467Google Scholar) and used for Northern blots by standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 202-203Google Scholar). A HindIII/XhoI fragment from pC631-Fluc containing the Fluc gene sequence (7Yu D.C. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 824-834Google Scholar) was labeled using Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and used as the probe. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 12 h, and the blots were washed under high stringency followed by autoradiography with an exposure time from 12 to 72 h (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 202-203Google Scholar). Expression of the in Vitro Transcripts of Dicistronic Plasmids in Transfected Giardia—Dicistronic plasmids containing the coding regions for Renilla and firefly luciferases as the first and second cistrons, respectively, were constructed, and their in vitro transcripts were expressed in the transfected Giardia. Among the constructs presented in Fig. 1, the 5′-end upstream from the coding region of Rluc contained the GLV 5′-UTR and the 264-nt capsid-coding region. The control construct pC631Rluc-Fluc had the two tandem reporters separated by only 10 nts between the stop codon of the first and the start codon of the second, which placed them also in two different reading frames. Only a background Fluc activity (75.5 ± 2.2 RLU/μg of protein) was detected in the lysate of Giardia trophozoites transfected with the transcript of this construct, whereas the Rluc activity amounted to 18,487 ± 1210 RLU/μg of protein in the same lysate. A ratio between the two activities (Fluc/Rluc) of 4 ± 0.3 × 10–3 is thus taken as the negative control value indicating no internal initiation of translation of the Fluc-coding region in the transcript (Fig. 1). When either the GLV 5′-UTR (pC631Rluc-UTR-Fluc) or the 264-nt capsid-coding region (pC631Rluc-Cod-Fluc) was introduced between the two cistrons, lysates from the transcript-transfected cells showed Fluc/Rluc ratios of 0.4 ± 0.1 × 10–3 and 1.0 ± 0.2 × 10–3, respectively (Fig. 1). Apparently, neither the 5′-UTR nor the 264-nt capsid-coding region alone can fulfill the function of an IRES. When both the 5′-UTR and the coding region were placed between the two open reading frames (pC631Rluc-UTR-Cod-Fluc), however, the Fluc activity in the lysate of transfected cells was increased to 17,489 ± 666 RLU/μg of protein, 240-fold of the background (as compared with pC631Rluc-Fluc negative control), resulting in a Fluc/Rluc ratio of 946 ± 36 × 10–3 (Fig. 1). The GLV IRES thus most likely includes the 264-nt coding region and a portion of or the entire 5′-UTR as well. To exclude the possibility that the enhanced translation of the second cistron in pC631Rluc-UTRCod-Fluc transcript could be due to a cleavage of the dicistronic transcript, Northern blot analysis was performed on levels and sizes of the transcripts in transfected cells at the time of luciferase assays (18 h after transfection). There were no shortened transcripts containing the second Fluc cistron detectable even after a prolonged exposure of the Northern blots up to 72 h (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2–5), nor was there any appreciable discrepancy in the levels of transcripts between the negative control (pC631Rluc-Fluc; Fig. 2, A and B, lane 2) and the other three dicistronic transcripts (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3–5), suggesting a similar stability among them inside the transfected Giardia cells.Fig. 2Northern blotting analysis showing the integrity and similar level of various dicistronic transcripts in the transfected cells. [α-32P]Fluc DNA was used as probe. By 18 h after electroporation, total RNA was extracted from the Giardia trophozoites transfected with transcripts from pC631-Fluc (lane 1), pC631Rluc-Fluc (lane 2), pC631Rluc-UTR-Fluc (lane 3), pC631Rluc-Cod-Fluc (lane 4), pC631Rluc-UTRCod-Fluc (lane 5), and pC631Rluc (lane 6). The luciferase chimeric RNA from the monocistronic pC631-luc (4.2 kb) is indicated on the left, and the sizes of the rRNAs are indicated on the right side of the figure. The blots were exposed for 12 h (panel A) and 72 h (panel B), respectively. Panel C shows the ethidium bromide-stained RNA bands in corresponding lanes used as sampling controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Deletion Analysis of the 5′-UTR—With the apparent involvement of 5′-UTR in IRES, we analyzed the secondary structure of 5′-UTR with MFOLD prediction (24Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Google Scholar). A predicted structure with estimated ΔG of –138.63 kcal/mol contains 8 stem loops designated as stem loops U1 (nts 1–27), U1a (nts 28–65), U2 (nts 99–119), U3 (nts 134–164), U4a (nts 204–219), U4b (nts 221–261), U4c (nts 263–292), and U5 (nts 314–344), respectively (Fig. 3). To provide a preliminary view on whether any of the structural elements is required for the IRES function, we made a series of deletions in the 5′-UTR by the positions of these predicted stem loops in plasmid pC631Rluc-UTRCod-Fluc (see Fig. 1). Thus, pC631Rluc-82–367Cod-Fluc and pC631Rluc-92–367Cod-Fluc both have stem loops U1 and U1a deleted, but the transcripts from these constructs retained the translation efficiency in Giardia (Fig. 4). These two stem loops are thus nonessential for the viral IRES. Plasmid pC631Rluc-102–367Cod-Fluc has the stem in stem loop U2 shortened by 4 bp, and pC631Rluc-114–367Cod-Fluc has the stem loop U2 structure destroyed. However, the transcripts from the two constructs were expressed at the wild-type level in transfected Giardia (Fig. 4), suggesting that stem loop U2 is also not required by the IRES. Nonetheless, upon a further deletion of 12 more nucleotides (pC631Rluc-126–367Cod-Fluc), which retains still U3, U4a, U4b, U4c, and U5 intact, translation of the transcript in Giardia was reduced to 15% of the wild type (Fig. 4). The upstream boundary of the IRES thus lies apparently somewhere between nts 114 and 126 in the 5′-UTR. Without further deletion analysis, these data enabled us to conclude that the 5′-UTR portion of the IRES contains a stretch of 253 nucleotides from nt 114 to 367, which, upon inclusion of the downstream 264-nucleotide capsid-coding region of the IRES, constitutes an IRES of 517 nucleotides with the initiation codon located at the center.Fig. 4Fluc expression in Giardia WB trophozoites transfected with pC631Rluc-UTRCod-Fluc transcripts carrying varying deletions in the 5′-UTR of the IRES. The extent of each deletion is indicated by positions of the nucleotides in the designated construct. Transfected cells were harvested 18 h after electroporation, and the Rluc and Fluc activities were assayed. Efficiency of IRES activity is expressed as described for Fig. 1. The Rluc activity recorded in the experiments stayed relatively unchanged as described for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To verify that the estimated upper boundary of IRES was indeed correct and that the U3, U4a, U4b, U4c, and U5 stem loop structures are all essential for the IRES function, pC631Rluc-176–367Cod-Fluc, which has U1, U1a, U2, and U3 missing, and pC631Rluc-278–367Cod-Fluc, which has only U5 remaining, were also constructed (see Fig. 3). Their transcripts were translated in Giardia to 4 and 0.4% of the wild-type level, respectively (Fig. 4). To further confirm that the U2 stem loop structure is indeed not required by the IRES, a construct of pC631Rluc-U2M-CodFluc was prepared from pC631Rluc-82–367-Cod-Fluc, in which 101GG102 in stem U2 was converted to 101CC102 to destroy the stem structure (see Fig. 3). Translation of its transcript in Giardia reached a Fluc/Rluc ratio of 899 ± 40 × 10–3, which is close to the wild-type ratio of 946 ± 36 × 10–3 (Fig. 4). There is thus little doubt that the U2 stem loop structure is not required by the IRES. Northern blotting analysis of the transcripts extracted from transfected cells indicated that there were no significant differences in the levels of transcripts among the control (pC631Rluc-UTRCod-Fluc) and the truncated mutant transcripts (see Supplementary Fig. I). The absence of any visible shortened transcripts upon prolonged exposure of the blots indicates also that these transcripts were of similar stability and integrity inside the transfected Giardia. The decreased expression of luciferase activities with increasing deletions in the 5′-UTR is thus most likely attributed to a reduced translation. Specific Mutations either in the 5′-UTR or in the Capsid-coding Region That Abolish IRES Activity—To further verify that translation of the second cistron depends on the intercistronic IRES sequence, we introduced to it the previously characterized mutations in the 264-nt capsid-coding region known to disrupt translation initiation (5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar). In this region of the IRES, we introduced mutations G16C, which destabilizes stem loop I, DB2, which disrupts the base pairing between the DB and the anti-DB sequences, and T160C, which destabilizes stem loop II in the pseudoknot structure (5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar). In the 5′-UTR of the IRES, we made an St5 mutation that destabilizes stem loop U5 (Fig. 5). In each case, translation of the downstream Fluc was significantly decreased as was observed in the previous study of the monocistronic expression (5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar, 8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar). 4S. Garlapati and C. C. Wang, submitted for publication. However, the translation efficiency of Rluc (the first cistron) remained unaltered. These results demonstrate that translation of the second cistron in a dicistronic transcript depends solely on the function of intercistronic IRES, whereas that of the first cistron is not affected by the IRES at all. Northern blotting analysis of the transcripts presented in Fig. 5 indicated once again little difference in their levels and integrity and confirmed the immediate consequences from individual mutations on translation initiation (see Supplementary Fig. II). IRES Activity Is Independent of Translation of the First Cistron—To demonstrate that the IRES function of the intercistronic UTRCod sequence is not attributed to or affected by translation initiation from the first cistron, we introduced the same type of mutations to the UTRCod sequence upstream from the first cistron while the intercistronic UTRCod sequence remained unchanged. Results from the transcript-transfected cells demonstrated the anticipated disruptive effects from these mutations on the expression of the first cistron (Rluc) (Fig. 6). But the levels of expression of the second cistron (Fluc) remained relatively unchanged in all cases, indicating once again that translation of the second cistron is independent of the first cistron. Again, Northern analysis of the transcripts extracted from the transfected cells was performed with an overexposure as described for Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. I and II. The results showed similar levels and no visible sign of breakdown among the transcripts (data not shown). The Distance between Stem Loop U5 and the Initiation Codon Cannot Be Altered without Inhibiting Translation—Our previous study indicated that the position of the initiation codon with respect to the functionally essential stem loop I in the downstream capsid-coding region could not be changed at all without disrupting translation initiation (8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar). Disruption of stem loop U5 in the 5′-UTR, located 21 nts upstream of the initiation codon, also drastically reduced translation of the transcript from the monocistronic construct pC631-Fluc. 5S. Garlapati and C. C. Wang, unpublished results. It is likely that being flanked by two functionally indispensable stem loops, U5 and I, the precise location of the initiation codon is of critical importance to accommodate the recruited ribosome small subunit for efficient translation initiation. To further verify this working hypothesis, site-directed mutageneses were carried out to either decrease or increase the distance between stem loop U5 and the initiation codon in the monocistronic luciferase transcript for potential effects on translation initiation (Fig. 7). Results from the transcript-transfected cells indicated that by decreasing the distance by 1, 2, 3, or 5 nucleotides there was a drastic loss of translation efficiency to 1.9, 3.4, 0.1, and 0.2% of the wild-type level, respectively (Fig. 7). Similarly, an increase of the distance by 3 or 5 nucleotides reduced the translation efficiency to 13 and 0.1% of the wild-type activity (Fig. 7). These results indicate that like the distance between stem loop I and the initiation codon (8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar), the distance between the stem loop U5 and the initiation codon is also highly precise and inflexible. In this study we expressed the chimeric transcripts instead of the cDNA constructs in Giardia in pursuing the structure-function analysis of GLV IRES. It enabled us to look into potential involvement of the 5′-UTR portion in the IRES without infringing on the involvement of 5′-UTR in transcription initiation (25Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 417-421Google Scholar). The results provided a clear demonstration that a downstream portion of the 5′-UTR from nt 114 to 367 plus the downstream 264-nt capsid-coding region constitute the viral IRES comprising a full sequence of 517 nts. This combination of a portion of upstream 5′-UTR and a long stretch of downstream coding region in forming an IRES has not been, to our knowledge, reported previously among other viral mRNAs. The expression of dicistronic transcripts in Giardia in our study helped also verifying the true identity of the IRES, which is capable of initiating translation while located at an internal position in the mRNA. Its function is unaffected by the translation or the lack of translation of the upstream cistron. It is a bona fide, albeit unique, IRES. The precise upstream boundary of the IRES can be only identified within a region between nts 114 and 126 in the 5′-UTR at the present time. The sequence of this region 114CUGCUAGAUUCGC126 was not predicted to be involved in any secondary structure by MFOLD (Fig. 3), and stem U3 is still 6 nucleotides downstream from it. Apparently, the sequence between nts 114 and 126 plays an important role in the function of IRES in initiating translation in Giardia. The actual presence of all the MFOLD-predicted secondary structures in 5′-UTR (Fig. 3) has been verified by chemical modification followed by primer extension in our recent studies. 6S. Garlapati and C. C. Wang, submitted for publication. We then conducted specific site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt these individual secondary structures and restore them in changed sequences. Our data suggest that stem loops U3, U4b, U4c, and U5 (but not U1, U1a, U2, or U4a) are all essential for the IRES function but that the space they occupy and their sequences are not. 7S. Garlapati and C. C. Wang, submitted for publication. An extension of ∼253 nts upstream and 264 nts downstream from the initiation codon to constitute the IRES suggests that the secondary structure of the IRES flanking the initiation codon at the center may constitute a suitable physical arrangement for efficient ribosome recruiting and translation initiation. Results from our previous investigation (8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar) and the current study, both showing an inflexibility of the location of the initiation codon between stem loops U5 and I, lend support to this elucidation. These observations suggest that there is little ribosome scanning prior to AUG recognition and that the structures surrounding the initiation codon, stem loops U5 and I, may play a major role in precisely positioning the ribosome onto the AUG codon. The spacing (including the AUG triplet itself) between the two stem loop structures is 31 nts, which could provide a suitable structural environment for accommodating a ribosome small subunit to the initiator AUG (Fig. 8). An experiment on Giardia small ribosome subunit protection of this specific RNA region will be performed to verify the point in the future. Direct recruitment of ribosome by IRES to the initiation codon has been also reported in hepatitis C virus (HCV) (17Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Google Scholar) and cricket paralysis virus (26Jan E. Sarnow P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 324: 889-902Google Scholar) despite the fact that these IRESs are confined exclusively within the 5′-UTR. Pseudoknot structures present in the IRESs of HCV (27Wang C. Le S.Y. Ali N.

A. 2000; 97: 1512-1515Google Scholar) were found to play essential functions for precise positioning of ribosome onto the initiation codon. In HCV IRES, domain IIIb interacts with the initiation factor eIF3 (29Buratti E. Tisminetzky S. Zotti M. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3179-3187Google Scholar, 30Sizova D.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4775-4782Google Scholar) and plays a role in translation initiation after the 48 S complex formation (17Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Google Scholar) suggesting that the overall structure of the IRES plays an active role in internal initiation in this virus (31Encarnacion M. Ramos R. Lafuente E. deq Uinto S.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 973-984Google Scholar). The overall complex secondary structures identified in the GLV IRES (Fig. 8) play also an essential function in translation initiation (Fig. 3) (5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar, 8Garlapati S. Wang C.C. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 601-611Google Scholar). The essential complex structural elements in the downstream region, including stem loop I, DB, stem loops II, III, and IVA, and a pseudoknot, have not yet been observed among other viruses. These elements could be involved in the downstream events after a successful binding of the ribosome to the initiation codon followed by formation of the 80 S initiation complex (32Dmitriev S.E. Pisarev A.V. Rubtsova M.P. Dunaevsky Y.E. Shatsky I.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 99-104Google Scholar). Movement of the ribosome complex would require melting stem loop I with help from initiation factors with RNA helicase activity. 8L. Li and C. C. Wang, submitted for publication. Once the translating ribosome complex moves past the sequence involving stem loop I, the latter needs to refold into its original structure for another round of translation initiation. One could speculate that the DB sequence and the pseudoknot structure would pause the translating ribosome so as to allow sufficient time for stem loop I to refold into its original shape. Alternatively, the pseudoknot could retard the downstream movement of ribosome for a sound and error-proof recognition of the initiation codon (33Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Google Scholar). Among examples of the IRES in other viruses, hepatitis C virus requires, however, a 12–30-nt viral polyprotein-coding sequence for efficient IRES-mediated translation initiation (15Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Kettinen H.J. Grace K. Clarke B.E. Carroll A.R. Rowlands D.J. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6010-6020Google Scholar, 34Hwang L.H. Hsieh C.L. Yen A. Chung Y.L. Chen D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 455-460Google Scholar). Deletion of the adenosine-rich domain near the 5′-end of CAT reporter sequence or insertion of a stable hairpin structure between HCV IRES and CAT sequences substantially reduced IRES-mediated translation. Mutational analysis of the inserted protein-coding sequences demonstrated no requirement for either a specific nucleotide- or amino acid-coding sequence to restore an efficient IRES-mediated translation (35Rijnbrand R. Bredenbeek P. Haasnoot P.C. Kieft J.S. Spaan W.J.M. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 585-597Google Scholar). Similar observations were also made in classical swine fever virus, wherein the inclusion of 17 or more codons of the viral coding sequence downstream from the 5′-UTR exhibited a full IRES activity. With only 12 codons, however, the activity was ∼66% of the maximum in vitro (36Fletcher S.P. Ali I.K. Kaminiski A. Digard P. Jackson R.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1558-1571Google Scholar). In contrast, efficient IRES activity was reported with constructs containing only 3–8 nts of HCV-coding sequences placed between the IRES and a downstream sequence encoding a reporter protein (14Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Iizuka N. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Google Scholar, 37Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3338-3344Google Scholar, 38Rijnbrand R. Brendenbeek P. van der Straten T. Whetter L. Inchauspe G. Lemon S. Spann W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 115-119Google Scholar). The role of these coding sequences in translation initiation remains, however, unclear. By placing a hairpin structure (ΔG = –18 kcal/mol) in the HCV IRES downstream of the AUG codon, an inhibitory effect on translation initiation was observed (35Rijnbrand R. Bredenbeek P. Haasnoot P.C. Kieft J.S. Spaan W.J.M. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 585-597Google Scholar), whereas a stable stem loop I (ΔG = –12 kcal/mol) in the capsid-coding region of the GLV IRES was found to be essential for translation initiation (5Garlapati S. Chou J. Wang C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 623-638Google Scholar). These apparent contradictions remain unexplained. Ironically, the presence of IRES within the coding region of eukaryotic cellular mRNA has been recently demonstrated. Two PITSLRE protein kinase isoforms, p110PITSLRE and p58PITSLRE, are translated from a single transcript. The second protein is resulted from an internal initiation of translation that is enhanced upon down-regulation of eIF4E in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (39Cornelis S. Bruynooghe Y. Denecker G. van Huffel S. Tinton S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Google Scholar). In a recent publication by Komar et al. (40Komar A.A. Lesnik T. Cullin C. Merrick W.C. Trachsel H. Altmann M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1199-1209Google Scholar), the mRNA encoding Ure2p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to possess an IRES that synthesizes an N-terminally truncated active form of the protein that is independent of eIF4E. The URE2 IRES, tentatively localized between nts 203 and 368, has the initiation codon contained at nts 280–282 and thus provides an example of IRES in a cellular mRNA that extends to both sides of the initiation codon very much like GLV IRES. Our identification of a novel IRES element in GLV may yet carry an additional biological significance. The dependence of GLV on a downstream sequence for translation could reflect one of the uniquely primitive features of the translation machinery operating in its host, Giardia. The cellular mRNAs in this primitive protozoan have very short 5′-UTR in the range of 0–14 nts (41Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Google Scholar). In the absence of a substantial 5′-UTR, how mRNA molecules can recruit the 40 S ribosome subunit to the precise decoding region to initiate translation has not been clearly understood. 9L. Li and C. C. Wang, submitted for publication. The GLV transcript is translated by the same machinery as the cellular mRNA of Giardia, and translation of the viral mRNA is known to exert no inhibitory effect on translation of cellular mRNA (1Wang A.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 269-276Google Scholar). Insights obtained from the mechanism of translation initiation on GLV IRES may shed light on whether the cellular mRNA in Giardia could also depend on similar elements present downstream of the initiation codon for translation initiation. Thus, translation of GLV transcript may serve as a model system for understanding the translation initiation mechanisms in this most primitive and one of the earliest diverging and living eukaryotes known to man.

https://openalex.org/W1967030938,"In response to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or cAMP-elevating agents (forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine), mouse B16 melanoma cells underwent differentiation characterized by increased melanin biosynthesis. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of melanogenesis during differentiation has not yet been clearly understood. Phospholipase D (PLD) has been reported to be involved in differentiation. This enzyme cleaves phosphatidylcholine upon stimulation with stimuli to generate phosphatidic acid. In the current study, the involvement of PLD in the regulation of melanogenesis characteristic of differentiation was examined using mouse B16 melanoma cells. Treatment of B16 cells with alpha-MSH was found to cause marked decreases in the PLD1 activity concurrent with its reduced protein level. Moreover, treatment of exogenous bacterial PLD also inhibited alpha-MSH-induced melanogenesis. To further investigate the role of PLD1 in the regulation of melanogenesis, we examined the effects of overexpression of PLD1 on melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells. The B16 cells overexpressing PLD were prepared by transfection with the vector containing the cDNA encoding PLD1. The melanin contents in PLD1-overexpressing cells (B16/PLD1) were observed to be lower compared with those in the vector control cells (B16/Vec), concomitant with the decreases in both activity and protein level of tyrosinase, a key regulatory enzyme in melanogenesis. Moreover, overexpression of PLD1 resulted in a marked inhibition of melanogenesis induced by alpha-MSH. The inhibition of melanogenesis was well correlated with the decrease in the tyrosinase activity associated with its expression. These results indicated that PLD1 negatively regulated the melanogenic signaling by modulating the expression of tyrosinase in mouse B16 melanoma cells."

Functional interactions between different proteins provide a plausible explanation for the discrepancy between the limited number of individual genes and the huge number of well defined functional phenotypes in biological systems. Strategies, which allow for the identification of functional interactions between a target protein and unknown partners are of utmost importance to efficiently scrutinize the functional genome. A powerful approach for this is provided by the use of yeast at the level of orthologue search of human disease genes and as a genetic toolkit for hybrid-protein interactions but with the known limitations based on the archaic functional architecture of yeast if compared with animals. Caenorhabditis elegans is an animal system allowing for straightforward genetic approaches for the functional analysis of single genes, i.e. double-stranded RNA interference for knocking out single or multiple genes (1Kamath R.S.

The cooperation between the two proteins led to the reduction of the voltage-dependent inactivation of the IClnN2-induced ion current when reconstituted in lipid bilayers (6Furst J. Ritter M.

Now we will attempt to test the hypothesis that a functional interaction between operon-bound proteins on the level of nematode cells can also be extrapolated to the human system. Blumenthal et al.

Nature. 2002; 417: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) describe the nematode genome as embracing at least 1000 distinct operons containing between two and eight genes. Because we used the operon structure of the nematode genome as an efficient way to identify functional partner proteins, we examined the possible operon structure of genes coding for human orthologues of ion channels in C. elegans to provide a rational starting point for more in-depth analyses aiming to identify the functional entities of complex ion channels in human cells. Ion channels build an interface between the cell interior and the extracellular environment (8Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar) and are increasingly recognized to be responsible for numerous diseases in humans (9Ashcroft F.M. Ion Channels and Disease.

Genet. 2002; 11: 2435-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). 276 different human ion channels were taken from the protein databases SwissProt, TrEMBL (us.expasy.org/sport), and GenBank™ (NCBI). The pairwise sequence alignment of the protein sequences was performed on WormBase release WS95 (WS95; total of 21,341 proteins; www.wormbase.org/db/searches/blat) using BLASTP.OMP-WashU provided from Washington University (St. Louis; blast.wustl.edu). A positive search result was assumed at a p value of <10-2 irrespective of the length of the compared protein sequences. The p value represents the probability that the query-positive match occurred by random. Therefore, small p values are associated with good estimates, which are very unlikely to be random matches. For about 2340 genes an operon association was proven by probing nematode cDNA microarrays (7Blumenthal T. Evans D. Link C.D. Guffanti A. Lawson D. Thierry-Mieg J. Thierry-Mieg D. Chiu W.L. Duke K.

For the putative operons we assumed a distance between the individual genes (intercistronic sequence) of no longer than 1500 bp. This distance was chosen according to already confirmed operons (see below). As stated under “Discussion,” this is no proof for the existence of an operon, and therefore, the existence of these putative operons needs to be confirmed, as on the other site in the case of an intercistronic distance of >1500 bp, which does not exclude the existence of an operon structure.Table IGenomic structure of nematode orthologues of human channel proteinsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table IINematode ion channel genes with an intercistronic distance of ≤300 bp and those structured in known operonsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The nematode strain (N2) used in this work was provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. The nematodes were grown on Escherichia coli strain OP50, harvested, and homogenized. Total RNA was isolated according to standard protocols (13Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1982Google Scholar). RT was performed according to standard protocols (13Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1982Google Scholar) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). For PCR amplifications standard PCR protocols using Taq or Pfu polymerases (Roche Applied Science and Stratagene) were applied according to the manufacturer's protocols. The primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: SL1, 5′-GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGA-3′; SL2, 5′-GGTTTTAACCCAGTTACTCAAG-3′; acr-2, 5′-GAAGACGTTGGATTTGAAGG-3′ (position 479-498); acr-3, 5′-GGGTCCCATTGCATTTGATAA-3′ (first PCR; position 255-275) and 5′-CATTCCATTTCATTGTAGGC-3′ (second, or nested PCR; position 234-253); mrp-1, 5′-CATATTGCACGAGGTCAC-3′ (position 332-349); mrp-2, 5′-TCCGAATTGAACAAGGTCTCC-3′ (first PCR; position 331-351) and 5′-GTTGAGCAGTTCGGGTATGA-3′ (second, or nested PCR; position 177-196). The PCR products obtained were sequenced using an automatic sequencer (LiCor Gene ReadIR 4200) and SequiTherm EXEL-II DNA sequencing kit (Epicenter) with the protocols suggested by the manufacturer. Plasmids and Fusion Proteins—Standard procedures (13Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1982Google Scholar) were used for DNA preparation, cloning, purification, and sequencing. A plasmid coding for a fusion protein of human ICln attached to the N terminus of ECFP (hICln-CFP) was prepared by cloning the open reading frame (ORF) coding for the human ICln in-frame into the vectors pECFP-N1 (Clontech) using the XhoI and BamH1 restriction sites. A plasmid coding for a fusion protein of HSPC038 attached to the C terminus of EYFP (YFP-HSPC038) was prepared by cloning the ORF coding for HSPC038 in-frame into the vector pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) using the XhoI and BamH1 restriction sites. All constructs were sequenced using an automated sequencer (Gene ReadIR 4200, LiCor). For all FRET experiments ECFP served as a donor, and EYFP as an acceptor (14Ritter M. Ravasio A. Jakab M. Chwatal S. Furst J. Laich A. Gschwentner M. Signorelli S. Burtscher C. Eichmuller S. Paulmichl M. J. Biol.

Transfected cells were superfused at room temperature (20-23 °C) with phosphate-buffered saline (136.9 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 3.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Visualization of ECFP- and/or EYFP-expressing cells and detection of FRET was performed on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a monochromator (Polychrome 4, TILL Photonics) and a cooled CCD camera (TILL Imago SVGA) controlled by TILL Vision software (versions 4.01). Experiments were either performed by changing three separate Olympus BX cubes equipped with the appropriate filter combinations for ECFP, EYFP, and FRET measurements or by using a CFP/YFP dual-band polychroic mirror in combination with a real time dual color imaging device (Dual-View™, Optical Insights). All images were adjusted to pixel-by-pixel alignment and corrected for background autofluorescence, which was then clamped to zero (14Ritter M. Ravasio A. Jakab M. Chwatal S. Furst J. Laich A.

Acceptor Photobleaching—Light from a xenon lamp (XBO 75, Osram) was passed through a 515-nm cut-off filter toward the object. The FRET efficiency was calculated from the increase in ECFP intensity after partial bleaching of EYFP according to the formula calFRETeff=1-(ICFP-bg0/ICFP-bgt) In addition, FRET efficiency was extrapolated to the total bleaching of EYFP according to equations, exFRETeff=1-(αICFP-bg0/(ICFP-bgtβICFP-bg0)) α=1-β β=(IYFP-bgt/IYFP-bg0) where ICFP-bg and IYFP-bg are the background-corrected gray-value densities of ECFP and EYFP, respectively, measured before (suffix 0) and t min (suffix t) after bleaching of EYFP (14Ritter M.

The FRET efficiency image (Fig. 2c) was generated using Equation 2 on a pixel-to-pixel calculation from the images recorded at time zero and after 2 min. Homologues for the Human Ion Channels in C. elegans—In our study we included the following human channels: (i) sodium channels (epithelial, amiloride-sensitive channels, voltage dependent channels, and nicotinic acetylcholine-receptor-channels), (ii) potassium channels (voltage-gated channels of the Kv, eag, and KCNQ family, calcium-activated channels, inwardly rectifying and ATP-sensitive channels, and channels of the two pore domain family), (iii) calcium channels (voltage-dependent channels, transient receptor potential channel family (TRP), and ligand gated receptor channels), (iv) chloride channels (voltage-gated channels, intracellular channels, calcium-activated channels, channels from the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family, channels from the γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and glycine receptor family, and other channels), (v) cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, (vi) aquaporines, (vii) gap-junction-forming channels, and (viii) other channels. These eight channel families consist of 276 different human ion channels listed in GenBank™ for which the respective nematode orthologues were identified using a pairwise sequence alignment of the protein sequences with a p value <10-2, as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” For the 10 voltage-dependent sodium channels (Nav1.1 to Nav1.9 and Nax) the only nematode orthologues that could be identified were egl-19 and cca-1, which are both identified as calcium channels and are, therefore, not included in our listing. For the remaining 266 human channel proteins a total number of 235 nematode orthologues were identified (88.3%) based on a p value of <10-2. From these 235 nematode orthologues 82.6% demonstrate a p value of ≤10-40, 12.3% demonstrate a p value of ≤10-10 and >10-40, and 5.1% demonstrate a p value of ≤10-2 and >10-10. These 235 nematode orthologues consist of 80 individual proteins, since different human ion channels correspond to the same nematode protein. A p value of <10-2 is no proof that the respective nematode orthologue is indeed a member of the same functional protein group. However, in 63.8% of the 80 nematode orthologues the respective human homologue can be obtained if the similarity search is performed by starting with the nematode protein and searching for the respective human orthologue. This value is slightly higher than the values of 44% reported for a random collection of human cDNA (16Wheelan S.J. Boguski M.S. Duret L. Makalowski W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the value of ≈42% reported for human disease genes (17Culetto E. Sattelle D.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), or the value of 50% predicted by Ahringer (18Ahringer J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), pointing to the possibility that within the ion channel families in different species a higher sequence similarity is maintained with respect to other functional protein groups. Therefore, we presume that the respective nematode orthologues of human ion channel genes listed in Table I provide good support for the hypothesis that the corresponding proteins act in the same functional compartments. This is further supported by the fact that for 31.3% of the nematode orthologues (25 proteins marked accordingly in Table I) a biophysical characterization was done, demonstrating that the respective proteins are indeed involved in current formation. For the icl-1 protein, the nematode homologue of the ICln protein, known as a channel-forming protein involved in volume regulation in mammalian cells (19Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickmann K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the direct channel-forming aptitude was proven by the reconstitution of the protein in lipid bilayer (6Furst J. Ritter M.

Ion Channels Organized in Nematode Operons—An operon is a gene cluster transcribed from a single promoter located upstream of its 5′-end. During transcription or shortly thereafter monocistronic mRNAs are processed from the polycistronic pre-mRNA and trimmed by trans-splicing (11Blumenthal T. Gleason K.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The latter process adds splice leaders (SL) at the respective 5′-ends of the monocistronic mRNAs. The SL sequences come in two forms, one termed SL1, which are short sequences of about 22 nucleotides added at the mRNA from the leading gene in the operon, and the second, termed SL2, added at the mRNAs of the downstream gene or genes of the same operon (20Nilsen T.W. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 678-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it was also described that SL1 sequences can lead the downstream gene (21Kato Y. Aizawa T. Hoshino H. Kawano K. Nitta K. Zhang H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The SL2 sequence was used to identify genes clustered in operons by probing whole-genome microarrays, leading to ≈900 operons estimated to contain about 90% of the operons in the nematode genome (7Blumenthal T. Evans D. Link C.D. Guffanti A. Lawson D. Thierry-Mieg J. Thierry-Mieg D. Chiu W.L. Duke K. Kiraly M. Kim S.K. Nature. 2002; 417: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A total of 266 human ion channels were tested comprised of 84 potassium channels, 49 calcium channels, 23 sodium channels, 68 chloride channels, 9 cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, 11 aquaporin channels, 17 gap-junction channels, and 5 other channels (Table I). For these 266 human ion channels 235 nematode orthologues can be identified comprised of 75 potassium channels, 43 calcium channels, 23 sodium channels, 65 chloride channels, 9 cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, 11 aquaporin channels, 5 gap-junction channels, and 4 other channels (Table I). Scrutinizing the nematode genome for potassium channel homologues results in the identification of 51 individual potassium channels, which is well in agreement with the conjecture made by Bargmann (23Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) and Miller (22Miller C. Genome Biology. 2000; http://genomebiology.com/2000/1/4/REVIEWS/0004PubMed Google Scholar) for these channels in nematodes. However, from this huge family only 19 channels show a high similarity to human potassium channels and are included in Table I. A significant likelihood of an operon organization was assumed if in the nematode genome additional potentially expressed gene(s), organized in the same direction, could be identified within an intercistronic distance of ≤1500 bp. As the intercistronic distance we defined the bp located within the end of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the leading gene and the start of the 5′-UTR of the following gene in the potential operon. Because the information on the UTRs was not available for all genes in question, we used (if the respective information was not available) the genomic sequence (bp distance) between the ORF of the leading gene and the following gene as the putative intercistronic distance. This circumstance is marked in Tables I and II as not known (#) or partially known (*). If a second nematode gene is located beyond 1500 bp the information on the respective nematode gene is not included in Table I. As described by Blumenthal et al. (7Blumenthal T. Evans D. Link C.D. Guffanti A. Lawson D. Thierry-Mieg J. Thierry-Mieg D. Chiu W.L. Duke K. Kiraly M. Kim S.K. Nature. 2002; 417: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) the intercistronic distances between the individual genes in an operon are typically clustered around 126 bp; however, several hundred bp are also described, as in the case of the known operons for the ion channels nmr-2 (944 bp) and the pannexin-1 homologue (1390 bp). For 40 different nematode ion channel genes listed in Table I, a second gene can be found within a distance of 1500 bp, and in 36 cases of these 40 ion channel genes (4 genes show overlapping UTRs, and therefore, no classical intercistronic sequence is defined), the intercistronic sequence is particularly rich in uridines (51.5% U content), which is indicative for intercistronic sequences (24Huang T. Kuersten S. Deshpande A.M. Spieth J. MacMorris M. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For some of the ion channel genes in nematode the operon structure has already been established, and the summary of these proteins is provided in Table II. In addition, in this table we also summarize those nematode ion channel genes with an intercistronic distance of ≤300 bp. The mere intercistronic distance of <1500 bp or even shorter distances of <300 bp are of course no proof that the respective genes are indeed organized in operons. For a fast screening for operons the best method is the identification of SL2 sequences attached to the downstream gene in a putative operon cluster (7Blumenthal T. Evans D. Link C.D. Guffanti A. Lawson D. Thierry-Mieg J. Thierry-Mieg D. Chiu W.L. Duke K. Kiraly M. Kim S.K. Nature. 2002; 417: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We used RT-PCR to elucidate a possible operon structure of the two non-α subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (sodium channel) acr-2/acr-3 and the two transmembrane proteins of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins mrp-1/mrp-2 gene-doublets. Indeed, we were able to identify SL2 sequences on the acr-3 as well as on the mrp-2 gene (Fig. 1). On the acr-2 and the mrp-1 genes the SL1 sequence was identified. No SL2 sequences could be found on these genes, demonstrating that the acr-2/acr-3 and the mrp-1/mrp-2 genes are indeed organized in operons. Functional Relation between the Operon-embraced Ion Channel Genes—As recently summarized by Blumenthal and Gleason (11Blumenthal T. Gleason K.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a number of bacterial proteins are clustered in operons, which indeed belong to the same functional pathway (see also Lawrence (5Lawrence J.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 407-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)). A much smaller correlation can be found in C. elegans (11Blumenthal T. Gleason K.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus far, as for ion channels, only two examples are known in which functionally related proteins are encoded within the same operon, i.e. two subunits of the acetylcholine receptor channel, i.e. des-2 and deg-3 (12Treinin M. Gillo B. Liebman L. Chalfie M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15492-15495Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the ICln ion channel (icl-1; the three letter codes extended by a number are the gene names in the nematode genome), which functionally interacts with the Nx protein (6Furst J. Ritter M. Rudzki J. Danzl J. Gschwentner M. Scandella E. Jakab M. Konig M. Oehl B. Lang F. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4435-4445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we propose that scrutinizing the operon structure of the nematode genome could be used to identify partner proteins in an organism as distant from nematode as human. As stated above, we showed that IClnN2, the nematode homologue of the ICln channel, interacts with the nematode Nx protein, and that both proteins are coded within the same operon (6Furst J. Ritter M. Rudzki J. Danzl J. Gschwentner M. Scandella E. Jakab M. Konig M. Oehl B. Lang F. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4435-4445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). According to Table II the human homologue of the nematode IClnN1 and its splice variant IClnN2 is a single gene named CLNS1A, and the human homologue of the nematode Nx is the HSPC038 gene, whose function in human cells is unknown. As shown in Fig. 2a, Nx and HSPC038 have a similar amino acid sequence. However, in contrast to the nematode system, both human genes are not in close genomic vicinity to each other. Whereas the CLNS1A gene in the human genome is located on chromosome 11 at the position 11q13.5, the HSPC038 gene is located on chromosome 8 at position 8q22.3 (Fig. 2b). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 2c, both human gene products are able to elicit FRET-based light emission, which indicates a functional interaction between both proteins. The bleaching of YFP-HSPC038 is paralleled by an increase of the hICln-CFP fluorescence to 107.6 ± 2.0% (n = 8) after 10 min. The calculated FRET efficiency is 6.8 ± 1.7% (n = 8) after 10 min and 9.1 ± 2.1% (n = 8) when extrapolated to total YFP bleaching (Equations 1 and 2, respectively, under “Experimental Procedures”). For the calculation of the FRET efficiency the entire area of the cells was taken, which, however, underestimates the local rise of the FRET efficiency. It is shown in Fig. 2c that the functional interaction leading to the FRET signal between the CLNS1A and the HSPC038 gene products is not distributed homogeneously throughout the cell but, in contrast, is most efficient in the areas of the membrane. Operons were first discovered in bacteria, and because it became obvious that genes encoding proteins from the translational as well as from the transcriptional machinery are clustered in operons in these organisms, it was speculated that the operon organization might be an efficient way to co-regulate genes in the same regulatory pathway (25Nomura M. Cell. 1976; 9: 633-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This concept was sustained by further experimental evidences and furthermore discovered to also be adopted in higher species such as C. elegans (4Spieth J. Brooke G. Kuersten S. Lea K. Blumenthal T. Cell. 1993; 73: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11Blumenthal T. Gleason K.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus far, for ion channels only two examples are known in which functionally related proteins are encoded within the same operon, i.e. two subunits of the acetylcholine receptor channel and the ICln ion channel (icl-1), which functionally interacts with the Nx protein. Treinin et al. (12Treinin M. Gillo B. Liebman L. Chalfie M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15492-15495Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) describe two related subunits of the acetylcholine receptor channel (des-2 and deg-3) that are similar in sequence, encoded by the same operon, and in which only the simultaneous expression of both proteins generates a current in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We recently used the operon structure in nematodes to identify a protein (Nx), which is able to modify the current elicited by the IClnN2 ion channel protein (6Furst J. Ritter M. Rudzki J. Danzl J. Gschwentner M. Scandella E. Jakab M. Konig M. Oehl B. Lang F. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4435-4445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is important to note that these two proteins, unlike the two subunits of the acetylcholine receptor channel, are not related in terms of their sequence. Therefore, we provided the first evidence that by scrutinizing the operon structure of target genes, functional partner-proteins, which are not structurally related, can also be identified in eukaryotes. This finding led to the hypothesis that this approach could be used as a more general gene-finding tool, which is also able to predict functional partner-proteins in the human system. Therefore, we examined, first, the vast family of human ion channels to determine whether or not they could be organized in operons in the nematode genome and, second, if the predicted proteins in the human system really do functionally interact. As can be evidenced by the information given in Table II, for two ion channels (des-2/deg-3 and icl-1/Nx) an operon structure and functional interaction was already reported (11Blumenthal T. Gleason K.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For additional five ion channels, an operon structure can be assumed according to the data provided by the WormBase (see also Table II; the respective operon names are: CEOP5320, CEOPX084, CEOPX032, CEOP5436, and CEOP1108). Here we provide experimental evidence that for two additional candidate genes listed in Table II (the two non-α subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor acr-2/acr-3 and the two transmembrane proteins of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins mrp-1/mrp-2), an organization in operons can be assumed, proving that the information provided in the two tables can indeed help to identify new possible partner proteins for ion channels. In addition we showed that, indeed, the functional interaction of operon-packed genes in nematodes (icl-1/Nx) can be projected onto the human system, leading to the identification of partner proteins in human cells that indeed do functionally interact (CLNS1A/HSPC038). This indicates, that the “operon based partner protein quest (OBPQ),” suggested by us, could be a very efficient gene-finding strategy, which, apart from ion channels, could also be extended to other functional systems.

To answer this question, astronomers should ideally identify a supernova progenitor on pre-supernova images. Unfortunately, no supernova has been definitely discovered by eye in our Galaxy since 1604 A.D. Progenitors have been identified for 6 of the ∼2900 known extragalactic supernovae, but 5 of these 6 supernovae are somewhat peculiar; 2 may not be supernovae at all."
