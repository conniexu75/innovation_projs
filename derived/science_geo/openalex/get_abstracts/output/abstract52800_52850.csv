https://openalex.org/W1898798642,"Abstract The complete primary structure of reduced and S-carboxy-methylated bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase has been derived through analysis of peptides from peptic, plasmin, and hydroxylamine digests of the intact polypeptide chain, and from chymotryptic, subtilisin, and dilute acid digests of derived peptides. From these data, the following unique amino acid sequence of 151 residues was deduced, corresponding to a molecular weight of 15,600, in each of the 2 apparently identical subunits of the protein molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2008833205,"Long-term infusion of amounts of angiotensin insufficient at the beginning to raise arterial pressure results, after several days in sustained arterial hypertension in unanesthetized dogs. This hypertension is to a large degree dependent on environmental stimuli, and results chiefly from increase in peripheral resistance. As in dogs with renal hypertension, there is increased pressor responsiveness to tyramine. This indirect action of angiotensin to increase total peripheral resistance and arterial pressure by an action on the sympathetic nervous system, along with an upward resetting of the carotid sinus buffering mechanism, might logically account for the neural component of chronic renal hypertension. Such a proposal integrates the humoral and neural elements of the mosaic describing the mechanisms of tissue perfusion."

https://openalex.org/W1538991163,"Abstract When the purified sodium and potassium ion-activated ATPase (NaK-ATPase) from Squalus acanthias is added to a sonicated mixture of egg lecithin and cholate and dialyzed, vesicles are formed which trap either glucose or inulin. These vesicles are capable of ATP-dependent 22Na+ uptake. Optimum 22Na+ uptake occurs after 2 days dialysis at 4°. 22Na+ uptake was considerably higher at 25° than at 37°, presumably because of a higher lability of the vesicles at the higher temperature. Optimum incubation time for 22Na+ uptake was 1 to 2 hours. The pH profiles for NaK-ATPase activity and 22Na+ uptake were the same. 22Na+ uptake showed a dependence on the presence of Mg2+ but this dependence was not absolute, presumably because of some bound Mg2+ in the preparation. There was a good parallelism in the nucleotide specificity for the NaK-ATPase reaction and 22Na+ uptake, with ATP being the most effective substrate, UTP the poorest substrate, and CTP showing intermediate activity. Internal, but not external, ouabain inhibited 22Na+ uptake, as would be predicted from other observations in the literature which show that ouabain inhibits only on the side of the membrane opposite to the ATP substrate site. The ATP-dependent, ouabain-inhibitable uptake of 22Na+ was shown to be true active transport of Na+, by forming vesicles in the presence of 22Na+ so that the specific activity and concentration of Na+ were the same on both sides of the membrane. In the presence of external ATP there was an actual increase in the concentration of internal Na+ from 20 mm to 38.4 mm. The ratio of Na+ transported to ATP hydrolyzed was 0.3 to 0.4, which is only 10 to 15% of that reported in intact erythrocytes. In the absence of K+, an Na+-Na+ exchange which was dependent on ATP and inhibited by ouabain could be demonstrated; this is similar to Na+-Na+ exchange demonstrated in erythrocytes and muscle. Na+-Na+ exchange was a small percentage of active Na+ transport in the presence of K+. These observations provide strong evidence that vesicles formed from the purified NaK-ATPase of S. acanthias are capable of active sodium transport and that this transport shows the same properties as sodium transport observed in intact cells such as the erythrocyte."

https://openalex.org/W2024937096,"When newborn hamsters were inoculated subcutaneously with chicken-embryo lethal orphan virus, tumnors developed at the site of inoculation in 23 out of 69 hamsters within 88 to 195 days of inoculation. These tutlnors and tissue cultures, prepared from a primary tumor, were transplantable to newborn and weanling hamsters. The primary tumnors and tissue cultures of a primary tumor were free of demnonstrable infectious virus. The virus is the first ""nonhuman"" adenovirus found to induce tumors in hamsters."

https://openalex.org/W2066238589,"Lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 5 from rabbit skeletal muscle is activated by citrate, cis-aconitate, isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, aspartate, and glutamate. In the presence of these activators the shape of the pyruvate saturation curve is changed from sigmoid to hyperbolic. Lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 1 from rabbit heart gives a hyperbolic pyruvate saturation curve and is not activated by these compounds. Oxalacetate is a competitive inhibitor of both isozyme 5 and isozyme 1 but at low concentration it activates the former. These results indicate that lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 5 from rabbit skeletal muscle is an allosteric protein and a regulatory enzyme, while lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 1 from rabbit heart is apparently neither."
https://openalex.org/W2075294315,"A simple and rapid plaque procedure has been developed for detecting and accurately assaying rubella virus in a noncytopathic virus-cell relationship. Plaque-formation is based on the development, in individual cells infected with rubella virus, of a unique type of intrinsic interference to infection with Newcastle disease virus. Rubella virus—infected cells challenged with Newcastle disease virus and tested for hemadsorption 15 hours later stand out as hemadsorption-negative areas. Individual living cells infected with rubella virus can be resolved under conditions allowing standard cloning procedures. In principle, the hemadsorption-negative plaque test can be used to search for a new class of noncytopathic, nonhemadsorbing viruses—those that induce an intrinsic interference to infection by any hemadsorbing virus."

https://openalex.org/W1578627425,"Abstract An actin-relaxing protein complex was isolated from rat brain synaptosomal membranes by attachment to muscle myosin bound by the surface of polystyrene (Lytron) particles. These particles acquired Mg2+ATPase activity. The brain actin-relaxing protein complex, dissociated from muscle myosin-Lytron complex by ATP, reacted with synaptic vesicles preloaded with [14C]glutamate mediating the release of labeled glutamate and activation of Mg2+ATPase. Both release of 14C and ATPase activity were inhibited by ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and stimulated by addition of 0.4 mm Ca2+. Isolated brain actin-relaxing protein complex conferred Ca2+ sensitivity to muscle myosin in the presence of EGTA. Stimulation of Mg2+ATPase activity and [14C]glutamate release from synaptic vesicles was also generated by a complex of muscle Factin-relaxing protein. The data suggest that contractile proteins are important in mediation of the release of neurotransmitters in brain tissue."
https://openalex.org/W190629016,"The conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides without cleavage of the glycosidic bond is catalyzed by enzymes of bacterial (2-5), avian (6), and mammalian (7-9) origin. The preferred substrates of the ribonucleotide reductase system (or systems) of Escherichiu coli B are ribonucleoside diphosphates (2, 10). Activity has been demonstrated with cytidylates (2), uridylates (3), and purine ribonucleotides (4, 6) although it is not yet clear whether the four ribonucleotides are reduced by one or more enzymes. The CDP reductase system of E. coli B requires ATP, Mg++, and, according to recent purification studies (11, 12), a new low molecular weight heat-stable protein called thioredoxin whose disulfide group is reduced in a preliminary reaction by a TPNHlinked reductase. The resulting disulfhydryl compound serves as actual hydrogen donor in the reduction of CDP. Although thioredoxin has also been shown to function in the reductase system of Novikoff ascites rat hepatoma (8), the universality of this mechanism remains to be determined. An interesting aspect of the ribonucleotide reductase system concerns its physiological role as supplier of precursors for DNA synthesis and the possibility that it possesses an important regulatory function. From experiments showing that the reductase system of chick embryo extract is strongly inhibited by various deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates with different substrates being maximally inhibited by different nucleotides, Reichard, Canellakis, and Canellakis (13) concluded that DNA synthesis may be regulated by the interplay of DNA polymerase, an enzyme requiring all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and ribonucleotide reductase, a system subject to feedback inhibition by these same compounds. Although it is unclear to what extent the inhibitory activity in vitro of deoxyribonucleotides in E. coli B and Novikoff tumor extracts mimics the orderly patterns observed in chick embryo extracts, indirect evidence has suggested that similar inhibitions occur in mammalian cell cultures (14, 15). The present paper shows that the ribonucleotide reductase system of the thymineless mutant E. co&.- is subject to feedback inhibition by a number of deoxyribonucleotides and to a repressor control system that is apparently governed by the intracellular concentration of a thymine derivative."

https://openalex.org/W1916475782,"The rates of rat liver mitochondrial membrane-linked reactions were studied as a function of temperature, with the results being expressed as Arrhenius plots. Energy-dependent reactions involving the adenine nucleotide translocase yielded two distinct discontinuities in their Arrhenius plots, near 17.5° and 27.5°. These reactions include ADP phosphorylation, state 3 and state 4 respiration, uncoupler-stimulated respiration, dinitrophenol-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase and ATP-supported calcium uptake. Energy-dependent reactions not involving the adenine nucleotide translocase also gave two breaks in their Arrhenius plots. The upper break was near 27.5° as before. However, the temperature at which the lower break occurred was decreased to around 12.5°. These reactions included respiration-dependent calcium uptake, valinomycin-induced potassium uptake, and phosphate-induced swelling. Studies with representative matrix, outer membrane, and inner membrane enzymes including the ATPase in sonicated mitochondrial particles indicated that an intact, energy-transducing membrane is required for discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots to appear at any temperature."

The cofactors for this synthesis were shown to be diphosphopyridine nucleotide and Mg+, and when glucose was the substrate ATP was also needed. We have extended these studies, and the present communication presents data on the purification of this system, its properties, and the origin of the carbon atoms of inositol."

https://openalex.org/W1539555655,"Abstract A tryptophan hydroxylase has been purified approximately 20-fold from Chromobacterium violaceum. The enzyme is inducible and it is induced to a greater extent by phenylalanine than by tryptophan. The hydroxylation requires molecular oxygen and a reduced pteridine, and has a further requirement for the addition of a sulfhydryl compound. No evidence for the further metabolism of the product, 5-hydroxy-tryptophan, could be obtained. The enzyme is inhibited by phenylalanine and p-chlorophenylalanine. It acts on d-tryptophan to some extent. The enzyme is different from the phenylalanine hydroxylase also produced by the organism."

https://openalex.org/W1506496535,"Abstract The allosteric behavior of Ca2+-ATPase from Escherichia coli was studied in both soluble and membrane-bound states. At 36° the membrane-bound enzyme presents cooperativity toward two ligands: inhibitor and substrate. A break in the Hill plot for inhibition by Na+ appears at relatively high concentrations of Na+ (60 mm), with values of of 2.1 at lower Na+ and of 0.7 at higher concentrations. In the substrate saturation curves a break is also present with slopes of 0.8 and 2.0 under and over the transition. When the enzyme is released from the membrane, linear plots are obtained over the whole range with n of 1.0 for both inhibitor and substrate. If the temperature of assay is shifted to 19°, opposite effects are encountered: linear plots indicating a lack of cooperativity observed for both effectors in the membranebound enzyme. On the other hand, breaks are present in the case of the soluble enzyme with values of n of 1.8 and 0.8 for inhibitor and of 0.9 and 1.8 for substrate under and over the break point, respectively. The allosteric behavior inherent to the membrane-bound enzyme at both temperatures is regained when the membrane is reconstituted. The membrane reconstitution was carried out by passage through a column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with 1 mm Ca2+. It is clear from these experiments that the membrane acts as an macroeffector in both Na+ inhibition and substrate activation at 36 and 19°. At 36°, the membrane enhances cooperativity shown by the soluble enzyme; at 19° the opposite holds true."

They concomitantly prevent the transformation of myosin into faster-sedimenting products. This is adduced as support for the hypothesis that the strategic sulfhydryl group is not binding adenosine triphosphate at the active site, but is initiating a conformational change upon its reaction with the mercurial reagent."

https://openalex.org/W2063117634,"Antibody mediated cell dependent immune lympholysis (ABCIL), an extremely sensitive serological technique for detecting tissue sensitization, was used in a family segregation study. Two serums capable of demonstrating ABCIL were used to identify members of the family who differed by one HL-A haplotype but whose cells did not stimulate in mixed lymphocyte culture. Absorption study of one serum indicated that the ABCIL reaction of that serum was directed against a factor, independent of HL-A, that might be responsible for lymphocyte stimulation in mixed lymphocyte culture. Thus the ABCIL technique may be used to detect lymphocyte-defined gene products."
