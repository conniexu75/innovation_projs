https://openalex.org/W2086725873,"The primary event in the infection of cells by HIV is the interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, and its cellular receptor, CD4. A recombinant form of gp120 was found to bind to a recombinant CD4 antigen with high affinity. Two gp120-specific murine monoclonal antibodies were able to block the interaction between gp120 and CD4. The gp120 epitope of one of these antibodies was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography of acid-cleaved gp120 and shown to be contained within amino acids 397-439. Using in vitro mutagenesis, we have found that deletion of 12 amino acids from this region of gp120 leads to a complete loss of binding. In addition, a single amino acid substitution in this region results in significantly decreased binding, suggesting that sequences within this region are directly involved in the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1972882396,"On the basis of electrophysiological analysis of Shaker mutants, the Shaker locus of Drosophila melanogaster has been proposed to encode a structural component of a voltage-dependent potassium channel, the A channel. Unlike sodium channels, acetylcholine receptors, and calcium channels, K+ channels have not been purified biochemically. To facilitate biochemical studies of a K+ channel, genomic DNA from the Shaker locus has been cloned. Rearrangements in five Shaker mutants have been mapped to a 60-kilobase segment of the genome. Four complementary DNA clones have been analyzed. These clones indicate that the Shaker gene contains multiple exons distributed over at least 65 kilobases of genomic DNA in the region where the mutations mapped. Furthermore, the gene may produce several classes of alternatively spliced transcripts. Two of the complementary DNA clones have been sequenced and their sequences support the hypothesis that Shaker encodes a component of a K+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W2074571771,"The phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine in vivo and in vitro was examined in 3T3 cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transformed by polyoma middle T antigen (MTAg) by using an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine (P-tyr). Two common events were observed upon PDGF stimulation or MTAg transformation of cells: the appearance in the immunoprecipitates of an 85 kd phosphoprotein, and increased phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity. In PDGF-stimulated cells, the 85 kd phosphoprotein and PI kinase activity appeared rapidly, within 1 min of growth factor addition. The PI kinase activity and 85 kd phosphorylation were also increased in anti-P-tyr immunoprecipitates from cells transformed by v-fms and v-sis, but not by SV40 T antigen. The presence of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 85 kd protein correlated with PI kinase activity during several purification steps. These results suggest that the 85 kd phosphoprotein, a putative PI kinase, is a substrate for both the PDGF receptor and MTAg/pp60c-src tyrosine kinase activities."
https://openalex.org/W2051242500,"The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) contains several open reading frames (ORFs) not present in other viruses. The 'A' gene1, also known as Q2P'3, ORF-14 or sor5, partially overlaps the pol gene; its protein product has a relative molecular mass of 23,000 (Mr 23K) and is present in productively infected cells7–10. The function of this protein is unclear; mutant viruses deleted in 'A' replicate in and kill CD4+ lymphocyte lines8, but the high degree of conservation of the deduced amino-acid sequence in nine different HIV isolates (80%) and the presence of analogous genes in HIV-211 and other lentiviruses suggest that the gene function is an important one. Here we describe a mutant virus deficient in the 'A' gene which produces virion particles normally; however, the particles are & sm;1,000 times less infective than wild type. Transcomplementation experiments partially restore infectivity. The mutant virus spreads efficiently when virus-producing cells are co-cultivated with CD4+ lymphocytes, however, indicating that HIV can spread from cell to cell in a mechanism that does not require the 'A' gene product and probably does not require the production of infective virus particles."
https://openalex.org/W1986694073,"It has previously been shown that a proportion of middle T antigen molecules exist in a stable complex with pp60c-src. Here we show that there appears to be a third component to the complex, a protein of molecular mass 81 kd (p81). p81 was phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine residues in kinase assays performed using immunoprecipitates from polyoma virus-transformed cells and antibodies to both middle T and pp60c-src, and was also detected when immunoprecipitates were made from lysates of 32P-labeled cells. p81 was bound to middle T and pp60c-src in cell lines containing transforming mutants of middle T, but not (in phosphorylated form) to all nontransforming mutants. A parallel investigation of phosphatidylinositol kinase activity in immune complexes containing these middle T mutants revealed a complete coincidence between the presence of p81 and phosphatidylinositol kinase activity. We therefore suggest that p81 is a phosphatidylinositol kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2068807517,"A homeobox sequence has been used to isolate a new Xenopus cDNA, named XIHbox6. A short probe from this gene serves as an early marker of posterior neural differentiation in the Xenopus nervous system. The gene recognized by this cDNA sequence is first transcribed at the late gastrula stage and solely in the posterior neural cells. The gene is expressed when ectodermal and mesodermal tissues of an early gastrula are placed in contact, but not by either tissue cultured on its own. However, gene expression is most easily inducible in ectoderm from the dorsal region, i.e., in ectoderm normally destined to form neural structures. This establishes the principle, in contrast to previous belief, that the induction of the embryonic nervous system involves a predisposition of the ectoderm and does not depend entirely on an interaction with inducing mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2035971213,"The deduced amino acid sequence of a Drosophila gene isolated with a vertebrate sodium channel complementary DNA probe revealed an organization virtually identical to the vertebrate sodium channel protein; four homologous domains containing all putative membrane-spanning regions are repeated in tandem with connecting linkers of various sizes. All areas of the protein presumed to be critical for channel function show high evolutionary conservation. These include those proposed to function in voltage-sensitive gating, inactivation, and ion selectivity. All 24 putative gating charges of the vertebrate protein are in identical positions in the Drosophila gene. Ten introns interrupt the coding regions of the four homology units; introns with positions conserved among homology units bracket a region hypothesized to be the selectivity filter for the channel. The Drosophila gene maps to the right arm of the second chromosome in region 60D-E. This position does not coincide with any known mutations that confer behavioral phenotypes, but is close to the seizure locus (60A-B), which has been hypothesized to code for a voltage-sensitive sodium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1525467358,"Recently a series of fluorescent calcium indicator dyes have been developed for measurement of free intracellular calcium in eukaryotic cells. Here we report the use of one such dye, fura-2, for the study of intracellular calcium levels in the prokaryote Escherichia coli. Cells of E. coli were loaded with the membrane-permeable acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2, which was cleaved intracellularly to give the free pentaacid. The concentration of free [Ca2+]i in unstarved cells was maintained at 90 +/- 10 nM, irrespective of the Ca2+ concentration in the extracellular medium. Cells of a strain lacking the H+-translocating ATPase were depleted of endogenous energy reserves and loaded with calcium. In this strain oxidative phosphorylation is uncoupled, so ATP is not produced by respiration. In starved cells [Ca2+]i varied from 0.2 to 0.7 microM when the loading Ca2+ concentration varied from 10 microM to 10 mM. Addition of glucose lowered the Ca2+ levels to 90 nM. Addition of respiratory substrates as energy donors produced cyanide-sensitive efflux. Total cell Ca2+ increased in parallel to the extracellular calcium, but the pool of free calcium did not equilibrate with the total cellular pool. These results demonstrate that 1) the pool of total Ca2+ in the bacterial cell is large and responds to extracellular calcium, 2) the free [Ca2+]i is independent of extracellular calcium, and 3) energy in the form of a proton motive force is required for maintenance of the free intracellular pool of calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1990343225,"Cloned, sequenced mouse satellite DNA exhibits properties characteristic of molecules that possess a stable curvature. Circularly permuted fragments containing the region predicted to bend were used to map the curvature relative to DNA sequence. The altered mobility of these fragments in polyacrylamide gels is reversed when gels are run in the presence of distamycin A, a drug that binds preferentially to AT-rich DNA. Treatment of living mouse cells with this drug dramatically reduces the condensation of centromeric heterochromatin, the exclusive location of satellite sequences. In situ hybridization of satellite probes to extended chromosomes at the electron microscope level shows that satellite does not comprise a single block but is distributed throughout the centromere region. Based on these experiments, we hypothesize that the structure of mouse satellite DNA is an important feature of centromeric heterochromatin condensation."
https://openalex.org/W1592950349,"The action of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) on calcium influx was studied in BALB/c 3T3 cells. IGF-II did not affect calcium influx rate in either quiescent or platelet-derived growth factor-treated cells. In contrast, IGF-II induced an approximately 2-fold sustained increase in calcium influx rate in cells briefly primed with epidermal growth factor (primed competent cells). The IGF-II-stimulated calcium influx was dependent on extracellular calcium and was inhibited by lanthanum, cobalt, and tetramethlin but not by nitrendipine. The IGF-II-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation was also dependent on extracellular calcium and was inhibited by cobalt and tetramethlin. A pharmacological stimulation of calcium influx by BAYK8644 resulted in an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in primed cells but not in either quiescent or cells. Pretreatment of primed cells with pertussis toxin completely abolished subsequent action of IGF-II on both calcium influx and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Inhibitory actions of pertussis toxin correlated well with toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of a 41-kDa protein. The binding of 125I-IGF-II to membrane fraction was inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), and this inhibition was reversed by pretreatment of the cell with pertussis toxin. These results suggest that IGF-II stimulates calcium influx in primed BALB/c 3T3 cells by a mechanism involving G protein and that calcium influx may be a message of IGF-II action on cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1596458865,"The interference of the heparin-neutralizing plasma component S protein (vitronectin) (Mr = 78,000) with heparin-catalyzed inhibition of coagulation factor Xa by antithrombin III was investigated in plasma and in a purified system. In plasma, S protein effectively counteracted the anticoagulant activity of heparin, since factor Xa inhibition was markedly reduced in comparison to heparinized plasma deficient in S protein. Using purified components in the presence of heparin, S protein induced a concentration-dependent reduction of the inhibition rate of factor Xa by antithrombin III. This resulted in a decrease of the apparent pseudo-first order rate constant by more than 10-fold at a physiological ratio of antithrombin III to S protein. S protein not only counteracted the anticoagulant activity of commercial heparin but also of low molecular weight forms of heparin (mean Mr of 4,500). The heparin-neutralizing activity of S protein was found to be mainly expressed in the range 0.2-10 micrograms/ml of high Mr as well as low Mr heparin. S protein and high affinity heparin reacted with apparent 1:1 stoichiometry to form a complex with a dissociation constant KD = 1 X 10(-8) M as determined by a functional assay. As deduced from dot-blot analysis, direct interaction of radiolabeled heparin with S protein revealed a dissociation constant KD = 4 X 10(-8) M. Heparin binding as well as heparin neutralization by S protein increased significantly when reduced/carboxymethylated or guanidine-treated S protein was employed indicating the existence of a partly buried heparin-binding domain in native S protein. Radiolabeled heparin bound to the native protein molecule as well as to a BrCN fragment (Mr = 12,000) containing the heparin-binding domain as demonstrated by direct binding on nitrocellulose replicas of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Kinetic analysis revealed that the heparin neutralization activity of S protein in the inhibition of factor Xa by antithrombin III could be mimicked by a synthetic tridecapeptide from the amino-terminal portion of the heparin-binding domain. These data provide evidence that the heparin-binding domain of S protein appears to be unique in binding to heparin and thereby neutralizing its anticoagulant activity in the inhibition of coagulation factors by antithrombin III. The induction of heparin binding and neutralization may be considered a possible physiological mechanism initiated by conformational alteration of the S protein molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1587319566,"Polyclonal antibodies raised against bovine brain P-57, a neural-specific calmodulin-binding protein, were used to isolate murine cDNAs encoding P-57 from murine brain cDNA libraries in the expression vector lambda gt 11. Two of the overlapping clones contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 227 amino acid residues (predicted Mr, 23,635), a 163-nucleotide 5'-untranslated sequence, and a 403-nucleotide 3'-untranslated sequence. Hydrophobicity analysis of the predicted polypeptide indicated the lack of any considerable stretch of hydrophobic residues that may span the membrane. This is consistent with prior data suggesting that P-57 exists in a soluble, as well as a membrane-associated, form. The predicted amino acid composition of P-57 is rather unusual in that it is highly enriched in alanine, glutamic acid, and lysine residues, and relatively enriched with proline residues. This amino acid composition accounts for the very low helical content of the predicted polypeptide. A search of the GenBank and EMBL sequence data banks (GenBank Inc., release 44.0 (August, 1986); European Molecular Biology Library, release 8.0 (April, 1986] indicated that the P-57 nucleotide sequence shows no significant homology to any reported sequences. RNA blot analysis of brain, heart, liver, and testes RNA revealed that cDNAs detect P-57 transcripts of 1.5 kilobases in brain, but not in other tissues. Genome blot analysis was consistent with P-57 being encoded by a single or small number of genes. These data demonstrate that the accumulation of this novel calmodulin-binding polypeptide in neural tissue is controlled primarily at the level of RNA abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2057794086,"The H-2, Qa, and Tla genes of the murine major histocompatibility complex are related to each other by DNA sequence homology. The H-2 genes encode ubiquitously expressed transplantation antigens that serve as recognition structures for cytotoxic T cells. The identities of the Qa and Tla products, their sites of expression, and their functions are largely unknown. We report here that the Qa region gene Q7 encodes a membrane-bound as well as a secreted form of the serologically defined antigen Qa-2. The Q7 gene introduced into liver-derived cells is expressed as a membrane-bound and as a secreted molecule. In transfected L cells it is expressed only as a soluble protein. Biochemical analysis suggests that the Q7 product is anchored to the liver cell membranes by a phospholipid tail. This feature may be responsible for cell type-specific expression of the two forms of the Qa-2 molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2094821420,"Cellular src protein, p60c-src, is phosphorylated on tyrosine 527 in chicken embryo fibroblasts, and this phosphorylation is implicated in suppressing the protein-tyrosine kinase activity and transforming potential of p60c-src. To determine whether tyrosine 527 phosphorylation is dependent on p60c-src kinase activity, the ATP-binding site of chicken p60c-src was destroyed by substitution of lysine 295 with methionine. The resultant protein, p60c-src(M295), expressed either in chicken cells or in yeast, lacked detectable kinase activity. Nevertheless, tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of p60c-src(M295) overproduced in chicken cells were indistinguishable from that of authentic p60c-src. By contrast, p60c-src(M295) was not phosphorylated on tyrosine in yeast. These results suggest that a protein kinase present in chicken cells but not in yeast phosphorylates tyrosine 527 in trans, and are consistent with the possibility that this kinase is distinct from p60c-src."
https://openalex.org/W2063659783,"Abstract We have measured the time course of release of 42K and 86Rb from an occluded state of the Na,K-pump using a rapid filtration apparatus. We have found that at 20 degrees C and in the presence of ATP, 42K is released with a rate constant of approximately 45 s-1 and 86Rb with a rate constant of approximately 20 s-1; both ATP and ADP are effective at a low affinity site (Kd approximately 0.3 and 1 mM, respectively) with the rate of deocclusion being only half as great in ADP as in ATP. Mg2+ stimulates 2-fold at low concentrations probably by forming MgATP, and free Mg2+ is strongly inhibitory at high concentrations (Kd approximately 10 mM). Mg2+ also decreases the affinity for ATP, and the data are consistent with mixed type inhibition; from the analysis the dissociation constant is approximately 1 mM for the inhibitory Mg2+ and the Rb+-occluded form without ATP. The rate of 42K or 86Rb release increases monotonically with pH while ATPase activity decreases above pH 8, so that deocclusion is not rate-limiting in the overall cycle at high pH. This is reflected by a convergence of the rate of Na,K-ATPase and Na,Rb-ATPase activities at high pH and by a decrease in the observed steady-state level of the occluded 86Rb intermediate at high pH. K+, Rb+, Na+, and Cs+, but not Li+, increase the rate of 42K and 86Rb release at constant ionic strength, presumably at sites other than the transport sites. The spontaneous rate of deocclusion is only approximately 0.1 s-1 at low ionic strength in the absence of nucleotides, and it is increased markedly by all cations tested except Li+. Overall the data are consistent with deocclusion as a rate-limiting step in the Na,K-pump cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1591761111,"The reverse transcriptase polymerase of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus/lymphadenopathy-associated virus has been cloned into an expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. Two polypeptides of 66 and 51 kDa molecular mass are detectable in polymerase-expressing bacterial lysates with human patient sera. They are processed from a short-lived 120-kDa polyprotein precursor equivalent to a region consisting of polymerase, protease, and endonuclease. The 51 kDa protein appears to originate from the 66-kDa molecule; additional processing products are 32- and 15-kDa proteins. The bacterially expressed polymerase is enzymatically active and exhibits the template specificities, ion requirements, and response to inhibitors of the authentic enzyme. It was purified by DEAE-cellulose-, phosphocellulose-, and poly(rC)-agarose column chromatography followed by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. It copurifies with an RNase H activity, suggesting the existence of a virus-coded DNA polymerase-RNase H complex. The purified bacterial enzyme allows a safe large-scale screening for inhibitors of both activities."
https://openalex.org/W1567706221,"N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) inhibits 100% of proton transport and 80-85% of (Mg2+)-ATPase activity in clathrin-coated vesicles. Half-maximum inhibition of proton transport is observed at 10 microM DCCD after 30 min. Although treatment of the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase with DCCD has no effect on ATP hydrolysis in the detergent-solubilized state, sensitivity of proton transport and ATPase activity to DCCD is restored following reconstitution into phospholipid vesicles. In addition, treatment of the detergent-solubilized enzyme with DCCD followed by reconstitution gives a preparation that is blocked in both proton transport and ATP hydrolysis. These results suggest that although the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase can react with DCCD in either a membrane-bound or detergent-solubilized state, inhibition of ATPase activity is only manifested when the pump is present in sealed membrane vesicles. To identify the subunit responsible for inhibition of the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase by DCCD, we have labeled the partially purified enzyme with [14C]DCCD. A single polypeptide of molecular weight 17,000 is labeled. The extremely hydrophobic nature of this polypeptide is indicated by its extraction with chloroform:methanol. The 17,000-dalton protein can be labeled to a maximum stoichiometry of 0.99 mol of DCCD/mol of protein with 100% inhibition of proton transport occurring at a stoichiometry of 0.15-0.20 mol of DCCD/mol of protein. Amino acid analysis of the chloroform:methanol extracted 17,000-dalton polypeptide reveals a high percentage of nonpolar amino acids. The similarity in properties of this protein and the DCCD-binding subunit of the coupling factor (H+)-ATPases suggests that the 17,000-dalton polypeptide may function as part of a proton channel in the coated vesicle proton pump."
https://openalex.org/W1606113013,"Sequences of the circumsporozoite protein gene from five isolates of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are compared, and the extent of sequence variability within putative functional domains is assessed in terms relating to vaccine efficacy. Nucleotide substitutions were observed outside of the immunodominant domain. Of the substitutions observed outside of the repeat domain, none were silent. The substitutions correlated with biologically functional regions, such as a helper T cell epitope (Th2R) and a region (N1) which may be important in liver invasion. Contrary to previous impressions, the small numbers of amino acid changes in these areas of the protein seem potentially very significant. The immunodominant repeat region displays several characteristics that implicate a rapid evolutionary mechanism, most probably involving recombination. The data supporting this are 1) variable numbers of repeats, 2) a shifting pattern of substitutions among the isolates, and 3) codon bias. The region thus has the potential for very rapid change should an effective anti-repeat vaccine come into use. We conclude that strain variability is significant, that the potential for large scale variation in the repeats is great, and that regions that may be critical for an effective vaccine are polymorphic. Their potential impact on malaria vaccine development must be addressed."

https://openalex.org/W1485255926,"We have identified a mitochondrial protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which confers the ability to recognize mitochondrial promoters onto a nonspecifically transcribing mitochondrial core RNA polymerase and we have purified this specificity factor 10,700-fold from a whole cell extract. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified fraction followed by elution and renaturation of protein activity shows that the specificity factor is a 43-kDa polypeptide which directs mitochondrial core RNA polymerase to promoters belonging to rRNA-, tRNA-, and protein-encoding genes, as well as to mitochondrial replication origins. Gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation studies indicate that the specificity factor shows little association with core RNA polymerase in the absence of DNA, and that it behaves like a monomeric 43-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1530499572,"Pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and NADP-malate dehydrogenase function in a series of reactions for fixing CO2 in mesophyll cells and NADP-malic enzyme (ME) catalyzes the production of CO2 and NADPH in bundle sheath cells of maize which is a NADP-ME type C4 plant. Northern blot analyses with cDNA clones for pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and in vitro translation-immunoprecipitation experiments with antiserum to NADP-malate dehydrogenase showed that pools of transcripts of these three genes grow and shrink coordinately in mesophyll cells but not in bundle sheath cells upon illumination of dark-grown maize seedlings. Western blot analyses indicated that the protein levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase are low in dark-grown maize seedlings and increase progressively following light-induced transient accumulation of their mRNAs in mesophyll cells. These proteins continue to accumulate and plateau in late-greening and green leaves in spite of a rapid drop in the sizes of their mRNA pools. Surprisingly, relatively large amounts of NADP-malate dehydrogenase are present in mesophyll cells of etiolated leaves despite the low level of the corresponding mRNA. No phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase or NADP-malate dehydrogenase were detected in bundle sheath cells. On the other hand, the ME gene responds to light induction at both the transcriptional and translational levels only in bundle sheath cells. Moreover, the steady-state level of ME mRNA stays high in late-greening and green leaves in contrast to the rapid decline of mRNA levels of three other C4 pathway genes in mesophyll cells. In addition, low levels of both the mRNA and protein encoded by the PPDK gene were detected in bundle sheath cells. These levels were not influenced by light as distinguished from the patterns observed in mesophyll cells."
https://openalex.org/W1543547039,"The bacterium Pseudomonas PG2982 metabolizes glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) by converting it to glycine, a one-carbon unit, and phosphate. Here we show that this conversion involves the intermediate formation of sarcosine. When cells are incubated with [14C]glyphosate, the 14C can be entrapped in glycine or sarcosine. With added sarcosine, 14C from all three carbons of glyphosate is recovered solely in sarcosine. In experiments with glycine, radioactivity from the carboxymethyl moiety of glyphosate is trapped in glycine as well as serine, whereas radioactivity from the phosphonomethyl carbon is only incorporated into serine. These results are consistent with a pathway involving the conversion of glyphosate to sarcosine by cleavage of its carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond, followed by the oxidation of sarcosine to glycine and formaldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W1488616816,"The organic hydroperoxides tert-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide are tumor promoters in the skin of SENCAR mice, and this activity is presumed to be mediated through the activation of the hydroperoxides to free radical species. In this study we have assessed the generation of free radicals from organic hydroperoxides in the target cell (the murine basal keratinocyte) using electron spin resonance. Incubation of primary isolates of keratinocytes from SENCAR mice in the presence of spin traps (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide or 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane) and either tert-butyl hydroperoxide or cumene hydroperoxide resulted in the generation and detection of radical adducts of these spin traps. tert-Butyl alkoxyl and alkyl radical adducts of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide were detected shortly after addition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide, whereas only alkyl radical adducts were observed with cumene hydroperoxide. Spin trapping of the alkyl radicals with 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane led to the identification of methyl and ethyl radical adducts following both tert-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide exposures. Prior heating of the cells to 100 degrees C for 30 min prevented radical formation. The radical generating capacity of subcellular fractions of these epidermal cells was examined using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and cumene hydroperoxide, and this activity was confined to the 105,000 × g supernatant fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1492344127,"We have studied cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of sodium channels in rat brain neurons maintained in primary culture. In back phosphorylation studies, cells were treated with drugs to increase intracellular cAMP and sodium channels were solubilized and isolated by immunoprecipitation. Surface and intracellular pools of sodium channels were isolated separately. Purified channels were then phosphorylated with [gamma-32P]ATP by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to incorporate 32P into available cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites. The amount of 32P incorporated in vitro is inversely proportional to the extent of endogenous phosphorylation. Incubation of cells with forskolin (0.1-100 microM), 8-Br-cAMP (0.1-10 mM), or isobutylmethylxanthine (0.01-1.0 mM) inhibited subsequent incorporation of 32P into isolated sodium channels by 70-80%, indicating that treatment of cells with these drugs had increased endogenous phosphorylation to nearly maximum levels. The phosphopeptides phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro were identical. To examine the magnitude of basal phosphorylation and the extent of stimulated phosphorylation, the amount of 32P incorporated into sodium channels from control and stimulated cells was compared to that from matched samples which had been dephosphorylated with calcineurin. Sodium channels from control cells incorporated approximately 2-fold more 32P after dephosphorylation, indicating that cAMP-dependent sites on the channel are at least 47% phosphorylated in the basal state. Sodium channels from forskolin-treated cells incorporated 7-8-fold more 32P after dephosphorylation, indicating that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites are 80-90% phosphorylated after stimulation. Cell surface and intracellular pools of sodium channels were phosphorylated similarly. In cells metabolically labeled with 32P, cell surface sodium channels incorporated 2.7 mol of phosphate/mol of channel. Forskolin stimulated 32P incorporation into sodium channels 1.3-fold, consistent with the results obtained by back phosphorylation. We conclude that the rat brain sodium channel is substantially phosphorylated in both the cell surface and intracellular pools in vivo in unstimulated rat brain neurons, and the extent of phosphorylation is increased to 80-90% of maximum phosphorylation by agents that elevate intracellular cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1986755804,"Abstract The rate of 86Rb or 42K release from an occluded form of the phosphorylated Na+ pump has been studied using a rapid filtration apparatus described previously. The rate constant of release is 5-15 s-1, and 42K and 86Rb dissociate at approximately the same rate. Mg2+ is required for deocclusion in the presence of Pi at a site which has the same affinity as the site involved in stabilization of E2(K) with ATP; we propose that Na,K-ATPase has only one site for Mg2+ (apart from Mg2+ complexed with ATP), that the affinity of this site for Mg2+ is increased by Pi binding and decreased by ATP binding, and that Mg2+ is bound and released in the normal transport cycle. In the presence of K+, Cs+, Rb+, or Tl+, the release of two distinct 86Rb ions can be observed, the slow release from one site (s site) being blocked by occupancy of the site vacated by the other (f, fast site). By a sequence of incubations, labeled 86Rb can be placed at either site, and the rate of dissociation monitored individually; in the absence of K+, dissociation from the s site proceeds after a lag in which the f site is vacated. The results are consistent with a flickering-gate model of deocclusion to the extracellular pump face, in which the site is exposed to the medium only long enough for a single ion to be released. When deocclusion to the intracellular face is promoted with ATP, ions are released from both sites at the same rate, presumably because the E2----E1 conformational change is rate-limiting. Unlabeled ions co-occluded with 86Rb increase the ATP-stimulated rate of release in the order Rb+ less than Tl+ less than Cs+ less than K+; since the same rank order is observed when dissociation from the s site is monitored in the presence of these ions and MgPi we propose that the latter process proceeds toward the intracellular pump face. 86Rb release from the vanadate-inhibited enzyme has the characteristics of Pi-stimulated release but is approximately 25-fold slower. ATP binds to both the phosphorylated and vanadate-inhibited forms of Na,K-ATPase and increases the rate of deocclusion, apparently to both the intracellular and extracellular faces of the pump."
https://openalex.org/W1566568714,"We have developed a monoclonal antibody, designated PR7212 (IgG1), which specifically recognizes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) of primate cells. The antibody recognizes an extracellular epitope of the receptor, demonstrated by its ability to bind to intact cells. Using this antibody, we have detected three forms of PDGFR of approximately 180, 164, and 130 kDa. All three of the forms were detected by Western blot analysis of human dermal fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitates of 32P-labeled membrane extracts of human dermal fibroblasts demonstrate that phosphorylation of all three forms of the receptor is stimulated by PDGF. In addition, several smaller molecules were detected, ranging in size from 113 to 49 kDa, which are also phosphorylated in response to PDGF addition. These smaller molecules may be either PDGFR kinase substrates or partially degraded PDGFR. Only the 180- and the 164-kDa forms of the receptor are detectable from immunoprecipitates of soluble extracts of 35S-metabolically labeled cells. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that the 164-kDa form is a precursor of the 180-kDa molecule. After PDGF binding at 37 degrees C, the 180-kDa form disappears from the cell surface in parallel with a decrease in 125I-PDGF binding, providing evidence that occupation results in internalization of PDGFR rather than inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1499051086,"In plant seeds, the storage triacylglycerol is packed in discrete particles called lipid bodies which consist of a lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer with embedded proteins. We have cloned and sequenced a nearly full-length cDNA for the major protein (L3) associated with the lipid bodies of maize. The L3-cDNA clone was identified by hybrid-selected translation analysis and contains the complete 3' noncoding region and an open reading frame of 432 nucleotides. This open reading frame encodes a polypeptide with amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, and predicted protease digestion pattern which correlate well with those of the authentic L3 protein. Analyses of predicted secondary structure and local hydropathy of the deduced amino acid sequence suggest three structural domains in the protein. An internal domain of 72 contiguous hydrophobic or neutral amino acids is bounded at the amino-terminal side by a hydrophilic alpha-helix and on the carboxyl-terminal side by an amphipathic alpha-helix. The data suggest that L3 is uniquely suited to interact with both lipid and phospholipid moieties of the lipid body. A simple model for the topology of L3 on the lipid body is proposed. The unusual structure of the lipid body protein is discussed and compared to those of the two well-studied classes of lipid-associated proteins, apolipoproteins and intrinsic membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1516998764,"Through labeling with the sodium salt of the photolabile bile salt derivative (7,7-azo-3 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-[3 beta-3H]cholan-24-oyl)- 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, a bile salt-binding polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 100,000 was identified in isolated canalicular but not basolateral (sinusoidal) rat liver plasma membranes. This labeled polypeptide was isolated from octyl glucoside-solubilized canalicular membranes by DEAE-cellulose and subsequent wheat germ lectin Sepharose chromatography. The purified protein still contained covalently incorporated radioactive bile salt derivative and exhibited a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 100,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels. Antibodies were raised in rabbits and their monospecificity toward this canalicular polypeptide demonstrated by immunoblot analysis. No cross-reactivity was found with basolateral membrane proteins. The antibodies inhibited taurocholate uptake into isolated canalicular but not basolateral membrane vesicles. In addition, the antibodies also decreased efflux of taurocholate from canalicular vesicles. If the canalicular bile salt-binding polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100-solubilized canalicular membranes and subsequently deglycosylated with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, the apparent molecular weight was decreased from 100,000 to 48,000 (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). These studies confirm previous results in intact liver tissue and strongly indicate that a canalicular specific glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 100,000 is directly involved in canalicular excretion of bile salts."

The gene was extensively methylated in leukocytes and sperm, with the former exhibiting a highly specific methylation pattern. Individual ras alleles were differentially methylated at the VTR region in fetal fibroblasts and immortal cell lines. A new polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the gene was also detected. The presence or absence of an Xhol site showed a striking and complete concordance with the length of the VTR region and suggested that the site had been lost by a previous allele-specific mutation."

Digitonin-solubilized [3H]PN200-110-binding component, purified by wheat germ agglutinin chromatography, sediments as a 21 S complex. The sedimentation coefficient of the complex is increased to about 24 S after incubation with mAb 1A IgG. Four polypeptides with apparent molecular weights under nonreducing conditions of 220,000, 200,000, 61,000, and 33,000 co-sediment with the 21 S complex. mAb 1A recognizes the Mr 200,000 polypeptide, as shown by Western blotting analysis. [3H] PN200-110 complex purified by wheat germ agglutinin chromatography followed by immunoaffinity chromatography on an mAb 1A column is comprised primarily of the same four polypeptides. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, the Mr 220,000 protein migrates as a polypeptide of Mr 143,000; the mobility of the Mr 200,000 protein recognized by mAb 1A is unaffected by reduction. Thus, the Mr 200,000 polypeptide appears to be a previously undescribed component of the dihydropyridine-binding complex and, in association with the other polypeptides, may comprise the voltage-sensitive calcium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1605415092,"We have investigated the requirements for the induction of the acute phase response to inflammation using the FAZA rat hepatocyte cell line which can be induced to activate the acute phase response genes with supernatants from human or rat monocytes. Using ribonuclease mapping of fibrinogen transcripts, we find that the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate can induce a 10-20-fold increase in properly initiated and spliced fibrinogen mRNA. This response is likely to be mediated by protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) since the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, can also induce fibrinogen mRNA. In addition to the alpha, beta, and gamma chains of fibrinogen, other acute phase response mRNAs are induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate including alpha 2-macroglobulin. The active agent capable of inducing the fibrinogen mRNAs in the monocyte supernatants is clearly not interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor. The FAZA cell line does not have detectable IL-1 receptors and does not respond to either murine or human IL-1 or the 30-kDa precursor for IL-1. In addition, fibrinogen cannot be induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha in this cell line, and the active agent in monocytes supernatants cannot be neutralized with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha. We conclude that a third as yet uncharacterized agent is responsible for the induction of fibrinogen during the acute phase response and that this agent transduces its signal to the fibrinogen genes by a mechanism involving protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1554453744,"The effect of minoxidil on lysyl hydroxylase activity and proliferation of human skin fibroblasts in culture was examined. Exposure of cells to minoxidil resulted in a specific loss of lysyl hydroxylase activity, the extent of which was dependent on the concentration of minoxidil from 25 to 500 microM and the duration of the treatment from 6 to 48 h. This phenomenon was unaffected by culture conditions, i.e. ascorbic acid status, serum concentration, and cell density. Minoxidil added directly to cell extracts had no effect on lysyl hydroxylase activity, showing a requirement for intact cells. Mixing experiments with extracts of minoxidil-treated cells and controls gave additive results which rule out the possibility that a metabolite derived from minoxidil could be inhibiting the enzyme activity. The effect of minoxidil on fibroblast lysyl hydroxylase activity disappeared in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Moreover, the recovery of the enzyme activity that occurred after removal of minoxidil from the culture medium could be prevented by actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis. These results indicate that minoxidil may inhibit the synthesis of lysyl hydroxylase in the cell. In addition to suppressing fibroblast lysyl hydroxylase activity, minoxidil caused inhibition of cell growth within 48 h in a manner dependent on the concentration from 10 to 1000 microM, the latter resulting in almost complete cessation of cell proliferation. This effect was not accompanied by cytotoxicity as judged by the criteria of dye exclusion, plating efficiency, growth recovery, and protein synthesis. The inhibition of fibroblast proliferation by minoxidil appeared to be related to its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine into acid-precipitable material."
https://openalex.org/W1507712770,"Isolated rat pancreatic islets were pulse-labeled for 5 min with [3H]leucine then chased for 25 min, during which time endogenously labeled [3H]proinsulin becomes predominantly compartmented in immature secretory granules. The islets were then homogenized in isotonic sucrose (pH 7.4) and a beta-granule preparation obtained by differential centrifugation and discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. This preparation was enriched 8-fold in beta-granules. Aside from contamination with mitochondria and a limited number of lysosomes, the beta-granule preparation was essentially free of any other organelles involved in proinsulin synthesis and packaging (i.e. microsomal elements and, more particularly, Golgi complex). Conversion of endogenously labeled [3H]proinsulin was followed in this beta-granule fraction for up to 2 h at 37 degrees C in a buffer (pH 7.3) that mimicked the cationic constituents of B-cell cytosol, during which time 92% of the beta-granules remained intact. Proinsulin conversion was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The rate of proinsulin conversion to insulin was stimulated by 2.2 +/- 0.1-fold (n = 6) (at a 60-min incubation) in the presence of ATP (2 mM) and an ATP regenerating system compared to beta-granule preparations incubated without ATP. This ATP stimulation was abolished in the presence of beta-granule proton pump ATPase inhibitors (tributyltin, 2.5 microM, or 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 50 microM). Inhibitors of mitochondrial proton pump ATPases (sodium azide, 20 mM, or oligomycin, 10 micrograms/ml) had no effect on the ATP stimulation of proinsulin conversion. When granules were incubated in a more acidic buffer (pH 5.5), proinsulin conversion was increased relative to that at pH 7.3. At pH 5.5, ATP no longer stimulated conversion, and tributyltin and 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide had no effect. Disrupted granules only converted proinsulin to a limited extent, and neither ATP nor the inhibitors affected conversion. It is therefore suggested that ATP stimulation of proinsulin conversion in isolated, intact, beta-granules is secondary to intragranular acidification by an ATP-dependent proton pump (reflecting the low pH optimum for proinsulin conversion), rather than ATP dependence of converting activity per se."
https://openalex.org/W1605233189,"Seven monoclonal antibodies to the alpha subunit (G alpha) of the frog photoreceptor guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (transducin or G-protein) have been characterized as to their effect on G-protein function, and this has been correlated in the accompanying paper (Deretic, D., and Hamm, H. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10839-10847) with the antibody-binding sites on G alpha tryptic fragments. Antibodies 4A, 7A, 7B, 7C, and 7D are members of a class of antibodies that block G-protein activation by light and therefore also block activation of the cGMP phosphodiesterase. All these blocking antibodies also block the interaction of G-protein with rhodopsin as measured by the light-scattering and as measured by the stabilization of meta-rhodopsin II by bound G-protein (extra-meta-rhodopsin II). The antibodies (or Fab fragments) also solubilize G alpha beta gamma from the membrane in the dark under isosmotic conditions and thus interfere with G alpha interaction with the membrane. Antibody 4A also blocks the extra-meta-rhodopsin II generated by G-protein-rhodopsin interaction in detergent solubilized membranes. Thus, even in the absence of phospholipids, antibody 4A blocks G-protein-rhodopsin interaction. Therefore, we suggest that the antibodies recognize a region of G alpha involved with binding to rhodopsin. An alternative hypothesis is that this antigenic site is a region of interaction between the alpha and beta gamma subunits, disruption of this interaction leading to removal of both the alpha and beta gamma subunits from the membrane and blocking interaction with rhodopsin. This does not seem to be the case because the antibodies immunoprecipitate the alpha beta gamma complex, and not just the alpha subunit. Other antibodies, 4C and 4H, do not block phosphodiesterase activation, the light-scattering signal, extra-meta-rhodopsin II formation, or interaction with the membrane in the dark and therefore recognize other sites on G alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1562244762,"Antigenic sites for six monoclonal antibodies that bind to the alpha subunit (G alpha) of the photoreceptor guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein or transducin) have been determined. Five of these antibodies (4A, 7A, 7B, 7C, and 7D) were shown in the preceding paper (Hamm, H. E., Deretic, D., Hofmann, K. P., Schleicher, A., and Kohl, B. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10831-10838) to block G-protein-rhodopsin interaction. We have blotted tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of G-protein to nitrocellulose paper and found that these antibodies bind to peptides that contain the COOH-terminal end of the protein assessed by 32P-ADP-ribosylation of the COOH-terminus by pertussis toxin. The antigenic site is not exactly at the COOH-terminus since the antibodies also bind two peptides which lack a 2-kDa piece from the COOH-terminus. Antigenic sites are therefore on the 7-kDa chymotryptic peptide and 5-kDa tryptic peptide more than 2 kDa away from the COOH-terminus. Further evidence for this antigenic site comes from the ability of these antibodies to block pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation while still binding to the previously ADP-ribosylated protein both on nitrocellulose blots and in immunoprecipitations. Antibody 4H, which was shown not to interrupt any of the functions studied, binds to the 11-kDa major tryptic fragment. To aid in the mapping of these sites onto the surface of G alpha, a model of the three-dimensional structure of G alpha has been generated using the G alpha primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, hydropathy plot, and the constraints of the GDP-binding site of the GTP-binding protein elongation factor Tu solved by Jurnak (Jurnak, F. (1985) Science 230, 32-36)."
https://openalex.org/W1569886016,"Abstract Incubation of purified human plasma prekallikrein with sulfatides or dextran sulfate resulted in spontaneous activation of prekallikrein as judged by the appearance of amidolytic activity toward the chromogenic substrate H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide. The time course of generation of amidolytic activity was sigmoidal with an apparent lag phase that was followed by a relatively rapid activation until finally a plateau was reached. Soybean trypsin inhibitor completely blocked prekallikrein activation whereas corn, lima bean, and ovomucoid trypsin inhibitors did not. The Ki of the reversible inhibitor benzamidine for autoactivation (240 microM) was identical to the Ki of benzamidine for kallikrein. Thus, spontaneous prekallikrein activation and kallikrein showed the same specificity for a number of serine protease inhibitors. This indicates that prekallikrein is activated by its own enzymatically active form, kallikrein. Immunoblotting analysis of the time course of activation showed that, concomitant with the appearance of amidolytic activity, prekallikrein was cleaved. However, prekallikrein was not quantitatively converted into two-chain kallikrein since other polypeptide products were visible on the gels. This accounts for the observation that in amidolytic assays not all prekallikrein present in the reaction mixture was measured as active kallikrein. Kinetic analysis showed that prekallikrein activation can be described by a second-order reaction mechanism in which prekallikrein is activated by kallikrein. The apparent second-order rate constant was 2.7 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 (pH 7.2, 50 microM sulfatides, ionic strength I = 0.06, at 37 degrees C). Autocatalytic prekallikrein activation was strongly dependent on the ionic strength, since there was a considerable decrease in the second-order rate constant of the reaction at high salt concentrations. In support of the autoactivation mechanism it was found that increasing the amount of kallikrein initially present in the reaction mixture resulted in a significant reduction of the lag period and a rapid completion of the reaction while the second-order rate constant was not influenced. Our data support a prekallikrein autoactivation mechanism in which surface-bound kallikrein activates surface-bound prekallikrein."
https://openalex.org/W2077267518,"Circularization and reverse circularization of the Tetrahymena thermophila rRNA intervening sequence resemble the first and second steps in splicing, respectively. However, site-specific base substitutions show that different nucleotides are involved in selection of the 5' splice site and the circularization sites. Furthermore, a substitution at the major circularization site that prevents circularization can be suppressed by second substitutions at two different nucleotide positions. A model is proposed in which adjacent and overlapping sequences can function as a binding site, forming a short duplex with the sequence at the circularization site and thus directing circularization and reverse circularization. Because the 5' exon-binding site and three potential circularization binding sites fall within a contiguous eight nucleotide region, this sequence may translocate relative to the catalytic core of the ribozyme in a template-like manner."

https://openalex.org/W1485965528,"A porcine genomic cosmid library was constructed to study the structure and regulation of the porcine relaxin gene. Two overlapping cosmids containing relaxin-specific sequences were isolated, and a 9-kilobase BamHI fragment containing the porcine relaxin gene was sequenced. The sequence derived from these cosmids was used to characterize the relaxin gene transcription unit utilized in the pregnant ovary. Analysis of chromosomal and cosmid DNA has shown that porcine relaxin is encoded by a single copy gene, comprising two exons separated by a 5.5-kilobase intron. The gene contains elements representing two classes of repeated sequences homologous with the human Alu and Kpn families. The transcriptional initiation site of this gene was located by primed extension and direct sequencing of relaxin-specific cDNA. Furthermore, the promoter elements were mapped and sequenced, and transcriptional activity was demonstrated. The promoter contained sequences with homology to regions conserved within retroviral long terminal repeats and within the adenovirus E4 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1480045750,"Comparative binding studies with peptide fragments of the whole antigen, or with evolutionarily related intact proteins with varying degrees of sequence homology, have been used extensively to map antigenic sites on proteins to the resolution of single amino acid residues. These methods are limited, however, since high affinity antibodies will often not react with peptides and evolutionarily related proteins are available for only a few antigens. In this study we use site-directed chemical modification of horse cytochrome c to identify residues involved in the binding sites of four monoclonal antibodies specific for this protein. Thus, we have N-formylated the single tryptophan found in horse cytochrome c at position 59 and N-carbethoxylated one of the histidyl residues, which was determined to be at position 26 by the analysis of proteolytic cleavage fragments of the modified protein using liquid secondary ion-mass spectrometry on triple quadropole or tandem quadropole Fourier transform instruments. We discuss the impact of these modifications on the antigenicity of horse cytochrome c with regard to the conformational perturbations introduced by such modifications and with reference to our previous studies on the binding sites of these antibodies using other methodologies (Jemmerson, R., and Paterson, Y.

https://openalex.org/W1520593464,"Rat glomerular mesangial cell monolayers loaded with the fluorescent probe fura-2 responded to exogenous platelet-activating factor (PAF) with a rapid increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). PAF-induced [CA2+]i transients consisted of a dose-dependent phasic peak response followed by a sustained tonic phase of increased [Ca2+]i. Chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA suppressed the tonic phase of increased [Ca2+]i but did not affect the phasic peak response. This suggests two mechanisms for the elevation of [Ca2+]i: a transient mobilization from intracellular stores and an enhanced calcium influx across the plasma membrane, possibly mediated by receptor-operated channels. Lyso-PAF had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i and the PAF-receptor antagonist L652,731 selectively inhibited responses to PAF. PAF-stimulated mesangial cells displayed homologous desensitization to reexposure to PAF while still being responsive to other calcium-mobilizing agonists. Preincubation of cells with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol myristate acetate diminished the PAF-induced [Ca2+]i transient, suggesting a regulatory role for PKC in PAF-activation of mesangial cells. An increase in [Ca2+]i, as a result of receptor-linked activation of phospholipase C, may mediate PAF-induced hemodynamic and inflammatory events in renal glomeruli."
https://openalex.org/W1565894439,"Nucleosomal particles lacking one H2A.H2B dimer interact with RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli more strongly than the complete nucleosomal core particles. Moreover, the in vitro transcription of the H2A.H2B-deficient particles is much more efficient than that of the whole nucleosomal cores, both in the presence and absence of rifampicin. Although a substantial fraction of particles in the preparation of whole nucleosomal cores binds to RNA polymerase, the efficiency of these particles as transcription templates is very small. This block to transcription is partially eliminated when one H2A.H2B dimer is released from the core particle. Our results suggest that the lack of one H2A.H2B dimer from nucleosomal particles might be required for the formation of complexes with RNA polymerase active in transcription."

The alpha and beta 2 subunits are linked by disulfide bonds. The hydrophobic properties of these three subunits were examined by covalent labeling with the photoreactive hydrophobic probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine [( 125I]TID) which labels transmembrane segments in integral membrane proteins. All three subunits of the sodium channel were labeled by [125I]TID when the purified protein was solubilized in mixed micelles of Triton X-100 and phosphatidylcholine (4:1). The half-time for photolabeling was approximately 7 min consistent with the half-time of 9 min for photolysis of TID under our conditions. Comparable amounts of TID per mg of protein were incorporated into each subunit. Purified sodium channels reconstituted in phosphatidylcholine vesicles were also labeled by TID with comparable incorporation per mg of protein into all three subunits. The efficiency of photolabeling of the three subunits was reduced from 39 to 44% by a 2-fold expansion of the hydrophobic phase of the reaction mixture but was unaffected by a 2-fold expansion of the aqueous phase, confirming that the photolabeling reaction took place in the lipid phase of the vesicle bilayer. The hydrophobic properties of the sodium channel subunits were examined further using phase separation in the nonionic detergent Triton X-114. Under conditions in which beta 1 is dissociated from alpha, the beta 1 subunit was preferentially extracted into the Triton X-114 phase, and the disulfide-linked alpha beta 2 complex was retained in the aqueous phase. When the disulfide bonds between the alpha and beta 2 subunits were reduced with dithioerythritol, the beta 2 subunit was also preferentially extracted into the Triton X-100 phase leaving the free alpha subunit in the aqueous phase. A preparative method for isolation of the beta 1 and beta 2 subunits was developed based on this technique. Considered together, the results of our hydrophobic labeling and phase separation experiments indicate that the alpha, beta 1, and beta 2 subunits all have substantial hydrophobic domains that may interact with the hydrocarbon phase of phospholipid bilayer membranes. Since the alpha subunit is known to be a transmembrane protein with many potential membrane-spanning segments, we conclude that the beta 1 and beta 2 subunits are likely to also be integral membrane proteins with one or more membrane-spanning segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1539845217,"The epitopes of two classes of monoclonal antibody and the binding site for the epsilon subunit have been mapped to the carboxyl-terminal region of the beta subunit of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase using partial CNBr cleavage, weak acid hydrolysis, and Western blots. One class of antibody, B-I, inhibits ATPase activity; the other class, B-II, recognizes an epitope not exposed on the surface of intact F1. Data from two-dimensional gels and blots of beta cleaved with CNBr/weak acid showed that the B-I epitope lies between Asp-381 and the carboxyl-terminal Leu-459, and the B-II epitope lies between Asp-345 and Met-380. Weak acid hydrolysis of the beta-epsilon product obtained by cross-linking F1 with a water-soluble carbodiimide yielded a fragment containing epsilon and a 13-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of beta indicating that epsilon interacts with this portion of beta as well. Fab fragments from the B-I antibody beta-6 could be cross-linked to the epsilon subunit in native F1 by various cross-linking agents demonstrating that the antibody and the epsilon subunit occupy adjacent, nonoverlapping sites on the beta subunit. Implications of these results for the roles of the epsilon subunit and of the carboxyl-terminal region of the beta subunit in F1 are discussed."

The chemical structure of (5'-AmNS)ApU was proved by the phosphodiesterase digestion followed by Whatman No. 3MM paper chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis of the digested products. The ability of these analogs to be incorporated into the 5' terminus of RNA chain forming fluorescent oligonucleotides by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was studied in the presence of a synthetic DNA template. The enzymatic reaction of (5'-AmNS)UpA and [3H]UTP in the presence of poly(dA-dT) yielded (5'-AmNS)UpAp[3H]U in greater than 30% yield with the Km values of 5 and 2.5 microM and Vmax values of 17 and 25 nmol/min/mg of enzyme for (5'-AmNS)UpA and UpA, respectively. The structure of this fluorescent trinucleotide was identified by RNase A digestion and paper chromatographic analysis of the digested products. (5'-AmNS)UpA or (5'-AmNS)ApU exhibits two absorption maxima around 270 and 340-350 nm and a fluorescent emission maximum at 445 nm when excited at 340 nm. These spectral characteristics permit their use as energy donors for the transfer of energy to the intrinsic cobalt of the cobalt-substituted RNA polymerases. Upon hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of these analogs by venom phosphodiesterase, the absorption at 340 and 270 nm increased by 5 and 20%, respectively, while their fluorescence at 445 nm was enhanced by 25%.

https://openalex.org/W1566632332,"Mammalian testis contains a tissue-specific testicular cytochrome c (cyt ct). By immunizing rabbits with rat cyt ct and phosphorylated albumin (pBSA), rabbit anti-cyt ct was produced. Then the antiserum was applied to phosphorylated bovine serum albumin and rat somatic cyt c (cs)-Sepharose affinity columns to remove cross-reacting antibodies. The resultant anti-cyt ct was highly specific for cyt ct. From immunoblot assays, no protein other than cyt ct in rat testis extract was bound by the anti-cyt ct. By using the anti-cyt ct, radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed for the quantitation of cyt ct in rat testis extract. The observation that the RIA did not bind rat cyt cs (1-1000 pmol), and other rat tissue extracts (kidney, heart, lung) further indicated that the RIA was highly specific for rat cyt ct. Separately, the concentration of holocyt ct was determined using CM-cellulose chromatography and subsequent spectral analysis on the same testis extract. The total cyt ct concentration in the rat testis extract determined by the RIA was about 3-fold higher than those determined by the latter techniques. Since the affinity purified anti-horse cyt c cross-reacted with both horse holo- and apocyt c, anti-rat cyt ct will cross-react with rat apocyt ct. Thus the concentration of cyt ct quantitated by the polyclonal anti-cyt ct-based RIA probably included apocyt ct concentration as well. Therefore, the higher cyt ct concentration determined by the RIA was probably attributed to the presence of the apocyt ct in the testis extract. The presence of the high concentration of the apocyt ct pool in testis is probably necessary to maintain continuous spermatogenesis, during which holocyt ct is incorporated into sperm mitochondria."
