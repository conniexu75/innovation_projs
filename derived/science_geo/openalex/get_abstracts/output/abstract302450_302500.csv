https://openalex.org/W2071091649,"The experimental replacement of calcite and aragonite by dolomite under a variety of conditions indicates that dolomitization can take place in marine and lacustrine environments under two conditions: (i) low dissolved sulfate concentrations and (ii) insubstantial contemporaneous silica diagenesis. Common sites for dolomite formation are areas where the dissolved sulfate concentration is reduced by microbial sulfate reduction, through the mixing of seawater with large amounts of fresh water, or where low-sulfate alkaline lacustrine environments prevail. Even under these conditions, dolomite formation may be inhibited by the concurrent transformation of opal-A (amorphous silica) to opal-CT (disordered cristobalite and tridymite), whereas the subsequent transformation of opal-CT to quartz favors the formation of dolomite."

Accurate global atmospheric temperature estimates are needed for detection of possible greenhouse warming, evaluation of computer models of climate change, and for understanding important factors in the climate system. Analysis of the first 10 years (1979 to 1988) of satellite measurements of lower atmospheric temperature changes reveals a monthly precision of 0.01 degrees C, large temperature variability on time scales from weeks to several years, but no obvious trend for the 10-year period. The warmest years, in descending order, were 1987, 1988, 1983, and 1980. The years 1984, 1985, and 1986 were the coolest."
https://openalex.org/W2072308542,"Bubbles of less than 1 micrometer and as large as 13.5 micrometers in diameter, stabilized by an apparent compression of substances sorbed onto their surfaces, were examined to determine their physical and temporal stability. Their ease of formation is related to the qualities of the water in which they are formed. Their presence in the water column must now be considered when interpreting acoustic data gathered to determine marine bubble populations."

https://openalex.org/W1981181241,"Quantification of intragranular porosity in sand-size material from an aquifer on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, by scanning electron microscopy, mercury injection, and epifluorescence techniques shows that there are more reaction sites and that porosity is greater than indicated by standard short-term laboratory tests and measurement techniques. Results from laboratory and field tracer tests show solute nonequilibrium for a reacting ion consistent with a model of diffusion into, and exchange within, grain interiors. These data indicate that a diffusion expression needs to be included in transport codes, particularly for simulation of the transport of radioactive and toxic wastes."

It is chemically weathered from continental rocks and transported by rivers to the oceans, where it is taken up by siliceous organisms and deposited in biogenic opal. The ratio of germanium to silicon buried in siliceous oozes must reflect the oceanic input ratios from rivers (crustal weathering) and sea-floor vents (mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal weathering). The opal germanium/silicon ratio may thus monitor relative variations in these weathering processes and provide information about the geochemical history of seawater."

https://openalex.org/W2015124381,"The generation of the orientation component of the polarization of matter in an electric field has previously been thought to require interaction of molecules with their neighbors. It is demonstrated that, even in the absence of collisions between neighboring molecules, hot isolated polyatomic molecules can reorient in response to an external field, thereby giving rise to the orientation component of polarization. This reorientation occurs through the interaction of rotation with molecular vibrations, which provides a heat bath to establish thermal rotational equilibrium. This effect is demonstrated for o-difluorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and p-chlorotoluene, with an inhomogeneous electric field used to deflect molecular beams of these molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2094463584,The P-wave velocity in shallow crystalline rock decreases systematically from a normal value of about 5.5 kilometers per second 20 kilometers or more from the Garlock and San Andreas faults to less than 3 kilometers per second at distances of less than 2 kilometers from these faults. This lateral velocity gradient closely resembles the shear stress profile. It is proposed that the velocity gradient results from increased fracturing nearer these major strike-slip faults and that this fracturing dominates the response of the shallow crust to tectonic stress.

https://openalex.org/W2051408786,"From an analysis of the long-run electric generating requirements of several representative utilities, it is concluded that the energy supplied by solar photovoltaic power devices will displace primarily base-load, and to a lesser extent intermediate, generating plants, even at relatively modest penetrations corresponding to several percent of the utility peak load. Attaching photovoltaic devices to the utility grid will not yield significant fuel oil savings over the long run, in which utilities approach the economic optimum generating mix, and will increase peak plant requirements. Utility capacity and fuel savings of photovoltaic devices are reported both for the case without storage and for the case in which the utility has access to load-leveling storage."
