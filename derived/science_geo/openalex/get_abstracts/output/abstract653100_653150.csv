Optical clocks, which are based on optical transitions of atoms, operate at much higher frequency and have been shown to exhibit better stability. Nakamura et al. demonstrate a framework that carries the improved stability of the optical domain over to microwaves (see the Perspective by Curtis). In addition to contributing to the eventual redefinition of the second based on optical clocks, this work will also lead to improvements in microwave-based technologies such as astronomical imaging and geodesy through very long baseline interferometry, radar, communications, and navigation systems.

For neurotransmitter transporters, which reside in synaptic vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane after an action potential, transport activity needs to be regulated so that they do not pump out neurotransmitters after vesicle fusion. Using cryo–electron microscopy, Li et al. determined the structure of a vesicular glutamate transporter from rat that unveils some of the distinctive features that enable it to function properly in two distinct cellular environments. An allosteric pH sensor, proposed to be a glutamate residue, gates binding of the substrate glutamate and simultaneously permits binding and counterflow of chloride ions. This molecular traffic light allows for a single ion channel to behave appropriately in different contexts. Science , this issue p. 893"
https://openalex.org/W3027017529,"Natural killer (NK) cells are key innate immunity effectors that combat viral infections and control several cancer types. For their immune function, human NK cells rely largely on five different cytotoxic proteases, called granzymes (A/B/H/K/M). Granzyme B (GrB) initiates at least three distinct cell death pathways, but key aspects of its function remain unexplored because selective probes that detect its activity are currently lacking. In this study, we used a set of unnatural amino acids to fully map the substrate preferences of GrB, demonstrating previously unknown GrB substrate preferences. We then used these preferences to design substrate-based inhibitors and a GrB-activatable activity-based fluorogenic probe. We show that our GrB probes do not significantly react with caspases, making them ideal for in-depth analyses of GrB localization and function in cells. Using our quenched fluorescence substrate, we observed GrB within the cytotoxic granules of human YT cells. When used as cytotoxic effectors, YT cells loaded with GrB attacked MDA-MB-231 target cells, and active GrB influenced its target cell-killing efficiency. In summary, we have developed a set of molecular tools for investigating GrB function in NK cells and demonstrate noninvasive visual detection of GrB with an enzyme-activated fluorescent substrate.

In summary, we have developed a set of molecular tools for investigating GrB function in NK cells and demonstrate noninvasive visual detection of GrB with an enzyme-activated fluorescent substrate. In the last two decades, significant advances in the understanding of natural killer (NK) cells have been made (1Caligiuri M.A. Human natural killer cells.Blood. 2008; 112 (18650461): 461-46910.1182/blood-2007-09-077438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). These cytotoxic lymphocytes are key effectors of innate immunity and are involved in viral infection responses as well as controlling several types of tumors. The activation of these cells is initiated by major compatibility complex (MHC) class I protein loss in compromised cells (1Caligiuri M.A. Human natural killer cells.Blood. 2008; 112 (18650461): 461-46910.1182/blood-2007-09-077438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). NK cell activation changes the balance between the activating and inhibiting receptors on cell surfaces. Activated cells rapidly and quickly secrete cytokines, tumor necrosis factor α and γ interferon, leading to subsequent stimulation of the immune system. Reciprocal interactions with dendritic cells, macrophage T cells, and endothelial cells also enhance the immune system response. To prevent autoimmune damage, the NK cell inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I proteins and protect healthy host cells (2Vivier E. Tomasello E. Baratin M. Walzer T. Ugolini S. Functions of natural killer cells.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 (18425107): 503-51010.1038/ni1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Among the various weapons of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), the most important, located in the cytotoxic granules, are perforin and granzymes (granule-associated enzymes, or Grs). Grs are the family of homologous serine proteases and the five different human granzymes (A/B/H/K/M); the most studied and abundant are granzymes A and B (3Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Granzymes: a family of serine proteases in granules of cytolytic T lymphocytes.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 140 (2644074): 33-4710.1007/978-3-642-73911-8_4PubMed Google Scholar, 4Masson D.

These enzymes are not only stored within the cytotoxic granules of immune killer cells but also detected in primary breast carcinoma and in chondrocytes of articular cartilage (5Horiuchi K. Saito S. Sasaki R. Tomatsu T. Toyama Y. Expression of granzyme B in human articular chondrocytes.J. Rheumatol. 2003; 30 (12913938): 1799-1810PubMed Google Scholar). Upon the activation of NK cells and binding to the target cell, the granule membrane fuses with the plasma membrane of the NK cell, and perforins (proteins that form pores in cell membranes) and granzymes are released from the cytotoxic effector cell into the intermembrane space (6Jans D.A. Jans P. Briggs L.J. Sutton V. Trapani J.A. Nuclear transport of granzyme B (fragmentin-2). Dependence of perforin in vivo and cytosolic factors in vitro.J. Biol.

The mechanism of GrB entering the target cell through perforin-formed pores in the plasma membrane is still unclear (8Voskoboinik I. Whisstock J.C. Trapani J.A. Perforin and granzymes: function, dysfunction and human pathology.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 (25998963): 388-40010.1038/nri3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). GrB is transported into the target cell to carry out its effect. Within the cell, GrB initiates at least three distinct pathways of programmed cell death, namely, 1) the activation of caspase 3, which triggers apoptosis, 2) GrB caspase-3 substrate hydrolysis with the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) BID, or 3) the direct hydrolysis of lamin B. The detection of individual granzymes with antibody-related techniques is challenging due to their structural similarities; for example, GrB antibody cross-reacts with GrA and GrH (3Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Granzymes: a family of serine proteases in granules of cytolytic T lymphocytes.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 140 (2644074): 33-4710.1007/978-3-642-73911-8_4PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, the detailed analysis of individual Grs is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, chemical approaches for developing enzymatic inhibitors and activity-based probes as efficient tools for granzyme exploration have been attempted. However, one problem is that the substrate specificity of GrB is similar to that of some caspases (caspase-8) (9Poreba M. Strozyk A. Salvesen G.S. Drag M.

To date, only a few groups have succeeded in making functional activity-based probes for granzymes, but the major issues in these studies are the lack of selectivity of these probes toward individual enzymes and the low kinetic parameters (10Thornberry N.A.

For example, an activity-based probe for GrB developed using combinatorial chemistry resulted in an inactivation rate constant for the target activity-based probes (GrB) equal to kobs/I = 460 m−1 s−1 (13Mahrus S.

Here, we design and characterize a set of selective chemical probes, including a quenched fluorescence substrate for GrB imaging in live cells. The development of new chemical tools for investigating Grs allows the examination of the unexplored functions of these proteases and their localization. Our objective was to develop selective and potent substrates and probes for human granzyme B (GrB). Although the available GrB substrates are tetrapeptides, it was previously reported that lengthening the peptide substrate improves the substrate hydrolysis rate for some proteases (14Rut W. Drag M. Human 20S proteasome activity towards fluorogenic peptides of various chain lengths.Biol. Chem. 2016; 397 (27176742): 921-92610.1515/hsz-2016-0176Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To define the optimal peptide length for which GrB is most active, six fluorescent substrates were designed based on literature data. The S1 binding pocket of GrB has an unusual preference for aspartic acid (10Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S.

The investigated peptides were Ac-AAIEPD-ACC, Ac-AIEPD-ACC, Ac-IEPD-ACC, Ac-EPD-ACC, Ac-PD-ACC, and Ac-D-ACC. We measured the activity of GrB against each of the new substrates (at equal concentrations) and observed that neither the tripeptide, the dipeptide, nor the single-amino-acid-based substrates were hydrolyzed. The longer tetra-, penta-, and hexapeptides were cleaved by GrB. The pentapeptide and hexapeptides were more efficiently cleaved by GrB than was the classic tetrapeptide substrate (Fig. 1A). Because there was no significant difference in the efficiency of the cleavage of the penta- and hexapeptides, we selected the pentapeptides as the most appropriate chain length for activity-based probes and substrates. To further explore the substrate specificity of GrB and allow better optimization of GrB substrates, we analyzed the S1–S5 pocket preferences using both combinatorial chemistry methods and the screening of defined peptides possessing natural and diverse unnatural amino acids (16Kasperkiewicz P.

The GrB S1 pocket almost exclusively recognizes aspartic acid, and this feature is also seen in cysteine protease caspases (9Poreba M. Strozyk A. Salvesen G.S. Drag M.

To reduce substrate cross-reactivity, especially with caspases, we tested whether any acidic and nonacidic modifications of natural amino acid residues are accommodated by the GrB S1 pocket. For this purpose, we designed and synthesized (using a solid-phase peptide synthesis method, see Fig. S1) a library of 95 defined peptides that share the same leading sequence and differ only by one amino acid residue at P1 (for the structures, see Fig. S2). ACC (7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin) was applied as a fluorescent leaving group, allowing the substrate hydrolysis rate to be determined based on the increase in fluorescence. In the positions P4–P2, defined natural amino acid residues were incorporated based on literature data (Ac-Ile-Ser-Pro-P1-ACC), while the N termini of the peptide substrates were acetylated. We tested the activity of GrB against the new P1 library and determined that GrB almost exclusively requires aspartic acid in the S1 pocket (l-Asp, 100%); it can accommodate the methylated derivative (l-Asp [O-Me], 30%) and, less potently, tyrosine (l-Tyr) and its derivatives (<10%) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S3A). This confirms the literature data where, similar to caspases (10Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P.

Additionally, the carboxyl group of Asp forms hydrogen bonds with three water molecules within the S1 subsite of GrB (18Rotonda J. Garcia-Calvo M. Bull H.G. Geissler W.M. McKeever B.M. Willoughby C.A. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W.

Not only the charge but also the shape of this pocket dictates amino acid binding, since only Asp or uncharged Asp derivatives with minimal modifications (Asp [O-Me]) can occupy this pocket, despite the lack of a negative charge, while more sizable Asp derivatives (Asp [O-Chx] and Asp [O-Bzl]) are not recognized by GrB, revealing the limited capacity of the S1 subsite and the involvement of additional interactions in peptide binding. The shape of Asp allows it to fit perfectly in the S1 pocket, and this is supported by the interaction between the guanidine group and the COOH group (for the P1 library screening, see Fig. S3). Although P1-Asp specificity distinguishes GrB from other granzymes, many GrB substrates are also recognized by caspases (10Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T.

Therefore, we sought a substrate sequence that distinguishes GrB activity from other proteases. To this end, we next determined the extended catalytic preferences of GrB at S4–S2 using a well-established HyCoSuL strategy (Hybrid Combinatorial Substrate Library) incorporating a wide range of different nonproteinogenic amino acids (16Kasperkiewicz P.

We observed that bulky hydrophobic proline derivatives, such as octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (l-Oic), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (Tic), and O-benzyl-l-hydroxyproline (l-Hyp [Bzl]) are strongly preferred by GrB in P2, while substrates with hydroxyproline (l-Hyp) bearing unprotected hydroxyl groups are not hydrolyzed. Additionally, bulky hydrophobic 6-benzyloxy-l-norleucine (l-Nle [O-Bzl]), benzyl-l-histidine (l-His [Bzl]), and benzyl-l-serine (l-Ser [Bzl]) were tolerated in the S2 pocket, indicating that amino acids with benzyl groups can be accommodated within this pocket (Fig. 1B and Fig. S3) and revealing that the S2 pocket is very capacious. We speculate that this pocket, filled by the flexible cyclohexane group of proline derivative l-Oic or the benzyl groups of l-Nle (O-Bzl) or l-Ser (Bzl), enables the amino acid residues to perfectly fill the S2 pocket. The HyCoSuL strategy also revealed that the S3 pocket of GrB has a broad substrate scope; however, it has strong preferences for glutamic acid (l-Glu, 100%), hydrophobic tyrosine bearing a benzyl group (l-Tyr [Bzl], 72%), and mono-oxidized methionine l-Met (O) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S3). The strong preference for an acidic amino acid is due to Asn-218 and Lys-192 in the S3 pocket of GrB, which interact with the side chain of l-Glu and stabilize the positively charged side chain of lysine (18Rotonda J.

Our results demonstrated that the S4 pocket also possesses broad substrate preferences. It can accommodate branched amino acids, such as isoleucine (l-Ile, 72%), valine (l-Val, 36%), or linear hydroxyl-l-norvaline (l-Hnv, 82%), as well as a proline derivative (l-Tic, 100%) and benzyloxymethyl-l-histidine (l-His [3-Bom], 82%) and some basic amino acids, such as 2,4-diaminobutyrylic acid (l-Dab, 39%), citrulline (l-Cit, 10%), and 1,3-diaminopropionic acid (l-Dap, 10%) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S3). According to Rotonda et al., this GrB pocket is a “shallow hydrophobic depression formed by aromatic rings” (Tyr-174 and Tyr-215) and the side chain of Leu-172 (18Rotonda J. Garcia-Calvo M. Bull H.G.

Our data from the HyCoSuL screening revealed that a bulkier amino acid (l-His [3-Bom]) was hydrolyzed by GrB (Fig. S3). To find the optimal amino acid for P5, we synthesized a combinatorial library of pentapeptides. For this purpose, based on the literature data and our results related to GrB specificity, we designed a library consisting of 1) defined amino acids at P1 (Asp) and P3 (Glu), 2) equimolar mixtures (X) at P2 and P4 (a mixture of natural amino acids with l-Nle replacing l-Met and l-Cys), and 3) one of the 174 defined amino acids at P5 (Ac-P5-X-Glu-X-Asp-ACC) (for the structures, see Fig. S2). GrB was tested against the library, and we observed that it displays no S5 substrate specificity and is capable of hydrolyzing most substrates regardless of the residue at this position; however, the addition of an extra amino acid to the substrate (P5) clearly leads to a dramatic increase in substrate hydrolysis (Fig. 1B–D). To validate the results of the HyCoSuL screening, we selected the most promising amino acid residues for the S4–S2 positions (P4, l-Tic, l-His [3-Bom], and l-Ile; P3, l-Glu and l-Tyr [Bzl]; and P2, l-His [Bzl], l-Oic, l-Tic, and l-Hyp [Bzl]) and synthesized eighteen different fluorogenic tetrapeptides using a previously described method (20Maly D.J. Leonetti F. Backes B.J. Dauber D.S. Harris J.L. Craik C.S. Ellman J.A. Expedient solid-phase synthesis of fluorogenic protease substrates using the 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (ACC) fluorophore.J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67 (11856036): 910-91510.1021/jo016140oCrossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We then tested the activity of GrB on the new substrates and observed that peptides with Ile at P4 were exclusively hydrolyzed by GrB (TJ40–44), while substrates with other selected amino acids, such as Tic (TJ2, TJ4, TJ6, and TJ35–39) and l-His (3-Bom) (TJ3 and TJ30–34), were not recognized by GrB under these assay conditions. Additionally, we confirmed that sequences containing l-Nle (O-Bzl) or l-Oic at S2 were preferred by GrB, confirming the large size of S2 (Fig. S4A). With this in mind, we performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the most hydrolyzed and promising substrates, namely, TJ40 (Ac-Ile-Glu-Oic-Asp-ACC), TJ41 (Ac-Ile-Glu-Hyp [Bzl]-Asp-ACC), TJ42 (Ac-Ile-Glu-Tic-Asp-ACC), TJ43 (Ac-Ile-Glu-His [Bzl]-Asp-ACC), and TJ44 (Ac-Ile-Glu-Nle [O-Bzl]-Asp-ACC) (Fig. S4), and we compared those results with those of reference substrate TJ7 (Ac-Ile-Glu-Pro-Asp-ACC). Substrates TJ40, TJ43, and TJ44 were cleaved more rapidly by GrB than was TJ7, and their kinetic constants were kcat/Km = 379.09 m−1 s−1, 267.89 m−1 s−1, and 685.51 m−1 s−1, respectively, and that of the reference is kcat/Km = 76.95 m−1 s−1 (Fig. S4B). This was in agreement with our initial substrate screening (Fig. S4A). Since l-Oic and other proline derivatives are poorly or not recognized by caspases (10Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P.

The optimization of the P4–P1 GrB peptide sequence resulted in a champion substrate that is well recognized by GrB and is less likely to show cross-reactivity with other granzymes and caspases. From the broad range of investigated amino acids, we selected the most promising structures (l-Lys [TFA], l-Nva, l-Ile, l-Phe [2-Cl], and l-hPhe), and we synthesized ten defined pentapeptide substrates, incorporating the sequences previously selected for P4–P1 (l-Ile-l-Glu-l-Oic/l-Nle [O-Bzl]-l-Asp). After an initial screening of GrB activities against the new substrates (TJ46–TJ56) (Fig. 1C), we selected substrates TJ47, TJ49, TJ52, and TJ55 as being hydrolyzed with the highest efficiency, and we studied their kinetics in detail (Fig. 1D). Substrate TJ49 possesses the lowest Km value (32.33 μm) and, at the same time, the highest kcat parameter (0.152 s−1), with 40% higher activity (kcat/Km of 4960 m−1 s−1) than that of the optimal tetrapeptide. Exchanging l-Nle (O-Bzl) at P2 (in TJ49) for l-Oic (affording TJ55) caused the enzyme activity to decrease by approximately a factor of four; however, we used this sequence in further analyses to minimize the cross-reactivity with the majority of caspases (17Poreba M.

https://openalex.org/W3027752863,"Agonist stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) typically leads to phosphorylation of GPCRs and binding to multifunctional proteins called β-arrestins (βarrs). The GPCR-βarr interaction critically contributes to GPCR desensitization, endocytosis, and downstream signaling, and GPCR-βarr complex formation can be used as a generic readout of GPCR and βarr activation. Although several methods are currently available to monitor GPCR-βarr interactions, additional sensors to visualize them may expand the toolbox and complement existing methods. We have previously described antibody fragments (FABs) that recognize activated βarr1 upon its interaction with the vasopressin V2 receptor C-terminal phosphopeptide (V2Rpp). Here, we demonstrate that these FABs efficiently report the formation of a GPCR-βarr1 complex for a broad set of chimeric GPCRs harboring the V2R C terminus. We adapted these FABs to an intrabody format by converting them to single-chain variable fragments and used them to monitor the localization and trafficking of βarr1 in live cells. We observed that upon agonist simulation of cells expressing chimeric GPCRs, these intrabodies first translocate to the cell surface, followed by trafficking into intracellular vesicles. The translocation pattern of intrabodies mirrored that of βarr1, and the intrabodies co-localized with βarr1 at the cell surface and in intracellular vesicles. Interestingly, we discovered that intrabody sensors can also report βarr1 recruitment and trafficking for several unmodified GPCRs. Our characterization of intrabody sensors for βarr1 recruitment and trafficking expands currently available approaches to visualize GPCR-βarr1 binding, which may help decipher additional aspects of GPCR signaling and regulation."

However, the physiological conditions that govern purinosome formation in cells remain unknown. Here, we report that purinosome formation is up-regulated in cells in response to a low-oxygen microenvironment (hypoxia). We demonstrate that increased purinosome assembly in hypoxic human cells requires the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and not HIF-2. Hypoxia-driven purinosome assembly was inhibited in cells lacking 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), a single enzyme in de novo purine biosynthesis, and in cells treated with a small molecule inhibitor of ATIC homodimerization. However, despite the increase in purinosome assembly in hypoxia, we observed no associated increase in de novo purine biosynthesis in cells. Our results indicate that this was likely due to a reduction in mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism, resulting in reduced mitochondrion-derived one-carbon units needed for de novo purine biosynthesis.

The findings of our study further clarify and deepen our understanding of purinosome formation by revealing that this process does not solely depend on cellular purine demand. Purines are more than just the building blocks for DNA and RNA; they are key metabolites that are critical for cellular function. Purines constitute the cellular energy unit ATP, the key signaling molecule GTP, and the substrates and cofactors for a variety of cellular pathways. There are two paths for purine production in cells: recycling of existing bases via a salvage pathway and de novo synthesis of the purine precursor inosine monophosphate (IMP) from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) by six enzymes in 10 steps. Purine salvage is the predominant path for purine production in nonmalignant human cells as it is more resource efficient (1Murray A.W. The biological significance of purine salvage.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1971; 40 (4330582): 811-82610.1146/annurev.bi.40.070171.004115Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that during periods of rapid cell growth, the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway is up-regulated, but little is known about other factors that affect the balance between these two pathways (1Murray A.W. The biological significance of purine salvage.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1971; 40 (4330582): 811-82610.1146/annurev.bi.40.070171.004115Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As with other multienzyme pathways, it is difficult to explain the intracellular kinetics of de novo purine biosynthesis and the chemical stability of several intermediates if the six enzymes of this pathway were randomly dispersed within the cytosol. The association of these enzymes in a functional multienzyme complex or “metabolon” has therefore been a longstanding hypothesis. Using a combination of microscopy-based techniques, the six de novo purine biosynthetic enzymes were shown to assemble into a dynamic complex in cells named the purinosome, in response to purine depletion from the cell culture medium (2An S.

One physiological factor that significantly alters cell metabolism is hypoxia. Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is orchestrated by HIF-1, a heterodimeric transcription factor that is composed of an oxygen-regulated α-subunit and a constitutively expressed β-subunit (9Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is a basic-helix-loop-helix-Pas heterodimer regulated by cellular O-2 tension.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is a basic-helix-loop-helix-Pas heterodimer regulated by cellular O-2 tension.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Prolyl hydroxylase enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of two proline residues (Pro-402 and Pro-564) using oxygen as a substrate, marking HIF-1α for ubiquitination and degradation (10Ivan M. Kondo K.

This process does not occur in the absence of molecular oxygen, the substrate for the enzyme, leading to the rapid build-up of HIF-1α and its translocation to the nucleus, where its binds to HIF-1β to form the active HIF-1 transcription factor. Thus, the HIF-1 response to hypoxia is near instantaneous, with HIF-1α both sensing and responding to reduced cellular oxygen levels. HIF-1 enables cellular adaptation to hypoxia by reprogramming the expression of hundreds of genes, including those associated with several metabolic pathways (12Benita Y. Kikuchi H. Smith A.D.

Up-regulation of glycolysis and PPP in hypoxia serves to increase metabolites that feed into various pathways to synthesize key molecules required for cell proliferation (21Tong X.M. Zhao F.P. Thompson C.B. The molecular determinants of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in cancer cells.Curr. Opin. Genet.

As purinosome formation has been correlated to increased de novo purine biosynthesis, and considering the significant metabolic reprogramming that occurs in hypoxic cells, we hypothesized that a hypoxic environment would lead to increased purinosome formation in cells. We first investigated the possibility that hypoxia enhances the assembly of the multienzyme purinosome complex. HeLa cells were transfected with a construct encoding formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase (FGAMS), which catalyzes step 4 of de novo purine biosynthesis, as a fusion with the fluorescent protein mCherry (FGAMS-mCherry). These cells were cultured for 24 h in hypoxia (1% environmental oxygen) in the presence of purines (so far, purinosome formation had only been observed in cells cultured in purine-depleted media), and the degree of purinosome formation, as noted by enzyme clustering into distinct punctate structures, was assessed by fluorescence microscopy (2An S.

We observed 40% of cells showing the clustering of FGAMS-mCherry in response to hypoxia compared with the 19% of cells in normoxia (Fig. 1, a and c). This was comparable with the ∼2-fold increase in purinosome-containing cells observed when cells were cultured in purine-depleted medium in normoxia (Fig. 1c). This experiment was repeated with ADSL, which catalyzes step 8 of de novo purine biosynthesis, tagged with GFP (ADSL-EGFP). Similar to that of FGAMS-mCherry, we observed a 2-fold increase in cells showing clustering of ADSL-EGFP in hypoxia (Fig. 1, b and d). Colocalization analysis between FGAMS-mCherry and ADSL-EGFP by confocal microscopy showed a high degree of colocalization in hypoxia (Pearson’s coefficient of 0.83) and was validated by three-dimensional volume reconstitution showing clear isolated peaks within the cytoplasm, supporting the notion that purinosomes form in response to hypoxia (Fig. S1, a and b). The number of fluorescent clusters per cell was next measured using HeLa cells transfected with either FGAMS-mCherry or ADSL-EGFP (24Chan C.Y. Zhao H. Pugh R.J. Pedley A.M. French J. Jones S.A.

We found that the number of clusters per cell varied between 6 and 220 with the median being 42 clusters per cell (Fig. 1e). In addition, we analyzed the diameter of the clusters and found that these ranged from 0.6 to 1.9 μm, with an average diameter of 0.96 ± 0.25 μm (Fig. 1e). To ensure that our observation of hypoxia-mediated purinosome formation was not cell line-specific, we transfected the plasmid encoding FGAMS-mCherry in MDA-MB-231 cells and observed an increase in purinosome-positive cells in hypoxia similar to that observed in HeLa (Fig. S2, a and c).

No overlap in the signals from these two markers was observed (Pearson’s coefficient of −0.003), indicating that the observed clusters of FGAMS-mCherry in hypoxia are not associated with stress granules (Fig. S1c). In addition, we assessed whether hypoxia increases the number of stress granule-positive cells (Fig. S1d). We observed comparable numbers of cells containing stress granules in normoxia and hypoxia, indicating that the formation of the purinosome complexes in hypoxia is not a result of enhanced cellular stress. Previous reports note that the formation of the purinosome complex correlates to the cell cycle, reaching a maximum in G1 phase (22Chan C.Y. Zhao H. Pugh R.J. Pedley A.M. French J. Jones S.A. Zhuang X. Jinnah H. Huang T.J. Benkovic S.J. Purinosome formation as a function of the cell cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112 (25605889): 1368-137310.1073/pnas.1423009112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore quantified purinosome formation in the G1 phase of synchronized HeLa cells in hypoxia, however, we observed a similar ratio of purinosome containing cells in hypoxia (28%) as when using nonsynchronized cells (Fig. S1e). To verify that hypoxia-induced purinosome formation occurs on the endogenous level, we developed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) to visualize and quantify the association of pathway enzymes, FGAMS and ADSL, within purinosomes (27Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F. Larsson L.G. Landegren U. Direct observation of individual endogenous protein complexes in situ by proximity ligation.Nat Methods. 2006; 3 (17072308): 995-100010.1038/nmeth947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). As this method probes endogenous proteins, any observed clustering of these enzymes cannot be a consequence of their transient overexpression nor due to interactions between the fluorescent protein tag(s). We observed 88% of hypoxic cells having a colocalization between FGAMS and ADSL, whereas few (10%) normoxic cells showed colocalization (Fig. 1, f and g). As a positive control, we confirmed an association of endogenous FGAMS and ADSL in 87% of normoxic cells cultured in purine-depleted medium (Fig. 1, f and g). To further support this, we assessed the colocalization of FGAMS and GART (a trifunctional protein that catalyses steps 2, 3, and 5 of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway), and observed an increase in the number of PLA signal-positive cells in hypoxia (81%) compared with normoxia (4%) (Fig. S1, f and g), which is in line with the results observed for ADSL and FGAMS. These data suggest that a substantially higher subset of cells form purinosomes in hypoxia (and in purine-depleted normoxia) than observed when using fluorescently-tagged proteins (88 versus 40%). This may be a consequence of the need for multiple copies of a given fluorescently tagged proteins to be present in a purinosome cluster before it can be observed by fluorescent microscopy. Alternatively, the presence of the fluorescent protein may impede complete purinosome formation or be less favorable than the complexation of endogenous proteins. Together the above data demonstrates that purinosome assembly is up-regulated by hypoxia in HeLa cells. HIF-1 plays a central role in the cellular hypoxia response, and we therefore sought to assess whether activation of HIF-1 correlates with purinosome formation in hypoxia. HeLa cells transiently expressing FGAMS-EGFP were treated with HIF-1α siRNA prior to incubation in hypoxia for 24 h. Consistent with before, a 2-fold increase in purinosome formation was observed in hypoxic cells (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2a); however, in cells lacking HIF-1α, purinosome formation was not detected (Fig. 2a). The role of HIF-1 in this process was further probed using desferrioxamine (DFX), which chemically stabilizes HIF-1α in normoxia (28Woo K.J. Lee T.J. Park J.W. Kwon T.K. Desferrioxamine, an iron chelator, enhances HIF-1alpha accumulation via cyclooxygenase-2 signaling pathway.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343 (16527254): 8-1410.1016/j.bbrc.2006.02.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If purinosome formation in hypoxia is mediated through HIF-1α stabilization, then DFX treatment will be sufficient to enhance purinosome formation in normoxia. We observed a ∼3-fold increase in purinosome formation in DFX-treated cells cultured in normoxia (Fig. 2a). The isoform specificity of HIF-1 in promoting purinosome formation was probed using 786-O cells, which under hypoxic conditions use the HIF-2α isoform, instead of HIF-1α, and the HIF-2 transcription factor (29Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. The tumour suppressor protein VHL targets hypoxia-inducible factors for oxygen-dependent proteolysis.Nature. 1999; 399 (10353251): 271-27510.1038/20459Crossref PubMed Scopus (4117) Google Scholar). We did not observe any hypoxia-driven increase in purinosome formation in these cells (Fig. S2, b and c). To ensure that our data were not a result of an inherent inability of 786-O cells to form purinosomes, we incubated these cells under normoxic purine-depleted conditions and observed a ∼6-fold increase in purinosome formation (Fig. S2b). This confirms the necessity of the HIF-1α isoform in driving purinosome formation in hypoxic cells, and this phenomenon is not replaceable with the HIF-2α isoform. To further probe the link between HIF-1α stabilization in hypoxia and purinosome formation, we carried out a time course experiment. Purinosome assembly and HIF-1α levels were assessed in HeLa cells incubated under hypoxic conditions at intervals over a 10 h period. We observed a ∼50% reduction in the number of purinosome-containing cells within the first 2 h of hypoxia exposure followed by a steady increase where it eventually levelled off after 8-10 h (Fig. 2b, Video S1). During the same time course, HIF-1α protein levels showed the highest expression at 3 h and gradually decreased over time (Fig. 2c), consistent with prior reports (30Asby D.J. Cuda F. Hoakwie F. Miranda E. Tavassoli A. HIF-1 promotes the expression of its α-subunit via an epigenetically regulated transactivation loop.Mol.

However, this reduction in HIF-1α did not alter the number of cells containing purinosomes (Fig. 2b), presumably because the downstream effects of HIF-1α activation persist. Purinosomes are highly dynamic structures that readily dissipate in response to high purine levels in culturing media (2An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J. Reversible compartmentalization of de novo purine biosynthetic complexes in living cells.Science. 2008; 320 (18388293): 103-10610.1126/science.1152241Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether purinosomes formed in hypoxic cells were similarly dynamic and could be disrupted by reoxygenation. After 10 h in hypoxia, cells were reincubated in normoxia for 2 h, and the number of purinosome containing cells counted. Upon reoxygenation, the ratio of purinosome-containing cells had reverted back to normoxic levels (Fig. 2b), demonstrating the reversible and transient nature of this multienzyme complex. Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is driven by HIF-1–mediated transcription of multiple genes, several of which encode metabolic enzymes (14Greijer A.E. van der Groep P. Kemming D. Shvarts A. Semenza G.L. Meijer G.A. van de Wiel M.A. Belien J.A.M. van Diest P.J. van der Wall E. Up-regulation of gene expression by hypoxia is mediated predominantly by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1).J.

We therefore assessed whether the observed increase in purinosome formation in hypoxia is a result of an up-regulation in gene or protein expression of its enzymes. The expression levels of the six genes encoding the enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis remained unchanged after exposure to hypoxia for 24 h (Fig. 2d). Protein expression by immunoblotting also showed no changes in the levels of the purinosome enzymes except for a slight increase in intracellular ATIC protein levels (Fig. 2e). These data eliminated the possibility that the increase in purinosome formation under hypoxic conditions is caused by an up-regulation in transcription or translation of the enzymes within the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. It has been previously demonstrated that the formation of the purinosome complex is disrupted in cells lacking one of the enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis or by introducing loss-of-function mutations in ADSL and/or ATIC (7Baresova V.

We used Cpd14 to probe whether disruption of ATIC homodimerization leads to inhibition of purinosome formation in hypoxia.

In both cases, treatment with Cpd14 prevented hypoxia- and DFX-induced purinosome formation (Fig. 3a). Similarly, purinosome formation was assessed in an ATIC knockout HeLa cell line (33Baresova V.

The objective of this study was to describe the changes in the cecal and fecal microbiomes and metabolomes of clinically healthy horses before and after metronidazole administration. Metronidazole (15 mg/kg BID PO) was given to five horses with cecal cannulas. The study was suspended on Day 3 due to adverse gastrointestinal effects. Cecal and fecal samples were obtained before (Days minus52, m28, m14, and 0) and after (Days 7, 14, 28, and 52) metronidazole administration. DNA was extracted from the cecal and fecal samples, and 16S rRNA genes were sequenced. Richness and evenness indices were significantly decreased by metronidazole administration in both cecal and fecal samples, but the overall composition was only significantly changed in fecal samples on Day 3 (ANOSIM, p = 0.008). The most dominant phyla were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in all groups examined. In fecal samples, significant changes of the phyla Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, Lentisphaerae, and Verrucomicrobia occurred on Day 3, which correlated with clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. The metabolome was characterized by mass spectrometry-based methods and only named metabolites were included in the analysis. Fecal, but not cecal, metabolites were significantly affected by metronidazole. The fecal metabolites affected represent diverse metabolic pathways, such as the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and cofactors and vitamins. Metronidazole administration has potential to cause adverse effects in horses, alters the bacterial composition of the horse’s cecal and fecal content, and the metabolome of fecal samples."

The degree of oxidation level and polar compounds were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) with the principal component analysis and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Two FTIR absorption peaks were used for the oil evaluation, namely 3007–3009 cm-1, which is related to C-H symmetric stretching vibration of the cis double bonds, and ~1743 cm-1, which is related to = CH and ester carbonyl stretching vibration of the functional groups of the triglycerides, C = O. The principal component analysis results showed significant variations in the oxidation level of the sunflower and the corn oils occurred after consecutive heating and French fries frying for 10 days. The oxidation products that are adsorbed on the surface of the OSAC forms π-complexes with the C = C parts of the OSAC system. It can be concluded that the prepared adsorbents can be promising, efficient, economically effective, and environmentally friendly alternative adsorbents for oil treatment applications."

Anthropometric and physical fitness characteristics were collected from a convenience sample of 30472 Italian schoolchildren (6-11 years old). Six field-based tests were used: Léger, agility shuttle, long jump, frontal throw of the basketball, Sit & Reach and standing balance. Significant differences were found in the anthropometric characteristics, physical fitness and weight status prevalence between girls and boys (p<0.05) and, except for flexibility, by age class (p<0.05). Obese children performed worse than their NW counterparts in aerobic capacity (p<0.001), agility (p<0.001), muscular power of the lower limb (p<0.001) and balance (p<0.001). Conversely, children with obesity showed greater upper limb power than NW children (p<0.001). The discrepancy in physical fitness between OB and NW children increased in older girls (flexibility, p = 0.002; muscular power of the lower and upper limb, p = 0.002 and p = 0.005) and boys (aerobic capacity, p = 0.009; agility, p = 0.006; standing balance, p = 0.019; muscular power of the lower and upper limb, p<0.001 and p = 0.011) compared to their younger counterparts. On the other hand, UW children performed worse than NW children mainly in terms of muscular power of the arms (p<0.001). Additionally, there was an increasing disparity in the frontal throw test scores of UW and NW girls (p = 0.003) and boys (p = 0.011) in older children compared to younger children. In conclusion, the effect of body mass index on children's physical fitness intensifies with age. OB and OW negatively affect aerobic capacity, agility, lower limb power and balance but positively affect upper limb power. UW negatively affects upper limb power. This study underscores the importance of preventing childhood OW, OB, and UW in early life to promote children's health and proper fitness development."

We retrospectively reviewed patients with HCV-related HCC in a single medical center, and the outcome of patients with or without DAA therapy was analyzed. In total, 107 HCC patients were enrolled, of whom 60 had received DAA therapy after treatment for HCC. There were no significant intergroup differences in age, sex, laboratory results, or tumor burden. A more advanced stage was noted in the no DAA group (P = 0.003). In the treatment modality, sorafenib was commonly prescribed in the no DAA group (P = 0.007). The DAA group had a longer overall survival (OS) time than the no DAA group (P<0.001). When stratified by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging, the DAA group had better OS in the HCC stages 0-A and B-C (P = 0.034 and P = 0.006). There were 35 patients who received DAA therapy after curative HCC therapy. At a median follow-up of 20 months, 37.1% patients had HCC recurrence after DAA therapy. There was no statistical difference in recurrence-free survival between patients receiving and those not receiving DAA (P = 0.278). DAA therapy improved the survival outcome of HCC patients and did not increase recurrent HCC after curative therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3027746149,"Background MicroRNAs (miRs) control gene expression and the development of the immune system and antiviral responses. MiR-155 is an evolutionarily-conserved molecule consistently induced during viral infections in different cell systems. Notably, there is still an unresolved paradox for the role of miR-155 during viral respiratory infections. Despite being essential for host antiviral TH1 immunity, miR-155 may also contribute to respiratory disease by enhancing allergic TH2 responses and NFkB-mediated inflammation. The central goal of this study was to define how airway miR-155 production is related to TH1, TH2, and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during naturally occurring viral respiratory infections in young children. Methods Normalized nasal airway levels of miR-155 and nasal protein levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-13, IL-4 were quantified in young children (≤2 years) hospitalized with viral respiratory infections and uninfected controls. These data were linked to individual characteristics and respiratory disease parameters. Results A total of 151 subjects were included. Increased miR-155 levels were observed in nasal samples from patients with rhinovirus, RSV and all respiratory viruses analyzed. High miR-155 levels were strongly associated with high IFN-γ production, increased airway TH1 cytokine polarization (IFN-γ/IL-4 ratios) and increased pro-inflammatory responses. High airway miR-155 levels were linked to decreased respiratory disease severity in individuals with high airway TH1 antiviral responses. Conclusions The airway secretion of miR-155 during viral respiratory infections in young children is associated with enhanced antiviral immunity (TH1 polarization). Further studies are needed to define additional physiological roles of miR-155 in the respiratory tract of human infants and young children during health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W3026788199,"Introduction Depression is a global burden that is exacerbated by smoking. The association between depression and chronic smoking is well-known; however, existing findings contain possible confounding between nicotine dependence (ND), a latent construct measuring addiction, and objective smoking behavior. The current study examines the possible unique role of ND in explaining depression, independently of smoking behavior. Methods A nationally-representative sample of current adult daily smokers was drawn by pooling three independent, cross-sectional, biennial waves (spanning 2011–16) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The association between ND (operationally defined as time to first cigarette (TTFC) after waking) and the amount of depression symptoms was examined after adjusting for both current and lifetime smoking behaviors (cigarettes per day and years of smoking duration) and sociodemographic factors (gender, age, race, education and income to poverty ratio). Results Earlier TTFC was associated with more depression symptoms, such that those smoking within 5 minutes of waking had an approximately 1.6-fold higher depression score (PRR = 1.576, 95% CI = 1.324–1.687) relative to those who smoke more than 1 hour after waking. This relationship remained significant after adjusting for current and lifetime smoking behavior as well as sociodemographic factors (PRR = 1.370, 95% CI = 1.113, 1.687). Conclusions The latent construct of ND, as assessed by TTFC, may be associated with an additional risk for depression symptoms, beyond that conveyed by smoking behavior alone. This finding can be used for more refined risk prediction for depression among smokers."

We applied urinary metabolomics to explore differences associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; CKD-EPI equation) and future eGFR decline. Methods Targeted, quantitative metabolic profiling (1H NMR-spectroscopy) was performed on baseline spot urine samples obtained from 501 patients with ADPKD. The discovery cohort consisted of 338 patients (56% female, median values for age 46 [IQR 38 to 52] years, eGFR 62 [IQR 45 to 85] ml/min/1.73m2, follow-up time 2.5 [range 1 to 3] years, and annual eGFR slope –3.3 [IQR –5.3 to –1.3] ml/min/1.73m2/year). An independent cohort (n = 163) was used for validation. Multivariate modelling and linear regression were used to analyze the associations between urinary metabolites and eGFR, and eGFR decline over time. Results Twenty-nine known urinary metabolites were quantified from the spectra using a semi-automatic quantification routine. The model optimization routine resulted in four metabolites that most strongly associated with actual eGFR in the discovery cohort (F = 128.9, P = 7×10−54, R2 = 0.724). A model using the ratio of two other metabolites, urinary alanine/citrate, showed the best association with future annual change in eGFR (F = 51.07, P = 7.26×10−12, R2 = 0.150). This association remained significant after adjustment for clinical risk markers including height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV). Results were confirmed in the validation cohort. Conclusions Quantitative NMR profiling identified urinary metabolic markers that associated with actual eGFR and future rate of eGFR decline. The urinary alanine/citrate ratio showed additional value beyond conventional risk markers."
https://openalex.org/W3026701260,"Recently-emerged base editing technologies could create single base mutations at precise genomic positions without generation DNA double strand breaks. Herbicide resistant mutations have been successfully introduced to different plant species, including Arabidopsis, watermelon, wheat, potato and tomato via C to T (or G to A on the complementary strand) base editors (CBE) at the P197 position of endogenous acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes. Additionally, G to A conversion to another conserved amino acid S653 on ALS gene could confer tolerance to imidazolinone herbicides. However, no such mutation was successfully generated via CBE, likely due to the target C base is outside of the classic base editing window. Since CBE driven by egg cell (EC) specific promoter would re-edit the wild type alleles in egg cells and early embryos, we hypothesized the diversity of base editing outcomes could be largely increased at later generations to allow selection of desired herbicide resistant mutants. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to introduce C to T conversion to the complement strand of S653 codon at ALS gene, hosting a C at the 10th position within the 20-nt spacer sequence outside of the classic base editing window. While we did not detect base-edited T1 plants, efficient and diverse base edits emerged at later generations. Herbicide resistant mutants with different editing outcomes were recovered when T3 and T4 seeds were subject to herbicide selection. As expected, most herbicide resistant plants contained S653N mutation as a result of G10 to A10. Our results showed that CBE could create imidazolinone herbicide resistant trait in Arabidopsis and be potentially applied to crops to facilitate weed control."

Differentiation of viable and nonviable virus would expand the usefulness of PCR-based detection. This study tested three treatments (1. DNAse, 2. propidium monoazide [PMA], 3. immunomagnetic separation [IMS]) applied to dust or virus stock prior to nucleic acid extraction for their ability to exclude nonviable virus from PCR amplification. Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) was used as a model. These treatments assume loss of viral viability due to damage to the capsid or to denaturation of epitope proteins. DNAse and PMA assess the integrity of the capsid to penetration by enzyme or intercalating dye, while IMS assesses the integrity of epitope proteins. Treatments were evaluated for their ability to reduce PCR signal, measured as ILTV log10 genomic copies (ILTV GC), of heat and chemically inactivated ILTV in poultry dust and virus stock. Compared to untreated dust samples, there was an overall reduction of 1.7 ILTV GC after IMS treatment (p<0.01), and a reduction of 2.0 ILTV GC after PMA treatment (p<0.0001). DNAse treatment did not reduce ILTV GC in dust (p = 0.68). Compared to untreated virus stocks, there was an overall reduction of 0.5 ILTV GC after DNAse treatment (p = 0.04), a reduction of 1.8 ILTV GC after IMS treatment (p<0.001) and a reduction of 1.4 ILTV GC after PMA treatment (p<0.0001). None of the treatments completely suppressed the detection of inactivated ILTV GC. In conclusion, treatments that use capsid integrity or protein epitope denaturation as markers to assess ILTV infectivity are unsuitable to accurately estimate proportions of viable virus in poultry dust and virus stocks."

Neglected and underutilized crops may play a role in mitigating and addressing such challenges. Breadfruit is a long-lived tree crop that is a nutritious, carbohydrate-rich staple, which is a priority crop in this regard. A fuzzy-set modeling approach was applied, refined, and validated for breadfruit to determine its current and future potential productivity. Hawai'i was used as a model system, with over 1,200 naturalized trees utilized to calibrate a habitat suitability model and 56 producer sites used to validate the model. The parameters were then applied globally on 17 global climate models at the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 global climate projections for 2070. Overall, breadfruit suitability increases in area and in quality, with larger increases occurring in the RCP 8.5 projection. Current producing regions largely remain unchanged in both projections, indicating relative stability of production potential in current growing regions. Breadfruit, and other tropical indigenous food crops present strong opportunities for cultivation and food security risk management strategies moving forward."

Methods The cohort comprised adult patients who started ART between 2001 and 2007 and followed for up to 15 years. Clinical data were collected in retrospective manner. Patients with an AIDS defining illness or a CD4 count <200 cell/μL were started with a combination of ART. The participants have clinic visits every 6 months and/or as needed. Poisson regression models were used to identify factors associated with development of incident TB. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the probability of incident TB while on ART. Results A total of 347 patients with a median duration of follow-up on ART of 11.5 (IQR: 10.0–12.5) years were included. Incident TB developed in 47 patients during the 3259 person-years of follow-up, the majority (76.6%) occurred within five year of ART initiation. On univariate analysis, poor ART adherence (RR:2.57, 95% CI: 1.28–5.17), time-updated CD4 cell count of lower than 200 (RR: 4.86, 95%CI 2.33–10.15), or CD4 cell count between 200 and 500 (RR: 4.68, 95% CI: 2.17–10.09), time-updated CD8 cell count lower than 500 (RR: 2.83 95% CI 1.31–6.10), or CD8 cell count over 1000 (RR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.12–4.45), time-updated CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.30 (RR: 6.00, 95% CI: 2.96–12.14), lack of normalization of CD4 T-cell count (RR: 6.13, 95% CI: 2.20–17.07), and virological failure (RR: 2.35 (95% CI: 1.17–4.71) were all associated with increased risk of incident TB. In multivariate analysis, however, time-updated CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.30 (adjusted RR: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.31–12.68) was the only factor associated with increased risk of developing incident TB (p = 0.015). Similar results were obtained in a sensitivity analysis by including only those virally suppressed patients (n = 233, 69% of all patients). In this group, CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.30 was associated with development of incident TB (adjusted RR: 4.02, 95% CI: 1.14–14.19, p = 0.031). Overall, the incidence rate of TB in patients with an updated CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.30 was more than 5-fold higher when compared with those with a ratio more than 0.45. Conclusion Low CD4/CD8 ratio is independently associated with an increased risk of incident TB despite viral suppression. CD4/CD8 ratio may serve as a biomarker for identifying patients at risk of TB in patients on ART in the setting of SSA."
https://openalex.org/W3027301087,"Background Tuberculosis [TB] is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease in the world. Intensifying tuberculosis screening and contact investigation strategy is recommended to ensure early diagnosis among household contacts of TB patients. Studies showed that there is low TB contact tracing. There was limited evidence on barriers and facilitators of household contact tracing. Therefore, this study was aimed at exploring barriers and facilitators for household contact tracing of index TB cases. Methods A descriptive qualitative study was conducted at Anlemo district, Hadiya zone, Ethiopia from March 12-April 9, 2019. Purposive sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. A total of 16 participants were involved in the study which included health extension workers [HEWs], index TB patients, household contacts of TB patients, health center TB focal and district TB coordinator. Data were collected through in-depth interviews using a semi-structured guide, transcribed verbatim and translated into English. Inductive thematic analysis was employed using ATLAS.ti7.1 software and the findings were presented on major themes, categories, and quotations. Results This study found low TB contact tracing and investigation, and explored barriers and facilitators such as monitoring and supervision, training of health workers, logistics and infrastructure, waiting time and institutional readiness, referral, feedback and linkage, human resource, charge for some laboratory, transportation, budget, knowledge, commitment and motivation, workload, distance, social support, economic constrain, and stigma and discrimination for household contact tracing of index TB cases under four themes. Conclusions From this study, it was understood that there was a gap in addressing all household contacts. Also, the study explored a wide range of possible barriers and facilitators for it. Explored barriers outweigh the facilitators which might have an implication facilitating the dissemination of TB silently within the community. This underscores the importance of taking action to avert those barriers by developing different strategies to increase TB contact tracing. Therefore, health care providers should have to improve the implementation of contact tracing by designing and developing appropriate strategies that should fit the local context."

We identified IgE-binding monocytes in equine peripheral blood as IgE+/MHCIIhigh/CD14low cells that bind IgE through an FcεRI αɣ variant. IgE-binding monocytes were analyzed monthly in Culicoides hypersensitive horses and nonallergic horses living together with natural exposure to Culicoides midges. The phenotype and frequency of IgE-binding monocytes remained consistent in all horses regardless of Culicoides exposure. All horses upregulated IgE-binding monocyte CD16 expression following initial Culicoides exposure. Serum total IgE concentration and monocyte surface IgE densities were positively correlated in all horses. We also demonstrated that IgE-binding monocytes produce IL-10, but not IL-4, IL-17A, or IFN-γ, following IgE crosslinking. In conclusion, we have characterized horse IgE-binding monocytes for the first time and further studies of these cells may provide important connections between regulation and cellular mechanisms of IgE-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3027478509,"Natural history collections and tropical tree diversity are both treasure troves of biological and evolutionary information, but their accessibility for scientific study is impeded by a number of properties. DNA in historical specimens is generally highly fragmented, complicating the recovery of high-grade genetic material. Furthermore, our understanding of hyperdiverse, wide-spread tree assemblages is obstructed by extensive species ranges, fragmented knowledge of tropical tree diversity and phenology, and a widespread lack of species-level diagnostic characters, prohibiting the collecting of readily identifiable specimens which can be used to build, revise or strengthen taxonomic frameworks. This, in turn, delays the application of downstream conservation action. A sizable component of botanical collections are sterile—thus eluding identification and are slowing down progress in systematic treatments of tropical biodiversity. With rapid advances in genomics and bioinformatic approaches to biodiversity research, museomics is emerging as a new field breathing life into natural collections that have been built up over centuries. Using MIGseq (multiplexed ISSR genotyping by sequencing), we generated 10,000s of short loci, for both freshly collected materials and museum specimens (aged >100 years) of Lithocarpus—a widespread tropical tree genus endemic to the Asian tropics. Loci recovery from historical and recently collected samples was not affected by sample age and preservation history of the study material, underscoring the reliability and flexibility of the MIGseq approach. Phylogenomic inference and biogeographic reconstruction across insular Asia, highlights repeated migration and diversification patterns between continental regions and islands. Results indicate that co-occurring insular species at the extremity of the distribution range are not monophyletic, raising the possibility of multiple independent dispersals along the outer edge of Wallacea. This suggests that dispersal of large seeded tree genera throughout Malesia and across Wallacea may have been less affected by large geographic distances and the presence of marine barriers than generally assumed. We demonstrate the utility of MIGseq in museomic studies using non-model taxa, presenting the first range-wide genomic assessment of Lithocarpus and tropical Fagaceae as a proof-of-concept. Our study shows the potential for developing innovative genomic approaches to improve the capture of novel evolutionary signals using valuable natural history collections of hyperdiverse taxa."
https://openalex.org/W3028346404,"Introduction Geographical variations in cancer mortality can be explained, in part, by their association with social inequalities. The objective of our study was to analyse the spatial pattern of mortality in relation to the most common causes of cancer in the Spanish autonomous community of Andalusia and its possible association with social inequalities. Materials and methods A small area cross-sectional study in Andalusia, with census tracts as units of spatial analysis, for the period 2002–2013. Cases and person-years, sex and age group came from the Longitudinal Population Database of Andalusia. Standardized mortality rates and smoothed risk ratios were calculated using the Besag, York and Mollié model for lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, bladder and stomach cancer. In order to evaluate the association with social inequalities we included the deprivation index of the census tract as a covariate. Results The results show an East-West mortality pattern with higher risk in the west for lung and bladder cancer among men, and breast cancer among women. For all of Andalusia, the association between deprivation index of the census tract and mortality relative risks is positive and significant for lung, stomach and bladder cancers in men, while in women we observed a negative association for lung cancer and a positive for stomach cancer. Conclusions Knowledge regarding the spatial distribution of cancer mortality and the socioeconomic inequalities related should contribute to the design of specific health and social policies–aimed at tackling cancer mortality and social inequalities in areas of high mortality and/or levels of deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W3028407048,"Most commonly, animal communication systems are driven by shared call repertoires, with some individual distinctiveness encoded as a byproduct of voice cues. We provide evidence that bottlenose dolphins produce both individually distinctive whistles, and a shared whistle type. A stereotyped whistle contour (termed the group whistle) is shared by five bottlenose dolphins that have lived, worked, and traveled together for at least 21 years. These five dolphins are members of a group of eight dolphins that work as a specialized team for the Navy Marine Mammal Program. Each dolphin is routinely recorded during periods when an individual is isolated from the others in above ground pools as part of their routine training. Each of the eight dolphins has an individually distinctive signature whistle. In addition, at least five of these dolphins share a distinct non-signature whistle type. This shared whistle contour was produced an average of 22.4% +/- 9.0% of the time during periods in which individuals were isolated. During these isolations the signature whistle was produced an average of 42.9% +/- 11.9% of the time. This is consistent with decades of signature whistle research. A group of 10 naïve observers rated the similarity of the different whistle contours. The observers rated the group whistle contour produced by all five dolphins as highly similar (P < 0.01). Their ratings further showed that the signature whistles of the five dolphins were very different (P < 0.01). These findings were further supported by discriminant function analyses. That said, the shared whistle contours still exhibited individual differences which may allow conspecifics to identify the producer even when a whistle contour is shared among multiple dolphins. This is the first in-depth analysis of a non-signature whistle type shared among multiple conspecifics."
https://openalex.org/W3028424550,"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a rare complication of acute pulmonary embolism, characterized by non-resolving fibro-thrombotic obstructions of large pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the treatment of choice for the disease, significantly improving survival. Patients with worse hemodynamic profile have worse prognosis after surgery, raising the question of whether the use of medical therapy prior to surgery to optimize hemodynamics could improve outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of medical therapy pre-PEA, according to the hemodynamic profile at the diagnosis. We retrospectively analyzed all patients submitted to PEA, from January 2013 to December 2017. Functional, clinical and hemodynamic data were collected to evaluate the main prognostic determinants. Patients were stratified according to the hemodynamic severity and use of targeted therapies prior to surgery. A total of 108 patients were included. Thirty-five patients (32,4%) used targeted therapy pre-PEA. The use of medical therapy delayed the surgical procedure by about 7 months. There was no difference in overall survival between patients that received targeted therapy and those treated only with supportive therapy (87.8% vs 80.3%, respectively, p = 0.426). Nevertheless, when analyzing the group of patients with severe hemodynamic impairment, defined by low cardiac output(<3.7L/min) at baseline, patients treated with targeted therapies presented a significantly better one-year survival. In higher-risk CTEPH patients, characterized by the presence of low cardiac output, the use of targeted therapies prior to PEA was associated with better outcome, suggesting a potential role for pre-operative use of medical treatment in this particular subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W3028536090,"Introduction The effectiveness of repetitive transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on reducing smoking behaviour has been studied with mixed results. Smoking behaviour is influenced by affect and context, therefore we choose to use mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMA) to measure changes in smoking behaviour after tDCS. Methods In a randomized, placebo-controlled, between subject study, we applied tDCS bilaterally with the anodal electrode targeting the right DLPFC (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03027687). Smokers were allocated to six sessions of either active tDCS (n = 35) or sham tDCS (n = 36) and received two sessions on three different days in one week. They were asked to keep track of their daily cigarette consumption, craving and affect in an application on their mobile phones for three months starting one week before the first tDCS session. Results Number of smoked cigarettes a day progressively decreased up to one week after the last tDCS session in both conditions. Active treatment had no additional effect on cigarette consumption, craving and affect. Conclusions In this exploratory study, repetitive bilateral tDCS over the DLPFC had no effect on daily smoking behaviour. Future research needs to investigate how motivation to quit smoking and the number of tDCS sessions affect the efficacy of repetitive tDCS."
https://openalex.org/W3026650348,"Social media has become an emerging alternative to opinion polls for public opinion collection, while it is still posing many challenges as a passive data source, such as structurelessness, quantifiability, and representativeness. Social media data with geotags provide new opportunities to unveil the geographic locations of users expressing their opinions. This paper aims to answer two questions: 1) whether quantifiable measurement of public opinion can be obtained from social media and 2) whether it can produce better or complementary measures compared to opinion polls. This research proposes a novel approach to measure the relative opinion of Twitter users towards public issues in order to accommodate more complex opinion structures and take advantage of the geography pertaining to the public issues. To ensure that this new measure is technically feasible, a modeling framework is developed including building a training dataset by adopting a state-of-the-art approach and devising a new deep learning method called Opinion-Oriented Word Embedding. With a case study of the tweets selected for the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we demonstrate the predictive superiority of our relative opinion approach and we show how it can aid visual analytics and support opinion predictions. Although the relative opinion measure is proved to be more robust compared to polling, our study also suggests that the former can advantageously complement the later in opinion prediction."

Investigating these areas is needed to understand current PPP management in Japan.To describe the characteristics, medication treatment and health care resource utilization patterns, and associated costs of PPP patients in Japan.A retrospective analysis of insurance claims data was conducted using the Japan Medical Data Center database. Adult Patients with at least two claims with a PPP diagnosis from January 1, 2011 to March 30, 2017 and six months of follow-up after the first diagnosis were included. Patient characteristics described include age, gender, and comorbid conditions. Treatment patterns assessed include the types of treatment, sequence of treatment, and rates of discontinuation, switching, persistence and use of concomitant medications.A total of 5,162 adult patients met all inclusion criteria. Mean (SD) patient age was 49.7 (11.6) years and 43.2% were male. A total of 2441 patients (47.8%) received systemic non-biologic drugs during the entire follow up period, 2,366 (46.4%) were prescribed topical therapy, 273 (5.4%) were prescribed phototherapy, while 18 (0.4%) of patients with other autoimmune comorbidities were eligible for prescribed biologics. For treatment-naïve patients with mild PPP, topical therapy was most commonly (77.1%) prescribed, whereas in moderate to severe cases of PPP, systemic non-biologic drugs (65%) were most often used. The frequency of switching was similar (64.3% to 75.3%) across various therapies and treatment lines.This study describes the treatment patterns and health care resource utilization for Japanese PPP patients using a large claims database, and highlights an unmet need to derive better treatment strategies for PPP and address disease burden in Japan."

Among individuals with type 2 diabetes, ∼30% exhibit hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia has been linked to insulin resistance through reduced tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor; however, its impact on pancreatic β-cell function is unknown. In this study, through analysis of several single-cell RNA-sequencing data sets in tandem with quantitative PCR validation in both murine and human islets, we identified NIPAL1 (NIPA-like domain containing 1), encoding a magnesium influx transporter, as an islet-enriched gene. A series of immunofluorescence experiments confirmed NIPAL1’s magnesium-dependent expression and that it specifically localizes to the Golgi in Min6-K8 cells, a pancreatic β-cell–like cell line (mouse insulinoma 6 clone K8). Under varying magnesium concentrations, NIPAL1 knockdown decreased both basal insulin secretion and total insulin content; in contrast, its overexpression increased total insulin content. Although the expression, distribution, and magnesium responsiveness of NIPAL1 in α-TC6 glucagonoma cells (a pancreatic α-cell line) were similar to the observations in Min6-K8 cells, no effect was observed on glucagon secretion in α-TC6 cells under the conditions studied. Overall, these results suggest that NIPAL1 expression is regulated by extracellular magnesium and that down-regulation of this transporter decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and intracellular insulin content, particularly under conditions of hypomagnesemia.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that pancreatic Mg2+ perfusion inhibits both insulin and glucagon secretion, because of magnesium’s capacity to disrupt critical Ca2+ binding and Ca2+ channel activity; this, in turn, alters the sensitivity of these cells to glucose (31Bergsten P.

The effect of magnesium becomes even more complicated in vivo. One study demonstrated that magnesium-deficient rats develop significantly elevated blood-glucose values versus pair-fed controls (35McNeill D.A. Herbein J.H. Ritchey S.J.

The relevance of Mg2+ to islet function thus remains poorly understood. In this study, several recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and whole-islet RNA-seq studies were explored to discover novel islet-specific proteins. Through this process, magnesium transporter NIPAL1 (NIPA-like domain containing 1) was identified in islets and subsequently investigated in vitro to determine its relation to pancreatic β-cell function. A sequential discovery process was designed to identify novel gene transcripts in pancreatic islets (i.e. α- and β-cells) and determine their influence in the secretion of insulin, glucagon, or both (Fig. S1). In the candidate selection phase, 915 candidates were independently investigated and ultimately filtered down into a final shortlist of 28 genes (Fig. 1). The specific publications, data sets, and preprocessing and selection strategies used can be found under “Experimental procedures.” The 28 shortlisted genes were investigated in both human and mouse tissues (i.e. liver, kidney, islets, and exocrine pancreas) through quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to identify those with significant islet enrichment. The transcripts that demonstrated statistically significant higher expression in mouse islets versus liver, kidney, and pancreas include Nipal1, Syt13, Fam159b, Vat1l, Syt4, Tm4sf4, and Tspan13 (Fig. 2A). In humans, candidates that demonstrated statistically significant higher expression in islets versus liver and pancreas include NIPAL4, IGSF11, NIPAL1, CYSTM1, and BEST3 (Fig. 2B). Of all the genes investigated, magnesium transporter NIPAL1 was the only candidate found to be statistically significant in islets versus all other tissues in both species and was thus selected for further characterization and functional investigation using both mouse pancreatic α and β-cell lines (summarized in Fig. 3A).Figure 2Shortlisted candidate gene expression was measured in mouse (A) and human (B) tissues via qPCR, with results split into low and high value graphs. In mice, expression was determined in islets, liver, kidney, and exocrine pancreas. In humans, expression was measured in islets, liver, and exocrine pancreas. Raw expression values were normalized to β-actin and then displayed as fold expression over pancreas. The results were then organized by decreasing fold islet expression, after controls PEPCK (liver), OAT3 (kidney), and KCNJ11 (islet). Candidates that were significantly enriched in islets versus all other tissues are indicated (*). NIPAL1 is significant in both species (indicated by arrows). Statistical significance between islets and other tissues was evaluated via one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s honest significant difference (not shown here) (n = 3; values displayed as means ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3A, workflow linking transcriptional validation phase to translational validation phase. B, analysis via qPCR identified substantial Nipal1 expression in Min6-K8 cells, comparable with expression of islet/Min6-enriched potassium channel Kcnj11 (n = 3). C, representative images of immunofluorescent staining of NIPAL1 in Min6-K8 cells, co-stained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and insulin. NIPAL1 staining was observed to have a punctate (likely vesicular) presence throughout much of the cytosol but is most concentrated in regions adjacent to the nuclei, as denoted by arrows. D, subcellular localization studies with GM-130 (Golgi) staining identified that this concentrated region was confined to the Golgi apparatus. However, NIPAL1 still shows distribution outside of the Golgi. E, PCC analysis was performed to quantify co-localization between NIPAL1 and other markers (n = 30–45 cells across three independent studies; values displayed as means ± S.E.). All IF experiments had n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following the identification of NIPAL1 in both murine and human islets, its expression was similarly assessed via qPCR in Min6-K8 cells (i.e. glucose-responsive murine pancreatic β-cell–like cell line). Nipal1 expression in Min6-K8 cells was comparable with the functionally important gene Kcnj11, encoding a KATP channel that is enriched in β-cells (Fig. 3B). In immunofluorescence (IF) studies, abundant NIPAL1 protein expression was also observed in Min6-K8, with a punctate cytosolic distribution suggesting a vesicular presence (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, NIPAL1 appeared to be concentrated in an area directly adjacent to the nucleus in all cells. Co-localization studies were thus performed using an antibody against GM-130 (Golgi matrix protein 130) (Fig. 3D). A strong overlap between the concentrated region of NIPAL1 and GM-130 indicated that NIPAL1 was indeed most abundant in the Golgi. The co-localization of NIPAL1 was quantified using Pearson’s correlation co-efficient (PCC) analysis. Relative co-localization was found to be significantly higher with both insulin granules (0.38 ± 0.04) and the Golgi (0.44 ± 0.04) compared with the nucleus (Fig. 3E). Because NIPAL1 is a magnesium transporter, experiments were conducted to determine whether NIPAL1 expression in Min6-K8 cells is directly responsive to variations in extracellular magnesium content using qPCR (Fig. 4A). The results showed that Nipal1 gene expression is roughly halved under magnesium-free (0.0 mm) conditions relative to standard (0.8 mm) conditions, with no substantial change under high magnesium (5.0 mm) conditions. These findings thus suggest that Nipal1 expression depends on the presence of Mg2+. IF studies were performed on cells cultured under similar conditions (Fig. 4B). Qualitatively, there was a visible increase in staining intensity under high Mg2+ (5.0 mm) within a small area inside each cell (likely the Golgi). Mean NIPAL1 pixel intensity for each condition was thus quantified via ImageJ software analysis (Fig. 4C). However, the difference in mean intensity observed between 5.0 and 0.8 mm Mg2+ did not reach significance (p = 0.078). To characterize the role of NIPAL1 in pancreatic β-cell function, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assays were conducted in transfected Min6-K8 cells (i.e. NIPAL1 overexpression and knockdown) under both regular and hypo/hypermagnesemic conditions. NIPAL1 overexpression was confirmed via IF using a FLAG antibody (Fig. 5A), with mean pixel intensity of both NIPAL1 and FLAG being significantly elevated in cells transfected with NIPAL1 cDNA (Fig. 5B) relative to control. In the case of NIPAL1 knockdown using siRNA, qPCR was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of silencing. Results showed a consistent decrease ∼70% of expression (or <0.3-fold expression) relative to scramble control (Fig. 5C). Attempts were taken to further validate these observations using immune blots; however, the NIPAL1 antibody (used here) was found not suitable for this application (not shown). In GSIS under standard culture conditions (0.8 mm Mg2+), neither overexpression nor knockdown of NIPAL1 in Min6-K8 cells showed significant alteration in overall insulin secretion (Fig. 6, A and B). However, it was hypothesized that any observable effect might be magnesium-dependent. In subsequent experiments, the role of NIPAL1 was evaluated under magnesium-induced stress using a range of magnesium concentrations (0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 5.0, and 10.0 mm Mg2+) with 2% FBS (to minimize additional magnesium content) as displayed in Fig. 6C, following confirmation that treatments did not impact cell viability (Fig. 6, I and J); GSIS was performed in both untransfected (Fig. 6D) and siRNA-transfected Min6-K8 cells (Fig. 6, E and F). In untransfected cells, a positive correlation between Mg2+ concentration and insulin secretion was readily apparent. (Fig. 6D). This suggests an importance for Mg2+ in insulin secretion in Min6-K8 cells. In the case of NIPAL1 knockdown, basal insulin secretion (0 mm glucose) was significantly decreased under almost every magnesium concentration (Fig. 6E). However, these differences were abolished under treatment with 16.7 mm glucose and KCl (Fig. 6F). In addition, knockdown of NIPAL1 significantly reduced total insulin content at lower Mg2+ concentrations (0.4 and 0.8 mm Mg2+) but not at higher concentrations (5.0 and 10.0 mm Mg2+) (Fig. 6G). In contrast, overexpression of NIPAL1 significantly increased total insulin content under almost every concentration (Fig. 6H). These observations thus indicate a role for NIPAL1 in insulin secretion and storage in a magnesium-dependent manner. The experiments conducted in Min6-K8 cells were additionally carried out in α-TC6 cells (i.e. murine α-cell–like cell line, α-TC1 clone 6). Nipal1 gene expression was observed in α-TC6 as assessed via qPCR, although at notably lower levels than Kcnj11 (Fig. 7A). Follow-up IF experiments confirmed healthy expression at the protein level (Fig. 7B). As in Min6-K8, NIPAL1 protein distribution appeared cytosolic and punctate in α-TC cells, with concentration in the Golgi (Fig. 7C). PCC analysis of NIPAL1 with glucagon was notable (0.60 ± 0.09), potentially indicating a higher degree of co-localization (Fig. 7D). IF experiments of α-TC cells cultured under varying magnesium conditions (Fig. 7E) showed stronger NIPAL1 staining under high Mg2+ (5.0 mm), which was confirmed to be significantly increased under mean pixel intensity quantification relative to standard Mg2+ (0.8 mm) (Fig. 7F). In similar fashion to previous GSIS experiments, α-TC6 cells were transfected (i.e. NIPAL1 overexpression and knockdown), and both basal glucagon secretion (Fig. 7G) and total glucagon were measured (Fig. 7H). No significant differences were observed between any of the treatment groups with respect to glucagon secretion or content. An interactome was generated based on NIPAL1's known interactions with other proteins. A total of 10 proteins are known to interact with NIPAL1, as follows: MMGT1, MAGT1, PPM1G, SLC35C1, SLC35C2, SLC35B3, TMEM144, FAM35A, NFXL1, and CNGA1 (Fig. 8). Many of these proteins are integrated into membranes (both of the cell and various organelles), with notable representation in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. (Fig. S3). However, NIPAL1's location is not defined here. In this study, we have shown that NIPAL1 is concentrated in the Golgi. The major suggested biological function of NIPAL1 is transmembrane transport of ions and biomolecules which include Mg2+, carbohydrate derivatives, nucleotide sugars, inorganic cations, metals, and carbohydrates. In addition, NIPAL1 may play a role in glycosylation and in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway (Fig. S3). A better understanding of T2D pathophysiology entailing the role of various contributing genes/proteins, especially in pancreatic islets, is essential for ultimately devising novel interventions. As such, omics-based technology such as scRNA-seq holds enormous potential to discover novel disease-related factors. In this study, NIPAL1 was identified as a novel islet-enriched protein via a manually curated data mining approach employing several T2D-related scRNA-seq data sets in combination with qPCR validation in both human and murine islets. To understand the functional roles of NIPAL1 in islets, we first examined its expression in α- and β-cell–like cell lines. The abundant expression of Nipal1 in both α- and β-cell–like cell lines is supported by observations of robust Nipal1 expression in murine α- and β-cells in scRNA-seq studies by Benner et al.

Multicollinearity in correlation matrices may cause a bias in path analysis estimates. This study aimed to: a) understand the correlation among soybean traits and estimate their direct and indirect effects on gain oil content; b) verify the efficiency of ridge path analysis and trait culling to overcome colinearity. Three different matrices with different levels of collinearity were obtained by trait culling. Ridge path analysis was performed on matrices with strong collinearity; otherwise, a traditional path analysis was performed. The same analyses were run on a simulated dataset. Trait culling was applied to matrix R originating the matrices R1 and R2. Path analysis for matrices R1 and R2 presented a high determination coefficient (0.856 and 0.832, respectively) and low effect of the residual variable (0.379 and 0.410 respectively). Ridge path analysis presented low determination coefficient (0.657) and no direct effects greater than the effects of the residual variable (0.585). Trait culling was more effective to overcome collinearity. Mass of grains, number of nodes, and number of pods are promising for indirect selection for oil content."

https://openalex.org/W3027111795,"Cancer development has been ascribed with diverse genetic variations which are identified in both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations have been detected in several tumours which include lung, colorectal, renal, pancreatic and breast cancer. Several studies have explored the breast tumour-specific mtDNA alteration mainly in Western population. This study aims to identify mtDNA alterations of 20 breast cancer patients in Malaysia by next generation sequencing analysis. Twenty matched tumours with corresponding normal breast tissues were obtained from female breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy. Total DNA was extracted from all samples and the entire mtDNA (16.6kb) was amplified using long range PCR amplification. The amplified PCR products were sequenced using mtDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) on an Illumina Miseq platform. Sequencing involves the entire mtDNA (16.6kb) from all pairs of samples with high-coverage (~ 9,544 reads per base). MtDNA variants were called and annotated using mtDNA-Server, a web server. A total of 18 of 20 patients had at least one somatic mtDNA mutation in their tumour samples. Overall, 65 somatic mutations were identified, with 30 novel mutations. The majority (59%) of the somatic mutations were in the coding region, whereas only 11% of the mutations occurred in the D-loop. Notably, somatic mutations in protein-coding regions were non-synonymous (49%) in which 15.4% of them are potentially deleterious. A total of 753 germline mutations were identified and four of which were novel mutations. Compared to somatic alterations, less than 1% of germline missense mutations are harmful. The findings of this study may enhance the current knowledge of mtDNA alterations in breast cancer. To date, the catalogue of mutations identified in this study is the first evidence of mtDNA alterations in Malaysian female breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3027749663,"The interactions between membrane receptors and their endogenous ligands are key interactions in organisms. Recently, we have shown that a high number of genes encoding human receptors appeared at the same moment as their ligand in the animal tree of life. However, a set of receptors appeared before their present ligand. Different scenarios have been proposed to explain how a receptor can be conserved if its ligand is not yet appeared. However, these scenarios have been proposed individually and have never been studied in a global way. In this study, we investigated 30 mammalian pairs of ligand/receptor for which the first ligand appeared after its receptor in the tree of life, by using common indexes of selection, and proposed different scenarios explaining the earlier appearance of a receptor relative to its ligand. Based on 3D structural studies, our indexes allowed us to classify the evolution of these partners into different scenarios: 1) a scenario where the binding interface of the receptor is already present and under purifying selection before the appearance of the ligand; 2) a scenario where the binding interface seems to have appeared progressively, and 3) a scenario where the binding site seems to have been reshuffled since its appearance. As some scenarios were confirmed by the literature, we concluded that simple indexes can give a good highlight of the evolutive history of two partners that did not appear at the same time. Based on these scenarios, we also hypothesize that the replacement of a ligand by another is a frequent phenomenon during evolution."

This study investigated a new safe distance concept to prevent scope damage by analyzing the breakdown of the laser fiber jacket and cores. Methods Laser fibers were fixed in a benchtop simulation model. The fiber tip was in contact with uniform phantom stones and submerged in saline. Four different energy settings (1.0 or 2.0J x 10Hz or 30Hz) and two different fiber sizes (200 μm and 365 μm) were tested. After three minutes of use at each energy setting, the length of fiber shortening and jacket burn were measured. The fibers were stripped to measure the length of core degradation. Results Mean degradation lengths were 4.2 to 7.8 mm. There was no statistical difference in the mean lengths of fiber core degradation and jacket burn. However, core degradation was longer than the jacket burn in half of the samples. The mean difference in lengths between core degradation and jacket burn was 0.49 ± 0.90 mm. Lengths of core degradation and the jacket burn were longer at the setting of high-power energy and 200 μm fiber - 2J with 30 Hz. Conclusion To reduce ‘double-firing’-induced damage, the authors recommend that laser fiber should be cut 1.0 mm longer than visible jacket burn at high-power settings after 3-min continuous fragmentation. After cutting the fiber, the laser should be checked whether ‘double-firing’ is no more seen."
https://openalex.org/W3027271680,"DNA lesions can severely compromise transcription and block RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase (RNAP), leading to subsequent recruitment of DNA repair factors to the stalled transcription complex. Recent structural studies have uncovered molecular interactions of several DNA lesions within the transcription elongation complex. However, little is known about the role of key elements of the RNAP active site in translesion transcription. Here, using recombinantly expressed proteins, in vitro transcription, kinetic analyses, and in vivo cell viability assays, we report that point amino acid substitutions in the trigger loop, a flexible element of the active site involved in nucleotide addition, can stimulate translesion RNA synthesis by Escherichia coli RNAP without altering the fidelity of nucleotide incorporation. We show that these substitutions also decrease transcriptional pausing and strongly affect the nucleotide addition cycle of RNAP by increasing the rate of nucleotide addition but also decreasing the rate of translocation. The secondary channel factors DksA and GreA modulated translesion transcription by RNAP, depending on changes in the trigger loop structure. We observed that although the mutant RNAPs stimulate translesion synthesis, their expression is toxic in vivo, especially under stress conditions. We conclude that the efficiency of translesion transcription can be significantly modulated by mutations affecting the conformational dynamics of the active site of RNAP, with potential effects on cellular stress responses and survival."
https://openalex.org/W3027420707,"Staphylococcus warneri is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that is a normal inhabitant of the skin. It is also considered to be an opportunistic etiological agent causing significant infections in human and animals. Currently, relatively little attention has been paid to the genome biology of S. warneri pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance, which are emerging issues for this etiological agent with considerably clinical significance. In this study, we determined the complete genome sequence of S. warneri strain GD01 recovered from the sampled muscle abscess tissue of a diseased pig in South China. The genome of S. warneri is composed of a circular chromosome of 2,473,911 base pairs as well as eight plasmid sequences. Genome-wide metabolic reconstruction revealed 82 intact functional modules driving the catabolism of respiration and fermentation for energy production, uptake of distinct sugars as well as two-component regulatory systems. The evidence uncovered herein enables better understanding for metabolic potential and physiological traits of this etiological agent. The antibiotic susceptibility test demonstrated that S. warneri GD01 was resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefalexin, vancomycin, and sulfisoxazole. The associations between antibiotic phenotypes and the related genotypes were identified to reveal the molecular basis conferring resistance to this pathogen. A number of genes coding for potential virulence factors were firstly depicted in the genome of S. warneri GD01, including adhesins, exoenzymes, capsule, and iron acquisition proteins. Our study provides a valuable genomic context of the genes/modules devoting to metabolism, antibiotic resistance, and virulence of S. warneri."

This paper focuses on the impact that international trade in online platforms has on the skilled-unskilled wage gap. Because online trade allows smaller firms with relatively more unskilled workers to access world markets, one can expect an expansion of online exports to reduce the wage gap. After correcting for potential endogeneity bias in a sample of 22 developing countries for which online trade and wage gap data can be matched, we find that a 1 percent increase in the share of online exports over GDP leads to a 0.01 percent decline in the skilled-unskilled wage gap."
https://openalex.org/W3028209613,"Mixed hematopoietic chimerism enables donor-specific tolerance for solid organ grafts. This study evaluated the influence of different serological major histocompatibility complex disparities on chimerism development, graft-versus-host disease incidence and subsequently on solid organ tolerance in a rat model. For bone marrow transplantation conditioning total body irradiation was titrated using 10, 8 or 6 Gray. Bone marrow transplantation was performed across following major histocompatibility complex mismatched barriers: complete disparity, MHC class II, MHC class I or non-MHC mismatch. Recipients were clinically monitored for graft-versus-host disease and analyzed for chimerism using flow cytometry. After a reconstitution of 100 days, composition of peripheral leukocytes was determined. Mixed chimeras were challenged with heart grafts from allogeneic donor strains to define the impact of donor MHC class disparities on solid organ tolerance on the basis of stable chimerism. After myeloablation with 10 Gray of total body irradiation, chimerism after bone marrow transplantation was induced independent of MHC disparity. MHC class II disparity increased the incidence of graft-versus-host disease and reduced induction of stable chimerism upon myelosuppressive total body irradiation with 8 and 6 Gray, respectively. Stable mixed chimeras showed tolerance towards heart grafts from donors with MHC matched to either bone marrow donors or recipients. Isolated matching of MHC class II with bone marrow donors likewise led to stable tolerance as opposed to matching of MHC class I. In summary, MHC class II disparity was critically associated with the onset of graft-versus host disease and was identified as obstacle for successful development of chimerism after bone marrow transplantation and subsequent donor-specific solid organ tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3026256485,"Attention has recently turned toward the use of device-assisted male circumcision to help scale up male circumcision services in sub-Saharan Africa, with increasing emphasis on younger age groups. We assessed the use of the ShangRing for circumcising the subset of boys aged 10 to 12 years who were enrolled in two randomized clinical trials in Kenya.We performed a sub-analysis of outcomes in 197 boys aged 10 to 12 years; a subset who were enrolled in two randomized clinical trials to assess the use of the no-flip ShangRing circumcision technique in men and boys. One trial assessed spontaneous detachment vs. planned removal of the ShangRing 7 days post-circumcision. The second trial compared the use of topical vs. injectable anesthesia with ShangRing circumcision. Aside from baseline characteristics, data was collected and analyzed for each trial separately.All participants were successfully circumcised. Duration of circumcision, participants requiring a dorsal slit, rate of adverse events, time to complete wound healing, and participant satisfaction were similar between the two groups in each trial. Mean time required for spontaneous ShangRing detachment was 14.82±3.76 days. Topical anesthesia showed a significantly lower mean pain score at the time of application (0.64±1.71 vs. 1.55± 2.21, p = 0.03) as well as postoperatively (0.54±0.88 vs. 1.72±1.56, p<0.0001). Median dwell time of the topical anesthetic was 43 (IQR: 35.5-60) minutes, while the median time it took the injectable anesthetic to take effect was 2.04 (IQR: 1.72-3.09) minutes.No-flip ShangRing circumcision had a positive safety profile among young adolescent boys, specifically ages 10-12 years. The use of spontaneous device detachment and topical anesthesia with the procedure have shown promising outcomes in this age group. This may have the potential to further increase the acceptability of ShangRing circumcision, and therefore accelerate the scle up of male circumcision services in sub-Saharan Africa.ClinicalTrials.gov registration # NCT02390310."
https://openalex.org/W3026985510,"We identified clinical, dietary, and socioeconomic factors associated with insufficient gestational weight gain among Mexican pregnant women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.This was a cross-sectional study involving 112 pregnant women with HIV infection receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data including viral load, complete blood analysis, and CD4 counts were extracted from medical records. An inquiry form was used to collect data on socioeconomic status and frequency of food intake. Pre-gestational weight was calculated based on pregnancy weight to obtain the body mass index (BMI) and weight gain for gestational age according the US Institute of Medicine. Of the study population, 68.7% were in consensual union, 31.3% were single, and 33.9% belonged to the two lowest socioeconomic strata. The median age and CD4 count were 27 (interquartile range [IQR]: 23-32) years and 418 (IQR: 267-591), respectively. The adequacy of energy was 91.8% (IQR: 74.1-117.7). The median energy intake from protein was 13.5% (IQR: 12.2-14.9) and from lipids, 35.5% (IQR: 31.1-40.3). Pregnant women with gastrointestinal symptoms and CD4 count <350 were seven times more likely to have folate deficiency (odds ratio [OR] 7.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-38.1; p = 0.009) and six times more likely to have poor zinc intake (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.3-36.8; p = 0.014). In all, 42.9% of the pregnant women consumed iron and folic acid supplements and 54.4% consumed multivitamin supplements. Moreover, 45.5% had a normal pre-gestational BMI, 41.1% were classified overweight, and 13.4% had obesity, whereas 62.5% showed insufficient gestational weight gain, and 18.8% experienced weight loss. The variables associated with insufficient weight gain were consensual union (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.9-15.0; p = 0.002) and belonging to the lowest socioeconomic stratum (E) (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0-9.2; p = 0.046).Dietary strategies to improve gestational weight gain for Mexican women with HIV infection receiving ART must consider clinical and socioeconomic factors."
https://openalex.org/W3027113446,"We investigate the dynamics of aggressive order in the financial market to further understand volatility. To analyze aggressive order, market orders in the order book are scrutinized. The market orders have different degrees of aggressiveness; therefore, we categorize market orders into four types: types Zero, One, A, and B, of which type B is the most aggressive. To examine the dynamics and impacts of each type of order, we use both macro- and micro-level approaches. From the macroscopic perspective, the burstiness and memory of type B is highly correlated with volatility. When traders face a financial crisis, they place bursty aggressive orders, and the orders are more predictable than usual. From the microscopic perspective, we additionally focus on the influence of the orders, particularly the price impact and resilience. The aggressive order has a greater impact than others, even when the price change of the aggressive order is smaller. Moreover, the aggressive order delivers more information on price because the aggressive order has a higher price impact than the execution cost."
https://openalex.org/W3028432291,"The phone rang 30 minutes before my talk. It was a familiar number—my fertility doctor's office—and I picked up, expecting a nurse to tell me that my pills and injections were ready for my next treatment. Instead, the nurse asked me to hold for the doctor, who told me I was pregnant. It should have been joyous news, but he quickly tempered my enthusiasm by telling me that, given the results of other tests, he wasn't sure the pregnancy would go to term. I felt a complicated wave of emotions: relief that our fertility treatment worked, anxiety at the prospect of starting my new job pregnant, worry that I'd have a miscarriage—and stress about my imminent talk.



> “It was a macabre preview into parenthood as an academic.” 

My husband and I had started fertility treatments during my postdoc years, unable to conceive on our own. The process was exhausting. I had to go into the doctor's office a few times per week for blood tests and appointments—all before my hourlong commute to work. The costs stretched our finances. I began to convert every price tag I saw to a portion of a doctor's visit.

During the same time period, my professional life had started to fall into place. I completed my postdoc and landed a faculty job in the same city where we were living. When the doctor's office called that day, I was 1 month away from starting my new position and changing my email signature to “Assistant Professor.”

Somehow, I managed to give my talk. But as I delivered my practiced monologue, I was having a very different conversation in my mind. I tried to imagine taking maternity leave during my first year as a professor. I also fretted about the viability of the pregnancy.

Follow-up doctor's visits didn't yield positive news. The pregnancy would almost certainly end in a miscarriage. I contemplated termination. But because we'd had such a tough time getting pregnant, my husband and I decided to wait to see what happened.

Over the next month, my appointments for blood draws and invasive ultrasounds increased to nearly every other day. During one appointment, we heard a heartbeat. My stomach sank all the way down to the stirrups holding my feet. It was painful to hear that heartbeat—because it provided a glimpse into the excitement of pregnancy that I knew would likely be cut short. We left the office still waiting for the supposedly imminent miscarriage.

But I wasn't waiting at home. I was waiting during my first faculty meeting. I was waiting in the lab while teaching interns how to prepare samples. I tried my best to silo my personal and professional lives. As time wore on, though, the barrier between “waiting for miscarriage Logan” and “shiny new professor Logan” became less and less distinct. I was worn out physically and emotionally.

It was a macabre preview into parenthood as an academic. I found myself constantly struggling to balance my career goals with my personal life, which featured many more doctor's appointments than visits with friends. I missed deadlines and meetings. I had trouble focusing. And I cried in my office, worried that I was already failing as a professor—feelings intensified by hormones that would bear no fruit.

Then, roughly 7 weeks into my pregnancy, I went into the doctor's office—and this time there was no heartbeat. I'd never experienced such a visceral combination of sadness and relief. I swallowed two doses of the abortion pill and waited for my pregnancy to be officially over.

I dealt with my grief, in part, by speaking openly with trusted colleagues, including my postdoc adviser and others who'd known me for years. And I'd had time to prepare. Difficult as my experience was, I can't imagine how someone feels when a miscarriage catches them totally off guard, or it happens for the second, third, or eighth time.

Ten months have passed, and my husband and I are still working with the fertility doctor. It isn't easy to be open about my personal struggles. But I know many academics are in the same boat: starting their first faculty appointment while trying to start a family, and dealing with the conflicting emotions that even a better outcome can bring. I want them to know they're not alone."
