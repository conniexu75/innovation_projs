https://openalex.org/W1980516378,"Chemical sensors based on individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are demonstrated. Upon exposure to gaseous molecules such as NO(2) or NH(3), the electrical resistance of a semiconducting SWNT is found to dramatically increase or decrease. This serves as the basis for nanotube molecular sensors. The nanotube sensors exhibit a fast response and a substantially higher sensitivity than that of existing solid-state sensors at room temperature. Sensor reversibility is achieved by slow recovery under ambient conditions or by heating to high temperatures. The interactions between molecular species and SWNTs and the mechanisms of molecular sensing with nanotube molecular wires are investigated."

The tensile-loading experiment was prepared and observed entirely within the microscope and was recorded on video. The MWCNTs broke in the outermost layer (""sword-in-sheath"" failure), and the tensile strength of this layer ranged from 11 to 63 gigapascals for the set of 19 MWCNTs that were loaded. Analysis of the stress-strain curves for individual MWCNTs indicated that the Young's modulus E of the outermost layer varied from 270 to 950 gigapascals. Transmission electron microscopic examination of the broken nanotube fragments revealed a variety of structures, such as a nanotube ribbon, a wave pattern, and partial radial collapse."

Mammalian homologs of yeast IRE1, which activate chaperone genes in response to ER stress, also activated JNK, and IRE1alpha-/- fibroblasts were impaired in JNK activation by ER stress. The cytoplasmic part of IRE1 bound TRAF2, an adaptor protein that couples plasma membrane receptors to JNK activation. Dominant-negative TRAF2 inhibited activation of JNK by IRE1. Activation of JNK by endogenous signals initiated in the ER proceeds by a pathway similar to that initiated by cell surface receptors in response to extracellular signals."

The fastest particles moved cooperatively; connected clusters of these mobile particles could be identified; and the cluster size distribution, structure, and dynamics were investigated. The characteristic cluster size grew markedly in the supercooled fluid as the glass transition was approached, in agreement with computer simulations; at the glass transition, however, there was a sudden drop in their size. The clusters of fast-moving particles were largest near the α-relaxation time scale for supercooled colloidal fluids, but were also present, albeit with a markedly different nature, at shorter β-relaxation time scales, in both supercooled fluid and glass colloidal phases."

In this report, we describe diketo acid inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase that manifest antiviral activity as a consequence of their effect on integration. The antiviral activity of these compounds is due exclusively to inhibition of one of the two catalytic functions of integrase, strand transfer."

https://openalex.org/W2012620166,"Dramatic changes in patterns of epidemics have been observed throughout this century. For childhood infectious diseases such as measles, the major transitions are between regular cycles and irregular, possibly chaotic epidemics, and from regionally synchronized oscillations to complex, spatially incoherent epidemics. A simple model can explain both kinds of transitions as the consequences of changes in birth and vaccination rates. Measles is a natural ecological system that exhibits different dynamical transitions at different times and places, yet all of these transitions can be predicted as bifurcations of a single nonlinear model."

https://openalex.org/W1964200863,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is a protein of 66.5 kDa that is composed of three homologous domains, each of which displays specific structural and functional characteristics. HSA is known to undergo different pH-dependent structural transitions, the N-F and F-E transitions in the acid pH region and the N-B transition at slightly alkaline pH. In order to elucidate the structural behavior of the recombinant HSA domains as stand-alone proteins and to investigate the molecular and structural origins of the pH-induced conformational changes of the intact molecule, we have employed fluorescence and circular dichroic methods. Here we provide evidence that the loosening of the HSA structure in the N-F transition takes place primarily in HSA-DOM III and that HSA-DOM I undergoes a structural rearrangement with only minor changes in secondary structure, whereas HSA-DOM II transforms to a molten globule-like state as the pH is reduced. In the pH region of the N-B transition of HSA, HSA-DOM I and HSA-DOM II experience a tertiary structural isomerization, whereas with HSA-DOM III no alterations in tertiary structure are observed, as judged from near-UV CD and fluorescence measurements.

Each domain is made up of two subdomains, which share a common helical motif. Specific characteristics, for example the location of the various ligand-binding sites, were assigned to some of the domains or subdomains in the past (1.Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar, 2.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). We recently described the production of the three domains of HSA1 as recombinant proteins, and we were able to show that they have structural features as well as ligand binding properties correlating to their specific functionality in the context of the native protein (3.Dockal M. Carter D.C. Rüker F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29303-29310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Clear evidence could be provided that the primary binding site for hemin is located on HSA-DOM I and that for diazepam on HSA-DOM III. Human serum albumin undergoes several transitions in dependence of pH, the N-F transition between pH 5.0 and 3.5, the F-E transition or acid expansion below pH 3.5, and the N-B transition between pH 7.0 and 9.0 (1.Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar, 2.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). The acid-induced structural changes of bovine and human serum albumin have been studied by a wide range of methods (1.Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar, 2.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar) and are characterized by changes in secondary as well as tertiary structure. An indication for the former is a significant decrease in helical content observed by far-UV CD measurements which was interpreted by Eraet al. (4.Era S. Ashida H. Nagaoka S. Inouye H. Sogami M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983; 22: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5.Era S. Sogami M. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to represent a helix → β and a helix → coil transition in the case of the N-F transition. As the pH of an albumin solution is reduced below 3.5, further unfolding occurs until about pH 2.5, when the molecule appears to be expanded to the full extent that is allowed by its disulfide bonding structure. Under slightly alkaline conditions, between pH 7.0 and 9.0, HSA and BSA undergo another conformational change, known as the N-B transition. It is more subtle and more gradual in onset and has been proposed to have physiological importance, similar to the acid-induced transformations (1.Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar, 2.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). The B isomerization is supposed to be a structural fluctuation, a loosening of the molecule with loss of rigidity, particularly affecting the N-terminal region and thereby impacting ligand binding (6.Wilting J. Weideman M.M. Roomer A.C. Perrin J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7.t' Hart B.J. Wilting J. de Gier J.J. Biochem.

Acta. 1988; 953: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One way to explore the molecular origins of these transitions is by using albumin fragments. Attempts have been made in the past to assign specific roles and contributions of the albumin domains to the characteristic structural transitions of both HSA and, more frequently, its closely related bovine homolog, BSA. For many of these studies, fragments have been used, which had been produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage (8.Bos O.J. Remijn J.P. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3905-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9.Bos O.J. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1989; 264: 953-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An F-like transformation was observed with a tryptic fragment of bovine serum albumin (BSA-T377–582), shedding some light on the nucleation points for the intramolecular changes that occur during this transition (13.Khan M.Y. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was shown that this fragment unfolds and abruptly loses structure at pH 4, whereas fragment BSA-P1–385 does not do so until pH 3.5 (12.Khan M.Y. Salahuddin A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), as determined by difference spectroscopic methods. Domain III of BSA was consequently proposed to have a less constrained conformation than the rest of the molecule and to expand through separation of its subunits in the course of the N-F transition. Bos et al. (17.Bos O.J. Labro J.F. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 953-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded from their work with two large fragments of HSA that the conformational change between pH 6.0 and 9.0 of the P-46 fragment (residues 1–387 of HSA) clearly resembles the N-B transition of albumin, whereas the T-45 fragment (residues 198–585 of HSA) does not display such a conformational change. However, the choice of fragments used in these studies was dependent on the availability of suitable cleavage sites and did not necessarily take into account the natural borders of the domains as they can be defined based on amino acid sequence and atomic structure. Based on our previous results on the structure and ligand binding properties of the three recombinant HSA domains, we report here in a systematic way on the conformational behavior of these new proteins in the acidic and slightly alkaline pH region and on their contributions to the origins of the structural transitions of the native molecule. For this purpose, fluorescence and CD spectroscopic measurements were performed depending on pH, and the results are discussed in the context of the atomic coordinates of HSA. HSA (essentially free of fatty acids and globulin) was from Sigma (catalog number A3782). This material was further purified by size exclusion chromatography over Superdex 200 prep grad (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and delipidated by passing over a Lipidx-1000 column (Canberra-Packard). The three domains of HSA were cloned, expressed, and purified as has been described before in detail (3.Dockal M. Carter D.C. Rüker F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29303-29310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The domains encompassed the following amino acid residues of HSA: HSA-DOM I, 1–197; HSA-DOM II, 189–385; HSA-DOM III, 381–585. Due to the restriction site used for cloning, all domains had Glu-Phe as the N-terminal amino acids. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Protein stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the delipidated proteins in aqua bidest. Protein concentrations were measured by their absorbance at 278 nm on a Hewlett-Packard HP8453 spectrophotometer. For HSA, an absorption coefficient ( A278 nm,1 cm0.1%) of 0.58 was used (8.Bos O.J. Remijn J.P. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3905-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For HSA-DOM I, HSA-DOM II, and HSA-DOM III, the absorption coefficients were found to be 0.50, 0.79, and 0.30, respectively (3.Dockal M. Carter D.C. Rüker F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29303-29310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Measurements were made using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm cell at 25 °C in a thermostated cell holder at a concentration of 4.5 μm in the far-UV region. Scans were made from 250 to 190 nm. The slit width was programmed for a half-bandwidth of 1 nm, and the dynode voltage never exceeded 0.6 kV. 10 μl of a 100 times concentrated protein stock solution (in aqua bidest.) were mixed with 990 μl of the corresponding buffer (pH 9.0 to 8.5, 10 mmboric acid/Borax; pH 8.0 to 5.0, 10 mm sodium phosphate; pH 4.5 to 3.5, 10 mm acetic acid/sodium acetate; pH 3.0 and less was adjusted with HCl). All spectra were recorded at least twice. After each measurement, the pH was confirmed with a standard pH meter. The data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRW, degree cm2 dmol−1), using the mean residue weights of 114.0 g mol−1 for the intact molecule, 114.9 g mol−1 for HSA-DOM I, 113.2 g mol−1 for HSA-DOM II, and 113.0 g mol−1 for HSA-DOM III. The fractional content of the secondary structure elements of the proteins was calculated from the far-UV CD spectra using the procedure of Provencher and co-workers (18.Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 19.Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2549) Google Scholar) (CONTIN) with a set of 16 reference proteins. In the near-UV region, measurements were made using a 1-cm cell at 25 °C in a thermostated cell-holder at a protein concentration of 20 μm. Scans were made from 340 to 250 nm. The slit width was programmed for a half-bandwidth of 1 nm, and the dynode voltage never exceeded 0.4 kV. As above, a 100 times concentrated protein stock solution was diluted with the desired buffer (pH 9.0, 0.1 mboric acid/Borax; pH 7.4, 0.1 m sodium phosphate; pH 4.0, 0.1 m acetic acid/sodium acetate; pH 2.0 was adjusted with HCl) to reach the final protein concentration of 20 μm. The results are expressed as molar ellipticity ([θ], degree cm2 dmol−1). Fluorescence measurements were made with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder at 25 °C. All spectra were recorded in a 0.5 × 1-cm stirred cell (0.5 cm at emission and 1 cm at excitation side) with the excitation and the emission slit width set to 5 nm. For HSA and HSA-DOM II, which contain only a single tryptophanyl residue (Trp-214), an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was routinely used, to ensure that the light was absorbed almost entirely by the lone tryptophanyl residue. HSA-DOM I and HSA-DOM III were excited at 280 nm to record the tyrosyl emission. pH-dependent experiments were carried out as described above with a protein concentration of 4.5 μm,and all spectra were recorded at least twice. Each spectrum was corrected for buffer base-line fluorescence. After each measurement the pH was controlled with a standard pH meter. In order to get information about the secondary structure of the proteins used in this study, far-UV CD measurements were performed between 250 and 190 nm depending on the pH. A spectrum for each of the proteins in the native (pH 7.4) and denatured state (9.5 m urea) is shown in Fig.1 A, demonstrating full disruption of the secondary structure of all proteins at 9.5m urea. Fig. 1 B presents the ellipticity at 222 nm in the pH range from 9.0 to 1.5 for the four proteins. Alterations in the ellipticity at this wavelength are a useful probe for visualizing varying α-helical content. The results of the secondary structure resolved analysis are represented in Table I for pH 9.0, 7.4, 4.0 and 2.5.Table IFraction of secondary structural elements of HSA, HSA-DOM I, HSA-DOM II, and HSA-DOM III estimated by the procedure of Provencher and Glöckner (CONTIN) (18.Provencher S.W.

In the acid pH region from pH 5.0 to 3.5 and further down to pH 2.5, the ellipticity observed with HSA shows a two-step sigmoidal increase, and calculated helix content (f α) decreases, whereas sheet structures (f β) increase. These changes in secondary structure are in accordance with the concept of the N-F transition followed by the acid expansion (1.Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar, 2.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications.

Sogami M. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A similar observation is made with HSA-DOM III, which also displays a characteristic two-step transition correlated with a decrease in α-helical content and a gain in β-sheet structure. However, the two transitions are clearly split. The onset of the first sigmoidal transition is shifted to higher pH as compared with HSA, followed by a second change in the pH region between 3.0 and 2.0. These findings clearly prove that the N-F transition originates in a structural loosening at the C-terminal end of the albumin molecule, probably followed by a separation of domains and subdomains in the course of the acid expansion, as has been suggested before by several authors (1.Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar, 2.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications.

For HSA-DOM I, a slight increase in [θ]222is observed in the pH region from 5.5 to 3.5, which indicates only a minor change in secondary structure, whereas below pH 3.5 this domain shows an acid expansion similar to HSA and HSA-DOM III, which is further evidence for the disruption of intradomain structure of HSA in this pH region. By diminishing the pH of a HSA-DOM II solution from 6.0 to 4.0, unexpectedly a sigmoidal decrease in [θ]222, is observed, which is correlated with a slight increase in α-helix content accompanied by a reduction of β-sheet structure. HSA-DOM II shows, in contrast to HSA-DOM I and HSA-DOM III, only a slight increment in ellipticity in the acid expansion region of HSA. Below pH 2.0, the ellipticity of all four proteins investigated is decreased. This can be interpreted as a gain in secondary structure, as was observed previously for many proteins in the absence of salt by Gotoet al. (20.Goto Y. Calciano L.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and Fink et al. (21.Fink A.L. Calciano L.J. Goto Y. Kurotsu T. Palleros D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12504-12511Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). HSA shows a small increase in the ellipticity at 222 nm in the pH range from 7.4 to 9.0, indicating a slight reduction of α-helical content and an increase in β-structural elements, in accordance with the concept of the well known N-B transition in the absence of added salt (2.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar, 22.Era S. Itoh K.B. Sogami M. Kuwata K. Iwama T. Yamada H. Watari H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Neither of the recombinant domains exhibits significant fluctuation in ellipticity between pH 6.0 and 9.0. In this pH region, only minor changes in secondary structure can therefore be expected, which is further supported by the data from the secondary structure resolved analysis. HSA has a single tryptophanyl residue, Trp-214, located in domain II. To examine the conformational variations around this residue in HSA and HSA-DOM II, fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, which provides no excitation of tyrosine residues and therefore neither emission nor energy transfer to the lone indole side chain. The pH profiles of the fluorescence intensity and the wavelength at the respective emission maximum are displayed in Fig.2 A for HSA and HSA-DOM II. The fluorescence of HSA in the acid pH region exhibited a two-step decrease, the first from pH 6.0 to 4.5 and the second, more pronounced, from pH 3.5 to 2.5, representing the N-F and F-E transitions (16.Geisow M.J. Beaven G.H. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23.Chen R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 120: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,24.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). The wavelength maximum of the tryptophanyl fluorescence shifted from 340 nm at the high pH end of the N-F transition (pH 5.0) to approximately 332 nm at pH 3.5. By raising the pH of an HSA solution from 7.4 to 9.0, we observed a slight decrease of λmaxand fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2 A), which was reported previously for BSA in the absence of salt (22.Era S. Itoh K.B. Sogami M. Kuwata K. Iwama T. Yamada H. Watari H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At pH 7.4, the fluorescence quantum yield of the tryptophanyl residue in HSA-DOM II is 2.6-fold lower compared with Trp-214 in the native molecule, and the emission maximum is shifted from 340 (HSA) to 332 nm (HSA-DOM II). As the pH is reduced, HSA-DOM II shows a sigmoidal rise in fluorescence intensity, reaching a maximum increase of 2.4-fold at pH 4.0. At the onset of this intensity enhancement no change of the emission maximum is observable, whereas from pH 5.5 to pH 4.0 a slight decrease of 1 nm can be detected. The pronounced rise in fluorescence intensity of HSA-DOM II between pH 7.4 and 4.0 coincides with the secondary structural rearrangement observed by far-UV CD in the same pH region. At pH 4.0, the tryptophanyl residues of both HSA-DOM II and HSA have superimposable fluorescence spectra (data not shown), suggesting that at this pH the tryptophanyl residue in both proteins has a similar environment. By further reduction of the pH, the fluorescence intensity and emission maximum of HSA-DOM II and HSA run nearly parallel, but the diminution in fluorescence intensity below pH 3.0 followed by the increase below pH 2.0 is not as pronounced in HSA-DOM II as it is in HSA. Even at pH 2.0, the tryptophanyl residues are not in a solvent-exposed environment, as indicated by denaturing both proteins with 9.5m urea, which leads to a red shift of the fluorescence maximum (349 nm for both proteins) and a reduction of the fluorescence intensity (data not shown). In the slightly alkaline pH region HSA-DOM II shows a gain in tryptophanyl fluorescence intensity, which is accompanied by an increase of the emission maximum. Since HSA harbors only a single tryptophanyl residue, which is located in domain II, we investigated the tyrosyl fluorescence of HSA-DOM I and HSA-DOM III in order to obtain additional insight into the structural characteristics of these two proteins. The pH profiles of the fluorescence intensity and the wavelength at the emission maximum are visualized in Fig.2 B. In the acidic pH region, HSA-DOM I shows a two-step alteration in fluorescence intensity. At first, by lowering the pH to 3.5, the fluorescence increases, which is aligned with a slight, but significant, decrease in the emission maximum. By further reducing the pH, the fluorescence intensity rises to a maximum value at pH 2.0; however, no change in the position of the emission maximum is observed. The spectra of HSA-DOM I in 9.5 m urea and at pH 2.0 (data not shown) are nearly superimposable, indicating that the seven tyrosyl residues in this protein have the same environment at pH 2.0 as in the fully denaturated state at 9.5 m urea. In the neutral and slightly alkaline pH range the tyrosyl fluorescence and the position of the emission maximum of HSA-DOM I show no significant alterations, which indicates no significant changes in the microenvironments of the seven tyrosyl residues. As the pH of the HSA-DOM III solution is reduced to pH 4.0, there is a sharp sigmoidal decrease in the tyrosyl fluorescence intensity and a slight increase in the emission maximum, however, by further lessening of the pH of the solution there is a smooth and continuous increase in fluorescence intensity. The tyrosyl fluorescence intensity of HSA-DOM III in the neutral to slightly alkaline pH region decreases, whereas the emission maximum increases slightly but reproducibly from ∼304 nm at pH 6.0 to ∼305 nm at pH 9.0. By raising the pH, a shoulder near 350 nm becomes obvious, which indicates ionization of some tyrosyl side chains (data not shown) (25.Pundak S. Roche R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1549-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To study the structural alterations in more detail, CD measurements in the near-UV region, which infer to tertiary structure, were performed at specific pH values, and the results are shown in Fig. 3, A–D, for HSA and each of the three recombinant domains. The near-UV CD spectra of HSA are shown in Fig. 3 A. At pH 7.4, minima at 262 and 268 nm are observed as well as two shoulders near 276 and 283 nm, which is in accordance with previous findings (26.Sjoholm I. Ljungstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8434-8441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Uversky V.N. Narizhneva N.V. Ivanova T.V. Tomashevski A.Y.

By reducing the pH to 4.0 and further to 2.0 there is an increase in the ellipticity at 262 and 268 nm and a decrease between 290 and 300 nm, denoting loss of tertiary structure in both the N-F transition and the acid expansion, in agreement with the alterations in secondary structure and tryptophanyl fluorescence. These findings agree with results published previously (29.Noel J.K. Hunter M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7391-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Sogami M. Era S. Nagaoka S. Inouye H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1982; 19: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However at pH 2.0 there are still significant CD signals left, compared with the spectrum at 9.5m urea, suggesting remaining tertiary structure even at this low pH. By changing the pH of the HSA solution from 7.4 to 9.0, we observe a slight gain in the CD signal at 262 and 268 nm, which might reflect perturbations around the numerous disulfide bridges (22.Era S. Itoh K.B. Sogami M. Kuwata K. Iwama T. Yamada H. Watari H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30.Sogami M. Era S. Nagaoka S. Inouye H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1982; 19: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, a small reduction in ellipticity in the region between 280 and 300 nm is seen, which was ascribed to changes in the tryptophanyl environment (22.Era S. Itoh K.B. Sogami M. Kuwata K. Iwama T. Yamada H. Watari H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30.Sogami M. Era S. Nagaoka S. Inouye H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1982; 19: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and which is corroborated here by the changes in tryptophanyl fluorescence that we observed in this pH region. Fig. 3 B presents the near-UV CD spectra of HSA-DOM I. Like HSA at pH 7.4, two minima at 262 and 268 nm and a shoulder at 276 nm are seen, and an additional shoulder near 255 nm is evident. Upon reduction of the pH of the solution to 4.0 the spectrum of HSA-DOM I exhibits an increase of [θ]262 and [θ]268, a flattening of the shoulder at 255 nm, and a decrease in the region above 280 nm with loss in fine structure. This is a clear indication for a structural rearrangement of HSA-DOM I in the pH region of the N-F transition of HSA, which is further emphasized by the pronounced increase in tyrosyl fluorescence intensity and the shifting emission maximum. By a further decrease of the pH to 2.0, an overall increase in ellipticity compared with the spectrum at pH 4.0 is perceivable, indicating further loss of tertiary structure elements of this domain in the pH region of the F-E transition of HSA. At 9.5m urea, a dramatic increase in ellipticity was observed. The difference between the spectrum at pH 2.0 and 9.5 murea denotes that even at pH 2.0 some tertiary structural elements are left. By raising the pH of the HSA-DOM I solution to 9.0, the CD signal at 262 and 268 nm increases slightly and the shoulder near 255 nm flattens, whereas there is a decrease in the region above 285 nm, highlighting the contribution of HSA-DOM I to the N-B transition of HSA. The near-UV CD spectra of HSA-DOM II at different pH values and at 9.5m urea are presented in Fig. 3 C. Similar to HSA the spectrum at pH 7.4 has minima at 262 and 268 nm, shoulders at 276 and 283, and an additional shoulder at 287 nm. As the pH is reduced to 4.0, there is an overall loss in ellipticity below 300 nm, and additional minima at 282 and 291 nm arise. These alterations in the near-UV CD spectra of HSA-DOM II provide evidence for major fluctuations in the tertiary structure and may reflect the changes in the environment of the"

The gene cluster responsible for epothilone biosynthesis in the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum was cloned and completely sequenced. It encodes six multifunctional proteins composed of a loading module, one nonribosomal peptide synthetase module, eight polyketide synthase modules, and a P450 epoxidase that converts desoxyepothilone into epothilone. Concomitant expression of these genes in the actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor produced epothilones A and B. Streptomyces coelicolor is more amenable to strain improvement and grows about 10-fold as rapidly as the natural producer, so this heterologous expression system portends a plentiful supply of this important agent."

https://openalex.org/W1999236279,"Ferritin molecules play an important role in the control of intracellular iron distribution and in the constitution of long term iron stores. In vitro studies on recombinant ferritin subunits have shown that the ferroxidase activity associated with the H subunit is necessary for iron uptake by the ferritin molecule, whereas the L subunit facilitates iron core formation inside the protein shell. However, plant and bacterial ferritins have only a single type of subunit which probably fulfills both functions. To assess the biological significance of the ferroxidase activity associated with the H subunit, we disrupted the H ferritin gene (Fth) in mice by homologous recombination.Fth +/− mice are healthy, fertile, and do not differ significantly from their control littermates. However,Fth −/− embryos die between 3.5 and 9.5 days of development, suggesting that there is no functional redundancy between the two ferritin subunits and that, in the absence of H subunits, L ferritin homopolymers are not able to maintain iron in a bioavailable and nontoxic form. The pattern of expression of the wild type Fth gene in 9.5-day embryos is suggestive of an important function of the H ferritin gene in the heart.

Of those, ferritins (Fts)1 play special roles because of their ubiquitous distribution in all tissues, to the tight iron-dependent gene expression, and to their capacity to store large amounts of iron (up to 4,000 Fe atoms per molecule) inside a large protein shell, in a nontoxic and bioavailable form (reviewed in Ref.1). Mammalian ferritins are heteropolymers made of two different subunit types named H and L. The H chain carries a ferroxidase center which appears to be essential for iron incorporation (2.Levi S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18086-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the L chain facilitates iron mineralization inside the cavity (3.Levi S. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Corsi B.

In prokaryotes and plants, ferritins are made of 24 identical subunits which all carry the ferroxidase activity. In mammals, multiple transcriptional regulations operate which modify H ferritin mRNA levels in response to cytokines (4.Tsuji Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) translational regulation according to the iron status of the cell. Therefore, the conservation of the ferritin ferroxidase activity throughout evolution as well as the very complex genetic regulation of ferritin expression suggest that this catalytic activity is essential for ferritin biological function. We disrupted the H ferritin (Fth) gene in mice and found that H subunit-associated ferroxidase is necessary for early embryonic development because no Fth −/− embryos were found after 3.5 days post coitus. Our data also demonstrate that L ferritin gene product cannot substitute for the H subunit. In contrast, heterozygous Fth +/− were healthy and indistinguishable from their control littermates. A 129/Sv genomic library was screened with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to a 483-bpHindIII fragment from intron 1 of the murine Fthgene, and a phage clone containing a 13-kb insert was identified. To construct the targeting vector, a 1.5-kb 5′-homology PCR fragment from the transcription start site to the first 137 nucleotides of exon 2 was subcloned into a pGEM11Z with a modified polylinker upstream of a 4.8-kb IRES β-geo-poly(A) signal cassette (11.Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A HindIII 6.5-kb long-arm 3′-homology fragment starting from intron 2 was then subcloned downstream of the IRES β-geo. The resulting promoterless targeting vector (see Fig. 1 A) was linearized at the 5′-end by SacII, and 20 μg of plasmid DNA was introduced into CK35 ES cells (gift from C. Babinet, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) by electroporation. After 10 days of G418 selection, surviving colonies were picked, expanded, and screened for homologous recombinants by Southern blotting using a 5′-external probe and a 3′-internal probe. The 5′-probe was a 900-bpEcoRI-SacII fragment excised from theFth proximal promoter region, and the 3′-probe was an 800-bpNsiI-SacI fragment from the region immediately downstream of exon 4. Two positive ES cell clones among 77 were identified and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Chimeric male mice obtained were then bred to C57BL/6 females to produce F1 heterozygous mice which were then interbred. DNA from mice tails and 9.5-day post coitus embryos were prepared by overnight lysis in a proteinase K-containing buffer followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Genotyping on mouse tails was performed using two independent PCR: one designed to amplify wild-type allele between intron 1 and exon 3 and the other designed to amplify the Neo selection marker in the transgene. Primers used for these PCR were for wild-type: sense primer, 5′-TGCGGTGCCTTGCAGTGGAGAT-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-ATTGCATTCCAGCCCGCTCT-3′; and for Neo transgene: sense primer, 5′-GTGTTCCGGCTGTCAGCGCA-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-GTCCTGATAGCGGTCCGCCA-3′. These PCR results were randomly verified by Southern blot analysis. Genotyping of 9.5-day post coitus embryos was performed by Southern blot as described above. For 3.5-day embryo genotyping, blastocysts were flushed out of uterus, washed with water, and then transferred into Eppendorf cups containing 10 μl of water and 7 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Cell DNA was released by successive dry ice freezing and boiling steps followed by a 30-min incubation at 56 °C in the presence of 3 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml). A final incubation was done at 95 °C for 10 min, and samples were kept at −80 °C. The whole lysate was used for multiplex PCR under standard conditions using the following primers: 5′-AGCATGCCGAGAAACTGATGAAG-3′ (5′ common exon 2 sense primer); 3′-antisense, 5′-TGAATGAAACATCGGGTCAAGTC-3′ (binding to intron 2 of the wild type allele); and 3′-antisense, 5′-AATTCTCTAGAGCGGCCGGACTA-3′ (binding to the selection cassette polylinker of the recombined allele). With the simultaneous addition of these three primers, all possible genotypes can be identified by the size of reaction products (299 bp for wild type allele and 139 bp for mutated sequence) on agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA from cell pellets and tissues was isolated using RNAZole B (Bioprobe systems, France). For quantification of L-Ft mRNA, a genomic fragment containing exon 1 from the mouse L ferritin gene and 60 bp of promoter region was used to generate a 190-b antisense RNA probe, using SP6 polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP. Two different probes were used for quantification of H-Ft mRNA. The first probe, H1, was synthesized from a template consisting in exon 1 and 300 bp of promoter region, as described previously (6.Beaumont C. Seyhan A. Yachou A.K. Grandchamp B. Jones R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20281-20288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second probe, H2, was generated from a PCR fragment encompassing the last 116 bp from exon 2 and 17 bp of intron 2. Five μg total RNA were hybridized with 3.105cpm of each probe in 80% formamide-hybridization buffer overnight at 55 °C. Following RNase A+T1 and proteinase K digestion, the protected fragments were separated on a denaturating 8% polyacrylamide gel. Radioactivity associated with the bands was quantified using an Instant Imager (Packard Instrs.) Tissues were homogenized in a 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer with protease inhibitors and sonicated three times for 2 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted in 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. The same polyclonal H-Ft specific anti-mouse subunit antibody was used for coating the plate and for labeling with horse-radish peroxidase. Standard curve was made with recombinant mouse H ferritin polymers. Heparinized blood was obtained by direct aortic puncture under anesthesia. Blood cell counts and erythrocyte parameters were determined using an automated Technicon H1 analyzer. For bone marrow cell count, femoral cavity from adult mice (12- to 26-week-old) were washed with 10 μl of physiological serum. Cell suspensions were spread on slides and stained by May-Grünwald Giemsa coloration, and cell types were scored microscopically according to their morphology. A total of 300 cells was counted for each bone marrow. Whole mount embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer saline at 4° C for 30 min. They were then rinsed for 45 min in three successive baths of 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. After a final rinse in phosphate buffered saline, β galactosidase activity was revealed by incubating the embryos in the dark for various periods of time in phosphate buffer saline containing X-gal at 1 mg/ml, 5 mm K3[Fe(CN6)], 5 mmK4[Fe(CN6)], 3H2O, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. A nullFth allele was generated by deleting the second half of exon 2 and part of intron 2 with the simultaneous “knock-in” of a promoterless internal ribosome entry site (IRES) β-geo-poly(A) signal cassette (11.Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This gene-targeting strategy allows the expression of a bi-cistronic mRNA under the control of the target gene promoter region and the IRES of the encephalomyocarditis virus allows cap-independent translation of the β-geo fusion gene containing the β-galactosidase (Lac Z) and the neomycin resistance (Neor) markers (Fig.1 A). The choice of a promoterless targeting vector was based on the observation made by RNase protection assay (Fig. 1 B), that the Fthgene is actively transcribed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The amount of H mRNA in ES cells is comparable with that in mouse erythroleukemia cells, where the Fth gene transcription is high (6.Beaumont C. Seyhan A. Yachou A.K. Grandchamp B. Jones R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20281-20288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Coccia E.M. Profita V. Fiorucci G. Romeo G. Affabris E. Testa U. Hentze M.W. Battistini A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CK35 ES cells were electroporated and selected in G418, and cells carrying the disrupted allele were identified by Southern blotting (Fig. 1 C) and used to produce mice heterozygous for the Fth mutation in a mixed (129/sv × C57BL/6) genetic background. Quantification of H and L ferritin mRNAs by RNase protection assay performed on several organs confirmed that the disrupted allele is nonfunctional. There was a 2-fold reduction in H-Ft mRNA in all tissues of Fth +/− mice as compared with their wild type littermates, whereas L-Ft mRNA was not modified (Fig. 2 A). Considering that ferritin synthesis is under the control of an iron-mediated translational regulation (reviewed in Ref.13), it was important to confirm that Fth haploinsufficiency resulted in a reduced amount of H-Ft protein. We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on tissue extracts using H-Ft specific anti mouse ferritin antibodies and recombinant H-Ft homopolymers for calibration. The results demonstrate that the amount of H-Ft subunit which accumulates in mouse tissues is also decreased inFth +/− mice as compared with wild type littermates. Fth +/− mice were generally indistinguishable from their control littermates; they were fertile and grew normally. Furthermore, no gross tissue abnormality nor obvious sign of fibrosis or oxidative stress damage was observed in any tissue, as shown by extensive histopathological studies. These analyses included the liver, spleen, heart, lung, kidney, duodenum, brain, pancreas, ovaries, stomach, and femur bone marrow, at different stages up to six month of age. A fine regulation of iron homeostasis is also essential for erythropoiesis. H-Ft has been shown to be up-regulated during erythroid cell differentiation (12.Coccia E.M. Profita V. Fiorucci G.

Thus, we measured blood and bone marrow hematological parameters (TableI), but no obvious difference was observed between Fth +/− andFth +/+ mice.Table IHematological parameters of Fth +/− mice and wild type littermatesGenotypeBlood parametersBone marrow differential countsRBCWBCHbHtCGranulocytesErythroid cellsLymphocytesMonocytesWild type8.9 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.713.9 ± 0.643.7 ± 1.566 ± 1018.5 ± 3.813 ± 91 ± 1Fth +/−8.8 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.613.8 ± 0.442.8 ± 1.773 ± 6.615.5 ± 6.48.6 ± 1.52.4 ± 0.6Values are mean ± S.E.

Bone marrow differential counts are expressed as % of total bone marrow cells ± S.E., after counting 300 cells for wild type (n = 7) and Fth +/− (n = 8) mice. Mice heterozygous for the non-functional Fth allele were intercrossed, but no homozygous mutant mice were found of 323 pups born, suggesting embryonic lethality. We then genotyped embryos at different time points during development to determine the stage of lethality. At embryonic day 9.5, no Fth −/−embryos were found (Fig. 3 A). However, multiplex PCR genotyping of blastocysts at 3.5 days of development revealed that Fth −/− embryos were present (Fig. 3 B) at the expected Mendelian frequency and displayed a normal morphology. These results indicate that theFth −/− embryos die during 3.5 and 9.5 days of development, showing that there is no functional redundancy of H-Ft biological activity with other proteins, including L ferritin. The targeting construct used for homologous recombination was designed to produce a fusion β-geo protein under the control of the regulatory sequences of the H ferritin gene and independently of the iron status of the cell. Therefore, we followed the β-galactosidase reporter gene expression during embryonic development to assess the transcriptional activity of the H ferritin locus. At 9.5 days of development, X-gal staining was low, but easily detectable after 3 h of incubation, mostly in the developing heart and in the central nervous system (Fig.4). A longer incubation period did not noticeably change the pattern of expression. At later stages of development, X-gal staining was ubiquitous, the strongest staining being observed in the heart and in brown fat tissue (not shown). This paper demonstrates that H ferritin subunit is nondispensable for embryonic development because a complete lack of this protein leads to early embryonic death. In addition, there is no redundancy between the H ferritin biological function and either the L subunit or any other protein. In Fth +/− mice, there was no evidence that the remaining wild type allele was up-regulated either at the transcriptional or translational level, to compensate for the disrupted allele. The tight regulation of the Fth gene transcription which operates in multiple conditions is assumed to protect cells against iron-mediated oxidative injury (16.Ryan T.P. Aust S.D. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 119-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), through rapid chelation of the labile iron pool (17.Picard V. Epsztejn S. Santambrogio P. Cabantchik Z.I. Beaumont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15382-15386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We therefore expected that H ferritin deficit might result in increased intracellular labile iron pool and tissue damage. The lack of obvious phenotype ofFth +/− mice could be because of the synthesis of H subunit in amounts sufficient to ensure the formation of functional ferritins. In vitro studies indicated that the ferroxidase activity conferred by 1–2 H subunits per ferritin molecule is sufficient to make it functional, and the ferroxidase activity conferred by 8–9 H subunits per molecule is enough to reach a maximum rate of iron incorporation (18.Santambrogio P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that the physiological amount of H subunits in tissues is not limiting. Death of Fth −/− embryos could result from a modification of intracellular iron availability during the critical period, which spreads developmental stages of implantation, gastrulation, and early organogenesis. The autonomous growth of the embryo from fertilization to the 3.5 day blastocysts may rely on the use of maternal ferritin-iron present in the oocyte. Ferritin is a very stable molecule, and rat liver ferritin has a half-life of 1–2 days (19.Munro H. Linder M. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 58: 317-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Because Fth −/− embryos survive at least to the 62-cell stage, they should have enough iron to ensure DNA replication and heme synthesis. Indeed, disruption of uroporphyrinogen III synthase, an intermediate enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, is lethal between 2- and 4-cell stage, suggesting that heme synthesis takes place at very early stages (20.Bensidhoum M. Larou M. Lemeur M. Dierich A. Costet P. Raymond S. Daniel J.Y. De Verneuil H. Ged C. Transgenics. 1998; 2: 275-280Google Scholar). However, after degradation of all maternal ferritin, the newly synthesized ferritins will lack the H-linked ferroxidase activity and will consist in L subunit homopolymers which are not competent for iron incorporation (21.Levi S. Girelli D. Perrone F. Pasti M. Beaumont C. Corrocher R. Albertini A. Arosio P. Blood. 1998; 91: 4180-4187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of a functional intracellular ferritin compartment is lethal to embryonic cells, possibly because iron entering into the cells cannot be sequestered and detoxified, leading to the catalytic Fenton-driven overproduction of reactive oxygen species which are deleterious for all cell components including membranes and DNA (16.Ryan T.P. Aust S.D. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 119-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In addition, the H-containing ferritins may be essential for making iron available to essential enzymes and to DNA replication. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive because ferritin-deficient mutants of Campylobacter jejuni have impaired growth because of iron deficiency and are more sensitive to killing by H2O2 (22.Wai S.N. Nakayama K. Umene K. Moriya T. Amako K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). During organogenesis, the absence of functional ferritins will also impair iron storage. Early in development, the primitive embryonic erythroid cells in the yolk-sac are the site of iron deposition and contain high amounts of ferritins (23.Theil E.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1976; 33: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24.Theil E.C. Brenner W.E. Dev. Biol. 1981; 84: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), before the liver becomes the major site of iron storage at a later stage. However, our observation that the highest level of H ferritin gene expression at 9.5 days of gestation is found in the heart suggests that the embryos could also die of heart failure because of massive iron deposition. To date, from the various mouse models with disrupted genes of iron metabolism, embryonic lethality seems to result from iron deficiency associated with impaired iron storage (Fth) or transport because transferrin receptor (Trfr) knock-out embryos die between 8.5 and 12.5 days of development, mostly from defective erythropoiesis and neurological abnormalities (25.Levy J.E. Jin O. Fujiwara Y. Kuo F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Taken together with the fact that H-type ferritins are present in plants and throughout the animal kingdom, our results demonstrate that the ferroxidase activity of the ferritin molecule, which is the only known cytoplasmic activity which can transform the more toxic Fe(II) into a less toxic Fe(III), is essential for detoxification of iron and/or for maintaining its bioavailability. The benefit of having two different H and L subunits, as it is the case in humans and other vertebrates, remains to be analyzed, and the study of L ferritin knock-out mice might bring some information on this point.

https://openalex.org/W1972606544,"Light generates reducing equivalents in chloroplasts that are used not only for carbon reduction, but also for the regulation of the activity of chloroplast enzymes by reduction of regulatory disulfides via the ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase (FTR) system. FTR, the key electron/thiol transducer enzyme in this pathway, is unique in that it can reduce disulfides by an iron-sulfur cluster, a property that is explained by the tight contact of its active-site disulfide and the iron-sulfur center. The thin, flat FTR molecule makes the two-electron reduction possible by forming on one side a mixed disulfide with thioredoxin and by providing on the opposite side access to ferredoxin for delivering electrons."
https://openalex.org/W1587532579,"Radiation chemical experiments demonstrate that the reaction of tyrosyl radical (TyrO⋅) with⋅NO2 yields 45 ± 3% 3-nitrotyrosine and that a major product of the reaction of TyrO⋅ with⋅NO is 3,3′-dityrosine. Radiolysis was used to generate⋅NO and O⨪2 in the presence of tyrosine and bicarbonate at pH 7.5 ± 0.1. The nitration yield was found to be dose rate-dependent, and the yield per radical produced by pulse radiolysis was identical to that obtained with authentic peroxynitrite. The proposed mechanism that accounts for the data is as follows: (i) In the presence of CO2 the reaction of ⋅NO with O⨪2 yields 33% ⋅NO2 and CO⨪3, where the latter reacts rapidly with tyrosine to form TyrO⋅; (ii) The formation of 3-nitrotyrosine takes place via the reaction of⋅NO2 with TyrO⋅, which is the main process at high dose rates; and (iii) Under continuous generation of⋅NO and O⨪2, the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine is strongly suppressed because of efficient scavenging of⋅NO2 by tyrosine. The proposed model shows that the highest nitration yield is obtained for similar fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2 and is completely inhibited upon excess production of O⨪2 because of efficient scavenging of TyrO⋅ by O⨪2.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356 (and references therein): 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that peroxynitrite can operate as a nitrating agent in vivo (3.Beckman J.S. Chem. Res.

In many cases the evidence that implicates ONOO− in a large variety of diseases is the detection of 3-NT in the injured tissues (3.Beckman J.S. Chem. Res.

However, it has been recently shown (15.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) that the in vitro nitration yield of tyrosine at pH 7.4 following the simultaneous generation of⋅NO and O⨪2 was considerably lower than that obtained upon bolus addition of peroxynitrite. Furthermore, addition of bicarbonate to the former system had hardly any effect on the nitration yield (15.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas it doubled the yield in the latter case (7.Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7855-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 8.Berlett B.S. Levine R.L. Stadman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) that the reaction of ⋅NO with O⨪2 forms a species different from the one present in alkaline bolus additions, although flash photolysis (1.Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) and pulse radiolysis (2.Goldstein S. Czapski G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) studies have demonstrated the formation of peroxynitrite via the combination of these radicals. Nevertheless, these experimental results (15.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) seem to present a problem for the hypothesis that 3-NT is a product of ONOO− in biological systems, given that the main biological source of ONOO− is the reaction of⋅NO with O⨪2. In the present study we used radiolysis to generate ⋅NO and O⨪2 in the presence of tyrosine and bicarbonate at pH 7.5. Pulse radiolysis mimics bolus addition of peroxynitrite, whereas with γ-radiolysis the radicals are continuously formed and the flux is determined by the dose rate. We shall show that maximum nitration yield is obtained for essentially equal fluxes of O⨪2 and ⋅NO and that the yield decreases upon decreasing the flux of these radicals. The biological implications of these observations will be discussed. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were used as received. Solutions were prepared with distilled water, which was further purified using a Milli-Q water purification system. Peroxynitrite was prepared by having nitrite react with acidified hydrogen peroxide at room temperature in a quenched flow system (16.Saha A. Goldstein S. Cabelli D. Czapski G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The yield of ONOO− was determined from its absorption using ε302 = 1670 m−1cm−1 (17.Hughes, M. N., and Nicklin, H. G. (1968) J. Chem. Soc., 450–456Google Scholar). The stock solution of peroxynitrite contained 7–9% nitrite and practically no residual H2O2. ⋅NO-saturated solutions in 2 mm phosphate buffer were prepared as described elsewhere (18.Goldstein S. Czapski G. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 35: 7735-7740Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 3,3′-Dityrosine (dityr) was prepared by irradiation of N2O-saturated solutions containing 4 mmtyrosine and 0.2 m azide at pH 11.4 (19.Prutz W.A. Butler J. Land E.J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1983; 44: 183-196Google Scholar). Bicarbonate was added as a sodium salt to the buffer, and the concentration of CO2 was calculated from the assumed pK = 6.2 for the hydration of CO2 (20.Alberty R.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 11028-11034Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in the presence of 50–100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5 ± 0.1) and at room temperature. Samples were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (Merck-Hitachi l-6200A) using a L-4500 diode-array detector. The products were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min from a LiChroCART 250–4 Superspher 100 RP-18 (Merck). The mobile phase contained 50 mmKH2PO4/H3PO4 buffer (pH 3) and 8% (v/v) methanol. Yields of 3-NT (RT = 12 min) were determined after daily calibration with standard solutions. Complete separation of dityr (RT = 4.9 min) from tyrosine (RT = 4.5 min) was not achieved under most experimental conditions. Therefore, yields of dityr were determined using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 Luminescence Spectrometer. Samples were adjusted to pH > 11, and fluorescence intensities at 410 nm (325 nm excitation) were compared with intensities of known amounts of dityr (19.Prutz W.A. Butler J. Land E.J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1983; 44: 183-196Google Scholar). Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out with a Varian 7715 linear accelerator with 5-MeV electron pulses of 0.2–1.5 μs and 200 mA as described elsewhere (18.Goldstein S. Czapski G. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 35: 7735-7740Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). γ-Radiolysis experiments were carried out with a 137Cs source (Radiation Machinery Corp., Parsippany, New Jersey). Absorbed doses were determined using the Fricke dosimeter (1 mmFeSO4 in 0.8 n H2SO4) on the basis of G(FeIII) = 15.6 and ε302(FeIII) = 2200m−1 cm−1 (21.Buxton G.V. Stuart C.R. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1995; 91: 279-281Crossref Google Scholar). Bio SX-17MV Sequential Stopped Flow from Applied Photophysics was used for efficient mixing of peroxynitrite with buffered solutions of tyrosine and bicarbonate because the half-life of the reaction is shorter than 0.1 s. This method was also used to study the reaction of ⋅NO with O2 in the presence of phenol and various tyrosine derivatives at 25 °C. The final pH was measured in the outlet of the flow system. Modeling of the experimental results was carried out using INTKIN, a noncommercial program developed at Brookhaven National Laboratories by Dr. H. A. Schwarz. Radiolytically generated⋅N3 and ⋅NO2 radicals in the presence of tyrosine have been used to determine the yield of 3-NT formed in the reaction of TyrO⋅ with⋅NO2, which was previously assumed to be 100% (6.Van der Vliet A.

Essentially equal amounts of ⋅N3 and⋅NO2 are formed upon irradiation of deaerated solutions containing 30 mm NaN3, 30 mm KNO3, and 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 (solution A) via Reactions 1–R4.

An additional contribution of ∼7% to these yields was assumed because of track scavenging (23.Schuler R.H. Patterson L.K. Janata E. J. Phys.

However, from published data (22.Prutz W.A. Monig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) for the reactions of ⋅NO2 with Gly-TyrOH (3.2 × 105 and 2 × 107m−1 s−1 at pH 7.5 and 11.3, respectively) and Gly-TyrO⋅ (≈3 × 109m−1 s−1), it is reasonable to assume similar values for tyrosine at pH 7.5. The main products found after irradiation of solution A were 3-NT and dityr. The amount of 3-NT increased linearly with the dose at a constant dose rate and was strongly dependent on the dose rate (Fig.1). The yield of 3-NT was determined to be 37.0 ± 1.4% of ⋅NO2 formed with a 21.2 Gy/pulse (100 ×G(3-NT)/G(⋅NO2)), and it was merely 4.3 ± 0.4% of the total ⋅NO2 produced with 9.3 Gy/min. The yield of dityr in γ-radiolysis experiments was considerably higher than that in pulse radiolysis, in which it was below the limit of detection. The yield of dityr in γ-radiolysis experiments could not be determined because it was not linear with the dose, suggesting subsequent reaction of dityr with TyrO⋅ to form higher derivatives (27.Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S. Mueller D.M. Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19950-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Pulse radiolysis and stopped flow techniques were used in an attempt to determine the products of the reaction of TyrO⋅ with⋅NO. N2O-saturated solutions containing tyrosine and azide ions at pH > 11 were mixed with ⋅NO-saturated solutions using the syringe technique. The final mixtures contained 90% N2O and 10% ⋅NO (22.5 mmN2O, 0.18 mm⋅NO), 4 mmtyrosine, and 0.2 m azide at pH 11.4 and 12.6 (solutionB). Pulse radiolysis of solution B yields the azide radical via Reactions 1, 2, and 12, which rapidly oxidizes only TyrO− (18.Goldstein S. Czapski G. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 35: 7735-7740Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24.Mallard W.G. Ross A.B. Helman W.P.

The latter is too low for determining the reaction products. We measured k(⋅NO + TyrO⋅) = (1.05 ± 0.05) × 109m−1 s−1 at pH 11.4, 2Pulse radiolysis (6.9 Gy/pulse) was applied to N2O-saturated solutions containing 0.2 m azide and 4 mm tyrosine at pH 11.3. The decay of TyrO⋅, as followed at 405 nm, was second order with 2k 8 = (7.0 ± 1.0) × 108m−1 s−1. In the presence of 10%⋅NO (0.18 mm) the decay of TyrO⋅ was first order with k obs = (1.9 ± 0.1) × 105 s−1. The bimolecular rate constant was calculated to be (1.05 ± 0.05) × 109m−1 s−1. which is identical to the value determined previously at pH 7.4 (28.Eiserich J.P. Butler J. van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The main product found after irradiation of solution B was dityr, and its yield was determined to be 36 ± 4% of the yield obtained in the absence of⋅NO at pH 11.4 (Fig. 2) and pH 12.6 (results not shown). The reaction of 0.9 mm⋅NO with 0.6 mmO2 was studied at pH 12 in the presence of 50 mm C6H5OH or TyrOH. Under these conditions ∼50% 4-nitrosophenol was formed as determined from the absorbance at 397 nm (29.Pires M. Rossi M.J. Ross D.S. Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 1994; 26: 1207-1227Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but less than 5% 3-nitrosotyrosine as determined from the absorbance at 474 nm (30.Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D.

Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). 3It has been shown that the reaction of⋅NO with O2 at pH 7.4 in the presence of 65 mm Ala-TyrOH forms an absorbing product with λmax at 474 nm (ε = 650 ± 150m−1 cm−1) (30.Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W.G. Mitchell J.B. Chem. Res.

We confirmed the latter value at pH 7.5 in the presence of 59 mm Ala-TyrOH and found that the yield of nitrosotyrosine decreased upon increasing the pH. The same results were obtained for Gly-TyrOH. The dipeptides were used because of the increased solubility in water at pH 7.5 compared with tyrosine. We therefore used ε474 = 650 ± 150m−1 cm−1 to calculate the yield of 3-nitrosotyrosine at pH 12. Peroxynitrite (0.12–3.22 mm, pH 12) was mixed with a solution containing 1.2 mmtyrosine, 20 mm bicarbonate, and 120 mmphosphate in a 1:5 ratio. The final mixture contained 20–537 μm peroxynitrite, 1 mm tyrosine, 0.91 mm CO2, and 100 mm phosphate at pH 7.6 (solution C). The yield of 3-NT was found to be 14–16% of the peroxynitrite, in good agreement with an earlier reported value at pH 7.5 (7.Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7855-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). When aerated solutions containing 10 mm nitrite, 1 m methanol, 2 mm tyrosine, 0.38 mm CO2, and 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.6 (solution D) are irradiated, eaq− is converted into ⋅NO via Reactions 14 and 15, and ⋅OH is converted into O⨪2 via Reactions 16–R18. eaq−+NO2−→NO22−k14=4×109 M−1s−1 (24)NO22−+H2PO4−→ ⋅NO+OH−+HPO42−k15=1.5×108 M−1s−1 (26)⋅OH+CH3OH→ ⋅CH2OH+H2Ok16=9.7×108 M−1s−1 (24)⋅CH2OH+O2→ ⋅O2CH2OHk17=4.9×109 M−1s−1 (24)⋅O2CH2OH+HPO42−→HCHO+H2PO4−+O ·2−k18=2×106 M−1s−1 (24) REACTIONS 14–18H⋅ reacts with CH3OH, O2, and NO2− to form ∼40% O⨪2 and 60% ⋅NO (24.Mallard W.G. Ross A.B. Helman W.P. NIST Standard References Database. 1998; 40 (Version 3.0)Google Scholar), and essentially equal yields of O⨪2 and⋅NO are formed in irradiation of solution D(G(O⨪2) ≈ G(⋅NO) ≈ 3.1). The maximum dose delivered into solution D did not exceed 600 Gy (corresponding to the production of 0.186 mmO⨪2 at the expense of O2 in aerated solutions via Reactions 17 and 18). The yields of 3-NT obtained after irradiation of solution D at various dose rates are given in TableI. The yield of dityr was measured to be 12.3 ± 3.2% using a 21 Gy/pulse.Table IExperimental and simulated yields of 3-nitrotyrosine from irradiation of solution D at various dose ratesRate3-NitrotyrosineExperimentalSimulated%6.5 μm/pulse0.32 ± 0.03 μm/pulse (4.9 ± 0.5%)6.12.9 μm/min0.98 ± 0.20 μm/h (0.56 ± 0.11%)0.560.86 μm/min0.62 ± 0.12 μm/4 h (0.30 ± 0.06%)0.320.36 μm/min0.24 ± 0.05 μm/6 h (0.19 ± 0.04%)0.20Solution D contains 2 mm tyrosine, 0.38 mm CO2, 10 mm nitrite, 1 mmethanol, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Open table in a new tab Solution D contains 2 mm tyrosine, 0.38 mm CO2, 10 mm nitrite, 1 mmethanol, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Reactions 5–R11 were used for simulating the yield of 3-NT obtained upon pulse radiolysis of solutionA, where 6.1 μm⋅N3 and 5.9 μm⋅NO2 are formed within less than 1 μs after the end of the pulse. Under these conditions the dimerization of ⋅N3 (Reaction 5) and hydrolysis of⋅NO2 (Reactions 10 and 11) cannot be ignored, but the contribution of Reaction 7 is insignificant, and therefore the results are insensitive for the value taken for this reaction. The best fit to the experimental yield of 3-NT was obtained assuming that the reaction of ⋅NO2 with TyrO⋅ forms 45 ± 3% 3-NT, i.e. k 9a/k 9b = 0.8 ± 0.1: ⋅NO2+TyrO⋅→O2N­adductk9=3×109 M−1s−1O2N­adduct→3­NTO2N­adduct→products REACTIONS 9,9a,9bIn γ-radiolysis Reactions 5, 10, and 11 can be ignored, but Reaction 7 becomes significant and competes efficiently with Reaction 9. Therefore, the yield of dityr is higher and that of 3-NT lower than those obtained in pulse radiolysis. The proposed model (k 9a/k 9b = 0.8) fits the experimental yield of 3-NT assuming that k 7 = 3.2 × 105m−1s−1, which is the value determined for GlyTyrOH at pH 7.5 (22.Prutz W.A. Monig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). No attempt was made in this study to identify the products formed through Reaction 9b. We note that a nitration yield of ∼30% can be calculated from the data given for Gly-TyrOH (22.Prutz W.A. Monig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). 4Prutz et al. (22.Prutz W.A. Monig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have applied pulse radiolysis (5.6 Gy/pulse) to deaerated solutions containing 20 1 μm Gly-TyrOH, 1.6 mm azide, and 1.6 mm nitrate at pH 9.3. Under these conditions ∼3.2 μm⋅N3 are initially formed, yet ∼0.3 μm 3-NT was measured. At pH 9.3k(Gly-TyrOH + ⋅N3) ≈ 5.9 × 108m−1s−1 (calculated using the published data for TyrOH (24.Mallard W.G. Ross A.B. Helman W.P. NIST Standard References Database. 1998; 40 (Version 3.0)Google Scholar)), and therefore because of the fast dimerization of⋅N3 only ∼1 μm oxidized Gly-TyrOH. Thus, the nitration yield is calculated to be ∼30%. The reaction of TyrO⋅ with ⋅NO may play an important role during simultaneous generation of ⋅NO and O⨪2 in the presence of TyrOH. It has been proposed (28.Eiserich J.P. Butler J. van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) by analogy to Reaction 9 that ⋅NO reacts with TyrO⋅ to yield 3-nitrosotyrosine, although the formation of the O-nitroso product was also assumed to be possible. However, no observable products of this reaction were identified by spectral scanning, and it was assumed that the nitroso products are unstable under the experimental conditions (28.Eiserich J.P. Butler J. van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, we found that the major product of this reaction is dityr, although the reaction of ⋅NO with TyrO⋅ is faster than the dimerization of TyrO⋅.2 Previously, it has been shown that C- andO-nitrosophenols slowly dissociate back to phenoxyl radical and ⋅NO in the gas phase and in nonaqueous solutions (31.Janzen E.G. Wilcox A.L. Manoharan V. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 3597-3599Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 32.Berho F. Caralp F. Rayez M.-T. Lesclaux R. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 1-8Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The binding of ⋅NO to tyrosyl residues in proteins appeared also to be reversible (33.Szalai V.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15080-15087Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34.Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 273: 8903-8909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar). If the binding of ⋅NO to TyrO⋅ is reversible (Equilibrium 19), we would expect all tyrosyl radicals to end up as dityr. The fact that only 36% dityr was formed (Fig. 2) must be attributed to some slow decomposition reaction of the NO-adduct, e.g. hydrolysis (Reaction 20) or conversion to a C-nitroso-tyrosine (Reaction 21). ⋅NO+TyrO⋅⇌TyrONO TyrONO+H2O→TyrOH+NO2−+H+ TyrONO→3­nitrosotyrosine REACTIONS 19–21Simulation of this mechanism, which accounts for 36% yield of dityr and k 19 = 1 × 109m−1 s−1 (28.Eiserich J.P.

To determine whether the reaction of TyrO⋅ with⋅NO yields 3-nitrosotyrosine, we compared the products of the reaction of ⋅NO with O2 in the presence of phenol or tyrosine at pH 12. It has been well established that⋅NO2 and N2O3 are formed as intermediates during autoxidation of ⋅NO and can oxidize and nitrosate a large variety of compounds (29.Pires M. Rossi M.J. Ross D.S. Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 1994; 26: 1207-1227Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30.Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C.

Soc. 1996; 118: 3419-3425Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Nitrosation can be initiated by ⋅NO2 unless it is scavenged faster by⋅NO to form N2O3 (36.Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3419-3425Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar), where the latter can nitrosate phenols via the so-calledA-S E2 mechanism (29.Pires M. Rossi M.J. Ross D.S. Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 1994; 26: 1207-1227Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 37.Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1988: 58-76Google Scholar). The rate constant for the reaction of C6H5O− with⋅NO2 (k = 1.5 × 107m−1 s−1) (24.Mallard W.G. Ross A.B. Helman W.P. NIST Standard References Database. 1998; 40 (Version 3.0)Google Scholar) is ∼2 times lower than k 7, yet under the same experimental conditions the yield of 3-nitrosotyrosine was 10 times lower than that of 4-nitrosophenol. These results demonstrate that although the reaction of C6H5O⋅ with⋅NO yields 4-nitrosophenol, that of TyrO⋅ with⋅NO does not result in the formation of 3-nitrosotyrosine. Nitrosation of phenol itself is known to give ∼90% 4-nitrosophenol (37.Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1988: 58-76Google Scholar), suggesting that when the 4 position of phenols is blocked, like in tyrosine, the addition of ⋅NO to the 2 position does not take place and that nitrosation of tyrosines during autoxidation of⋅NO proceeds mainly through N2O3. We conclude that binding of ⋅NO to TyrO⋅ is reversible and does not yield 3-nitrosotyrosine. This conclusion is further supported by a recent study (38.Gonzalez-Mancebo S. Carcia-Santos P.M. Hernandez-Benito J. Calle E. Casado J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1999; 47: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) demonstrating that once 2-NO-phenols are formed, they are stable, and therefore 3-nitrosotyrosine cannot be the source for dityr formation. It has been well established that the reaction of ONOO− with CO2 forms an adduct that decomposes to yield 30–33% CO⨪3 and⋅NO2 via Reactions 22–R24 (39.Goldstein S. Czapski G. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 36: 5113-5117Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40.Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 294-301Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 41.Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3458-3463Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and in this system CO⨪3 is scavenged rapidly by 1 mmTyrOH via Reaction 25 (24.Mallard W.G. Ross A.B. Helman W.P. NIST Standard References Database. 1998; 40 (Version 3.0)Google Scholar).

The dimerization of CO⨪3 and hydrolysis of ⋅NO2 are relatively slow (24.Mallard W.G. Ross A.B. Helman W.P. NIST Standard References Database. 1998; 40 (Version 3.0)Google Scholar) and can be ignored. Roughly, if ∼33% of peroxynitrite yields TyrO⋅ and⋅NO2 and if the reaction between these radicals yields ∼45% 3-NT, one expects the nitration yield to be ∼15%, in agreement with experimental results. Upon irradiation of solutionD, essentially equal yields of O⨪2 and ⋅NO are formed in the presence of tyrosine and bicarbonate. The results given in Table I demonstrate that the nitration yield is dose rate-dependent, i.e. the yield decreases upon lowering the flux of the radicals, and is considerably lower than that obtained in pulse radiolysis. This is similar to case A, where TyrO⋅ and ⋅NO2 radicals were produced simultaneously. In pulse radiolysis peroxynitrite was formed within 0.2 ms after the end of the pulse (Reaction 26), and this reaction was followed by Reactions 22–R25 and 7–R9. ⋅NO+O⨪2→ONOO−k26=(4.3–6.7)×109 M−1s−1 (1,2) REACTION 26Thus, pulse radiolysis of solution D resembles systemC, where the pulse replaces addition of relatively low concentration of authentic peroxynitrite. Indeed, simulation of Reactions 22–R25 and 7–R9 using the experimental conditions of solutionD (6.5 μm peroxynitrite, 2 mmTyrOH, 0.38 mm CO2, pH 7.6) yields 6.2% 3-NT and 19% dityr assumingk 9a/k 9b = 0.8 andk 7 = 3.2 × 105m−1 s−1, in fair agreement with the experimental yields of 4.9 ± 0.5% 3-NT and 12.3 ± 3.2% dityr obtained from pulse radiolysis. In γ-radiolysis the nitration yields are considerably lower than those in pulse radiolysis because the formation of 3-NT takes place through the reaction of TyrO⋅ with⋅NO2 (radical-radical addition). Under continuous generation of ⋅NO and O⨪2, the steady-state concentrations of these radicals are as low as a few times 10−9m. As the rate constants for the radical-radical reactions (k 8,k 9, k 26, andk 27) differ by less than a factor of 10, the corresponding steady-state concentration of TyrO⋅ will be close to those of ⋅NO and O⨪2. TyrO⋅+O⨪2→products k27=1.5×109 M−1s−1 (25) REACTION 27However, the steady-state concentration of ⋅NO2will be reduced far below those of the other radicals, because only⋅NO2 is sufficiently reactive toward the tyrosine molecule. Therefore, Reaction 7 will compete very efficiently with Reaction 9. The simulated yields of 3-NT using the proposed radical model are given in Table I and are in excellent agreement with the experimental ones. These results show that the yield of 3-NT per radical is proportional to (flux)1/2, i.e.([ONOO−]S.S.)1/2, as predicted by our radical model. We were unable to produce different ratios of ⋅NO and O⨪2 using γ-radiolysis and could not confirm experimentally the radical model in the same way as we did above for generation of equal fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2. Therefore, we used our proposed model to simulate the 3-NT yields produced at different fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2. Under these conditions Reactions 28–R33 must also be considered. 2 ⋅NO+O2→2 ⋅NO2 k28=2.9×106 M−2s−1 (36) ⋅NO+⋅NO2⇌N2O3 k29=1.1×109 M−1s−1 k−29=8.4×104 s−1 (44) N2O3+H2O→2 NO2−+2H+ k30=2×103+1.9×106[HCO3−]+ 8×105[phosphate]s−1 (36,45,46) ⋅NO2+O⨪2⇌O2NOO− k31=4.5×109 M−1s−1 (24)k−31=1.1 s−1 (47) O2NOO−→NO2−+O2 k32=1.3 s−1 (47) 2 O⨪2+2H+→O2+H2O2 2k33=4×105 M−1s−1 (24) REACTIONS 28–33The simulation was done for 1 h incubation at pH 7.5 (50 mm phosphate buffer) in the presence of 1 mmTyrOH and 1 mm CO2 (20 mmbicarbonate). Under these conditions the concentration of TyrOH is reduced by less than 5% and has a minor effect on the competing reactions. The simulated yields for a constant flux of 1 μm/min ⋅NO and varying fluxes of O⨪2 andvice versa are given in Fig. 3(A and B, respectively), resulting in asymmetrical bell-shaped curves. Upon excess production of O⨪2, the steady-state concentration of TyrO⋅ is significantly reduced because of Reaction 27. Thus, although Reaction 7 is still the major consumption route of⋅NO2, Reaction 9 is more and more suppressed in favor of Reaction 27, and nitration is completely inhibited in the presence of excess generation of O⨪2. With excess production of⋅NO or ⋅NO alone, the steady-state concentration of TyrO⋅ is unaffected because of the reversible binding of⋅NO to TyrO⋅. In this case, the nitration is initiated by autoxidation of ⋅NO (Reaction 28), followed by Reactions 7–R9, 29, and 30, and should depend on the rate of hydrolysis of N2O3, because the latter determines the steady-state concentration of ⋅NO2. Indeed, it has been shown that ⋅NO alone nitrates tyrosine (15.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the nitration yields measured by Pfeiffer and Mayer (15.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) for different fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2 did not result in an asymmetrical bell-shaped curve as predicted by our radical model (Fig. 3). In fact, they obtained maximum nitration yield in the presence of ⋅NO alone. We attribute this discrepancy to inappropriate experiments, where ⋅NO and O⨪2 were generated with donor systems,i.e. NONOates, xanthine/xanthine oxidase, for 12 h (15.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). During this time of incubation the flux of ⋅NO and the ratio ⋅NO/O⨪2 were dramatically reduced, and therefore the measured nitration yields were considerably lower than would have been obtained for constant fluxes. Clearly, these experimental artifacts invalidate the conclusions drawn by Pfeiffer and Mayer (15.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The occurrence of nitrotyrosine bound to proteins has often been regarded as evidence for in vivogeneration of peroxynitrite, although other reactive nitrogen species can also nitrate tyrosine bound to proteins (9.Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356 (and references therein): 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Our proposed model for free tyrosine nitration should be very similar to that of tyrosine residues in proteins because: (i) formation of 3,3′-dityr species from tyrosyl radicals (Reaction 8) is a rather common and efficient process in tyrosyl peptides and proteins (19.Prutz W.A. Butler J. Land E.J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1983; 44: 183-196Google Scholar); (ii) binding of ⋅NO to tyrosyl radicals in various peptides is reversible (33.Szalai V.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15080-15087Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34.Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 273: 8903-8909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar); and (iii) the rate constant for the hydrolysis of N2O3under biological conditions (12–30 mm bicarbonate, 5–80 mm phosphate, 5–110 mm chloride) varies between 3 × 104 and 1.4 × 105s−1 (46.Caulfield J.L.

Thus, the results given in Fig. 3 for free tyrosine (50 mm phosphate, 20 mm carbonate, pH 7.5) approximate very well the physiological conditions. It is worthwhile to note that the yields of dityrosine and its higher derivatives (27.Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S. Mueller D.M. Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19950-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) at (⋅NO)flux ≥ (O⨪2)flux should be very high and could cause possible enzyme inactivation. However, if the tyrosyl-NO adduct is efficiently oxidized in vivo by appropriate oxidants (34.Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 273: 8903-8909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the yield of 3-NT could be high and that of dityrosine and its higher derivatives low. Biologically generated radicals can oxidize thiols (RSH) to form thiyl radicals (RS⋅), which can undergo several other processes. Relatively high concentrations of thiols are required to compete with tyrosine for CO⨪3 (24.Mallard W.G. Ross A.B. Helman W.P. NIST Standard References Database. 1998; 40 (Version 3.0)Google Scholar), but rather lower concentrations are sufficient to compete with ⋅NO2 for the tyrosyl radical. Thiyl radicals will either form O⨪2 (Reactions 34 and 35) or RSNO (Reaction 36), where the latter is known as a ⋅NO carrier. RS⋅+RS−⇌RSSR⨪ RSSR⨪+O2→RSSR+O⨪2 RS⋅+⋅NO→RSNO REACTIONS 34–36Thus, nitration of tyrosine will be prevented by the presence of relatively low concentrations of thiols, provided the latter have access to the reactive site. Nitration of tyrosine in the presence of bicarbonate depends on the rates of generation of ⋅NO and O⨪2. The nitration yield obtained per radical produced by the pulse is identical to that obtained by the same concentration of authentic peroxynitrite but is remarkably reduced upon continuous generation of ⋅NO and O⨪2. The highest nitration yield is obtained for similar fluxes of ⋅NO and O⨪2 and is completely inhibited only in the presence of excess production of O⨪2."
https://openalex.org/W2164321447,"An ocean-climate model that shows high fluxes of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the Southern Ocean, but very low storage of anthropogenic carbon there, agrees with observation-based estimates of ocean storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. This low simulated storage indicates a subordinate role for deep convection in the present-day Southern Ocean. The primary mechanism transporting anthropogenic carbon out of the Southern Ocean is isopycnal transport. These results imply that if global climate change reduces the density of surface waters in the Southern Ocean, isopycnal surfaces that now outcrop may become isolated from the atmosphere, tending to diminish Southern Ocean carbon uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1995522818,"Strictosidine β-d-glucosidase (SGD) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) by converting strictosidine to cathenamine. The biosynthetic pathway toward strictosidine is thought to be similar in all TIA-producing plants. Somewhere downstream of strictosidine formation, however, the biosynthesis diverges to give rise to the different TIAs found. SGD may play a role in creating this biosynthetic diversity. We have studied SGD at both the molecular and enzymatic levels. Based on the homology between different plant β-glucosidases, degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers were designed and used to isolate a cDNA clone from a Catharanthus roseuscDNA library. A full-length clone gave rise to SGD activity when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD shows ∼60% homology at the amino acid level to other β-glucosidases from plants and is encoded by a single-copy gene. Sgd expression is induced by methyl jasmonate with kinetics similar to those of two other genes acting prior to Sgd in TIA biosynthesis. These results show that coordinate induction of the biosynthetic genes forms at least part of the mechanism for the methyl jasmonate-induced increase in TIA production. Using a novel in vivo staining method, subcellular localization studies of SGD were performed. This showed that SGD is most likely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, which is in accordance with the presence of a putative signal sequence, but in contrast to previous localization studies. This new insight in SGD localization has significant implications for our understanding of the complex intracellular trafficking of metabolic intermediates during TIA biosynthesis. Strictosidine β-d-glucosidase (SGD) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) by converting strictosidine to cathenamine. The biosynthetic pathway toward strictosidine is thought to be similar in all TIA-producing plants. Somewhere downstream of strictosidine formation, however, the biosynthesis diverges to give rise to the different TIAs found. SGD may play a role in creating this biosynthetic diversity. We have studied SGD at both the molecular and enzymatic levels. Based on the homology between different plant β-glucosidases, degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers were designed and used to isolate a cDNA clone from a Catharanthus roseuscDNA library. A full-length clone gave rise to SGD activity when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD shows ∼60% homology at the amino acid level to other β-glucosidases from plants and is encoded by a single-copy gene. Sgd expression is induced by methyl jasmonate with kinetics similar to those of two other genes acting prior to Sgd in TIA biosynthesis. These results show that coordinate induction of the biosynthetic genes forms at least part of the mechanism for the methyl jasmonate-induced increase in TIA production. Using a novel in vivo staining method, subcellular localization studies of SGD were performed. This showed that SGD is most likely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, which is in accordance with the presence of a putative signal sequence, but in contrast to previous localization studies. This new insight in SGD localization has significant implications for our understanding of the complex intracellular trafficking of metabolic intermediates during TIA biosynthesis. terpenoid indole alkaloids methyl jasmonate strictosidine β-d-glucosidase endoplasmic reticulum anion-exchange chromatography 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol high-performance liquid chromatography polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) Terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs)1 form the largest group of alkaloids with >3000 representatives. About 15 of these are of pharmaceutical interest. Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don (Apocynaceae) is the commercial source of three such alkaloids, which have pharmaceutical applications. Ajmalicine is used to improve cerebral circulation, and the dimeric alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine are important antitumor drugs. The biosynthesis of these alkaloids has been studied quite extensively (for a review, see Ref.1.Verpoorte R. van der Heijden R. Memelink J. Alkaloids. 1998; 50: 453-508Google Scholar), among others, with the aim of applying this knowledge to improve the production in plants or plant cell cultures. Some of the early steps leading to strictosidine, the key intermediate to all TIAs and quinoline alkaloids, have been studied in detail. Strictosidine is formed by the coupling of secologanin to tryptamine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme strictosidine synthase (EC 4.3.3.2). This enzyme is located in the vacuole (2.McKnight T.D. Bergey D.R. Burnett R.J. Nessler C.L. Planta (Heidelb.). 1991; 185: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Tryptamine is formed from the amino acid tryptophan by the action of the cytosolic enzyme tryptophan decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28), and secologanin is a glucoiridoid formed from geraniol. The expression of the Strand Tdc genes is induced by the plant stress signaling hormone MeJA (3.Menke F.L.H. Parchmann S. Mueller M.J. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 119: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MeJA increases alkaloid production in cell suspension cultures (4.Gantet P. Imbault N. Thiersault M. Doireau P. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 220-225Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and seedlings (5.Aerts R.J. Gisi D. De Carolis E. De Luca V. Baumann T.W. Plant J. 1994; 5: 635-643Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar) of C. roseus, showing that TIA-producing plants respond to stress by increasing their alkaloid content, among others, through increased gene expression. It is unknown how strictosidine is channeled into various pathways that lead to the different types of TIA skeletons. The first step after strictosidine formation is removal of the glucose moiety, a reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme strictosidine β-d-glucosidase (SGD; EC 3.2.1.105). Removal of glucose results in a highly reactive dialdehyde. Depending on the conditions (e.g. solvent, pH), various products can be formed from this dialdehyde. Under mildly acidic incubation conditions, the major product of SGD from C. roseus is cathenamine (6.Stevens L.H. Formation and Conversion of Strictosidine in the Biosynthesis of Monoterpenoid Indole and Quinoline Alkaloids..in: Ph.D. Thesis. Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands1994Google Scholar). Better understanding of this step may lead to the development of strategies to channel the flux toward the desired type of alkaloid. Apart from its role in the biosynthesis of TIAs, which have putative functions in plant defense, SGD may also have a more direct role in defense. In young tissue of C. roseus, where strictosidine is the major TIA, SGD in combination with strictosidine is thought to be part of a damage-inducible biochemical defense system. Strictosidine is stored in the vacuole, whereas SGD is thought to be outside the vacuole (7.Luijendijk T.J.C. Stevens L.H. Verpoorte R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 419-425Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29.Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Upon cell damage, SGD will rapidly convert strictosidine into the aglucon, which was shown to have antimicrobial activity (8.Luijendijk T.J.C. van der Meijden E. Verpoorte R. J. Chem. Ecol. 1996; 22: 1355-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This proposed defense mechanism shows similarity to cyanogenesis occurring as a result of the damage-induced interaction between cyanogenic glucosides and their specific glucosidases (9.Jones D.A. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1998; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the cloning of the SGD cDNA and the functional expression of the encoded protein in yeast. We show thatSgd expression is induced by MeJA with kinetics similar to those of two other genes acting earlier in TIA biosynthesis. Finally, via an in vivo activity staining method, we present evidence that SGD is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A C. roseus cell suspension culture (cell line A12A2) was harvested 7 days after subculturing and used to purify SGD. This cell culture was grown in MS basal salt medium (10.Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) containing 100 mg/liter meso-inositol, 0.4 mg/liter thiamin, 2 mg/liter 1-naphthalene acetic acid, 0.2 mg/liter kinetin, and 30 g/liter sucrose. Purification of SGD was based on the purification scheme previously described (7.Luijendijk T.J.C. Stevens L.H. Verpoorte R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 419-425Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After protein extraction, a concentration step was performed on a Filtron concentrator containing a 30-kDa filter, followed by size-exclusion column chromatography (Sephacryl S-300). Instead of anion-exchange chromatography (AEC), a batch procedure with AEC material (Q-Sepharose) was used. The protein solution, in 50 mm BisTris (pH 6.3; Sigma), was incubated with the AEC material for 1 h at 4 °C. The AEC material was then washed with 0.1 m NaCl in 50 mm BisTris (pH 6.3) on a glass filter. The bound protein was eluted from the AEC material with 0.4 m NaCl in the same buffer. This fraction contained all the SGD activity and was used for the subsequent purification steps. After ultracentrifugation (2 h at 100,000 ×g), the pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of 50 mmBisTris (pH 6.3) and further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an increasing NaCl concentration (from 0 to 1m NaCl in 50 mm BisTris (pH 6.3)). The fractions containing SGD activity were pooled. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (11.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using precast gels (12.5% SDS and 4–15% native polyacrylamide) on a PhastSystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total visualization of proteins was carried out by silver staining (12.Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Davis L.G. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 315-317Crossref Google Scholar). SGD was visualized on a native gel by incubation in 2 mm strictosidine solution in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) (13.Luijendijk T.J.C. Stevens L.H. Verpoorte R. Phytochem. Anal. 1996; 7: 16-19Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Glycosylation of SGD was determined with purified enzyme using the GlycotrackTM carbohydrate detection kit from Oxford Glycosystems. Strictosidine was prepared enzymatically using immobilized strictosidine synthase (14.Pfitzner U. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1982; 46: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Quantitative SGD activity measurements were performed by HPLC (15.Stevens L.H. Schripsema J. Pennings E.J.M. Verpoorte R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 675-681Google Scholar). Qualitative SGD activity was determined by spotting 1 μl of protein solution on nitrocellulose. The protein bound to the nitrocellulose was then incubated at room temperature in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) containing 2 mm strictosidine until a yellow spot became visible. This staining procedure is based on the visualization method previously described (13.Luijendijk T.J.C. Stevens L.H. Verpoorte R. Phytochem. Anal. 1996; 7: 16-19Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Nonspecific β-glucosidase activity was measured by incubating the protein samples at 30 °C with the substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (2 mm in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3)). After stopping the incubation with 1 m Na2CO3 (1:1), the absorption was measured at 400 nm. The activity was calculated using a molar absorptivity of 10,300 liter·mole−1·cm−1 after correction for a blank assay. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used as a plasmid host. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH500 (16.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for expression ofSgd. The cDNA coding for SGD was inserted in theBamHI and KpnI sites of the shuttle vector pYPGE15 (17.Brunelli J.P. Pall M.L. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This recombinant plasmid containing the geneURA3 was transformed into yeast and selected on minimal synthetic dextrose medium without amino acids (nitrogen base, Difco) supplemented with 20 mg/liter Ade, 20 mg/liter His, 30 mg/liter Leu, 30 mg/liter Lys, and 20 mg/liter Trp. A control yeast culture contained the vector pYPGE15 without an insert. Total RNA was isolated from two C. roseus cell suspension cultures elicited at 1 and 4 h with 0.05% yeast extract (Difco). The total RNA extracted from both cultures was mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using a Promega kit. The cDNA was synthesized and inserted in λ-ZAP using the ZAP-cDNATM kit from Stratagene. Based on highly conserved regions (VT(L/I)FHWD and KG(Y/F)(Y/F)AWS) of plant β-glucosidases (18.Hughes M.A. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1992; 533: 151-169Google Scholar), two degenerate PCR primers were designed (GTNACNHTITTYCAYTGGGA and GACCANGCRWARWAICCYTT). One-hundred ng of λ-ZAP DNA containingC. roseus cDNA was used as a template. PCR cycles were carried out for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 35 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C in a Hybaid thermal reactor. PCRs were carried out with Taq DNA polymerase from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The PCR with primers T3 (AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG) and SgsecI (TTCGATCACTCAAGAAGCC) was done under the same conditions as described above, but with an annealing temperature of 50 °C instead of 35 °C. Approximately 500,000 cDNA-containing phages were screened on nylon filters (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a 32P-radiolabeled probe based on a PCR product obtained with degenerate primers. A total of seven positive phages were isolated and converted to plasmids. Sequence analysis showed that all seven clones were identical, except for their length, and the longest clone was selected for further studies. Since this clone was not full-length, a second PCR was performed using primers T3 and SgsecI. This PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme SacII and inserted in pBluescript II SK+. This 313-bp insert was found to be identical to the 5′-end of the previously isolated cDNA clone, except for an additional 72-bp part at the 5′-end containing a start codon. Using the restriction enzyme SacII, the 5′-part was inserted in front of the cDNA clone, making it full-length. The predicted amino acid sequence of SGD was analyzed using several computer programs available on the Internet. Homology to other amino acid sequences from the NCBI Protein Database was checked with the BLAST program (19.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). The PSORT program (20.Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the amino acid sequence for putative protein localization signals. Secondary structure prediction of the amino acid sequence was analyzed by the SAPS program (21.Brandel V. Bucher P. Nourbakhsh I. Blaisdell B.E. Karlin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was done using the T7 DNA sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech using primers T3 and T7. The complete cDNA coding for SGD was sequenced on both strands by making subclones in pBluescript II SK+ with different restriction enzymes. DNA isolated fromC. roseus was digested overnight with the restriction enzymes BglI, EcoRI, and EcoRV. Root, stem, flower, and leaf tissues from three mature C. roseusplants were pooled, and RNA was isolated. Three-day-old C. roseus cell suspensions (MP183L) were treated for different lengths of time with 50 μm MeJA (Bedoukian Research, Danbury, CT) diluted in Me2SO. Total RNA was isolated from tissue ground in liquid nitrogen by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation with LiCl at a final concentration of 2 m. The Rps9 probe has been described previously (3.Menke F.L.H. Parchmann S. Mueller M.J. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 119: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Southern and Northern blot analyses were performed as described (22.Memelink J. Swords K.M.M. Staehelin L.A. Hoge J.H.C. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: F1-F23Crossref Google Scholar) at high stringency with the following modifications. Northern blots contain 10 μg of total RNA/lane, and Southern blots 10 μg of digested DNA/lane. Prehybridization was done for 4 h in 1 mNaCl, 10% dextran sulfate (sodium salt, Sigma), 1% SDS, and 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C. After overnight hybridization, blots were washed three times at 65 °C using 0.5× SSPE (saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA) and 0.5% SDS. Finally, the blots were washed once with 0.1× SSPE and exposed at −80 °C to Fuji RX films mounted on Kyokko intensifying screens or to phosphor screens. Expression levels were quantitated using ImageQuant software. For subcellular localization studies of SGD, the C. roseus cell line A11 was used (23.Contin A. van der Heijden R. Lefeber A.W.M. Verpoorte R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in medium containing 0.1 g/liter B5 salts, 0.1 g/litermeso-inositol, 10 mg/liter thiamin, 1 mg/liter pyridoxine, 1 mg/liter niacin, 1.86 mg/liter NAA, and 20 g/liter sucrose at 25 °C and 2800 lux on a gyratory shaker (120 rpm). Protoplasts and vacuoles were prepared as described (24.Renaudin J.P. Brown H. Barbier-Brygoo H. Guern J. Physiol. Plant. 1986; 68: 695-703Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The marker enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (cytosol), cytochrome-c oxidase (mitochondria), NADPH-dependent cytochrome-creductase (ER), and catalase (peroxisomes) were measured as described previously (24.Renaudin J.P. Brown H. Barbier-Brygoo H. Guern J. Physiol. Plant. 1986; 68: 695-703Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The marker enzyme for the vacuole (α-mannosidase) was determined as reported (25.Boller T. Kende H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1979; 63: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative activity was calculated using the ratios between the activities of α-mannosidase (Man) and any other enzyme activity (X) in the vacuolar (vac) and protoplast (prot) preparations (relative activity of X= ((Man, prot × X, vac)/(Man, vac ×X, prot)) × 100%). Peroxisomes were isolated using a sucrose gradient (26.Holtman W.L. Heistek J.C. Mattern K.A. Bakhuizen R. Douma A. Plant Sci. (Shannon). 1994; 99: 43-53Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Data presented are mean values of three independent experiments. In vivo SGD activity staining was performed using cells and protoplasts of C. roseus and cells of Tabernaemontana divaricata, Cinchona officinalis, and Nicotiana tabacum. Cells, mounted on a microscope slide, were incubated with 2 mm strictosidine (with or without 100 mmd-gluconic acid δ-lactone) and visualized under a Nikon Diaphot-TMD-EF inverted using white light and blue light excitation. This was achieved with a B2 filter system, consisting of a DM 510 dichroic mirror block, a 450–490-nm excitation filter, and a barrier filter of 520 nm. For electron microscopy, the sample was prepared by incubating cells ofC. roseus with strictosidine (2 mm final concentration) for 20 min, followed by fixation in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). After fixation, the cells were embedded by spinning in 2% low melting point agar. Sections of 70 nm were prepared with a Reichert Ultracut microtome and stained with lead and uranyl. The sections were examined with a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope, and pictures were taken on a Fine Grain Positive film (Eastman Kodak Co.). A total of 192 μg of SGD was purified from 850 g of C. roseuscultured cells, following in part a previously reported method (7.Luijendijk T.J.C. Stevens L.H. Verpoorte R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 419-425Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using SGD activity staining on nitrocellulose, the SGD-containing fractions obtained after the chromatography steps were identified within 15 min, allowing purification within 1 day. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with SGD activity staining of crude protein extract showed that most of the activity was present in the stacking gel (Fig.1 C), suggesting that SGD is membrane-associated. After protein purification on native polyacrylamide gel, three different protein bands (∼250, 500, and 630 kDa) were observed (Fig. 1 B), all three of which contained SGD activity. Under denaturing conditions, only one protein band of 63 kDa was observed (Fig. 1 A), indicating that the purified SGD preparation consisted of aggregates of 4, 8, or 12 monomers. These different SGD aggregate isoforms were formed only during the last purification step (fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-Q column). Probably the high salt strength on this column partly disrupted SGD from the membranes, resulting in smaller SGD isoforms. Like many other β-glucosidases, SGD was found to be glycosylated (data not shown). Whether glycosylation is important for activity is unknown. Using the purified protein, antibodies were raised against SGD. Although these antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate SGD, they were not very specific (data not shown). Attempts to obtain internal amino acid sequences of SGD were not successful due to poor cleavage of the protein by chemical reagents or proteinases. For cDNA cloning ofSgd, another strategy was followed. Alignment of several amino acid sequences of plant β-glucosidases (18.Hughes M.A. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1992; 533: 151-169Google Scholar) identified two highly conserved regions (VT(L/I)FHWD and KG(Y/F)(Y/F)AWS). Degenerate PCR primers based on these conserved regions gave a PCR product of the expected size of 1 kilobase. With this PCR product as a probe, aC. roseus cDNA library was screened. This procedure led to a complete cDNA clone of 1875 bp encoding a protein with high homology to β-glucosidases (Fig. 2). Since an in-frame stop codon is present upstream of the start codon, this cDNA clone is full-length, which was confirmed by the estimated mRNA size of ∼1900 bp. To determine whether the clone encoded SGD, the cDNA clone was expressed in S. cerevisiae. This yeast culture was found to have a high SGD activity (2.52 ± 0.05 millikatals/g fresh weight), whereas a control culture did not have any SGD activity. Therefore, this cDNA encodes SGD since, in C. roseus, no other glucosidases have been found that can accept strictosidine as a substrate (6.Stevens L.H. Formation and Conversion of Strictosidine in the Biosynthesis of Monoterpenoid Indole and Quinoline Alkaloids..in: Ph.D. Thesis. Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands1994Google Scholar, 27.Hemscheidt T. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The introduction and expression of Sgd did not affect the nonspecific glucosidase activity of the yeast strain. This is explained by the fact that SGD does not acceptp-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, a nonspecific substrate for certain β-glucosidases (27.Hemscheidt T. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SGD expressed in yeast behaved in a way similar to that of the native plant enzyme. The product of strictosidine hydrolysis catalyzed by SGD expressed in yeast was cathenamine as determined by HPLC with diode array detection. As in C. roseus, SGD formed large complexes in S. cerevisiae, as visualized on activity-stained native polyacrylamide gel. On this native polyacrylamide gel of crude protein extract, part of the activity was found to be present in the stacking gel, and part was found to be present in a high molecular mass complex (Fig. 1 D). Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of SGD, the highest homology was found with plant β-glucosidases (60% with prunasin hydrolase and amygdalin hydrolase from Prunus serotina and cyanogenic β-glucosidase from Trifolium repens). SGD has a predicted molecular mass of 63.0 kDa. This theoretical mass corresponds well to the estimated mass of SGD as found after protein purification, indicating that the degree of glycosylation must be low. Furthermore, computer analysis predicted a possible subcellular localization in the ER. Southern blotting was performed to estimate the gene copy number ofSgd (Fig. 3). The presence of one (BglI), two (EcoRI), and three (EcoRV) bands visible on this blot can be explained since the Sgd coding sequence contains zero, one, and two recognition sites for BglI, EcoRI, andEcoRV, respectively. EcoRV digestion yielded a band of ∼1200 bp, which is similar to what would be expected based on the nucleotide sequence of Sgd. These results demonstrate that SGD is most likely encoded by a single-copy gene. The Sgd gene expression in different parts of the plant is shown in Fig. 4. The highestSgd expression was found in the leaf, followed by the root (76% compared with the leaf), the stem (34%), and the flower (3%). The mRNA expression is in accordance with the SGD enzyme activity measured in the same samples from the different tissues (leaf, 360 ± 24 picokatals/mg of protein; root, 221 ± 30 picokatals/mg; stem, 164 ± 22 picokatals/mg; and flower, 62 ± 8 picokatals/mg). The plant stress signaling hormone MeJA coordinately induces the expression of the Tdc and Str genes (3.Menke F.L.H. Parchmann S. Mueller M.J. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 119: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and leads to increased TIA production in cell suspension culture (4.Gantet P. Imbault N. Thiersault M. Doireau P. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 220-225Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and seedlings (5.Aerts R.J. Gisi D. De Carolis E. De Luca V. Baumann T.W. Plant J. 1994; 5: 635-643Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Consequently, we studied the jasmonate responsiveness ofSgd to see if this step of the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway is similarly regulated. The effect of the addition of 50 μm MeJA on the expression of Sgd is shown in Fig.5. MeJA transiently inducedSgd expression with maximum expression levels at 2–8 h and decreased mRNA level at 24 h. The kinetics of mRNA accumulation for Sgd were similar to those of Tdc andStr in the same RNA samples. The level of Rps9mRNA, encoding the 40 S ribosomal protein S9, was not affected by the addition of MeJA, indicating that gene expression in general was not affected. Thus, the results presented here demonstrate thatSgd expression is induced by MeJA with kinetics similar to those of two other genes acting prior to Sgd in TIA biosynthesis. Strictosidine synthase is a vacuolar protein (2.McKnight T.D. Bergey D.R. Burnett R.J. Nessler C.L. Planta (Heidelb.). 1991; 185: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), indicating that strictosidine is synthesized inside the vacuole. It has been suggested that SGD is localized outside the vacuole, loosely bound to the tonoplast (28.Stevens L.H. Blom T.J.M. Verpoorte R. Plant Cell Rep. 1993; 12: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of SGD shows a C-terminal KKXKX sequence. Jackson et al. (29.Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) showed that lysine residues at the C terminus may act as a retention signal for type I transmembrane ER proteins. Moreover, two internal sequences (SKL and SRL) were found in the amino acid sequence of SGD that may direct proteins to the peroxisomes. Although these sequences normally are present at the C terminus, they can also be found as internal sequences (30.Olsen J.L. Harada J.J. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 123-146Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To experimentally test the functional significance of the predicted signal sequences, subcellular localization studies were performed with a C. roseus cell line. First, vacuoles were isolated to test the hypothesis that SGD is bound to the tonoplast. Table I shows the relative activities of different marker proteins and SGD found in the vacuolar preparation. α-Mannosidase was used as a vacuolar marker. Some SGD activity was found in the vacuolar preparations, although it was only 12% of the SGD activity present in the protoplasts. No contamination with cytosolic, mitochondrial, or ER marker enzymes could be found in the vacuoles. However, catalase (peroxisomal marker) was found in the vacuolar preparations. The presence of SGD in the vacuolar preparations might be due to contamination by other organelles and in particular by peroxisomes. Peroxisomes were therefore isolated using a sucrose gradient that resulted in two protein peaks at 53% (fraction I) and 47% (fraction II) sucrose. The activities of the marker enzymes for peroxisomes, mitochondria, and ER and the SGD activities of these two protein peaks are given in Table II. Other protein peaks at lower sucrose densities did not contain any concentrated marker enzyme activities. Fractions I and II had protein characteristics of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the ER. Based on the ratios of the occurrence in these fractions, it is obvious that the peroxisomes are more concentrated in fraction I. As SGD is more abundant in fraction II, it is conclu"

Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed evidence for two such mechanisms: (i) Enhanced neural responses, primarily in the frontal cortex, were associated with the target and were maintained across repetitions of the target. (ii) Reduced responses, primarily in the extrastriate visual cortex, were associated with stimulus repetition, regardless of whether the stimulus was a target or a distracter. These complementary neural mechanisms track the status of familiar items in working memory, allowing for the efficient recognition of a currently relevant object and rejection of irrelevant distracters."
https://openalex.org/W2001087258,"Microbial pathogens frequently take advantage of host systems for their pathogenesis. Shedding of cell surface molecules as soluble extracellular domains (ectodomains) is one of the host responses activated during tissue injury. In this study, we examined whether pathogenic bacteria can modulate shedding of syndecan-1, the predominant syndecan of host epithelia. Our studies found that overnight culture supernatants of Pseudomonas aeruginosaand Staphylococcus aureus enhanced the shedding of syndecan-1 ectodomains, whereas culture supernatants of several other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria had only low levels of activity. Because supernatants from all tested strains of P. aeruginosa (n = 9) enhanced syndecan-1 shedding by more than 4-fold above control levels, we focused our attention on this Gram-negative bacterium. Culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa increased shedding of syndecan-1 in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and augmented shedding by various host cells. A 20-kDa shedding enhancer was partially purified from the supernatant through ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel chromatography, and identified by N-terminal sequencing as LasA, a known P. aeruginosa virulence factor. LasA was subsequently determined to be a syndecan-1 shedding enhancer from the findings that (i) immunodepletion of LasA from the partially purified sample resulted in abrogation of its activity to enhance shedding and (ii) purified LasA increased shedding in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results also indicated that LasA enhances syndecan-1 shedding by activation of the host cell's shedding mechanism and not by direct interaction with syndecan-1 ectodomains. Enhanced syndecan-1 shedding may be a means by which pathogenic bacteria take advantage of a host mechanism to promote their pathogenesis.

Because protein kinase C agonists (phorbol ester) and peptide hydroxamates have been found to enhance and inhibit the shedding of most affected molecules, respectively, existence of a common shedding system has been proposed (3.Arribas J.

However, shedding of some effectors is insensitive or only partially sensitive to hydroxamates (13.Jones S.A. Novick D. Horiuchi S. Yamamoto N. Szalai A.J. Fuller G.M. J. Exp.

The genetic variability that pathogenic microorganisms can generate have allowed variant pathogens to take advantage of the host environment for their growth and survival. For example, a diverse group of pathogens including Yersinia spp. (19.Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), Bordetella pertussis (20.Relman D. Tuomanen E. Falkow S. Golenbock D.T. Saukkonen K. Wright S.D.

Tran Van Nhieu G. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Bacteria also produce molecules that can derange host homeostasis to their benefit. Several bacteria secrete toxins that can modify the host cell cytoskeleton (24.Finlay B.B. Cossart P. Science. 1997; 276: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) and secrete enzymes that can degrade extracellular matrix components, immunoglobulins and complement, either directly (25.Suter S.

Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 405-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or indirectly by activating the matrix metalloproteinases in the host (27.Okamoto T. Akaike T. Suga M.

Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria, the causative agent of endotoxic shock, affects the expression of host defense effectors such as TNF-α and IL-1, -6, -8, and -10 (28.Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Zähringer U. Seydel U. Di Padova F. Schreier M. Brade H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that bacterial pathogens may also utilize the host cell's shedding mechanism to enhance their virulence. For instance, the pore-forming toxins, streptolysin O and Escherichia coli hemolysin, trigger shedding of lipopolysaccharide (CD14) and IL-6 receptors (29.Walev I. Vollmer P. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Rose-John S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7882-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Listeria monocytogenes can also augment shedding of the IL-6 receptor (30.Vollmer P. Walev I. Rose-John S. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3646-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and culture supernatants fromS. epidermidis can activate shedding of TNF-α (31.Mattson E. Van Dijk H. Verhoef J. Norrby R. Rollof J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4351-4355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the responsible shedding enhancers were not defined in these studies. Furthermore, increased serum levels of soluble ectodomains of several surface effectors, such as CD14, TNF-α, and IL-4 receptors, have been documented during infection (32.Blum H. Wolf M. Enssle K. Rollinghoff M. Gessner A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1846-1853PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hayashi J. Masaka T. Ishikawa I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 417-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Munk M.E. Anding P. Schettini A.P.M. Cunha M.G.S. Kaufman S.H.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 423-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that bacteria-enhanced shedding can modulate the activation and function of host effectors, and play a role in bacterial pathogenesis. The syndecans are a family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans which, along with the glypicans, are the major source of cell surface heparan sulfate (35.Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). There are currently four mammalian syndecans known, syndecan-1 through -4, each encoded by distinct genes. Syndecans can bind and modulate the activity of a diverse group of soluble and insoluble ligands, such as extracellular matrix components, growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, and proteases, through the action of their heparan sulfate chains. Syndecans have also been proposed to act as adhesion and internalization receptors for pathogenic microorganisms (36.Grassmé H. Gulbins E. Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Lang F. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1997; 91: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 37.Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of syndecans can be shed as soluble, intact heparan sulfate proteoglycan ectodomains which, because they bind the same ligands as their precursor proteoglycans on the cell surface, can serve as soluble effectors. For example, shed syndecan-1 ectodomains have been found to regulate the proliferative response of cells to FGF-2 (38.Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and potentiate the activity of neutrophil enzymes, such as elastase and cathepsin G (39.Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), by binding to the enzymes and protecting them from inhibition by their physiological inhibitors. All syndecans are shed constitutively as part of normal syndecan turnover, but available evidence also indicates that syndecan shedding is a regulated host response to tissue injury and that shed syndecan ectodomains are regulators of inflammation (15.Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of syndecan shedding by pathogenic bacteria may play a role in pathogenesis through alteration of the host response to infection and/or the pathogen's ability to colonize host tissue components. We have studied whether pathogenic bacteria can modulate syndecan shedding and have found that culture supernatants from S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, but not from several other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, enhance shedding of syndecan-1 by host cells. Here we report the characterization of syndecan-1 shedding enhanced by P. aeruginosa. Syndecan-1 shedding augmented by overnight culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa is rapid, is seen with various types of host cells, and produces intact, soluble syndecan-1 ectodomains. A P. aeruginosa shedding enhancer has been purified from a clinical isolate and identified as the mature 20-kDa LasA protein, a known virulence factor of P. aeruginosa (40.Preston M.J. Seed P.C. Toder D.S. Iglewski B.H. Ohman D.E. Gustin J.K. Goldberg J.B. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Woods D.E. Cryz S.J. Friedman R.L. Iglewski B.H. Infect.

LasA-enhanced shedding produces syndecan-1 ectodomain core proteins identical in size to ectodomains shed endogenously, and is inhibited by inhibitors of the host cell's shedding mechanism. These results indicate that LasA enhances syndecan-1 shedding by activating the host cell's shedding machinery. Enhancement of syndecan-1 shedding by LasA may be a mechanism by which P. aeruginosa parasitizes a host system to aid their pathogenesis.

Frozen glycerol stocks of bacteria were grown overnight to stationary growth phase in tryptic soy broth at 37 °C with agitation. The rat monoclonal anti-mouse syndecan-1 ectodomain antibody (281-2) was generated in the our laboratory (45.Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and is now commercially available from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The purified LasA protein used for antisera production was prepared previously (40.Preston M.J. Seed P.C. Toder D.S. Iglewski B.H. Ohman D.E. Gustin J.K. Goldberg J.B. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LasA was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80%), DEAE ion exchange chromatography and further fractionation with a sulfopropyl column. C3H/Hen mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were immunized subcutaneously with 10 μg of purified LasA emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Mice were given a second injection of 5 μg of LasA emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 2 weeks later. Two weeks after the second immunization, mice were bled via the dorsolateral tail vein and sera prepared. Non-immune sera were prepared by immunizing mice with complete Freund's adjuvant followed 2 weeks later with incomplete Freund's adjuvant as described above. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibodies were obtained from either Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA) or Cappel (Durham, NC). Quantification of syndecan-1 shedding was performed as described previously (15.Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent or 1-day post-confluent cultures of NMuMG and C127 cells in 96-well plates and LA-4 and NIH3T3 cells in 24-well plates were washed once with their respective culture media, and various test samples diluted in culture media were added to the cells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with the samples for 6 h or for the indicated times as described in the figure legends. Cell viability was measured with the tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) conversion assay (46.Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). For quantification of shedding, the culture supernatants were collected, spun down to remove cells, and the cell-free supernatants were applied to Immobilon N membranes using a dot immunoblotting apparatus. The samples were acidified by adding NaOAc (pH 4.5), NaCl, and Tween 20 to final concentrations of 50 mm, 150 mm, and 0.1% (v/v), respectively. By acidifying the samples, only highly anionic molecules such as proteoglycans are retained by the cationic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon N) while most proteins pass through the membrane during dot blotting. To obtain measurements within the linear range of the dot immunoblotting method, 70 μl out of 100 μl in each well of 96-well plates were applied for NMuMG and C127 cells, and 200 μl out of 500 μl in each well of 24-well plates were applied for LA-4 and NIH3T3 cells. For quantification of cell surface syndecan-1, following removal of media with or without test samples, cells were washed once with ice-cold TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl) containing 0.5 mm EDTA and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with ice-cold 10 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin in TBS with 0.5 mm EDTA. Trypsin was subsequently inactivated with 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and the reaction mixture was spun down to remove detached cells. For NMuMG cells, 15 μl out of 100 μl of trypsinate were blotted onto Immobilon N membranes as described above to obtain measurements in the linear range of the dot immunoblotting method. The blotted membranes were developed by sequential incubations at 4 °C with (i) 10% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in TBS for 2 h or longer (blocking), (ii) 0.2 μg/ml of anti-syndecan-1 antibody (281–2) in BLOTTO (TBS containing 0.5% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20) for 14–24 h, (iii) BLOTTO for 30 min × 2 (wash), (iv) 1:8,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibodies in BLOTTO for 14–24 h, (v) TBS for 30 min × 2 (wash), and (vi) the ECL development reagent. The developed blots were scanned and quantified using the public domain NIH Image (V. 1.60) software. Overnight culture supernatant (1 liter) ofP. aeruginosa, strain BL2, was mixed overnight at 4 °C with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, dissolved in 60 ml of de-ionized H2O, and dialyzed twice against 4 liters of de-ionized H2O. The dialysate was freeze-dried, resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl), and 5 ml of this sample were applied to a 1 × 115-cm Bio-Gel P-30 column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The applied material was fractionated at a flow rate of 4.5 ml/h with buffer A and 24 1-h fractions were collected. Aliquots (300 μl) of each fraction were Speed-vac dried, resuspended in 600 μl of NMuMG culture media, filter sterilized, and tested for their ability to modulate syndecan-1 shedding from NMuMG cells. For gel analysis, fractions were dialyzed against de-ionized water, Speed-vac dried, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and fractionated by 12% reducing SDS-PAGE. Carbohydrate moieties within the Fc region of anti-LasA IgGs were oxidized and reacted with hydrazide groups in the Affi-Prep coupling resin to form covalent hydrazone bonds. This coupling method was employed to orient the antigen-binding sites outwards from the resin to achieve higher antigen binding capacities. Mouse polyclonal anti-LasA IgGs were purified from sera by protein G affinity chromatography and dialyzed into oxidation buffer (0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.5, 1 m NaCl). Anti-LasA IgGs (2 mg) in 5 ml of oxidation buffer were oxidized by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with 500 μl of 180 mg/ml NaIO4 in de-ionized H2O. The oxidized antibody was first dialyzed into H2O, then into coupling buffer (0.1 m NaOAc, pH 4.5, 1 m NaCl) and incubated overnight with 2 ml of Affi-Prep Hydrazide gel slurry at 4 °C. The coupled affinity resin was transferred to a polypropylene column and the active fractions from gel chromatography, resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl), were applied. The samples were re-cycled overnight at a flow rate of 5 ml/h through the affinity resin at 4 °C. The flow-through fraction was collected and the column was washed with binding buffer. The specifically bound materials were eluted with 0.1 mglycine (pH 2.8), neutralized with 1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), dialyzed into autoclaved de-ionized H2O, and concentrated by lyophilization. The concentration of purified LasA was determined by UV spectrophotometry based on the number of tyrosine and tryptophan residues in LasA (1 A 280 = 0.41 mg/ml). This preparation of purified LasA, generated through ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel chromatography, and immunoaffinity chromatography, was used in the shedding assays. Conditioned media from unstimulated NMuMG cells (contains constitutively shed syndecan-1 ectodomains), and from NMuMG cells stimulated for 14 h with crude P. aeruginosasupernatant (20%, v/v) or purified LasA (5 μg/ml) were collected, and NaOAc (pH 4.5) and NaCl were added to final concentrations of 100 and 300 mm, respectively. The acidified conditioned media were incubated with DEAE-Sephacel for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were applied to disposable polypropylene columns, washed with 100 mm NaOAc (pH 4.5), 300 mm NaCl buffer and bound materials were eluted with 2 m NaCl. The eluates were dialyzed extensively against de-ionized H2O, concentrated by lyophilization, and the amount of partially purified syndecan-1 ectodomain in the samples was estimated by dot immunoblotting. Samples containing 30 ng of syndecan-1 were resuspended in digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaOAc, 5 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and digested with 10 milliunits/ml heparitinase and 20 milliunits/ml chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase for 3 h at 37 °C with fresh enzymes added after 1.5 h. These digested samples and undigested samples containing 30 ng of syndecan-1 were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 3.5–10% gradient acrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon N (undigested) or nitrocellulose (digested) membranes, probed with monoclonal rat anti-mouse syndecan-1 antibodies (281-2), and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgGs, and developed by the ECL detection method as described above. Overnight culture supernatants from several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were screened for their ability to alter shedding of syndecan-1 ectodomains by NMuMG cells. NMuMG cells were chosen initially since they express syndecan-1 abundantly (43.Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and because the epithelium is the target cell type of many bacterial pathogens (47.Kagnoff M.F. Eckmann L. J. Clin.

Overnight culture supernatants of bacteria were filter sterilized, diluted to 20% (v/v) with NMuMG culture media, and incubated with NMuMG cells for 14 h at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 1, culture supernatants from all tested P. aeruginosa (7/7 clinical, 2/2 laboratory) and the majority of S. aureus (3/5 clinical, 3/4 laboratory) strains enhanced shedding of syndecan-1 by more than 4-fold over control levels, whereas strains from several other Gram-negative (S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, and K. pneumoniae) and Gram-positive (S. saprophyticus, S. xylosus, and S. pneumoniae) bacteria d"

In this study we investigated (i) the cis-acting response elements and transcription factors active at the COX-2 promoter and (ii) the signal transduction pathways mediating COX-2 induction following aggregation of mast cell IgE receptors. Transient transfection assays with COX-2 promoter/luciferase constructs suggest that a consensus cyclic AMP response element is essential for induced COX-2 expression. Cotransfection studies with plasmids expressing c-Jun, dominant negative Ras, dominant negative c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and dominant negative MEKK1 demonstrate that activation of the Ras/MEKK1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/c-Jun pathway is required for COX-2 promoter-mediated luciferase expression. Attenuation of COX-2 promoter activity by dominant negative constructs for Raf-1, ERK1, and ERK2 suggests that the Ras/Raf-1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway is also necessary for COX-2 induction. Although mutating the two NF-IL6 sites individually did not affect COX-2 promoter activity, mutating both NF-IL6 sites substantially inhibits COX-2 promoter activity. Moreover, overexpression of wild type CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) augments COX-2 promoter activity in activated mast cells and cotransfection of a dominant negative C/EBPβ construct completely blocks COX-2 promoter/luciferase expression. Our data suggest that in activated mast cells, a Ras/MEKK1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signal transduction pathway activating c-Jun, a Ras/Raf-1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, and activated C/EBPβ facilitate COX-2 induction via the cyclic AMP response element and NF-IL6 sites of the COX-2 promoter.

Altered prostanoid production is associated with a variety of illnesses, including acute and chronic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, colon cancer and allergic diseases (1.DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 2.Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase (COX),1 also known as prostaglandin synthase, is the key enzyme in prostaglandin, prostacyclin, and thromboxane synthesis from arachidonic acid (1.DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). COX converts arachidonic acid, released from membrane phospholipid stores by phospholipases, to prostaglandin H2, the common precursor of all prostanoids. Two COX isoforms have been described (3.Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in nearly all cells. The second COX isoform, COX-2, is induced by a wide range of ligands in many distinct cell types (4.Kujubu D.A. Reddy S.T. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Several consensus sequences, including those for NF-κB, NF-IL6, ATF/CRE, and an E-box found in the 5′ region of the COX-2 gene, have been identified as regulatory sequences involved in COX-2 induction in response to a variety of stimuli in different species and cell types (7.Inoue H.

In murine fibroblasts, the cyclic AMP response element, or CRE, located between nucleotides −56 and −52 of the murine COX-2 gene is necessary for the induction of COX-2 transcription mediated byv-src, serum, and PDGF (9.Xie W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). COX-2 induction via the CRE by v-src, serum, and PDGF in these fibroblast cells is mediated through both the Ras/MEKK1/JNK/c-Jun- and Ras/Raf-1/MAP kinase kinase/ERK- signaling pathways (9.Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Anderson R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

IL-1β induction of COX-2 expression in both NIH3T3 cells and primary rat renal mesangial cells involves the activation of both JNK/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathways (14.Guan Z.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and the c-Jun transcription factor (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

The C/EBP family of transcription factors plays an important role in COX-2 induction by lipopolysaccharide and phorbol ester in human vascular endothelial cells (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), by tumor necrosis factor-α in murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells (10.Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and in mouse skin carcinoma cells (11.Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Transcription factor NF-κB has been reported to mediate COX-2 induction by lipopolysaccharide in differentiated U937 monocytic cells (15.Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and by tumor necrosis factor-α in the MC3T3-E1 cell line (10.Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptional mechanisms of COX-2 induction seem to be agonist- and cell type-specific and appear to involve context-specific interactions among several cis-acting regulatory elements, transcription factors, and signal transduction pathways. Mast cells, distributed throughout vascularized epithelial tissue, play a critical role both in immune responses and in allergic disease. Mast cells, activated either by aggregation of their high affinity IgE receptors or by other effectors, release stored inflammatory mediators such as histamine and serotonin. Aggregation of mast cell IgE receptors also mediates the induced synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes and prostaglandin D2(PGD2) (16.Roberts L.J. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. Oates J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Unlike nearly all other cell types, prostaglandin production in activated mast cells occurs in two distinct phases, an immediate, activation-induced PGD2 release completed within 10–15 min, and a delayed phase of PGD2synthesis and secretion that peaks at 4–6 h after activation (6.Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 818-825PubMed Google Scholar). The immediate phase of PGD2 synthesis in activated mast cells is due to conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin by preexisting COX-1. In contrast, the delayed phase of PGD2synthesis and secretion following IgE receptor aggregation requires activation-induced transcription of COX-2 mRNA and production of functional protein (6.Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 818-825PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Murakami M. Bingham C.O. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4445-4453PubMed Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways, transcription factors, and COX-2 promoter elements participating in stimulus-induced COX-2 expression have not been described for mast cells. In this report, we identify the cis-acting elements of the COX-2 promoter, the transcription factors, and the signal transduction pathways necessary for COX-2 induction in activated MMC-34 murine mast cells. A wild type COX-2 promoter fragment from −724 to +7 was PCR-amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using the murine COX-2 reporter plasmid pT10L (9.Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Anderson R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) as template. Mutant COX-2 promoter fragments were constructed in a two-stage PCR procedure. 2Wadleigh, D. J., Reddy, S. T., Kopp, S., Ghosh, S., and Herschman, H. R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in press. Mutant constructs were made using PCR-amplified promoter fragments from pT10L, which were then cut with HindIII and XhoI, polyacrylamide gel-purified, and cloned into the HindIII andXhoI sites of the luciferase reporter plasmid pXP2.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), an expression vector dominant negative Ha-Ras was the gift of Geoffrey Cooper (Harvard). Murine MMC-34 mast cells were cultured as described previously (6.Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 818-825PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol for suspension cells, with slight modifications. MMC-34 mast cells were plated in 3 ml of regular medium at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Ten μg of plasmid DNA was prepared in 150 μl of serum-free, antibiotic-free medium and incubated with 30 μl of Superfect reagent prepared separately in 150 μl of serum-free, antibiotic-free medium. After 15 min, the DNA superfect complexes were added to cells and incubated for 2 h. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in medium supplemented with 0.5% serum, plated into 6-well dishes (one 6-well dish/10-cm dish), and incubated over night at 37 °C. In cotransfection experiments, appropriate empty vector DNA was used to ensure similar DNA concentrations in all conditions. In all transfections, 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) was included to control for transfection efficiency. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. The day after transfection (approximately 18 h), MMC-34 mast cells were activated as described previously (6.Kawata R. Reddy S.T. Wolner B. Herschman H.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 818-825PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MMC-34 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml mouse IgE (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) for 1 h, washed, and further treated with 1 μg/ml anti-IgE (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) for 4 h control cells received only medium after IgE treatment. After incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in passive lysis buffer provided in the dual luciferase kit (Promega), and assayed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol, using a LUMAT LB9501 luminometer (Wallac inc., Gaithersberg, MD). In NIH3T3 cells, the CRE element located between nucleotides −56 and −52 of the COX-2 gene is necessary for both basal COX-2 transcription and for induction mediated byv-src, serum, and PDGF (9.Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Anderson R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For the NIH3T3 studies, COX-2 promoter constructs that contained either −80 nucleotides (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) or −371 nucleotides (13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) upstream of the transcription start site of COX-2 gene were used. The −80 construct containing the overlapping CRE and E-box elements was sufficient for COX-2 induction byv-src, and the −371 construct containing two additional NF-IL6 sites was sufficient for COX-2 induction by serum and PDGF. However, both of these promoter construct sets only had mutations in either the CRE or the E-box sites. More recently, several laboratories have reported regulation of COX-2 gene by NF-IL6 sites (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 10.Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and the NF-κB site (10.Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 15.Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To test the roles of the NF-IL6 and NF-κB sites as well as the E-box and CRE site in the regulation of the COX-2 gene in mast cells, we generated a new set of COX-2 promoter/luciferase constructs. The wild type promoter, [COX-2−724][Luc], includes 724 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site and extends to position +7 (Fig. 1). We utilized site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutant [COX-2−724][Luc] constructs with specific mutations in the CRE, E-box, each of the two NF-IL6 sites, and the NF-κB site in the COX-2 promoter. We also created an additional mutant COX-2 reporter in which both NF-IL6 sites were mutated (Fig. 1). MMC-34 murine mast cells were transfected with each of the COX-2 reporter mutants, and luciferase expression was examined 4 h after activation by aggregation of IgE receptors (Fig.2). Mutation of the CRE element of the COX-2 gene reduced luciferase expression by more than 90% in both control and activated MMC-34 mast cells. In contrast, mutations in either the E-box or NF-κB elements have no inhibitory effect on luciferase activity, either in control or in activated MMC-34 mast cells. Mutant constructs in which only one of the NF-IL6 sites was mutated did not differ from the wild type COX-2 expression vector in luciferase expression (Fig. 2 and data not shown). However, luciferase expression in a mutant construct in which both NF-IL6 sites were mutated was reduced substantially in activated MMC-34 cells. In contrast to the CRE mutation, the double NF-IL6 mutation did not cause a significant change for basal luciferase expression (Fig. 2). Our results suggest that the CRE site of the COX-2 regulatory region is essential for basal expression and for optimal induction of the COX-2 gene in activated MMC-34 mast cells. Although both NF-IL6 sites are not essential, regulation by this cis-acting region of the COX-2 promoter appears to also be important for COX-2 expression in activated mast cells. Signal transduction pathways stemming from Ras are necessary for COX-2 induction byv-src, serum, and PDGF in NIH3T3 cells (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Furthermore, aggregation of IgE receptors resulted in the activation of Ras and Ras effector pathways in mast cells (23.Turner H. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 181: 43-53Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, transcription factors like Elk-1, an immediate early gene regulator, and the nuclear factor for activated T-cells are identified as Ras targets in mast cells activated by cross-linking of IgE receptors (23.Turner H. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 181: 43-53Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We examined whether Ras activation is also required for COX-2 induction in activated MMC-34 mast cells. MMC-34 cells were cotransfected with two different concentrations of a dominant negative Ras (DN-Ras) construct, along with [COX-2−724][Luc]. DN-Ras completely inhibits the induction of [COX-2−724][Luc] in activated MMC-34 mast cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that Ras activation is required for COX-2 induction following IgE receptor aggregation on mast cells. Ras activates several signal transduction pathways. Each pathway leads to a coordinated phosphorylation of distinct subsets of transcription factors (24.Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, at least two distinct pathways stemming from Ras, MEKK1/JNK and Raf/MEK, are required for COX-2 induction (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We first examined whether the Ras-mediated MEKK1/JNK pathway is involved in COX-2 induction in activated mast cells. Expression of either kinase-defective dominant negative MEKK1 or kinase-defective dominant negative JNK1 blocks luciferase expression from the [COX-2−724][Luc] in activated MMC-34 cells (Fig.4). Like the MEKK1/JNK pathway, the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is necessary for COX-2 induction in NIH3T3 cells (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase pathway enzyme MEK and the ERKs are Raf-dependent targets of Ras activation following aggregation of IgE receptors in mast cells, and activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway results in the activation of transcription factors like Elk in activated mast cells (23.Turner H. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 181: 43-53Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway plays a role in COX-2 induction in activated MMC-34 mast cells. Kinase-defective, dominant negative expression plasmids for Raf-1, ERK1, and ERK2 were cotransfected into MMC-34 cells along with [COX-2−724][Luc]. All three dominant negative expression plasmids block COX-2 induction in activated MMC-34 cells (Fig. 5), suggesting that (i) the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway is also necessary for COX-2 induction in mast cells and (ii) the signaling transduction pathways mediating the induction of COX-2 promoter in activated mast cells are very similar to those identified in NIH3T3 cells in response to v-src, PDGF, and serum (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the COX-2 promoter identified the CRE site CGTCA, located at nucleotide −56 of the murine COX-2 gene, as essential for COX-2 expression in activated MMC-34 mast cells (Fig. 2). We have previously shown, using gel shift assays in NIH3T3 cells, that CREB can bind to the CRE element of the murine COX-2 promoter (9.Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Anderson R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To identify the transcription factors that might play a role at the CRE, we first tested whether the classic CRE binding transcription factor, CREB, can mediate COX-2 induction in activated mast cells. If CREB is involved in COX-2 induction, we would expect wild type CREB protein to augment the induction from the COX-2 promoter in activated mast cells. However, when MMC-34 mast cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for CREB, luciferase expression induced from the COX-2 promoter by IgE receptor aggregation was completely blocked (Fig. 6). We conclude that some transcription factor other than CREB is involved in COX-2 transcriptional regulation at the CRE site in activated mast cells. The c-Jun transcription factor can bind to the CRE site in the murine COX-2 gene (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). c-Jun mediates v-src, PDGF, and serum induction of COX-2 expression in NIH3T3 cells (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). c-Jun also mediates IL-1β induced COX-2 expression in rat mesangial cells (14.Guan Z. ShaAvhree Y Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Jun is also involved in the induction of COX-2 expression in activated mast cells, we transfected MMC-34 cells with the [COX-2−724][Luc] reporter and a c-Jun expression vector. Overexpression of c-Jun augments the induced COX-2 expression in activated MMC-34 mast cells by more than 7-fold (Fig.7). c-Jun overexpression is also able to activate the COX-2 promoter activity in unstimulated MMC-34 cells (Fig.7). Our data suggest that c-Jun plays a critical role in COX-2 gene expression in mast cells. Sirois and Richards (25.Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that C/EBPβ may play a role in luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone-mediated COX-2 induction in rat granulosa cells (25.Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cell line, tumor necrosis factor-α-induced expression of COX-2 was mediated by two positive regulatory regions (−186 to −131 and −512 to −385) of the COX-2 promoter. The first element included a putative NF-IL6 element (C/EBPβ), and the second has an NF-κB motif. Both of these elements were shown to be important in COX-2 regulation in MC3T3-E1 cells (10.Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The NF-IL6 and CRE sites are also involved in the transcriptional regulation of the human COX-2 gene by lipopolysaccharide and by phorbol ester in vascular endothelial cells (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). More recently, transcriptional regulation of the COX-2 gene in mouse skin carcinoma cells was shown to be mediated by the C/EBP family of proteins (11.Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). COX-2 expression was substantially inhibited in activated MMC-34 mast cells when both NF-IL6 sites were mutated (Fig.2). To directly test whether C/EBPβ plays a role in COX-2 induction in activated mast cells, we examined the effect of C/EBPβ overexpression on luciferase expression from the [COX-2−724][luc] reporter. Expression of C/EBPβ augmented COX-2 induction by more than 5-fold in activated MMC-34 cells (Fig. 7). Like c-Jun overexpression, C/EBPβ overexpression also augmented the basal transcription from the COX-2 promoter. We conclude from these experiments that C/EBP transcription factors play an important role in the induction of the COX-2 gene in activated mast cells. We next examined whether blocking C/EBPβ function has any effect on COX-2 gene expression in activated mast cells. The C/EBPβ mRNA encodes two different proteins from alternate translation start sites (26.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The active form of C/EBPβ, containing the transactivation domain, DNA binding domain, and protein-protein interaction domain was originally isolated as a “liver-activating protein,” or LAP (27.Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). A second C/EBP isoform without the transactivation domain was generated from a second translation start site. This C/EBP isoform was originally isolated as a “liver inhibitory protein” or LIP (26.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). LIP inhibits C/EBPβ (liver-activating protein (LAP)) activity in a dominant negative fashion (26.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid containing LIP (i.e.DN-C/EBPβ) was transfected into MMC-34 mast cells along with [COX-2−724][Luc]. After activation by aggregation of IgE receptors, cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase expression. Expression of DN-C/EBPβ (LIP) completely blocked both the basal and induced expression from the COX-2 promoter (Fig.8 A). The most likely mechanism by which C/EBP transcription factors exert their regulatory roles on COX-2 gene expression in activated mast cells would be through the NF-IL6 sites. To test whether the NF-IL6 sites are necessary for the inhibition of COX-2 expression by LIP/DN-C/EBPβ, we repeated the LIP transfection experiment using a shorter COX-2/luciferase reporter construct, ([COX-2−80][Luc]) (14.Guan Z. ShaAvhree Y Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was induced from [COX-2−80][Luc] by receptor aggregation in mast cells, albeit at a reduced level when compared with the longer [COX-2−724][Luc] promoter construct (Fig.8 B). Once again, co-expression of LIP (DN-C/EBPβ) blocked both the basal and induced expression from the COX-2 promoter in MMC-34 mast cells, even in the absence of the two NF-IL6 sites (Fig.8 B). Moreover, wild type C/EBPβ also enhanced luciferase expression in activated MMC-34 mast cells transfected with [COX-2−80][Luc] (data not shown). Our results suggest that C/EBPβ may contribute to COX-2 expression both through activation at the NF-IL6 sites and via a mechanism not requiring interaction with the NF-IL6 sites. The molecular mechanisms by which COX-2 gene expression is elevated in mast cells following aggregation of their high affinity IgE receptors have not previously been addressed. In this report, we use deletion and mutation constructs of the COX-2 promoter as well as wild type and dominant negative constructs for a number of signaling proteins to identify (i) the cis-acting response element(s) responsible for the induction of COX-2 expression in activated MMC-34 mast cells and (ii) signal transduction pathways that mediate COX-2 induction and (iii) the transcription factors involved in the induction of COX-2 promoter activity. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that, in murine NIH3T3 cells, the CRE element located between nucleotides −56 and −52 of COX-2 gene is necessary for the induction of COX-2 transcription-mediated by v-src, serum, and PDGF (9.Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Anderson R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest a role for NF-IL6 and NF-κB as well as E-box sites in the transcriptional regulation of COX-2 in other cell types (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 10.Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 25.Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate characterization of transcriptional regulation of the COX-2 gene, we created new constructs that contain 724 nucleotides of the COX-2 promoter. This set of constructs contains all the response elements that have been implicated thus far in COX-2 regulation. Mutations were introduced in the CRE, E-box, NF-IL6, and NF-κB sites (Fig. 1). Similar to our previous observations in NIH3T3 cells (9.Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Anderson R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), induction from the COX-2 promoter in activated MMC-34 mast cells also requires an intact CRE response element (Fig. 2). There was no effect on luciferase expression when we used COX-2 promoter constructs harboring mutations in either the E-box or the NF-κB elements. The E-box of the COX-2 gene was suggested to play a critical role in the regulation of COX-2 expression in rat ovarian granulosa cells (8.Morris J.K. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16633-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, unlike the murine and human COX-2 promoters, the rat COX-2 promoter does not contain the CGTCA CRE element at nucleotide −56 (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Kim and Fischer (11.Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) report that the E-box of the murine COX-2 gene plays a prominent role in COX-2 transcriptional regulation in mouse skin carcinoma cells. However, the “E-box mutation” on which they base their conclusion changes two of the five critical nucleotides of the overlapping CRE of the COX-2 gene. We conclude from our data with murine mast cells and fibroblasts and data from other laboratories studying the human gene (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) that the COX-2 CRE plays a pivotal role in COX-2 gene expression in a wide range of cells, including mast cells, in response to a wide variety of stimuli. Mutating either the CRE or NF-IL6 site, in human vascular endothelial cells, reduces lipopolysaccharide/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced COX-2 promoter activity by 40% and 10% respectively. Mutating both the CRE and NF-IL6 sites results in the maximum inhibition of activity, >75% (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Using deletion constructs of the COX-2 promoter, Inoueet al. (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) conclude that transcriptional regulation of COX-2 in vascular endothelial cells is regulated through a combination of the NF-IL6 and CRE sites (7.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara C. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the regulation of the COX-2 gene might share similar characteristics in mast cells. The murine COX-2 promoter has two consensus NF-IL6 sites. We constructed vectors harboring mutations in either of the NF-IL6 sites or in both NF-IL6 sites. Although neither of the single site mutants has any effect on COX-2 promoter activity, we observe a significant (albeit not complete) inhibition when we use the construct harboring mutations in both NF-IL6 sites (Fig. 2). An interaction of these two sites thus appears to play a role in regulation of the COX-2 gene in activated mast cells. The human COX-2 promoter has only one putative NF-IL6 site. Subtle species differences in regulation of the COX-2 gene may exist as a consequence of these differences in promoter structure. In addition, at least one transcription factor that binds the NF-IL6 consensus sequences also appears to influence COX-2 gene expression in mast cells, albeit at least in part in a fashion independent of these sites (see below). Expression of a dominant negative Ras protein completely blocks luciferase induction from the COX-2 promoter in activated MMC-34 mast cells (Fig. 3). Ras also mediates oncogene and growth factor-induced transcriptional regulation of COX-2 in NIH3T3 cells (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A potential link between high affinity IgE receptors and the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway through SOS and Grb2 in mast cells has been reported (29.Jabril-Cuenod B. Zhang C. Scharenberg A.M. Paolini R. Numerof R. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16268-16272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, distinct downstream Ras effector pathways have also been reported to be involved in the regulation of gene expression following aggregation of the high affinity receptors on mast cells (23.Turner H. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 181: 43-53Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cotransfection experiments utilizing dominant negative constructs for the several pathways downstream of Ras demonstrate that regulation of COX-2 expression in activated MMC-34 mast cells is mediated both by Ras/MEKK/JNK and Ras/Raf/ERK pathways. In this regard, COX-2 induction in activated mast cells and mitogen-induced fibroblasts share common features. A number of recent reports describe a role for Ras activation of p38 MAP kinase signaling in induction of the COX-2 gene in several cell types, in response to a variety of ligands (14.Guan Z. ShaAvhree Y Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although we have not investigated p38 MAP kinase, it seems likely that this Ras-activated pathway may also play a role in induced COX-2 gene expression in activated mast cells. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that c-Jun mediates v-src, PDGF, and serum induction of COX-2 expression (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). c-Jun has also been implicated in COX-2 induction in response to IL-1β in rat renal mesangial cells (14.Guan Z. ShaAvhree Y Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We also find that the CRE plays a major role in the induction of COX-2 gene expression in murine osteoblasts, in response to a variety of inducers, and that c-Jun plays the major role in transcriptional modulation in these cells (31.Wadleigh D. Herschman H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). c-Jun, acting at the murine COX-2 promoter, also plays the major transcriptional role in mediating endotoxin induction of COX-2 expression in macrophages.2 In our experiments with MMC-34 mast cells, overexpression of c-Jun augments COX-2 expression even more than it does in NIH3T3 cells (12.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although enhancement of gene expression by overexpression of a transcription factor does not conclusively demonstrate that this same transcription factor mediates the expression of the gene in question in vivo, our results are consistent with the suggestion that c-Jun plays a major role in COX-2 induction in mast cells. Our observation that wild type CREB blocks expression from the COX-2 promoter in activated mast cells demonstrates that this classic transcriptional CRE activation factor does not mediate COX-2 gene expression in mast cells. In fibroblasts, we demonstrated by the use of chimeric transcription factors and an altered DNA binding site that the activation domain of c-Jun is responsible for induced COX-2 gene expression at the position of the CRE in the COX-2 promoter and that the activation domain of CREB is unable to elevate COX-2 gene expression (13.Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). CREB also blocks COX-2 activation in osteoblasts (31.Wadleigh D. Herschman H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and in macrophages.2 The inability of CREB to activate COX-2 gene expression in mast cells is consistent with an alternate transcription factor, c-Jun, playing a major role in COX-2 gene expression in activated mast cells. The trans-acting factors that bind to the NF-IL6 site have many isoforms, including C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ (32.Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 33.Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 34.Kinoshita S. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). All of the C/EBP isoforms have a leucine zipper motif for dimer formation, thus allowing substantial cross-talk with other transcription factors (30.Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of Thr-235 of C/EBPβ protein by a Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is essential for C/EBPβ activation (28.Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), making C/EBPβ a good candidate as a transcription factor required for COX-2 induction that is activated via the Raf/ERK pathway. Sirois and Richards (25.Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that C/EBPβ may play a key role in regulating COX-2 induction in rat granulosa cells. C/EBPβ overexpression enhances and DN-C/EBPβ inhibits COX-2 promoter activity of the [COX-2−724][Luc] reporter gene in activated mast cells, suggesting that C/EBPβ plays a role in COX-2 gene expression following mast cell activation. We also found that, in mast cells transfected with [COX-2−80][Luc], (i) overexpressing C/EBPβ can enhance luciferase induction, and (ii) expression of DN- C/EBPβ can block luciferase induction. [COX-2−80][Luc] does not contain either NF-IL6 site of the COX-2 promoter (data not shown). Without a deletion and/or mutational analysis of the region between −80 and the transcription start site of the COX-2 gene, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that C/EBP can also modulate COX-2 expression by interacting with an alternative binding site in this region. However, no conventional C/EBP binding sites are present in this region of the COX-2 gene, suggesting that C/EBPβ can modulate COX-2 gene expression by protein-protein interactions that are independent of DNA binding. Since the only known regulatory element found in [COX-2−80] is the CRE, C/EBP proteins may modulate COX-2 gene expression in activated mast cells both by direct interactions with NF-IL6 binding sites and by modulation of the transcription factor binding and/or activation at the COX-2 CRE. In summary, the transcriptional regulation of the COX-2 gene in activated mast cells is mediated (i) by both the CRE element present between −52 and −58 nucleotides on the COX-2 promoter and by the two NF-IL6 sites on the COX-2 promoter, (ii) by at least two Ras-dependent signaling pathways, Ras/MEKK/JNK and Ras/Raf/ERK, and (iii) by the transcription factors c-Jun and C/EBPβ.

https://openalex.org/W2069225430,The mechanism responsible for electromotility of outer hair cells in the ear is unknown but is thought to reside within the plasma membrane. Lipid lateral diffusion in the outer hair cell plasma membrane is a sigmoidal function of transmembrane potential and bathing media osmolality. Cell depolarization or hyposmotic challenge shorten the cell and reduce membrane fluidity by half. Changing the membrane tension with amphipathic drugs results in similar reductions. These dynamic changes in membrane fluidity represent the modulation of membrane tension by lipid-protein interactions. The voltage dependence may be associated with the force-generating motors that contribute to the exquisite sensitivity of mammalian hearing.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recent mutagenesis studies suggest that protonation of the homologous amino acid in the α1Badrenergic receptor (Asp142) may be involved in its mechanism of activation (2.Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of protonation in G protein-coupled receptor activation, we examined the effects of pH on the rate of ligand-induced conformational change and on receptor-mediated G protein activation for the β2adrenergic receptor (β2AR). The rate of agonist-induced change in the fluorescence of NBD-labeled, purified β2AR was 2-fold greater at pH 6.5 than at pH 8, even though agonist affinity was lower at pH 6.5. This biophysical analysis was corroborated by functional studies; basal (agonist-independent) activation of Gαs by the β2AR was greater at pH 6.5 compared with pH 8.0. Taken together, these results provide evidence that protonation increases basal activity by destabilizing the inactive state of the receptor. In addition, we found that the pH sensitivity of β2AR activation is not abrogated by mutation of Asp130, which is homologous to the highly conserved acidic amino acids that link protonation to activation of rhodopsin (Glu134) and the α1B adrenergic receptor (Asp142).

G protein-coupled receptor transmembrane N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine GTP-binding protein β2-adrenergic receptor n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate A majority of extracellular signaling molecules elicit their physiologic responses through members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 family. Classically, these extracellular ligands bind and activate their receptors, leading to the stimulation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins), which then initiate a cascade of intracellular biochemical changes. Despite diverse physiologic roles that range from neurotransmission to light detection, GPCRs are all believed to share a common seven transmembrane topology, as well as a common activation mechanism. Mutational analyses have assigned ligand binding and G protein coupling to distinct receptor domains (3.Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-172302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 4.Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5.Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). However, the molecular events responsible for receptor activation remain largely undefined (5.Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In an effort to characterize the nature of the structural changes important for GPCR activation, we have applied fluorescent spectroscopic techniques to the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), a prototypical member of the seven transmembrane receptor family (6.Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). By covalently labeling the receptor with (N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine) (IANBD), a fluorescent probe that is sensitive to the polarity of its molecular environment, we can directly follow ligand-induced structural dynamics in the receptor. Using this fluorescent spectroscopic method, we recently localized agonist-induced conformational changes to the third and sixth transmembrane (TM) domains of the β2AR (6.Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with spectroscopic studies on rhodopsin, which show that movements in TM III and TM VI are involved in its mechanism of activation (9.Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 10.Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The importance of conformational changes in TM III to the mechanism of receptor activation for both rhodopsin and the β2AR may reflect essential interactions between TM III and agonists. Glu113 in TM III of rhodopsin is the counter-ion for the protonated Schiff base formed by retinal and Lys296 in TM VII (11.Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and Asp113 in TM III of the β2AR forms an ion pair with the amine nitrogen of catecholamine agonists (12.Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Another interesting structural feature of TM III is a highly conserved Glu/Asp-Arg-Tyr (E/DRY) sequence found at the cytoplasmic border of most rhodopsin family GPCRs. Mutagenesis studies in rhodopsin demonstrated that protonation of the glutamic acid in this motif occurs directly after retinal isomerization (1.Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation to the uncharged glutamine results in a constitutively active opsin (13.Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies and molecular modeling simulations in the α1Badrenergic receptor suggest that activation of the receptor involves conformational changes induced by the protonation of the aspartic acid in this sequence (2.Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, the agonist-dependent conformational changes we observe in TM III via fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of the β2AR may reflect this protonation event. Taken together, these studies suggest that a protonation-sensitive conformational state may be important for the mechanism of GPCR activation. To better understand how protonation influences the activation of a GPCR, we studied the effect of pH on the activity of the β2AR. We hypothesized that if protonation was important in the mechanism of receptor activation, we would find enhanced receptor activity at a lower pH. We used fluorescently labeled receptor to study the effect of pH on structural dynamics. In addition, we studied the effect of pH changes on the ability of the receptor to activate its corresponding G protein. The results from these studies provide further evidence for protonation in the process of GPCR activation. DNA sequences encoding the human β2 adrenergic receptor, epitope-tagged at the amino terminus with the cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG epitope (IBI, New Haven, CT) and tagged at the carboxyl terminus with six histidines, were cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) (14.Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This construct was co-transfected with linearized BaculoGold DNA into Sf9 insect cells using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The resulting virus was harvested after 4–7 days and amplified once before plaque purification. The plaque-purified viruses were amplified several times to obtain 500 ml of a high titer virus stock (about 1 × 109plaque-forming units). For purification, the cells were grown in 1000-ml cultures in SF 900 II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Gemini, Calabasas, CA) and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were infected with a 1:30–1:40 dilution of a high titer virus stock at a density of 3.5–5.5 × 106cells/ml and harvested after 48 h by centrifugation (10 min at 5,000 × g). The cell pellets are kept at −70 °C until used for purification. Receptor was purified using a two-step purification procedure. One to two pellets of Sf9 cells from 1000 ml of infected cultures were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml benzamidine (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)). Following centrifugation (20 min at 30,000 ×g), the lysed cells were resuspended in solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 1.0%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (NDM) (Anatrace), 500 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μmalprenolol (Sigma)), subjected to 25 strokes from a Dounce homogenizer, and then stirred for 2 h at 4 °C. The solubilized receptor was purified by nickel column chromatography using Chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and alprenolol affinity chromatography as described (8.Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14.Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 nmol of pure protein generally could be obtained from a 1000-ml culture. The specific activity for the purified receptor was ∼10 nmol/mg protein. Protein levels were measured with the detergent-insensitive Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Purified protein was analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein was visualized by standard Coomassie staining. The cDNA encoding the human β2 adrenoreceptor, epitope-tagged at the amino terminus with the cleavable influenza hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG epitope (IBI) (15.Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tagged at the carboxyl terminus with six histidines (SF-h β2-6H) was used as the template for mutagenesis (15.Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aspartate and glutamate mutations were all generated by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis usingPfu polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The generated polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL 1392 containing SF-h β2 -6H fused to Gαs, constructed as described (16.Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequenced. For infection, cells were sedimented and suspended in fresh medium. Cells were seeded at 3.0 × 106 cells/ml, infected with the optimal dilution of β2-Gαs virus stock, as determined by titration, and cultured for 48 h. All membrane preparation steps were done at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and recentrifuged, then resuspended in lysis buffer and lysed using 25 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (5 min at 500 × g). The supernatant was removed and centrifuged (30 min at 40,000 ×g). The resultant pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer and recentrifuged. Membranes were resuspended at 0.5–1.5 mg of protein/ml in binding buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C until use. Purified receptor was bound to a 100-μl nickel column (Chelating Sepharose). Labeling with the cysteine-reactive fluorophore IANBD (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was achieved by recycling 800 μl of 500 μm IANBD in HS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl, and 0.08% NDM) for 30 min. Excess dye was removed by washing with 75 column volumes of HS buffer. Labeled receptor was eluted with 200 mm imidazole in HS buffer. This procedure results in ∼1 mol of IANBD/mol of receptor, as determined by measuring absorption at 481 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 21,000 m−1 cm−1 for IANBD and a molecular mass of 50 kDa for the receptor. Derivatization of the receptor does not perturb receptor pharmacology, and labeling could be selectively blocked by sulfhydryl-reactive agents. (8.Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy was performed on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer as described (8.Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). For experiments examining pH affects on the kinetics of the agonist-induced change in fluorescence, 25–50 pmol of IANBD-labeled β2 receptor were diluted into a solution containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% NDM in a total volume of 475 μl. The solution was constantly stirred for 10 min. The time scan was started and, after 300 s, 25 μl of either 1 m MOPSO, pH 6.5, or 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, were added and allowed to mix for 200 s. (−)-Isoproterenol was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the assay was continued for 2500 s. The time to maximal fluorescence change was calculated by using data from the final 300 s of each experiment (when the fluorescence intensity had stabilized) to extrapolate a line from which all data points after (−)-isoproterenol addition were subtracted. For experiments measuring the effect of pH changes on the magnitude of the agonist-induced fluorescence change, MOPSO (pH 6.5) or Tris (pH 8) were introduced after 200 s and allowed to mix for 100 s. Then (−)-isoproterenol ([100 μm]f) was added and the assay continued for 300 s. At this point, (−)-alprenolol ([50 μm]f) was added and the assay continued until the new base line had stabilized. The magnitude of the isoproterenol-induced fluorescence change was determined by comparing fluorescence intensity, corrected for dilution, before and after (−)-alprenolol addition. These corrected data were subjected to non-linear regression analysis to determine the time at which the half of the maximal change in fluorescence was reached. All of the compounds in the concentrations used had an absorbance of less than 0.01 at 481 nm (λexcitation) and 523 nm (λemission), excluding any inner filter effects. Binding assays on purified β2receptor were performed using [3H]dihydroalprenolol as radioligand (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (8.Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). On-rates were assessed by incubating purified receptor with 10 nm [3H]dihydroalprenolol in a total volume of 100 μl of binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1% NDM, with either 30 mm MOPSO, pH 6.5, or 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) to determine optimal time for subsequent incubations (data not shown). To examine the stability of the purified receptor under conditions of varying pH, the receptor was diluted 1:200 in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% NDM, and 50 mmamounts of the appropriate buffer. After either 1 or 3 h of incubation, 10 μl of this dilution was used for a 1 h binding assay containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 1% NDM, and 10 nm[3H]dihydroalprenolol in a total volume of 100 μl. For saturation binding assays, purified and solubilized receptor was incubated for 30 min in 100 μl of binding buffer containing [3H]dihydroalprenolol varying in concentration from 22 to 0.69 nm. In competition binding assays, purified receptor was incubated for 30 min in 100 μl of binding buffer containing either (−)-alprenolol or (−)-isoproterenol (from 10−4 to 10−9m). The (−)-isoproterenol competition assays contained 1.4 nm[3H]dihydroalprenolol for experiments at pH 8 and 5.5 nm [3H]dihydroalprenolol for pH 6.5 experiments, while the (−)-alprenolol competition assays contained 2.1 nm [3H]dihydroalprenolol for experiments at pH 8 and 10.3 nm [3H]dihydroalprenolol for experiments at pH 6.5. We were unable to consistently perform saturation binding on the purified receptor at pH 6.5. We therefore determined the dissociation constant (KD) at pH 6.5 by competing [3H]dihydroalprenolol with alprenolol. We determined the KD at pH 8.0 by both saturation and competition methods; these methods yielded the same value, thus confirming the validity of the competition assay approach for determining the dissociation constant at pH 6.5. With the goal of obtaining approximately 10% bound radioligand, both saturation and competition binding assays conducted at pH 6.5 contained between 4 and 6 times the amount of purified receptor as those experiments performed at pH 8.0. All binding assays were stopped and free [3H]dihydroalprenolol separated from bound by desalting on Sephadex G50 columns (4 cm × 0.5 cm) using ice-cold elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.08% NDM). All nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm alprenolol where appropriate. For saturation binding experiments on the β2-Gαsconstructs, Sf9 membranes (10–40 μg of protein) were suspended in 500 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 0.1–10 nm [3H]dihydroalprenolol and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 10 μm (−)-alprenolol. Incubations were performed for 1 h at 25 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Competition binding experiments were carried out with 1.2 nm[3H]dihydroalprenolol in the presence of increasing concentrations of (−)-isoproterenol. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). KI was calculated from the equationKI = IC50/(1 +L/KD). Before experiments, membranes were thawed at 4 °C, centrifuged (15 min at 15,000 ×g) and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Assay tubes contained β2-Gαs or Gαsmembranes (10 μg of protein), 100 nm GTP, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm EDTA, 100 μm ATP, 1 mm adenylyl imidodiphosphate, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 40 μg of creatine kinase, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mm MOPSO, pH 6.5, or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Tubes also contained ligands at various concentrations. Assay tubes (80 μl) were incubated for 3 min at 25 °C before the addition of 20 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (0.1–0.5 μCi/tube). Reactions were conducted for 20 min at 25 °C and were terminated by the addition of 900 μl of a slurry consisting of 5% (w/v) activated charcoal in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 2.0. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged (15 min at 15,000 × g) at room temperature. 700 μl of the supernatant were removed, and [32P]Pi was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The β2AR contains 34 acidic amino acids (Asp and Glu) and 45 basic amino acids (Lys, Arg, and His). In addition to their potential involvement in the process of receptor activation, these pH-sensitive amino acids may be involved in maintaining the tertiary structure of the receptor. We therefore examined the pH range over which the β2AR remains stable as determined by binding to the antagonist [3H]dihydroalprenolol. The results shown in Fig. 1 Ademonstrate that radioligand binding can be measured over a broad pH range from 7.0 to 9.0. There is a dramatic loss of receptor activity below pH 7, with nearly complete loss of binding at pH 6. Based on these studies, we chose to focus on a comparison of receptor at pH 8.0, where the receptor appeared most stable, and pH 6.5, where we began to observe a loss of function, suggesting that one or more of the acidic amino acids were being protonated. The loss of radioligand binding observed in Fig. 1 A could be due to denaturation of the receptor and/or to a more specific effect of pH on ligand binding. To assess receptor stability, the pH of purified receptor was adjusted to either pH 6.5 or 8.0. After a 1- or 3-h incubation at room temperature, ligand binding was performed at pH 8 with a saturating (10 nm) concentration of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to determine the recovery of functional receptor. As shown in Fig. 1 B, there was a significantly greater loss of binding activity in receptor incubated at pH 6.5. The isoproterenol (agonist) and dihydroalprenolol (antagonist) binding affinity for purified, detergent-solubilized β2AR receptor at pH 6.5 and pH 8.0 are presented in TableI. The affinities for both agonist and antagonist were reduced by approximately 10-fold at pH 6.5.Table IEffect of pH on agonist and antagonist binding affinitiesK D(ALP)K I (ISO)nmμmpH 6.535 ± 3 (n = 4)4.6 ± 0.4 (n = 3)pH 8.02.0 ± 0.3 (n = 4)0.56 ± 0.13 (n = 4)K D was determined at pH 8.0 via saturation and competition assays, both methods yielding the same value. The competition method was used for pH 6.5. ALP is the neutral antagonist (−)-alprenolol, and ISO is the full agonist (−)-isoproterenol. Open table in a new tab K D was determined at pH 8.0 via saturation and competition assays, both methods yielding the same value. The competition method was used for pH 6.5. ALP is the neutral antagonist (−)-alprenolol, and ISO is the full agonist (−)-isoproterenol. We have previously shown that fluorescent techniques can be used to monitor ligand-induced conformational changes in the β2adrenergic receptor. Purified, detergent-solubilized β2AR was labeled with IANBD, a fluorescent probe that is sensitive to the polarity of its molecular environment. We then examined agonist-induced changes in receptor fluorescence at pH 8.0 and at pH 6.5 (Fig.2 A). The rate of conformational change, as reflected by the rate of the agonist-induced fluorescence change, was 2.1 times faster at pH 6.5 (t 1/2 = 186 ± 10 s) than at pH 8.0 (t 1/2 = 391 ± 48 s). The increased rate of fluorescence change at pH 6.5 could be due to an increase in the rate of agonist-induced conformational change or to protein denaturation, since we noted greater instability at pH 6.5. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we looked at the ability of antagonists to reverse the changes in fluorescence. (−)-Alprenolol rapidly reverses agonist-induced changes in fluorescence; however, exposure of receptor to (−)-alprenolol alone has no effect on receptor fluorescence (8.Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, (−)-alprenolol would not be expected to reverse conformational changes due to protein denaturation. However, if conformational changes occur more rapidly at pH 6.5 than at pH 8.0, we would expect that the magnitude of the (−)-alprenolol reversal after a short exposure to isoproterenol would be greater at pH 6.5 than at pH 8.0. Therefore, we examined the ability of (−)-alprenolol to reverse the conformational change induced by exposure to isoproterenol (Fig. 2 B). We found that that the extent of reversal after the addition of the antagonist was significantly greater at pH 6.5 (4.5 ± 0.2%) than that at pH 8.0 (3.5 ± 0.2%). Thus the increased rate of agonist-induced fluorescence at pH 6.5 can be attributed to an increase in the rate of reversible, agonist-induced conformational changes in the receptor. It is well known that the intensity of fluorescent molecules can be influenced by pH. However, NBD is relatively pH-insensitive, and we examined agonist-induced changes in fluorescence at a given pH in each experiment, so that the pH was not changed while fluorescence was being monitored. Thus, the effect of pH on the rate of agonist-induced conformational change cannot be explained by pH-sensitive properties of NBD. To examine the influence of pH on interactions between the β2AR and its preferred G protein, Gαs, we monitored ligand-regulated GTPase activity. However, even when the β2AR is expressed with a large excess of Gαs in insect cells, the efficiency of coupling is not sufficient to permit the use of a GTPase assay to directly monitor interactions between receptor and G protein (16.Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a fusion protein between the β2AR and Gαs(β2-Gαs). Others and we have observed that fusion of the β2AR with Gαs leads to highly efficient coupling and permits the direct assessment of Gαs activation by techniques such as GTPase activity and GTPγS binding (16.Seifert R.

As shown in Fig. 3, basal GTPase activity was 1.7 times higher at pH 6.5 than at pH 8.0 (2.6 ± 0.2 pmol of32P released mg−1 min−1 versus 1.5 ± 0.2 pmol of 32P released mg−1 min−1). In contrast, the maximal GTPase activation by the agonist isoproterenol (ISO) was lower at pH 6.5. As another measure of the constitutive receptor activity, we also examined the proportion of the basal activity that was inhibited by the inverse agonist ICI 118,551 (ICI). At pH 8.0, the inverse agonist inhibited 7.9 ± 2.8% of ligand-regulated activity, whereas at pH 6.5, ICI inhibited 37.6 ± 2.5% of ligand-regulated activity; the higher efficacy of ICI at pH 6.5 indicates a higher proportion of basal activity at that pH. These results also serve to confirm that the higher basal GTPase activity at pH 6.5 was mediated by the receptor and not by a direct effect of pH on Gαs. To further investigate the effect of pH on Gαs, we examined Sf9 membranes expressing an equivalent amount of Gαs alone (as determined by Western blot analysis). In these membranes, there was no significant difference in basal GTPase activity at pH 6.5 compared with the activity at pH 8.0 (Fig. 3). In an attempt to identify the site or sites responsible for pH-dependent effect on basal activity, we generated β2-Gαs fusion proteins in which specific acidic amino acids in the β2AR were mutated to alanine. Glu122, Asp130, and Glu268 were chosen, based on predictions made from a three-dimensional model of the β2AR (see “Discussion”). The positions of these mutations in the predicted secondary structure of the β2AR are shown in Fig.4 A. All three mutated receptors were expressed in Sf9 cells, and membranes were prepared for ligand binding and GTPase studies. As a measure of constitutive activity, we examined the effect of the inverse agonist ICI on basal activity and expressed this as a percentage of the total ligand-regulated GTPase activity (100 × [basal − ICIMAX)/(ISOMAX − ICIMAX]). All of the mutated receptors showed increased basal activity at pH 6.5 compared with pH 8.0, as determined by the enhanced effect of ICI at pH 6.5 (Fig. 4 B). The pharmacological properties of these mutants are given in Table II. All three mutant β2-Gαs fusion proteins were indistinguishable from the wild type fusion protein with respect to the fraction and the KI of high affinity binding sites and to the EC50 for agonist stimulation of GTPase activity. TheKI of the low affinity site for the E122A fusion protein was significantly higher than that of the wild type and the other mutant fusion proteins. All three mutants had a slightly reduced affinity for the antagonist dihydroalprenolol compared with"

Transient transfection with dominant negative RacN17 inhibited IL1-induced κB-dependent reporter gene expression but not IκBα degradation, whereas constitutively active RacV12 potentiated κB-dependent reporter gene expression in response to IL1 but had no effects on its own. Using porcine aortic endothelial cells stably transfected with RacV12 or RacN17 under the control of an inducible promoter, we confirmed that RacV12 did not affect IκBα degradation, nor did RacN17 inhibit the IL1-induced response. RacV12 was also unable to induce nuclear translocation of NFκB. These effects suggested a role for Rac1 in p65-mediated transactivation of NFκB, independent of IκBα regulation. In support of this we found that IL1 activated a pathway leading to increased p65 transactivation activity and that RacV12 alone could drive this response in both cell systems. Additionally, RacN17 inhibited IL1-driven p65-mediated transactivation. From data using specific inhibitors of p38 and p42/p44 kinases we propose that both p38 and p42/p44 lie downstream of Rac1 on the IL1 pathway leading to enhanced transactivation by p65."

Cytoskeletal tension also has been implicated in anchorage dependence of cell growth in monolayer culture (14.Assoian R.K. Zhu X. Curr. Opin.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was of interest, therefore, to compare ERK signaling in fibroblasts in mechanically loaded versus unloaded collagen matrices. Our results show that disruption of ERK signaling could explain the onset of quiescence of fibroblasts in mechanically unloaded matrices even though the cells are anchored and well spread.DISCUSSIONThe collagen matrix model provides a unique opportunity to study the transition from cell proliferation to quiescence without pharmacologic intervention or removal of soluble growth factors. In the current studies, we analyzed ERK signaling after switching fibroblasts from mechanically loaded to unloaded conditions. Based on the decrease in acute ERK phosphorylation in response to serum or phorbol ester and on the inability of phorbol ester to acutely stimulate c-fostranscription, it could be concluded that the ERK signaling pathway was disrupted in fibroblasts after mechanical unloading.In collagen matrices switched from mechanically loaded to unloaded conditions, ERK signaling was disrupted after 4 h. DNA synthesis was reduced more than 50% after 10 h and 90% after 24 h. ERK signaling also was disrupted in fibroblasts in floating collagen matrices where only low levels of DNA synthesis occurred. Moreover, inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway by the inhibitor PD98059 reversibly inhibited DNA synthesis in fibroblasts in mechanically loaded collagen matrices (see also Ref. 39.Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies are consistent with the idea that disruption of the ERK signaling pathway contributes to the low levels of DNA synthesis by fibroblasts in mechanically unloaded matrices.The mechanism responsible for loss of ERK signaling in mechanically unloaded matrices remains to be determined but probably occurs upstream of the ERK activator MEK because MEK responded to mechanical unloading similarly to ERK. Receptor tyrosine kinases could be involved because platelet-derived growth factor receptors have been reported activated by increased mechanical stress (40.Hu Y. Bock G. Wick G. Xu Q. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) but desensitized after mechanical unloading (27.Lin Y.C. Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28.Lin Y.C. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, however, the ERK signaling pathway in mechanically unloaded fibroblasts did not function normally even when tested with phorbol ester, which stimulates the signaling pathway downstream of cell surface receptors (29.Thomas S.M. DeMarco M., G, D.A. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 30.Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J.

Therefore, in addition to receptor activity, loss of signaling likely depends on downstream factors. Physical organization of the signaling pathway itself also could be important. Scaffolding proteins are required for proper functioning of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling modules (42.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, caveolae have been reported to play a role in organizing the signaling molecules leading to ERK activation, and mechanoregulated signaling can be blocked by disrupting caveolae (43.Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26323-26329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Finally, mechanostimulation has been shown to cause Shc association with integrins, which is followed by recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex leading to ERK signaling (44.Chen K.D. Li Y.S. Kim M. Li S. Yuan S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18393-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Therefore, mechanical unloading could alter the association of Shc or other adapter proteins with the cell surface matrix receptors.Whatever the precise mechanism accounting for the loss of ERK signaling, it is interesting that this loss and concomitant cell quiescence in mechanically unloaded collagen matrices resembles the regulation of cells in monolayer cultures by anchorage dependence. Although it has been possible through the use of micropatterned substrata to make a distinction between the effects of cell tensionversus shape on cell proliferation (45.Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E131-E138Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), such studies cannot replicate the situation of cells engaged in three-dimensional adhesive interactions over their entire surfaces such as occurs in tissue. Use of a three-dimensional culture system such as the collagen matrix model provides such an opportunity. In mechanically unloaded collagen matrices, fibroblasts were attached and well spread but lacked stressed fibers, which indicated an absence of isometric tension. Moreover, fibroblasts in collagen matrices could not organize and maintain a fibronectin matrix in the absence of mechanical loading (7.Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 46.Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the interplay between the features of cytoskeletal tension and growth in the three-dimensional environment is similar to that reported for cells in monolayer culture (14.Assoian R.K. Zhu X. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15.Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev.

Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar).Finally, the current studies offer a novel mechanism to account for cell growth regulation at the end of wound repair. Before wounding, tissue fibroblasts are stellate, quiescent, and sessile. After wounding, a highly cellular wound tissue develops through the migration and proliferation of fibroblastic cells from the wound margins (1.Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 3-50Google Scholar, 2.Peacock E.E.J. Wound Repair. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1984: 1-140Google Scholar,4.Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar). These cells differentiate into myofibroblasts that are under a mechanical load (isometric tension) as shown by their elongated shape, prominent stress fibers, and fibronexus junctions (3.Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar, 47.Singer I.I. Kawka D.W. Kazazis D.M. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 2091-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). After the wound defect has been replaced through a combination of cellular contractile activity and extracellular matrix biosynthesis, the tissue returns to a mechanically unloaded state, and myofibroblast regression occurs through apoptosis (3.Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar). Based on our experiments with fibroblasts in collagen matrices, we speculate that quiescence at the end of wound repair depends on mechanically regulated disruption of the ERK signaling pathway, which leads to cessation of DNA synthesis even in the continued presence of soluble growth factors in the wound environment. During wound repair, fibroblasts go though a sequence of cell proliferation, quiescence, and apoptosis (1.Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed.

Based on the decrease in acute ERK phosphorylation in response to serum or phorbol ester and on the inability of phorbol ester to acutely stimulate c-fostranscription, it could be concluded that the ERK signaling pathway was disrupted in fibroblasts after mechanical unloading. In collagen matrices switched from mechanically loaded to unloaded conditions, ERK signaling was disrupted after 4 h. DNA synthesis was reduced more than 50% after 10 h and 90% after 24 h. ERK signaling also was disrupted in fibroblasts in floating collagen matrices where only low levels of DNA synthesis occurred. Moreover, inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway by the inhibitor PD98059 reversibly inhibited DNA synthesis in fibroblasts in mechanically loaded collagen matrices (see also Ref. 39.Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies are consistent with the idea that disruption of the ERK signaling pathway contributes to the low levels of DNA synthesis by fibroblasts in mechanically unloaded matrices. The mechanism responsible for loss of ERK signaling in mechanically unloaded matrices remains to be determined but probably occurs upstream of the ERK activator MEK because MEK responded to mechanical unloading similarly to ERK. Receptor tyrosine kinases could be involved because platelet-derived growth factor receptors have been reported activated by increased mechanical stress (40.Hu Y. Bock G. Wick G. Xu Q. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) but desensitized after mechanical unloading (27.Lin Y.C. Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28.Lin Y.C. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, however, the ERK signaling pathway in mechanically unloaded fibroblasts did not function normally even when tested with phorbol ester, which stimulates the signaling pathway downstream of cell surface receptors (29.Thomas S.M. DeMarco M., G, D.A. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 30.Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 41.Marquardt B. Frith D. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3213-3218PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to receptor activity, loss of signaling likely depends on downstream factors. Physical organization of the signaling pathway itself also could be important. Scaffolding proteins are required for proper functioning of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling modules (42.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, caveolae have been reported to play a role in organizing the signaling molecules leading to ERK activation, and mechanoregulated signaling can be blocked by disrupting caveolae (43.Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26323-26329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Finally, mechanostimulation has been shown to cause Shc association with integrins, which is followed by recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex leading to ERK signaling (44.Chen K.D. Li Y.S. Kim M. Li S. Yuan S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18393-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Therefore, mechanical unloading could alter the association of Shc or other adapter proteins with the cell surface matrix receptors. Whatever the precise mechanism accounting for the loss of ERK signaling, it is interesting that this loss and concomitant cell quiescence in mechanically unloaded collagen matrices resembles the regulation of cells in monolayer cultures by anchorage dependence. Although it has been possible through the use of micropatterned substrata to make a distinction between the effects of cell tensionversus shape on cell proliferation (45.Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E131-E138Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), such studies cannot replicate the situation of cells engaged in three-dimensional adhesive interactions over their entire surfaces such as occurs in tissue. Use of a three-dimensional culture system such as the collagen matrix model provides such an opportunity. In mechanically unloaded collagen matrices, fibroblasts were attached and well spread but lacked stressed fibers, which indicated an absence of isometric tension. Moreover, fibroblasts in collagen matrices could not organize and maintain a fibronectin matrix in the absence of mechanical loading (7.Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 46.Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the interplay between the features of cytoskeletal tension and growth in the three-dimensional environment is similar to that reported for cells in monolayer culture (14.Assoian R.K. Zhu X. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15.Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 16.Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17.Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Finally, the current studies offer a novel mechanism to account for cell growth regulation at the end of wound repair. Before wounding, tissue fibroblasts are stellate, quiescent, and sessile. After wounding, a highly cellular wound tissue develops through the migration and proliferation of fibroblastic cells from the wound margins (1.Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 3-50Google Scholar, 2.Peacock E.E.J. Wound Repair. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1984: 1-140Google Scholar,4.Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar). These cells differentiate into myofibroblasts that are under a mechanical load (isometric tension) as shown by their elongated shape, prominent stress fibers, and fibronexus junctions (3.Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar, 47.Singer I.I. Kawka D.W. Kazazis D.M. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 2091-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). After the wound defect has been replaced through a combination of cellular contractile activity and extracellular matrix biosynthesis, the tissue returns to a mechanically unloaded state, and myofibroblast regression occurs through apoptosis (3.Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar). Based on our experiments with fibroblasts in collagen matrices, we speculate that quiescence at the end of wound repair depends on mechanically regulated disruption of the ERK signaling pathway, which leads to cessation of DNA synthesis even in the continued presence of soluble growth factors in the wound environment. We are indebted to Drs. William Snell, Michael White, Ping-Sheng Liu, and David Lee for their helpful comments and suggestions. Confocal microscopic studies were carried out by Meifang Zhu."

We have now investigated the mechanisms responsible for these effects. Preincubation with an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II abolished CsA-induced eNOS up-regulation. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated a 1.6-fold increase in the induction of eNOS gene by CsA. In agreement with these results, transient transfections showed that CsA augmented the transactivation of the eNOS promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed an increase in the activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding activity in BAEC treated with CsA. An increase in the level of c-fos mRNA and in the nuclear content of c-Fos protein was detected in BAEC treated with CsA. Site-directed mutagenesis of the AP-1 cis-regulatory element in the context of the human eNOS promoter resulted in the abrogation of the induction mediated by CsA. Hence, up-regulation ofeNOS mRNA by CsA is a transcriptional phenomenon involving the proximal AP-1 site in the 5′-regulatory region of the human eNOS gene.

The pathogenesis of their appearance has been investigated in clinical studies and animal models, but a complete understanding is still elusive. The partial reversibility of these effects suggests that the underlying disturbance has a functional component. Acute nephrotoxicity is associated with renal vasoconstriction and a reduced glomerular filtration rate. A significant amount of data support that the vasoconstrictor peptide, endothelin-1, is involved in this response (1.Bunchman T.E. Brookshire C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 2.Kon V. Sugiura M. Inagami T. Harvie B.R. Ichikawa I. Hoover R.L. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 1487-1491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) has been proposed as a link between CsA-enhanced endothelin synthesis and many of the pathological fibrotic lesions observed with chronic CsA toxicity (3.Hutchinson I.V. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although endothelin and other paracrine vasoconstrictors have been identified as mediators of the hypertensive response (1.Bunchman T.E. Brookshire C.A. J. Clin.

Several reports have described that there is a defect in the relaxation of blood vessels in response to endothelial agonists, but the precise step of diminished NO synthesis, enhanced degradation, or receptor abnormality has not been established (6.Rego A.

In previous work, using endothelial cells in culture treated with CsA, we found that NO synthesis is not only not reduced but moderately enhanced (9.López-Ongil S. Saura M. Rodrı́guez-Puyol D. Rodrı́guez-Puyol M. Lamas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1072-H1078PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have been also confirmed in rats (10.Bobadilla N.A. Gamba G. Tapia E. Garcı́a-Torres R. Bolio A. López-Zetina P. Herrera-Acosta J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F791-F798PubMed Google Scholar), in healthy volunteers, in whom venous antecubital infusion of CsA significantly decreased forearm blood flow (11.Stroes E.S. Luscher T.F. de Groot F.G. Koomans H.A. Rabelink T.J. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and recently in patients treated with CsA after heart transplantation (12.Bracht C. Yan X.W. LaRocca H.P. Sutsch G. Kiowski W. J. Hypertens. 1999; 17: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These data indicate that nitric oxide may constitute an important regulatory mechanism that protects against CsA-associated vasoconstriction in vivo. In support of this hypothesis we found that the expression of the eNOS gene is increased in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) treated with CsA (12.Bracht C. Yan X.W. LaRocca H.P. Sutsch G.

BAEC were isolated from thoracic aortas using previously described methods (15.Marsden P.A. Brock T.A. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1295-F1303PubMed Google Scholar). Phenotype characterization was based on their typical cobblestone appearance and uniform uptake of fluorescent acetylated low density lipoprotein. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Experiments were performed on confluent monolayers (unless for transfection assays) at passages 3–6 and were made quiescent by serum deprivation. Specifically, cells were kept in serum-free medium for 24 h before starting the procedure and during incubations. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained and cultured as described elsewhere (16.Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. Gómez del Arco P. Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The following reagents were obtained from the indicated sources: cell culture media, calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Bio-Whittaker (Servier, Belgium); cell culture plates were from Falcon (Beckton Dickinson, France); the Plasmid Maxi kit purification system was from Qiagen (Germany); restriction endonucleases, Tfx-50 reagent, Dual-LuciferaseTM Reporter assay system, and pGL3 basic plasmid were from Promega (Madison, WI); Opti-minimum Eagle's medium and T4 DNA ligase were from Life Technologies, Inc; Klenow enzyme,Taq DNA polymerase, and TaqextenderTM polymerase chain reaction (PCR) additive were from Stratagene (Cupertino, CA). Deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate, [α-32P]- (3000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]UTP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; X-OMAT S x-ray film was from Eastman Kodak Co. Cyclosporine A was a gift from Dr. D. Rodrı́guez-Puyol (Madrid, Spain). Reagents for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) have been described elsewhere (14.López-Ongil S. Hernández-Perera O. Navarro-Antolı́n J. Pérez de Lema G.

(Santa Cruz, CA); phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. A fragment corresponding to the 5′-flanking regulatory region of the human eNOS gene at nucleotide positions from −1910 to +48 designated 1.9peNOS was obtained by PCR, including Taq extenderTM PCR additive, using a human genomic clone (17.Robinson L.J. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Michel T. Genomics. 1994; 19: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) as template. Primers were: upper, 5′-GGGGTACCTCACCTGAGGCTAGGAGT-3′ and lower, 5′-CCGGTACCTGGGCCACGCTCTTCAAG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into theKpnI site of the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic and sequenced to confirm correct orientation. Constructs with progressive deletions of the 5′-region at nucleotide positions from −1514 to +22, −728 to +22, and −314 to +22, designated 1.5peNOS, 0.7peNOS, and 0.3peNOS, respectively, were derived from plasmids pUA7, pUA8, and pUA4 (18.Arnet U.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15069-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and recloned into theKpnI/HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector. To obtain a construct of the human eNOS promoter with a mutation of the proximal AP-1 cis-regulatory element (positions −662 to −656), site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the 1.5peNOS plasmid as a template. A primer derived from the sequence of pGL3-Basic vector (RVprimer3, Promega) and the primer ΔAP-1 antisense (5′-CCCCATAGATCTAGTGGGGG-3′; mutated positions −662, −659, −658, and −657 are underlined, these mutations created a BglII site) were used to generate the upstream PCR fragment. Primers ΔAP-1 sense (5′-CCACTAGATCTATGGGGGTG-3′, complementary of ΔAP-1 antisense) and GLprimer2 (from pGL3-Basic) antisense were used to generate the downstream PCR fragment. After appropriate restriction enzyme digestions, the PCR fragments were ligated into theKpnI/HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector. This AP-1 mutant construct, named 1.5peNOSAP-1M, was confirmed by sequencing. The luciferase reporter plasmids containing AP-1-driven (-73pColLuc) and AP-1-unresponsive (-60pColLuc) promoters of the human collagenase gene have been described elsewhere (19.Deng T. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). AHindIII-BamHI fragment (nucleotide positions −517 to +63) of the 5′-flanking region of the human collagenase gene (20.Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pGL3-Basic and designated -517pColLuc. This construct was sequenced to confirm correct orientation. To standardize Northern and run-on experiments, a 650-base pair PCR fragment of the human GAPDH gene (GenBankTM accession number M33197) was generated by PCR and subcloned into the PCR-Script vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Total RNA was isolated following the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (21.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), UV cross-linked (UV stratalinker 1800 from Cultek, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and hybridized as described previously (22.Marsden P.A. Dorfman D.M. Collins T. Brenner B.M. Orkin S.H. Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F117-F125PubMed Google Scholar). A bovineeNOS cDNA (23.Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession numberM89952) or a murine c-fos cDNA was used as a probe. Blots were washed at final stringency conditions of 42 °C, 1X SSC, 0.5% SDS and exposed on X-OMAT S film, using intensifying screens, at −80 °C. The amount of RNA loaded was estimated by ethidium bromide staining of the ribosomal RNAs. The density of autoradiographic signals or the band intensities of 28 S ribosomal RNA were quantitated with a Studiostar Agfa image scanner using the public domain software package NIH Image 1.55. Levels of mRNA were normalized to GAPDHtranscript levels and expressed in relative densitometric units with respect to control value. For experiments of inhibition of RNA synthesis with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), BAEC were preincubated with 10 μm DRB for 45 min, and then CsA (1 μm final concentration) was added and the incubation continued for 12 h more. Isolation of nuclei (by Dounce homogenization) and the nuclear run-on transcription experiments were performed according to the protocols described elsewhere (24.Greemberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 4.10.11-14.10.15Google Scholar) with minor modifications: 12 μl of 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]UTP were used for each condition, proteinase K incubation was for 40 min, and after hybridization membranes were washed with 2× SSC for 15 min. For transfection experiments BAEC were grown in RPMI, 10% calf serum at 37 °C in 6-well plates. At 90% confluence medium was replaced, and 4 h later the transfection was initiated. Transfection mixtures were as following: (per well) 1.5 μg of plasmid of interest (1.5 μg), 3 ng of a cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid (used for normalization of transfection efficiency), 4.5 μl of Tfx-50, and 1 ml of Opti-minimum Eagle's medium. Mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with serum-free RPMI and incubated with transfection mixtures for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed again and maintained in RPMI with 10% calf serum for 24 h. Then fresh medium devoid of serum was added, and the incubation was continued for another 24 h. Following treatment with the specified agents, cells were harvested and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and two freeze/thaw cycles. The extracts were centrifuged for 30 s at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C and then used for assaying of luciferase reporters following the Dual-LuciferaseTMReporter Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by cotransfection of a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven Renilla luciferase gene plasmid and indicated as Firefly/Renilla luminescence ratio. Triplicates of each condition for the indicated number of independent experiments were considered for analysis. For preparation of nuclear extracts, a modification of the method of Schreiber et al. (25.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) was used. At the end of each experimental period, BAEC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, antipain, trypsin inhibitor, and pepstatin A. After 15 min at 4 °C, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. Tubes were vigorously vortexed for 10 s, and nuclei were sedimented for 30 s at 23,000 × g. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors at 1 μg/ml and vigorously rocked at 4 °C for 15 min. They were then centrifuged for 5 min, 23,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were aliquoted at −80 °C. Before use, their protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides were synthesized in a Beckman Oligo 100 M DNA synthesizer. The oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to the AP-1 site in the bovine eNOS promoter was: 5′- GGCCCCCAACTTGAGTCACAGGGGGTG-3′ and 3′-GGGGGTTGAACTCAGTGTCCCCCACGG-5′. Equal molar amounts of each oligonucleotide were mixed and annealed by incubation for 5 min at 85 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmspermidine, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmdithiothreitol and slowly cooled down to room temperature. Two hundred nanograms were end-labeled using Klenow DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 20 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. For binding reactions, approximately 6000 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide probes were incubated with 7 μg of nuclear extract and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 30 min. Where indicated c-Jun or IgG antibodies were added. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis, in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × Tris-borate EDTA buffer at 20 mA, and visualized by autoradiography. For competition experiments 125-fold molar excess of competitor DNA was coincubated with the labeled oligonucleotide probe. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, 15 μg/lane of total nuclear protein extract were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes using a semidry electroblotting system (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with 1:500 mouse monoclonal c-Fos antibody, and the c-Fos protein was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unless otherwise specified, data are expressed as means ± S.E. with the number (n) of experiments in parenthesis. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student'st test in the case of normal distribution of data or using nonparametric tests as appropriate.

Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), is consistent with a low transcriptional rate of theeNOS gene in basal conditions. Thus, the relatively early increase (at 4 h) of the eNOS mRNA levels upon incubation with CsA (9.López-Ongil S. Saura M. Rodrı́guez-Puyol D. Rodrı́guez-Puyol M. Lamas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1072-H1078PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that this immunosuppressant could be affecting the transcriptional rate of eNOS, rather than its mRNA stability. To confirm this, we first evaluated whether the inhibition of RNA synthesis was able to abrogate the CsA-induced increase in eNOS mRNA levels. To this end, we used a long half-life RNA polymerase II inhibitor, DRB. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, in BAEC, the CsA-dependent up-regulation of theeNOS transcript was significantly reduced by DRB (CsA: 73.9 ± 0.9; control: 7 ± 6, 8% of reduction;n = 3, p < 0.05). Further nuclear run-on experiments showed that CsA induction of the eNOSmRNA occurred at the transcriptional level. Nuclei from CsA-treated BAEC showed an enhanced rate of eNOS mRNA synthesis (161.3 ± 5.2% of control; n = 3,p < 0.05) (Fig. 2,A and B). This provides direct evidence for transcriptional activation of the eNOS gene by CsA.Figure 2Effect of CsA on the transcription rate of the eNOS gene in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. A, nuclear run-on analysis of transcription rates of eNOS and GAPDH genes in BAEC treated with vehicle (Control) or 1 μm CsA for 16 h. B, densitometric analysis of the autoradiograph shown in A. Intensities of GAPDH bands were assigned an arbitrary densitometric unit of 100. This graph shows a 1.7-fold increase of the eNOS band intensity in the blot hybridized with RNA synthesized by nuclei isolated from CsA-treated BAEC. In two additional experiments 1.5- and 1.6-fold increases were observed. pBS, pBluescript plasmid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the promoter region of theeNOS gene was responsive to the stimulatory effect of CsA, a 1.9-kilobase fragment of the 5′-regulatory region of the humaneNOS gene was transiently transfected into BAEC. A 2-fold increase (200.7% ± 13.8 of vehicle; n = 5,p < 0.05) of the promoter activity was detected after a 24-h treatment with 1 μm CsA (Fig.3). To further delineate which region of the promoter could be responsible for this induction, we transfected a series of 5′-deletion mutants of the 1.9-kb fragment of the humaneNOS gene and treated the transfected cells with 1 μm CsA or vehicle alone. As shown in Fig. 3, the degree of inducibility by CsA correlated positively with the length of the transfected construct (a 1.7-, 1.4- and 1.1-fold increase with the 1.5-, 0.7-, and 0.3-kb constructs, respectively) (170 ± 14.7, 137.8 ± 8.1, and 108.7 ± 12.7% of vehicle, respectively;n = 5, p < 0.05 for the 1.5- and 0.7-kb constructs). Similarly, transfections of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with the 1.9-, 1.5-, and 0.3-kb constructs showed comparable results (202%, 154%, and 123% of vehicle, respectively). Therefore, a unique specific region responsible for this inducibility is not immediately apparent. We had previously observed that the expression of the eNOS mRNA is a redox-sensitive process. Three reactive oxygen species-generating systems, glucose oxidase, hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase, and CsA, have been shown to increase the abundance of the eNOS transcript in BAEC. This process was abolished by catalase and horseradish peroxidase. In addition, we have observed that pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, an agent with a known capacity to increase AP-1 activity (27.Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28.Gómez del Arco P. Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Calvo V. Armesilla A.L. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26335-26340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and PMA (data not shown) were able to increaseeNOS mRNA levels in BAEC (14.López-Ongil S. Hernández-Perera O. Navarro-Antolı́n J. Pérez de Lema G. Rodrı́guez-Puyol M. Lamas S. Rodrı́guez-Puyol D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In view of these results and taking into account that both human (−1532 and −662) and bovine (−442) eNOS promoters include putative AP-1 sites, we analyzed the DNA binding activity of AP-1-related proteins to the AP-1 site of the bovine eNOS promoter. We carried out EMSA with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, which contained the −442 AP-1 site of the eNOS bovine promoter, and nuclear extracts of BAEC treated with CsA or vehicle. An increase in a retarded predominant band was observed in extracts of cells treated with 1 μm CsA (Fig.4 A) with a maximal binding activity at 60 min. This band was competed out by a 125-fold molar excess of the same nonlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide, thus suggesting the specificity of an AP-1-related complex. Furthermore, the addition of an antibody directed against the DNA binding domain of the c-Jun subunit of AP-1 resulted in a marked reduction of the binding in the EMSA (Fig.4 B). Incubation with an unrelated antibody (IgG) was not associated with any competition of the CsA-mediated binding of AP-1 to DNA. An increased stability of the AP-1 dimers results in higher levels of AP-1 DNA binding activity. As an increased synthesis of c-Fos and its translocation to the nucleus to combine with pre-existing Jun protein forms AP-1 dimers that are more stable than those formed by Jun protein alone, we investigated the potential effect of CsA on the expression of c-fos gene and on the nuclear content of c-Fos in BAEC. As shown in Fig.5, A and B an increase in c-Fos mRNA was detected, with a peak at 30–60 min, in BAEC treated with 1 μm CsA. An enhanced detection of c-Fos in nuclear protein extracts of BAEC treated for 30 or 60 min with 1 μm CsA was observed (192 ± 36 and 239 ± 73% of control, respectively; n = 3) (Fig.5 C). To assess if the increase on the AP-1 binding activity observed in CsA-treated BAEC correlated with an increase in the AP-1-dependent transcription, we transfected BAEC with an AP-1-driven luciferase gene construct (−73pColLuc) (containing one AP-1 site). The transcriptional response of this construct to 1 μm CsA for 24 h was compared with that of a similar construct lacking the AP-1 site, −60pColLuc. BAEC transfected in parallel with the same constructs were treated with 100 nmPMA for 24 h as a positive control. As shown in Fig.6, both PMA and to a lesser extent CsA augmented the promoter activity of −73pColLuc (percentage of vehicle: 238% ± 7 and 150% ± 18, respectively). In transfections with a full promoter of the collagenase gene, containing this AP-1 site and 517 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site, similar results were obtained with CsA and PMA (194.8% ± 18.4 and 152.8% ± 16.1 of increase over control, respectively), and an increase of 232% was observed with 100 μm pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (data not shown). Neither CsA nor PMA had an effect on the activity of the −60pColLuc construct. To evaluate the functional contribution of the AP-1 site to the CsA-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of eNOS, we generated a mutant version of the human eNOS promoter in which the proximal AP-1 site was modified by substituting four of the seven nucleotides of the AP-1 sequence in the context of the wild type 1.5-kb construct. As shown in Fig. 7, BAEC transiently transfected with this construct no longer responded to CsA treatment (wild type: 138% ± 8.7; AP-1M: 89% ± 7.4 of vehicle;n = 4, p < 0.05), and its induction by PMA was markedly diminished (wild type: 172.3% ± 11; AP-1M: 123.3% ± 10.6 of vehicle; n = 4, p < 0.05). Altogether these results suggest that this AP-1 site within the humaneNOS promoter is important in order to elicit an inductive response by CsA and PMA. The regulation of NO synthesis in endothelial cells involves a complex pathway starting with the coupling of agonists to their receptors and ending in coordinated post-translational changes ofeNOS, which allow initiation, development, and termination of its catalytic function. Accumulated evidence suggests that the endothelial content of eNOS enzyme is also subject to modest degrees of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, which may have important physiological and pathophysiological implications. These add other points for the control of NO production (29.Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 30.Forstermann U. Boissel J.P. Kleinert H. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Studies in cultured cells and in vivo models indicate that the expression of the eNOS gene is regulated at the transcriptional level by several stimuli, including shear stress (31.Nishida K.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this family is distinct from that of the PTR family, a ubiquitous group of proton-coupled transporters which selectively transports di- and tripeptides (3.Steiner H.-Y. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4.Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the OPT family is also distinct from the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), a diverse collection of proteins which catalyzes the transport of a wide variety of substrates, including sugars, amino acids, neurotransmitters, and drugs (5.Saier M.H. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 81-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Members of the OPT family have been identified and characterized in the yeasts Candida albicans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Additional members exist in plants, as indicated by searches of publicly accessible data bases. In mammalian tissues, reports in the literature suggest that the enkephalins, endogenous pentapeptides involved in analgesia in the central nervous system, are transported across the blood-brain barrier by a specific, saturable transport system (6.Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of enkephalin transporters has been inferred from data obtained by measuring whole brain flux of the peptides in rodents (7.Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Alcohol. 1997; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8.Plotkin S.R. Banks W.A. Waguespack P.J. Kastin A.J J. Neurosci.

Sci. 1998; 87: 1433-1439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To date, no protein has been identified in eukaryotes as the discrete enkephalin carrier.In this paper, we report that the endogenous opioids Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin, pentapeptides of amino acid sequence YGGFM and YGGFL, respectively, can be transported by cells expressing the S. cerevisiae ORF YJL212C. When expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter in a high copy number vector, this OPT family member is necessary and sufficient to transport Leu-enkephalin into yeast cells. This is the first example of a genetically defined eukaryotic transport protein which can transport enkephalins across the cell membrane. In accordance with the standard nomenclature forS. cerevisiae, we propose the name OPT1 for this gene.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we assign a function to the previously unknown open reading frame YJL212C in the yeast S. cerevisiae and have named this gene OPT1. The protein encoded by OPT1consists of 799 amino acids, and based on the amino acid sequence the predicted protein structure suggests an integral membrane protein containing 12–14 putative membrane-spanning domains. In addition, the protein contains several motifs unique to the OPT family, the largest of which consists of 10 invariable residues (SPYXEVRXXVXXXDDP) located before the first hydrophobic domain (2.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study we have confirmed thatOPT1, like other members of the OPT family, encodes a functional oligopeptide transporter.Because Opt1p exhibited all the molecular characteristics of an OPT family member, it was hypothesized that this protein was an oligopeptide transporter, even though it was known that S. cerevisiae could not utilize any tetra- or pentapeptides tested to date to satisfy auxotrophic requirements under routine growth conditions (1.Lubkowitz M.A. Hauser L. Breslav M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19.Becker J.M. Naider F. Taylor M.D. Amidon G.L. Peptide-based Drug Design: Controlling Transport and Metabolism. American Chemical Society, Washington D. C.1995: 369-384Google Scholar). To see activity of Opt1, it was necessary to express OPT1 under the control of the ADH promoter, a strong, constitutive promoter which would presumably result in high expression of the gene product. In prior studies, Northern blot analysis confirmed that OPT1 was not expressed at detectable levels under routine conditions of logarithmic growth (2.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results were independently confirmed by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (20.Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Zhou W. Vogelstein J. Basrai M.A. Bassett Jr., D.E. Heiter P. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) which revealed that OPT1 is only expressed at a low level (∼1 copy per cell) following nocodazole arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Additional analysis of sporulating yeast cells by DNA microarray analysis indicated that OPT1 was expressed during the late stages of sporulation (21.Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, OPT1 gene expression had to be ectopically induced under the control of a heterologous promoter to enable study of Opt1p function in log phase cells.The product of OPT1 is the oligopeptide transporter Opt1p, which translocates pentapeptides, including both Met- and Leu-enkephalin. In BY4730, a strain of S. cerevisiaeauxotrophic for leucine and methionine, only cells expressingOPT1 could grow on Leu-enkephalin in the absence of exogenous leucine. This indicates that enkephalins are transported intact into the cell and then hydrolyzed. If oligopeptides were hydrolyzed by an extracellular protease prior to transport, then the isogenic control strain (BY4730 transformed with the empty vector pDB20), as well as yeast cells transformed with plasmids encoding other OPT family members (CaOPT1, YPR194C) should be able to utilize the hydrolysis products for growth. Chromatographic analysis supports this postulate; no evidence for degraded forms of Leu-enkephalin could be found in the extracellular medium. In addition, a large body of work exists which demonstrates that di- and tripeptides enter the cell intact and are then rapidly hydrolyzed by intracellular peptidases (19.Becker J.M. Naider F. Taylor M.D. Amidon G.L. Peptide-based Drug Design: Controlling Transport and Metabolism. American Chemical Society, Washington D. C.1995: 369-384Google Scholar).Transport of Leu-enkephalin is pH- and temperature-dependent, suggesting that this is a proton-coupled, energy-dependent process. These observations are supported by the sensitivity of the transporter to agents which disrupt the proton gradient or deplete intracellular ATP. Utilization of the transmembrane proton gradient to energize active transport has been demonstrated for the PTR family of di- and tripeptide transporters (4.Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Uptake of radiolabeled Leu-enkephalin was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled Met- or Leu-enkephalin; amidated Leu-enkephalin was an ineffective competitor. Tyr-MIF-1 is an amidated tetrapeptide with opiate and anti-opiate activity. This peptide is a substrate for the previously described blood-brain barrier PTS-1 enkephalin transport activity (6.Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar) but, like the amidated form of authentic Leu-enkephalin, was not an effective competitor for yeast Opt1p. This observation is consistent with the need for a free carboxyl terminus for substrate recognition by Opt1p. Tetrapeptides were effective inhibitors, with Lys-Leu-Gly-Leu and des-Tyr1 Leu-enkephalin (Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu) eliminating over 50% of radiolabeled enkephalin accumulation, suggesting that an amino-terminal tyrosine is not essential for substrate recognition. Neither the tripeptide enkephalin fragment Gly-Gly-Phe nor the dipeptide Leu-Leu could inhibit uptake, indicating that this system is distinct from Ptr2p and is selective for tetra- and pentapeptides. These data suggest that intact oligopeptides are gaining access to the cell via a carrier-mediated process and that the discrete carrier is the gene product of OPT1. If enkephalins were entering by a nonspecific mechanism such as simple diffusion or endocytosis, then all strains, not just those expressingOPT1, should be able to utilize this substrate.Several enkephalin antagonists were assayed in this study for their effect on enkephalin transport across Opt1p. DADLE and DPDPE are enzymatically stable delta opioid receptor antagonists that are pentapeptide mimetics. Previous reports indicated that DPDPE gained access to the brain by a saturable, carrier-mediated mechanism in the blood-brain barrier, which has yet to be defined (22.Thomas S.A. Abbruscato T.J. Hruby V.J. Davis T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1235-1240PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Williams S.A. Abbruscato T.J. Hruby V.J. Davis T.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transport of DPDPE was not inhibited by Leu-enkephalin in those studies, suggesting either the existence of separate transport systems or a common system with different affinities for these two substrates. A recent report suggests that DPDPE crosses the blood-brain barrier by a phenylarsine oxide-sensitive pathway, suggesting a role for a saturable endocytic mechanism in the in vitro andin situ models studied (24.Egleton R.D. Davis T.P. J. Pharm. Sci. 1999; 88: 392-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, DPDPE and DADLE were weak competitors for Leu-enkephalin transport, indicating that Opt1p interacts with the stable antagonists with differential affinities compared with authentic Leu-enkephalin.Naloxone and naltrexone are synthetic opioid receptor antagonists classically used to reverse the effects of opiate overdose (18.McNicholas L.F. Martin W.R. Drugs. 1984; 27: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Naltrexone is also used clinically in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the fact that these compounds are similar in structure to morphine, rather than resembling a peptide, they were effective competitors for Leu-enkephalin transport. The effect appears to be specific for the Opt1p transporter because the presence of the morphine analogs did not influence the activity of the unrelated di- and tripeptide transporter Ptr2p. The nature of the inhibition of Leu-enkephalin transport by naloxone and naltrexone is currently under investigation. Specifically, it would be of interest to determine whether these compounds are substrates for transport or are nonsubstrate competitors for Opt1p.There is increasing evidence that opioids and their analogues enter the central nervous system by carrier-mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier (6.Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Thomas S.A. Abbruscato T.J. Hruby V.J. Davis T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

A. 1997; 94: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence also exists to suggest that the clearance of the enkephalin analogue DPDPE occurs by saturable efflux from the brain and systemic elimination of intact DPDPE via biliary excretion (26.Chen C. Pollack G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1151-1159PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is possible that neuronal re-uptake systems exist for enkephalin similar to the well studied transport systems for neurotransmitters such as serotonin and γ-aminobutyric acid (27.Blakely R.D. Ramamoorthy S. Schroeter S. Qian Y. Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Biol. Psychiatry. 1998; 44: 169-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28.Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). To date, none of the putative transporters for enkephalin have been cloned or characterized at a molecular level. In this report, we present the first evidence for a genetically defined eukaryotic transport protein, Opt1p, which recognizes and translocates both Met- and Leu-enkephalin into an intact eukaryotic cell. The identification of this transporter inSaccharomyces may facilitate the discovery of mammalian homologues, thus providing greater insight into the process of pain and its mediation. Small peptides containing four to five amino acid residues are transported by a recently identified class of peptide transporters named the OPT1 family (1.Lubkowitz M.A. Hauser L. Breslav M.

Sci. 1998; 87: 1433-1439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To date, no protein has been identified in eukaryotes as the discrete enkephalin carrier. In this paper, we report that the endogenous opioids Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin, pentapeptides of amino acid sequence YGGFM and YGGFL, respectively, can be transported by cells expressing the S. cerevisiae ORF YJL212C. When expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter in a high copy number vector, this OPT family member is necessary and sufficient to transport Leu-enkephalin into yeast cells. This is the first example of a genetically defined eukaryotic transport protein which can transport enkephalins across the cell membrane. In accordance with the standard nomenclature forS. cerevisiae, we propose the name OPT1 for this gene. DISCUSSIONIn this paper we assign a function to the previously unknown open reading frame YJL212C in the yeast S. cerevisiae and have named this gene OPT1. The protein encoded by OPT1consists of 799 amino acids, and based on the amino acid sequence the predicted protein structure suggests an integral membrane protein containing 12–14 putative membrane-spanning domains. In addition, the protein contains several motifs unique to the OPT family, the largest of which consists of 10 invariable residues (SPYXEVRXXVXXXDDP) located before the first hydrophobic domain (2.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study we have confirmed thatOPT1, like other members of the OPT family, encodes a functional oligopeptide transporter.Because Opt1p exhibited all the molecular characteristics of an OPT family member, it was hypothesized that this protein was an oligopeptide transporter, even though it was known that S. cerevisiae could not utilize any tetra- or pentapeptides tested to date to satisfy auxotrophic requirements under routine growth conditions (1.Lubkowitz M.A. Hauser L. Breslav M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19.Becker J.M. Naider F. Taylor M.D. Amidon G.L. Peptide-based Drug Design: Controlling Transport and Metabolism. American Chemical Society, Washington D. C.1995: 369-384Google Scholar). To see activity of Opt1, it was necessary to express OPT1 under the control of the ADH promoter, a strong, constitutive promoter which would presumably result in high expression of the gene product. In prior studies, Northern blot analysis confirmed that OPT1 was not expressed at detectable levels under routine conditions of logarithmic growth (2.Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results were independently confirmed by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (20.Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Zhou W. Vogelstein J. Basrai M.A. Bassett Jr., D.E. Heiter P. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) which revealed that OPT1 is only expressed at a low level (∼1 copy per cell) following nocodazole arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Additional analysis of sporulating yeast cells by DNA microarray analysis indicated that OPT1 was expressed during the late stages of sporulation (21.Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, OPT1 gene expression had to be ectopically induced under the control of a heterologous promoter to enable study of Opt1p function in log phase cells.The product of OPT1 is the oligopeptide transporter Opt1p, which translocates pentapeptides, including both Met- and Leu-enkephalin. In BY4730, a strain of S. cerevisiaeauxotrophic for leucine and methionine, only cells expressingOPT1 could grow on Leu-enkephalin in the absence of exogenous leucine. This indicates that enkephalins are transported intact into the cell and then hydrolyzed. If oligopeptides were hydrolyzed by an extracellular protease prior to transport, then the isogenic control strain (BY4730 transformed with the empty vector pDB20), as well as yeast cells transformed with plasmids encoding other OPT family members (CaOPT1, YPR194C) should be able to utilize the hydrolysis products for growth. Chromatographic analysis supports this postulate; no evidence for degraded forms of Leu-enkephalin could be found in the extracellular medium. In addition, a large body of work exists which demonstrates that di- and tripeptides enter the cell intact and are then rapidly hydrolyzed by intracellular peptidases (19.Becker J.M. Naider F. Taylor M.D. Amidon G.L. Peptide-based Drug Design: Controlling Transport and Metabolism. American Chemical Society, Washington D. C.1995: 369-384Google Scholar).Transport of Leu-enkephalin is pH- and temperature-dependent, suggesting that this is a proton-coupled, energy-dependent process. These observations are supported by the sensitivity of the transporter to agents which disrupt the proton gradient or deplete intracellular ATP. Utilization of the transmembrane proton gradient to energize active transport has been demonstrated for the PTR family of di- and tripeptide transporters (4.Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Uptake of radiolabeled Leu-enkephalin was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled Met- or Leu-enkephalin; amidated Leu-enkephalin was an ineffective competitor. Tyr-MIF-1 is an amidated tetrapeptide with opiate and anti-opiate activity. This peptide is a substrate for the previously described blood-brain barrier PTS-1 enkephalin transport activity (6.Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar) but, like the amidated form of authentic Leu-enkephalin, was not an effective competitor for yeast Opt1p. This observation is consistent with the need for a free carboxyl terminus for substrate recognition by Opt1p. Tetrapeptides were effective inhibitors, with Lys-Leu-Gly-Leu and des-Tyr1 Leu-enkephalin (Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu) eliminating over 50% of radiolabeled enkephalin accumulation, suggesting that an amino-terminal tyrosine is not essential for substrate recognition. Neither the tripeptide enkephalin fragment Gly-Gly-Phe nor the dipeptide Leu-Leu could inhibit uptake, indicating that this system is distinct from Ptr2p and is selective for tetra- and pentapeptides. These data suggest that intact oligopeptides are gaining access to the cell via a carrier-mediated process and that the discrete carrier is the gene product of OPT1. If enkephalins were entering by a nonspecific mechanism such as simple diffusion or endocytosis, then all strains, not just those expressingOPT1, should be able to utilize this substrate.Several enkephalin antagonists were assayed in this study for their effect on enkephalin transport across Opt1p. DADLE and DPDPE are enzymatically stable delta opioid receptor antagonists that are pentapeptide mimetics. Previous reports indicated that DPDPE gained access to the brain by a saturable, carrier-mediated mechanism in the blood-brain barrier, which has yet to be defined (22.Thomas S.A. Abbruscato T.J. Hruby V.J. Davis T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1235-1240PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Williams S.A. Abbruscato T.J. Hruby V.J. Davis T.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transport of DPDPE was not inhibited by Leu-enkephalin in those studies, suggesting either the existence of separate transport systems or a common system with different affinities for these two substrates. A recent report suggests that DPDPE crosses the blood-brain barrier by a phenylarsine oxide-sensitive pathway, suggesting a role for a saturable endocytic mechanism in the in vitro andin situ models studied (24.Egleton R.D. Davis T.P. J. Pharm. Sci. 1999; 88: 392-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, DPDPE and DADLE were weak competitors for Leu-enkephalin transport, indicating that Opt1p interacts with the stable antagonists with differential affinities compared with authentic Leu-enkephalin.Naloxone and naltrexone are synthetic opioid receptor antagonists classically used to reverse the effects of opiate overdose (18.McNicholas L.F. Martin W.R. Drugs. 1984; 27: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Naltrexone is also used clinically in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the fact that these compounds are similar in structure to morphine, rather than resembling a peptide, they were effective competitors for Leu-enkephalin transport. The effect appears to be specific for the Opt1p transporter because the presence of the morphine analogs did not influence the activity of the unrelated di- and tripeptide transporter Ptr2p. The nature of the inhibition of Leu-enkephalin transport by naloxone and naltrexone is currently under investigation. Specifically, it would be of interest to determine whether these compounds are substrates for transport or are nonsubstrate competitors for Opt1p.There is increasing evidence that opioids and their analogues enter the central nervous system by carrier-mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier (6.Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Thomas S.A. Abbruscato T.J. Hruby V.J. Davis T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

A. 1997; 94: 9469-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence also exists to suggest that the clearance of the enkephalin analogue DPDPE occurs by saturable efflux from the brain and systemic elimination of intact DPDPE via biliary excretion (26.Chen C. Pollack G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1151-1159PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is possible that neuronal re-uptake systems exist for enkephalin similar to the well studied transport systems for neurotransmitters such as serotonin and γ-aminobutyric acid (27.Blakely R.D. Ramamoorthy S. Schroeter S. Qian Y. Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Biol. Psychiatry. 1998; 44: 169-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28.Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). To date, none of the putative transporters for enkephalin have been cloned or characterized at a molecular level. In this report, we present the first evidence for a genetically defined eukaryotic transport protein, Opt1p, which recognizes and translocates both Met- and Leu-enkephalin into an intact eukaryotic cell. The identification of this transporter inSaccharomyces may facilitate the discovery of mammalian homologues, thus providing greater insight into the process of pain and its mediation.

Sequence analysis of this DNA region, located between four mithramycin glycosyltransferase genes, showed the presence of two genes (mtmMI and mtmMII) whose deduced products resembled S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases. By independent insertional inactivation of both genes nonproducing mutants were generated that accumulated different mithramycin biosynthetic intermediates. The M3ΔMI mutant (mtmMI-minus mutant) accumulated 4-demethylpremithramycinone (4-DPMC) which lacks the methyl groups at carbons 4 and 9. The M3ΔM2 (mtmMII-minus mutant) accumulated 9-demethylpremithramycin A3 (9-DPMA3), premithramycin A1 (PMA1), and 7-demethylmithramycin, all of them containing theO-methyl group at C-4 and C-1′, respectively, but lacking the methyl group at the aromatic position. Both genes were expressed inStreptomyces lividans TK21 under the control of the erythromycin resistance promoter (ermEp) ofSaccharopolyspora erythraea. Cell-free extracts of these clones were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (90% saturation) and assayed for methylation activity using different mithramycin intermediates as substrates.

These results demonstrate that themtmMI and mtmMII genes code for twoS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases responsible for the 4-O-methylation and 9-C-methylation steps of the biosynthetic precursors 4-DPMC and 9-DPMA3, respectively, of the antitumor drug mithramycin.

Many of these bioactive drugs contain methyl groups in their structures, which are introduced during biosynthesis. However, not all these methylations are due to the action of methyltransferases. In the case of the polyketides, some of these methyl groups derive from the carboxylic acids used as starter or extender units during the condensation reactions (1.Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 191-235Google Scholar) and also finds use for control of hypercalcemia in patients with malignant disease (14.Dewick P.M. Medicinal Natural Products: A Biosynthetic Approach. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, New York1997: 85Google Scholar). Mithramycin, together with the chromomycins, olivomycins, chromocyclomycin, and UCH9, constitutes the aureolic acid group of antibiotics. All they belong to the large and important family of the aromatic polyketides. Great progress has been made in the last few years on the understanding of the mithramycin biosynthetic pathway. It has been shown that the biosynthesis of the mithramycin aglycon derives from the condensation of 10 acetate units in a series of reactions catalyzed by a type II polyketide synthase thus generating a decaketide (15.Blanco G. Fu H. Méndez C. Khosla C. Salas J.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 193-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After several aromatizations and cyclizations two nonglycosylated intermediates are synthesized, 4-demethylpremithramycinone (4-DPMC)1 and premithramycinone (PMC) (16.Lombó F. Blanco G. Fernández E. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17.Rohr J. Weißbach U. Beninga C. Künzel E. Siems K. Bindseil K. Prado L. Lombó F. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Chem. Commun. 1998; 1998: 437-438Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This last compound is later glycosylated with (in this order) a trisaccharide (d-olivose-d-oliose and d-mycarose) and a disaccharide (d-olivose-d-olivose) (18.Fernández E. Weißbach U. Sánchez Reillo C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19.Rohr J. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 41-54Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, as one of the last events in mithramycin biosynthesis, an oxidative breakage (followed by a keto reduction) of the fourth ring of the fully glycosylated intermediate premithramycin B takes place generating the final mithramycin molecule (20.Prado L. Fernández E. Weißbach U. Blanco G. Quirós L.M. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 19-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structure of mithramycin bears nine methyl groups. C-5′, which is derived from the acetate starter unit, the O-methyl group at C-1′-O and the methyl side chain at C-7 of the polyketide-derived aglycon moiety. Furthermore, five methyl groups (always C-6 of each deoxysugar unit) are derived from the dehydration step affecting C-4 and C-6 of the corresponding sugars during an early step in the deoxysugar biosynthesis). Finally, another methyl side chain is attached at C-3 of the d-mycarose, the third sugar of the trisaccharide chain. Here we report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of two genes (mtmMI and mtmMII) encoding twoS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases. Insertional inactivation of both genes and in vitromethylation assays demonstrated that the MtmMI and MtmMII methyltransferases are responsible for introduction of methyl groups at C-1′-O and C-7, respectively, of the polyketide moiety of mithramycin by Streptomyces argillaceus. These studies have allowed the identification of the possible substrates for the two methyltransferases and to propose a pathway for the methylation steps in mithramycin biosynthesis. Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12596, mithramycin producer, was used as donor of chromosomal DNA. For sporulation on solid medium, it was grown at 30 °C on plates containing A medium (21.Fernández E. Lombó F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 692-698PubMed Google Scholar). For growth in liquid medium, the organisms were grown either on TSB medium (trypticase soya broth, Oxoid) or R5A medium (18.Fernández E. Weißbach U. Sánchez Reillo C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Streptomyces lividans TK21 was used as host for gene expression. When plasmid-containing clones were grown, the medium was supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics: 5 or 50 μg/ml thiostrepton for liquid or solid cultures, respectively, 100 μg/ml for ampicillin, 25 μg/ml apramycin, or 20 μg/ml tobramycin.Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (22.Bullock W.O.

Plasmid DNA preparations, restriction endonuclease digestions, alkaline phosphatase treatments, DNA ligations, and other DNA manipulations were performed according to standard techniques forE. coli (26.Sambrook J.

Sequencing was performed on double-stranded DNA templates by using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (28.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) and the Cy5 AutoCycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both DNA strands were sequenced with primers supplied in the kits or with internal oligoprimers (17-mer) using an ALF-express automatic DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Computer-aided data base searching and sequence analyses were carried out using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group programs package (UWGCG; Ref. 29.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) and the BLAST program (30.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The mtmMI and mtmMII genes were inactivated by gene replacement as follows. A 3.4-kb BamHI-SphI fragment (sites 6–13 in Fig. 1 B) was subcloned into the same sites of pUC18. The internal 0.5-kb PstI fragment (sites 10 to 11 in Fig. 1 B) to mtmMI was then deleted byPstI digestion and replaced by a 1.5-kb PstI fragment from pEFBA containing an apramycin resistance cassette. The insert in this construct was rescued byEcoRI-HindIII digestion (these restriction sites from the pUC polylinker) and subcloned into the sames of pBSKT, generating pMFMI-1. This construct was used to transform S. argillaceus protoplasts and one apramycin-resistant transformant was isolated being also thiostrepton-resistant and therefore the consequence of a single crossover. Spores from this clone were used to inoculate TSB liquid medium without any antibiotic and, after incubation at 30 °C for 72 h, protoplasts were prepared, diluted onto P medium (27.Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, England1985Google Scholar), and plated onto R5 agar plates containing apramycin (25 μg/ml). Surviving colonies were tested for thiostrepton sensitivity and two colonies were found to be thiostrepton-sensitive as a result of a second crossover. One of them, M3ΔMI, was chosen fo further studies. A 2.2-kb BamHI-PstI fragment (sites 6 to 10 in Fig. 1 B) was subcloned into the same sites of pUC18. Then, an internal 0.3-kb SalI fragment (sites 7 to 8 in Fig. 1 B) in mtmMII was deleted bySalI digestion, followed by end filling with Klenow polymerase and then replaced by a 1.5-kbSmaI-EcoRV fragment containing the apramycin resistance cassette. Finally and to incorporate a second antibiotic resistance marker into the vector, a 1.4-kb SmaI fragment containing the thiostrepton resistance gene was subcloned into the unique ScaI site of pUC18 located outside the polylinker. This construct (pMFMII-1) was used to transform S. argillaceus protoplasts and two apramycin-resistant transformants were isolated being also thiostrepton-resistant and therefore the consequence of a single crossover. The occurrence of a second crossover was forced by cultivating one of these clones in TSB medium without antibiotic, as in the case of the M3ΔMI mutant (see above). One apramycin-resistant thiostrepton-sensitive colony, M3ΔMII, was isolated and further studied. For expression in S. lividans of bothmtmMII and mtmMI genes, a 3.4-kbBamHI-SphI fragment (sites 6 to 13 in Fig.1 B) containing both genes was subcloned into the same restriction sites of pIAG0 generating plasmid pEFM45. For expression ofmtmMII gene, pEFM45 was digested with PstI and then religated generating pMJM2. In this construction, themtmMI gene was inactivated by deleting of the internal 0.5-kb PstI fragment. For expression of mtmMIgene, the gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCTCGATCGAAAGGCACGCGATG-3′ for the 5′-end of the gene and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCAGCCGGGCTTGCGGG-3′ for the 3′-end of the gene (BamHI and HindIII sites, respectively, were included in the oligoprimers to facilitate subcloning and are indicated in bold). The PCR product was subcloned into the BamHI-HindIII sites of pIAGO, generating pMJM1. The two constructs (pMJM1 and pMJM2) were introduced intoS. lividans TK21 by protoplast transformation and transformants selected for thiostrepton resistance (50 μg/ml). PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 100 ng of template DNA were mixed with 30 pmol of each primer and 2 units of Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing 2 mm of each dNTP, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. This reaction mixture was overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil (Sigma). The polymerization reaction was performed in a thermocycler (MinyCycler, MJ Research) under the following conditions: an initial denaturation of 3 min at 98 °C; 30 cycles of 30 s at 98 °C, 1 min at 61.6 °C, and 1.2 min at 72 °C; after the 30 cycles, an extra extension step of 5 min at 72 °C was added. 50 ml of TSB medium were inoculated with a spore suspension of the different S. lividans clones in the presence of 5 μg/ml thiostrepton. After 2 days of incubation at 30 °C, the mycelia was collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA. The mycelia was suspended in a small volume of the same buffer and disrupted by sonication (10 pulses 20 s each with intermittent cooling in a MSE-ultrasonic disintegrator at 150 W and 20 kHz). After removal of unbroken cells and cellular debris by centrifugation, the soluble fraction was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (90% saturation) and after resuspension in a small volume of the buffer mentioned above extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. Methylation reactions consisted of the following components (500 μl final volume): 10 μl ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (1 μCi/ml; specific activity 68 Ci/mmol), 10 μl of the correspondent mithramycin intermediate (0.2 μm final concentration) and a variable volume of extract and buffer (total 500 μl) depending on the protein concentration of the extracts. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reactions were stopped by adding one-tenth of their volume 0.2 n HCl and extracted twice with 500 μl of ethyl acetate. After phase separation, the organic phase was recovered, the solvent evaporated and the residue was suspended in 50 μl of methanol and the samples analyzed by HPLC. Fractions were collected and, after addition of scintillation mixture, the radioactivity in the samples was determined. Detection of mithramycin-related compounds was performed in a reversed phase column (Symmetry C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, Waters), with acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water as solvents. A linear gradient from 10 to 100% acetonitrile in 30 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, was used. Detection and spectral characterization of peaks were made with a photodiode array detector and Millennium software (Waters), extracting bidimensional chromatograms at 280 nm. Spores of mutant M3ΔMII were initially grown in TSB medium during 24 h at 30 °C and 250 rpm. This seed culture was used to inoculate (at 2.5%, v/v) eight 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 400 ml of R5A medium. After incubation for 4 days in the above conditions, the cultures were centrifuged, filtered, and extracted as described (18.Fernández E. Weißbach U. Sánchez Reillo C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mithramycin-related compounds (identified according to their spectral characteristics) were purified by preparative HPLC in a μBondapak C18 radial compression cartridge (PrepPak Cartridge, 25 × 100 mm, Waters). Short gradients using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and either methanol or acetonitrile, at 10 ml/min, were optimized for resolution of individual peaks. The purified material collected in each case was diluted 4-fold with water, applied to a solid-phase extraction column (Lichrolut RP-18, Merck), washed with water to eliminate trifluoroacetic acid, and finally eluted with methanol and dried in vacuo. 1H NMR (400 MHz, acetone-d 6) δ 1.19 (s, 3C-Me), 1.20 (d, 6E-H3, J = 6.0 Hz), 1.22 (d, 5′-H,J = 6.5), 1.24–1.31 (4 d, J = 6, 6A-H3, 6B-H3, 6C-H3, 6D-H3), 1.54 (ddd, 2B-Ha, J = 12, 12, 10), 1.54 (dd, 2E-Ha, J = 13.5, 9.5), 1.60 (ddd, 2C-Ha, J = 12, 12, 10), 1.73 (ddd, 2D-Ha, J = 12, 12, 10), 1.78 (ddd, 2A-Ha, J = 12, 12, 10), 1.88 (dd, 2E-He, J = 13.5, 2), 1.93 (ddd, 2D-He, J = 12, 4.5, 2), 2.16 (ddd, 2B-He, J = 12, 5, 2), 2.38 (ddd, 2A-He, J = 12, 5, 2), 2.54 (ddd, 2C-He, J = 12, 5, 2), 2.64 (dd, 4-He, J = 16, 3), 2.82 (bt, 3-H,J = 12), 2.9–2.95 (complex, 4-Ha), 2.90–3.04 (overlapping signals, 4A-H, 4B-H, 4C-H, 4E-H), 3.30 (dq, 5C-H, J = 9, 6), 3.36 (dq, 5B-H, J = 9, 6), 3.43 (s, 1′-OCH3), 3.48–3.66 (overlapping signals, 3A-H, 3B-H, 3C-H), 3.54 (dq, 5A-H, J = 9, 6), 3.63 (dq, 5E-H, J = 9, 6), 3.71 (m, 5D-H), 3.71 (bs, 4D-H), 3.88 (ddd, 3D-H, J = 12, 5, 3), 4.23 (m, 3′-H, 4′-H), 4.70 (dd, 1D-H, J = 10, 2), 4.71 (dd, 1B-H,J = 10, 2), 4.78 (d, 2-H, J = 11.5), 4.83 (d, 1′-H, J = 1.5), 4.95 (dd, 1E-H,J = 9.5, 2), 5.06 (dd, 1C-H, J = 10, 2), 5.35 (dd, 1A-H, J = 10, 2), 6.44 (d, 7-H,J = 2), 6.76 (d, 5-H, J = 2), 6.87 (bs, 10-H) ppm. 13C NMR (100.6 MHz, acetone-d 6) δ 17.0 (C-6D), 18.0 (C-6B), 18.4 (C-6C), 18.5 (C-6A), 18.7 (C-6E), 20.1 (C-5′), 27.5 (3E-CH3), 27.8 (C-4), 32.9 (C-2D), 37.9 (C-2A), 38.4 (C-2C), 40.4 (C-2B), 43.1 (C-3), 44.8 (C-2E), 59.1 (1′-OCH3), 68.9 (C-4′), 69.3 (C-4D), 71.1 (C-3E), 71.4 (C-5D, C-5E), 71.8 (C-3B), 73.0 (C-5A, C-5C), 73.1 (C-5B), 75.8 (C-4A), 76.1 (C-4C), 77.2 (C-3D, C-2), 77.3 (C-4E), 78.0 (C-4B), 79.6 (C-3′), 81.7 (C-3A), 82.3 (C-3C, C-1′), 97.1 (C-1A), 98.4 (C-1E), 100.4 (C-1B), 100.7 (C-1D), 101.3 (C-1C), 102.3 (C-5), 103.4 (C-7), 108.7 (C-8a), 109.1 (C-9a), 117.6 (C-10), 138.2 (C-4a), 141.8 (C-10a), 160.2 (C-8), 161.7 (C-6), 165.9 (C-9), 204.6 (C-1), 211.7 (C-2′) ppm.

Previous research in our laboratory on the mithramycin biosynthetic gene cluster allowed the isolation and characterization of a series of overlapping cosmid clones containing the mithramycin gene cluster. Through sequencing analysis in one of these cosmids, clone cosAR3, genes encoding two glycosyltransferases (18.Fernández E. Weißbach U. Sánchez Reillo C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A.

It comprises 1,035 nucleotides and ends in a TGA codon; it would code for a polypeptide of 345 amino acids with an estimated M r of 37,863. Both genes show a high GC content characteristic ofStreptomyces genes and the bias in the third codon position characteristic of the genes of this genus. Downstream ofmtmMI there is a DNA region with two long inverted repeats that could form stem-loop structures that might represent transcriptional terminators. The deduced products of the mtmMI and mtmMII genes were compared with other proteins in data bases using the BLAST program (30.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

In antiquity, Pakistani and Egyptian emeralds were traded by way of the Silk Route. Together with Austrian stones, they were the only source of gem-quality emeralds. Immediately after the discovery of the Colombian mines by Spaniards in the 16th century, a new trade route was established, first via Spain to Europe and India and then directly via the Philippines to India. Since then, Colombian emeralds have dominated the emerald trade, and most of the high-quality emeralds cut in the 18th century in India originated from Colombia."
https://openalex.org/W2017911801,"Collagen XVII is a hemidesmosomal transmembrane molecule important for epithelial adhesion in the skin. It exists in two forms, as a full-length protein and as a soluble ectodomain that is shed from the keratinocyte surface by furin-mediated proteolysis. To obtain information on the conformation and the functions of this unusual collagen, its largest collagenous domain, Col15, was expressed in a eukaryotic episomal expression system and purified by DEAE and fast protein liquid- Mono S chromatography. The protein was triple-helical (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i> of 26.5 °C) when produced in cultures containing ascorbic acid. When the vitamin supply was limited, the 4-hydroxyproline content was reduced from 74 to 9%, which, in turn, resulted in a drastic reduction of the stability of the triple helix. The glycine substitution mutation G627V associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a human blistering skin disease, also had a striking effect on thermal stability of rCol15 causing partial unfolding already at 4 °C. Col15 promoted cell adhesion of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines with a β1 integrin-mediated mechanism. In concert with this, in acquired autoimmune blistering skin diseases, circulating IgG and IgA autoantibodies were found to target rCol15r."
https://openalex.org/W2082150317,"Pit-1/GHF-1 is a pituitary-specific, POU homeodomain transcription factor required for development of somatotroph, lactotroph, and thyrotroph cell lineages and regulation of the temporal and spatial expression of the growth hormone, prolactin (PRL), and thyrotropin-β genes. Synergistic interaction of Pit-1 with a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, Ets-1, has been shown to be an important mechanism regulating basal and Ras-induced lactotroph-specific rat (r) PRL promoter activity. Pit-1β/GHF-2, an alternatively spliced isoform containing a 26-amino acid insert (β-domain) within its transcription-activation domain, physically interacts with Ets-1 but fails to synergize. By using a series of Pit-1 internal-deletion constructs in a transient transfection protocol to reconstitute rPRL promoter activity in HeLa cells, we have determined that the functional and physical interaction of Pit-1 and Ets-1 is mediated via the POU homeodomain, which is common to both Pit-1 and Pit-1β. Although the Pit-1 homeodomain is both necessary and sufficient for direct binding to Ets-1 in a DNA-independent manner, an additional interaction surface was mapped to the β-domain, specific to the Pit-1β isoform. Thus, the unique transcriptional properties of Pit-1 and Pit-1β on the rPRL promoter may be due to the formation of functionally distinct complexes of these two Pit-1 isoforms with Ets-1."

Three major differences with respect to the chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago (CPO) are observed in the reactivity of MPO and CiP toward styrene derivatives. First, in contrast to CPO, MPO and CiP produced the (S)-isomers of the epoxides in enantiomeric excess. Second, for MPO and CiP the H2O2 had to be added very slowly (10 eq in 16 h) to prevent accumulation of catalytically inactive enzyme intermediates. Under these conditions, CPO hardly showed any epoxidizing activity; only with a high influx of H2O2 (300 eq in 1.6 h) was epoxidation observed. Third, both MPO and CiP formed significant amounts of (substituted) benzaldehydes as side products as a consequence of C-α–C-β bond cleavage of the styrene derivatives, whereas for CPO and cytochrome c peroxidase this activity is not observed. C-α–C-β cleavage was the most prominent reaction catalyzed by CiP, whereas with MPO the relative amount of epoxide formed was higher.

The active site in CPO contains a distal glutamate and a proximal cysteine, whereas in classical peroxidases both a distal and a proximal histidine are present (21.Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J.

However, native HRP will oxidize styrene in the presence of H2O2 to form styrene oxide and benzaldehyde only when 4-methylphenol is present via a cooxidation mechanism (27.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Grab L.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5310-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MPO has previously been shown to perform the epoxidation of butadiene (28.Duesscher R.J. Elfarra A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19859-19865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but so far enantioselective epoxidations by this enzyme have not been reported. Enantiopure epoxides are important building blocks in organic synthesis. The development of practical methods for enantioselective epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins continues to present important challenges in the field of catalysis. Major progress has been made with synthetic catalysts, although there is still much room for improvement (29.Jacobsen E.N. Ojima I. Catalytic Asymmetric Catalysis.

Peroxidases perform asymmetric epoxidation under mild conditions, but their application in organic synthesis is hampered by the limited solubility of organic reactants in aqueous systems, the oxidative inactivation of the enzyme during catalysis, and the low enantioselectivity sometimes observed in peroxidase-catalyzed reactions. In the past decade, however, using CPO, tremendous progress has been achieved. Thus, styrene derivatives are oxidized to the corresponding (R)-styrene oxides with e.e amounts up to 96%. As side products, unsubstituted phenylacetaldehydes are formed (11.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Choe Y.S. DePillis G.D. Catalano C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11641-11646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Colonna S. Gaggero N. Casella L. Carrea G. Pasta P.

Very high enantioselectivities are obtained with disubstituted olefins (12.Allain A.J. Hager L.P. Deng L. Jacobsen E.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4415-4416Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 14.Dexter A.F. Lakner F.J. Campbell R.A. Hager L.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6412-6413Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of epoxidations catalyzed by heme proteins like cytochrome P450, cytochrome c peroxidase, and mutants of HRP and CPO remain unclear. The mechanism of peroxidases in general comprises two consecutive one-electron transfers in the oxidation of organic compounds at the expense of one equivalent of hydrogen peroxide, involving two intermediate forms of the enzyme, compounds I and II, each of which is able to abstract one electron from the substrate to produce a free radical. The free radical may be subjected to coupling, disproportionation, and reaction with molecular oxygen or with another substrate molecule (34.Yamazaki I. Pryor W.A. Free Radicals in Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1977: 183-218Crossref Google Scholar). Apart from this mechanism, a direct oxygen transfer from compound I to substrates will bypass compound II and return the enzyme directly to the native state. This is the putative mechanism for CPO in the epoxidation of alkenes, the so-called ferryl-oxygen transfer mechanism (11.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Choe Y.S. DePillis G.D. Catalano C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11641-11646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), comparable with the oxygen transfer mechanism of cytochrome P450. It has also been suggested that electron transfer from the alkene to compound I may occur first, forming a compound II-like species and an intermediate radical cation that can undergo different fates, leading to the formation of epoxides or aldehydes (11.Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Soc. 1995; 117: 8021-8022Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For CiP and MPO, it has been observed that compound II is also formed in the presence of sufficient H2O2 via the reduction of compound I by H2O2 itself (39.Andersen M.B. Hsuanyu Y. Welinder K.G. Schneider P. Dunford H.B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1991; 45: 1080-1086Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar,40.Hoogland H. Dekker H.L. van Riel C. van Kuilenberg A. Muijsers A.O. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 955: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Compound II can, in its turn, react with H2O2 to give compound III, which is believed to be a dead end species and catalytically inactive (41.Huwiler M. Jenzer H. Kohler H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the presence of compound III and an excess of H2O2 should be avoided in the enantioselective sulfoxidation of thioanisole catalyzed by CiP and lactoperoxidase (10.Tuynman A. Vink M.K.S. Dekker H.L. Schoemaker H.E. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that CiP and MPO are also capable of enantioselective epoxidation forming (S)-styrene oxide derivatives, provided that the H2O2 influx is slow to such an extent that accumulation of compound II or compound III due to reaction with H2O2 is avoided. Moreover, we show that both CiP and MPO are also capable of catalyzing C-α–C-β bond cleavage of (electron-poor) styrene derivatives without the necessity for the presence of a phenol as a co-substrate, as is the case in the cooxidation of styrene by HRP and phenols (27.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Grab L.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5310-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). So far, the only heme peroxidase known to catalyze C–C bond cleavage of nonphenolics has been lignin peroxidase (42.Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Bowen R.M. Palmer J.M.

Enzyme concentrations were determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 89 mm−1 cm−1 at 428 nm for MPO (44.Bakkenist A.R.J. Wever R. Vulsma T. Plat H. van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Methods Enzymol. 1970; 52: 521-529Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra in the UV-visible range were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8452 A spectrophotometer. Typically, reactions were carried out in 1.67-ml quartz cuvette sealed with a Teflon cap with two capillaries, one to add the hydrogen peroxide solution and one to dispose of the overflow. The cuvettes were completely filled with the reaction mixture in order to prevent partitioning of the substrate into a gas-phase head space. The contents of the cuvette were stirred continuously. General conditions were 20 μm CiP or 2 μm MPO, 100 mmbuffer, and 1 mm substrate. During 16 h, hydrogen peroxide was added continuously via a syringe pump (Cole Parmer model 74900-10) with a 250-μl Hamilton syringe with Teflon luer lock connected to the reaction cuvette via a PEEK Tubing 116-inch outer diameter, 0.20-inch inner diameter, that went through a capillary in the Teflon cap that sealed the cuvette. The rate of hydrogen peroxide addition was 1 μmol/h. For CPO, the conditions were as described previously (16.Zaks A. Dodds D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10419-10424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with some modifications regarding the scale of the experiment (10 μm CPO, 100 mm buffer, pH 5.5, and 1 mm substrate). For this enzyme, the rate of hydrogen peroxide addition was 312.5 μmol/h during 1.6 h. To determine a pH optimum, the buffers used were sodium acetate (pH 5.0 and 5.5), potassium phosphate (pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.8), Tris-sulfate (pH 8.4), and sodium carbonate (pH 9.5 and 10.0). To determine the substrate specificity, the reactions were carried out in a potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After 16 h, 1 μmol of anisaldehyde was added as an internal standard, and then the reaction mixture was extracted twice with 3.4 ml of CH2Cl2. The combined organic phases were dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated under a stream of nitrogen. To prevent excessive evaporation of the products, the organic phase was not evaporated further than to a volume of about 100 μl. To measure the conversion, the concentrated extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography on a Varian 3400 instrument equipped with a BP X-35 column (0.25 mm × 30 m) (SGE) programmed to run at 80 °C for 17 min and to rise at 15 °C/min to 200 °C. The enantiomeric excess of the epoxides was determined with a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph, equipped with a FID detector, using a Chiraldex G-TA capillary column (0.25 mm × 50 m) programmed to run at 110° for 45 min. The retention times are summarized in TableI. Absolute configurations were determined previously (47.Lutje Spelberg J.H. Rink R. Kellog R.M. Janssen D.B. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1998; 9: 459-466Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The enantiomeric excesses were double-checked on a CP-cyclodextrin-β-2,3,6-M-19 capillary column (0.25 mm × 50 m) programmed to run at 100 °C for 90 min as described previously (47.Lutje Spelberg J.H. Rink R. Kellog R.M. Janssen D.B. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1998; 9: 459-466Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements were carried out with a HP5973 MSD bench top gas chromatography-mass spectrometer using a CP Wax 52 CB column (25 m × 0.25 mm, phase film thickness = 1.20 μm, Chrompack) programmed to run at 30 °C for 5 min, to rise at 5 °C/min to 180 °C and to run at this temperature for 40 min at a 1 ml/min flow using a 1:40 split ratio. A Programmed Temperature Vaporization, (cis4) injector was used, starting at 50 °C and rising at 12 °C/s to 180 °C. Retention times for the different components were 24, 33.5, and 35 min for styrene, benzaldehyde, and styreneoxide, respectively.Table IRetention times in minutes of the different substrates and productsFor the epoxide enantiomers, the retention times on the Chiraldex-GTA column are shown (GTA).

For the other compounds the retention times on the BP-X35 column are shown (BP). n.d., not determined. Catalase activities were determined by measuring the rate of oxygen evolution with an oxygraph. To calculate the relative amounts of the different compounds present during turnover, the multicomponent analysis method present in the HP 8452 A software was used, which is based on an extension of Beer's law to m different components as follows, A=∑I=1m EicidEquation 1 where E i and c i denote, respectively, the extinction coefficient and concentration of componenti at wavelength λ. The program estimates the parameters by nonlinear least squares. The time-resolved spectra during the epoxidation of styrene by CiP and MPO are considered to be a superposition of the contributions of the spectra of native enzyme, compound I, compound II, and compound III. For MPO, the amount of compound I present during turnover is assumed to be zero, since the formation of compound II from compound I is very fast (48.Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the spectrum of this component was not used in the method of deconvolution. Since the porphyrins are degraded during the oxidative processes and the enzyme thus loses its absorption in the Soret and visual bands, an additional equation was added to this analysis. This equation states that the sum of the relative amounts of the compounds should add up to 1. H2O2 solutions were freshly prepared by dilution of a 30% stock solution (Merck). The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using an absorption coefficient of 43.6 m−1cm−1 at 240 nm (49.Beers Jr., R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity. Styrene, styreneoxide, 4-methoxystyrene, 4-methylstyrene, α-methylstyrene, benzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde, 3-chlorobenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, anisaldehyde, andp-tolylaldehyde were from Fluka, and 4-chlorostyrene, 3-chlorostyrene, 2-chlorostyrene, trans-β-methylstyrene, and acetophenone were from Aldrich. cis-β-Methylstyrene was from TCI. Epoxides were synthesized as described previously (47.Lutje Spelberg J.H. Rink R. Kellog R.M. Janssen D.B. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1998; 9: 459-466Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In earlier work, we demonstrated the enantioselective sulfoxidation of thioanisole by lactoperoxidase and Coprinus cinereus peroxidase under very special conditions, i.e. a continuous influx of H2O2 such that an accumulation of compound III was prevented (10.Tuynman A. Vink M.K.S. Dekker H.L. Schoemaker H.E. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Under the same incubation conditions in the presence of styrene, only a minor amount of styrene epoxidation (3% yield) was detected after 3 h, and the enzyme (CiP) was fully present as compound III throughout the reaction and rapidly inactivated (t = 1.6 h). However, when the H2O2 influx at pH 7 was lowered 10 times to 1 μmol/h and the reaction time was prolonged to 16 h, 18% of the styrene was converted into the epoxide with 20 μm CiP as a catalyst, and 18% was converted with 2 μm MPO. For both enzymes, the S-oxide was formed in enantiomeric excess, (35 and 20%, respectively). Incubation of styrene with lactoperoxidase, manganese peroxidase, or HRP under the same conditions generated only very low amounts (yield ≤1%) of the epoxide with low e.e. amounts. It should be noted that styrene oxide is not stable in aqueous solutions but slowly hydrolyzes (t about 11 h at pH 7) to yield the diol. Therefore, if no hydrolysis would have occurred in the incubations, the amounts of styrene oxide produced would have been higher. An important side product is benzaldehyde, which is even the major product in the reaction catalyzed by CiP. Another minor side product for MPO, but not for CiP, is phenylacetaldehyde (up to 9% yield at pH 6). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry provided us with a positive identification of the products present and excluded the formation of phenethylalcohol, which has a retention time identical to phenylacetaldehyde on the BP-X35 column. Monitoring (in time) the enzyme intermediates of CiP and MPO spectroscopically as described (10.Tuynman A. Vink M.K.S. Dekker H.L. Schoemaker H.E. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) during these incubations showed that for CiP the enzyme was present as 89% compound I and 11% compound II or compound III, between which the multicomponent analysis could not discern. For MPO the enzyme was present as 44% native enzyme and 56% compound II. No compound III was formed during these incubations. For CPO, the conditions to obtain epoxidation were very different. This enzyme epoxidizes styrene under a much higher influx of H2O2, i.e.312.5 μmol/h (14.Dexter A.F. Lakner F.J. Campbell R.A. Hager L.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6412-6413Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Even under these extreme oxidative conditions, the enzyme was fully present in its native state during catalysis. Conversely, CPO hardly produced any epoxides under the mild conditions that were necessary to obtain conversion of styrene by MPO and CiP; nor did MPO and CiP form any epoxide under the high H2O2 influx conditions as applied for CPO, and under these conditions both CiP and MPO were fully present as compound III and were inactivated within 1 h as deduced from the decrease of the absorption of the Soret bands. A similar experiment to follow the enzyme intermediates of CiP and MPO under the mild conditions that provide styreneoxide in the presence of styrene, but now conducted in the absence of styrene, showed an accumulation of compound III for both enzymes and a more rapid inactivation of the enzymes, as deduced from the decrease of the absorption of the Soret band. This indicates that the presence of styrene protects the enzymes against oxidative inactivation. From the catalase activity of the enzymes, measured in a separate experiment, the concentration of H2O2during turnover could be estimated, as described in a previous paper (10.Tuynman A. Vink M.K.S. Dekker H.L. Schoemaker H.E. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, for MPO the H2O2 concentration was estimated to be 2 μm, and for CiP it was estimated to be 1.6 μm. From our data, it is possible to calculate that for MPO 91% of the total H2O2 is lost due to catalase activity, whereas for CiP this is 94%. When the incubations with CiP were quenched after 3, 6, 16, and 24 h, the amount of epoxide formed was linear in time for 6 h for the epoxide, and the amount of benzaldehyde was linear for 16 h (not shown). For MPO, it was observed that the conversion reached completion after 5 h, after which formation of styreneoxide and benzaldehyde stopped (not shown). Moreover, for both enzymes the formation of benzaldehyde and styreneoxide was proportional to the enzyme concentrations (results not shown). CiP showed a broad pH optimum for the formation of styreneoxide around pH 9 and, for the formation of benzaldehyde, showed an optimum around pH 8 (Fig. 1). The enantioselectivity increases with increasing pH up to 56% at pH 10. For this enzyme, the amount of phenylacetaldehyde was negligible. For MPO, the pH optimum for the formation of styreneoxide and for the formation of benzaldehyde are both pH 6.5 (Fig.2). Only a minor amount of phenylacetaldehyde (≤10%) is formed between pH 6 and 7, which decreases at higher pH values and is almost absent above pH 8.5 (Fig.2). The enantioselectivity of the epoxide reaches a maximum at pH 6 (42%) and remains around 20% at other pH values. A small amount of hydrolysis of the epoxides (47.Lutje Spelberg J.H. Rink R. Kellog R.M. Janssen D.B. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1998; 9: 459-466Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) leading to the formation of diols will not influence the enantioselectivity and is therefore not examined in this research. The addition of t-BuOH as a cosolvent to the incubations with CiP to increase the solubility of the styrene did not lead to an improved conversion or enantioselectivity.Figure 2pH dependence of the formation of styreneoxide, of its e.e., and of benzaldehyde and phenylacetaldehyde by MPO. ▪, styreneoxide; ●, e.e.; ■, benzaldehyde; ▵, phenylacetaldehyde.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Yields and enantioselectivities of epoxidations of different substrates in the CiP- and MPO-catalyzed reactions are shown in Table II. The yield of the benzaldehyde derivative formed is also shown. The turnover numbers of the conversions can be calculated from this table by dividing the yield by the enzyme concentration. From this it becomes clear that MPO is a more potent catalyst in the epoxidation than CiP. Epoxidation of p-, o-, and m-chloro substituted styrene derivatives catalyzed by CPO were previously shown to provide low yields and moderate enantioselectivities (13.Colonna S. Gaggero N. Casella L. Carrea G. Pasta P. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1993; 4: 1325-1330Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We investigated the epoxidation of the same derivatives by CiP and MPO. Both CiP and MPO give a good conversion of the p-chlorostyrene but not of them- and o-isomers. Interestingly, an electron-withdrawing substituent such as chlorine led to an increased formation of the chlorobenzaldehyde. This is not observed for CPO catalyzing the same reaction (<1%; not shown). The e.e. amounts of the formed epoxides were low for the para-chloro substituted e"

However, the impact of PAI-1 on vascular remodeling and plaque stability appears quite complex to delineate. By regulating plasmin-mediated matrix metalloproteinase activity, PAI-1 may alter the structure of the extracellular matrix and associated cellular events. These include, for example, regulation of extracellular matrix degradation in a model of aneurysm in rat (11.Allaire E. Hasenstab D. Kenagy R.D. Starcher B. Clowes M.M. Clowes A.W. Circulation. 1998; 98: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cell migration in a model of vascular injury in PAI-1 gene knock-out mice (12.Carmeliet P. Moons L.

In addition, a non-anti-proteolytic function of PAI-1 was proposed from in vitro data. An excess of PAI-1 was shown to prevent attachment of different types of cells, including monocytes, by competing for the vitronectin binding site with uPAR and αvβ3(13.Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S.

Contrarily, endogenously secreted PAI-1 was shown to stabilize adhesion of the fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 (17.Ciambrone G.J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J.

Which of the anti- or pro-adhesive functions of PAI-1 can be considered as adverse during atherosclerosis is still an open question. The human leukemia cell line HL-60 is a powerful and convenient model to elucidate the regulation and function of factors that coordinate the monocyte/macrophage adherent phenotype and pericellular proteolytic activity. When treated with differentiative agents such as phorbol esters, these cells develop the adherent macrophage-like phenotype (19.Rovera G. Santoli D. Damsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We recently identified the early signaling pathway activating PAI-1 synthesis during the induction of differentiation in these cells, which is characterized by a linear cascade involving PKCβ-MAPKK-MAPKp42 (22.Lopez S.

In HepG2 cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), this pathway leads to the c-Jun homodimer binding at the −58 to −50 region of the PAI-1 promoter (23.Arts J. Grimbergen J. Toet K. Kooistra T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TNFα, which is released by activated macrophages, is an important mediator in the differentiation process of leukocytes (24.Camussi G. Albano E. Tetta C. Bussolino F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This is also a major inducer of PAI-1 synthesis in various differentiated cells (25.van Hinsberg V.W.M.

Macrophages isolated from atheromatous plaque, however, produce more PAI-1 than monocytes isolated from blood of the same donor (7.Tipping P.G. Davenport P. Gallicchio M. Filonzi E.L. Apostolopoulos J. Wojta J. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 875-885PubMed Google Scholar) strongly suggesting a differentiated state-related synthesis of PAI-1 in this type of cell. HL-60 cells differentiated by PMA also synthesize TNFα (30.Horiguchi J. Spriggs D. Imamura K. Stone R. Luebbers R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which was recently demonstrated to up-regulate, in an autocrine manner, the synthesis of 92-kDa gelatinase via α5β1integrin expression (31.Xie B. Laouar A. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11583-11588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because a close relationship exists between PAI-1 and pericellular proteolytic activity, this drove us to use this model to examine if TNFα contributes to PAI-1 synthesis during induction of leukocyte differentiation and if so, how it exerts this regulation. Results showed that, during the early steps of the monocytic differentiation program, TNFα and PAI-1 mRNA levels increased. The synthesized TNFα up-regulates and prolongs, in an autocrine manner, elevated PAI-1 mRNA levels resulting in enhanced protein antigen synthesis and secretion.

Appropriate dilutions were made in warm culture medium in such a way that the final Me2SO or ethanol concentration in the presence of cells did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). Proper controls made with similar Me2SO or ethanol concentrations were without effects on the parameters studied. The human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cell line and the HL-525 cell line that is resistant to PMA-induced differentiation (32.Homma Y. Henning-Chubb C.B. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Pr. E. Huberman (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). HL-60 and HL-525 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum as already described (22.Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells in 72-h-old culture medium were resuspended for 1 h in fresh medium and then treated with differentiative agents. Total RNA extraction (extraction kit for total RNA, RNeasy from Quiagen) and cDNA synthesis were performed as recently described (22.Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment for human PAI-1 (GenBankTM accession number X04744) is 284 bp, base position 10977–11260 and that for human TNFα (GenBankTM accession number M10988) is 296 bp, base position 761–1056. The amplified fragment of TNF-RI (p55) (GenBankTM accession number X55313) is 261 bp, base position 786–1046 and that of TNF-RII (GenBankTM accession number M55994) is 391 bp, base position 594–984. In PMA-treated cells, eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF1α) was observed to be a stable house keeping gene, whereas in TGF-β1/D3-treated HL-60 cells, β-actin was preferred. The amplified fragment for eEF1α (GenBankTM accession number X03558) is 289 bp, base position 382–670 and is 388 bp for β-actin (GenBankTMaccession number X00351), base position 379–766. PCR was performed on a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler (GeneAmp 2400). We selected a number of 25 cycles for TNFα and its receptors, PAI-1, and β-actin cDNAs and a number of 18 cycles for eEF1α. Specificity of the amplified fragment was assessed by the demonstration that appropriate restriction enzymes generated the expected cleavage fragments. PCR started for 2 min at 95 °C followed by cycles consisting of: 60 s at 58 °C (for PAI-1, eEF1α, and β-actin) or 57 °C (for TNFα and its receptors), 90 s at 72 °C, and 45 s at 97 °C. Amplification was terminated after 5 min at 72 °C. Products were visualized and photographed under UV radiation following gel-agarose (2%) electrophoresis. Total proteins of cell lysates were assayed according to specifications of the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit from Sigma. PAI-1 antigen assay was performed on supernatants from conditioned culture medium and on cell lysates (Triton X-100 0.1% final) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described by Declercket al. (33.Declerck P.J. Alessi M.C. Vertrken M. Kruithof E.K.O. Juhan-Vague I. Collen D. Blood. 1988; 71: 220-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα antigen assay was performed on culture supernatants according to the specifications provided with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Coulter-Immunotech). Expression of TNFα receptors p55 (RI) and p75 (RII) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The experimental protocol was comparable to that previously described for the urokinase receptor (27.Peiretti F. Fossat C. Anfosso F. Alessi M.C. Henry M. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Blood. 1996; 87: 162-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HL-60 cells (105) were first acid-treated (glycine buffer, pH 3.0, 1 min at 37 °C) to remove bound TNFα. Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody against TNF RI or RII (R&D Systems) and washed. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cells were analyzed on a XL-cytofluorograph (Coulter Electronics Inc.) at 488 and 525 nm, corresponding to excitation and detection wavelengths, respectively. Each experiment was performed in duplicate or triplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Comparisons were analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, and significance was calculated at p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 using the Scheffe F-test. In nonstimulated HL-60 cells, the level of TNFα mRNA was low (Fig. 1 A). When HL-60 cells were treated with 20 nm PMA, the TNFα mRNA level rose rapidly. The optimum expression was attained 2 h after PMA addition. The increase in TNFα mRNA level was transient since 24 h after PMA addition, the level was below that of nonstimulated cells (Fig. 1 A). TNFα antigen accumulation increased by a factor 3.6 in the culture medium of HL-60 cells treated with PMA (Fig.1 B). The PAI-1 mRNA level (Fig. 1 A) was not detectable in basal conditions but was strongly induced 4 h after PMA addition and remained elevated over 24 h. PAI-1 antigen accumulation was dramatically enhanced at 24 h compared with nontreated HL-60 cells (Fig. 1 B). In view of the above results and because PAI-1 is a TNFα-responsive gene in various differentiated cells, we then examined if the synthesis of PAI-1 was attributable only to the activation of the PKCβ-MAPKK-MAPKp42 pathway (22.Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or if the released TNFα contributed to the synthesis of PAI-1. HL-60 cells were simultaneously incubated with a neutralizing antibody against human TNFα and PMA. Preliminary experiments revealed that the optimal effect was obtained at 2.5 μg/ml anti-TNFα. We used 10 μg/ml to ensure complete quenching of released TNFα. As shown in Fig.2 A, anti-TNFα significantly lowered the level of PAI-1 mRNA 4 h after PMA addition indicating that endogenously released TNFα is already active at this time. This inhibition strongly persisted at 10 h. The intracellular level of PAI-1, measured 8 h after PMA addition, was reduced by 41% (from 6.9 ± 2.1 down to 4.06 ± 2.0 ng/mg proteins), whereas PAI-1 antigen accumulation in the culture decreased by 65% at 24 h (Fig. 2 B). IgG1 (10 μg/ml) used as a control isotype in anti-TNFα studies did not inhibit PMA-induced PAI-1 synthesis and even tended to increase it by 20% (not shown). This increase could be explained by the fact that in HL-60 cells, IgG immunoglobulins activate the production of TNFα (34.Glick D. Barenholz Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The IgG-induced TNFα release might in turn potentiate PAI-1 synthesis once differentiation is initiated by PMA. Morphological examination of HL-60 showed that the addition of anti-TNFα tended to reduce the spreading of cells, which appear more rounded when compared with PMA-treated cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Twenty four hours after PMA addition, the percentage of adherent cells was 95 ± 3% and 62 ± 10% when anti-TNFα was added. These results indicate that, in PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells, endogenous TNFα up-regulates, in an autocrine manner, the PAI-1 synthesis.Figure 3Microscopic examination of HL-60 and HL-525 cells 24 h after various treatments.

Magnification × 40.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) rhTNFα did not induce any changes in the accumulation of PAI-1 antigen from native HL-60 cells, which did not exceed 1 ng/106 cells (Fig. 2 B) at 24 h. When rhTNFα was simultaneously added with PMA, it induced a modest increase in PAI-1 antigen level. This was characterized by an increase in the intracellular compartment of 18% after 8 h (from 6.9 ± 2.1 to 8.3 ± 2.4 ng/mg proteins) and 55% in the culture medium after 24 h (Fig. 2 B). To rule out possible endotoxin contamination, rhTNFα was boiled for 5 min and added on PMA-treated cells. No enhancement of PAI-1 synthesis could be observed in these conditions. The addition of rhTNFα tended to increase the spreading of adherent cells (Fig. 3 D) but did not change the PMA-induced percentage of adherent cells. The increase in PAI-1 synthesis was not detected at the mRNA level (Fig. 2 A). The moderate effect of rhTNFα on PAI-1 synthesis could be due to the rapid down-regulation of the expression of TNF receptors I and II following PMA treatment as described previously in U937 cells (35.Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16450-16455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HL-60 cells (36.Winsen R. Wallach D. Engelmann H. Nophar Y. Brakebusch C. Kemper O. Resch K. Holtmann H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3454-3460PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we examined TNFα receptor (RI and RII) expression by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the level of RI mRNA progressively increased the first 14–20 h then returned to the basal level at 24 h. The RII mRNA basal level, higher than RI, slightly decreased at 6 h and then was strongly enhanced until 20 h. It then decreased at 24 h. Surface expression of RI and RII both increased with time peaking at 9 h (Fig. 4 B). The transient increase observed in untreated cells is likely the result of the renewal of the 72-h-old culture medium, because the basal expression of RI and RII was recovered around 36 h after culture medium renewal (not shown). However, this transient increase was less pronounced in PMA-treated than in untreated HL-60 cells. This is in line with previous data showing that PMA rapidly down-regulates RI and RII surface expression (35.Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16450-16455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Winsen R. Wallach D. Engelmann H. Nophar Y. Brakebusch C. Kemper O. Resch K. Holtmann H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3454-3460PubMed Google Scholar), but is not strong enough in our experimental conditions to induce an absolute decrease when compared with their levels at t = 0. The lack of effect of rhTNFα on PAI-1 synthesis observed on native undifferentiated HL-60 cells is not linked to some defect in TNFα receptors, because they are expressed in a constitutive manner as we demonstrated above and are operational in these cells (37.Kim M.-Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Raines M.A. Kolesnik R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to suggest the existence of a functional link between the differentiation state and the potency of TNFα to activate PAI-1 gene expression. We thus evaluated the relationship between the time-dependent monocyte/macrophage differentiation and the potency of TNFα to activate PAI-1 synthesis. To specifically evaluate the effect of rhTNFα from the global PMA effect, we treated HL-60 cells with a metabolizable phorbol ester (phorbol dibutyrate) for various times (i.e. 3, 6, 14, 24, 36, and 48 h after initial PdBu addition) at which conditioned medium was discarded. The cells were washed and then either stimulated or not (control) by rhTNFα for 24 h. As shown in Fig.5, the enhancing effect of rhTNFα appears optimal 14–24 h after the induction of monocytic differentiation and then declines progressively but remains higher than that of native undifferentiated HL-60 cells stimulated by rhTNFα alone. It should be mentioned that these results cannot be compared with those of the PMA-induced up-regulating effect described in Fig. 2. Indeed, once the PdBu-containing medium is removed, intracellular PdBu is rapidly degraded, which stops cellular differentiation related events. These results show that rhTNFα activates PAI-1 synthesis once HL-60 cells have been “primed” by a differentiative stimulus. The HL-525 cell line was cloned from HL-60 cells rendered resistant to PMA-induced monocytic differentiation after long term PMA treatment. This results in a down-regulation of PKCβ expression (32.Homma Y. Henning-Chubb C.B. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39.Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restoration of PMA responsiveness in terms of monocyte/macrophage differentiation can be obtained by pretreatment of HL-525 cells with RA that re-induces PKCβ gene expression (40.Yang K.D. Mizobuchi T. Kharbanda S.M. Datta R. Huberman E. Kufe D.W. Stone R.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 490-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6 A shows that, in HL-525 cells, the level of TNFα mRNA was slightly enhanced by PMA alone, although it was lower and appeared later than in HL-60 cells. Treatment of HL-525 cells with RA alone had no effect on TNFα mRNA levels, except a slight transient increase at 6–8 h. Clearly, RA pretreatment allows PMA to progressively and strongly enhance TNFα mRNA levels. It should be noticed that the optimum level of TNFα mRNA significantly increased much later than in HL-60 cells (10versus 2 h). The amount of TNFα antigen secreted into the culture medium (Fig. 6 B) showed that, in comparison with control HL-525 cells, PMA modestly enhanced TNFα antigen accumulation, whereas RA alone had no marked effect. The combination of RA + PMA increased the antigen level of TNFα in the culture medium. This level was 60% higher than that from HL-60 cells (cf. Fig. 1 B), and the increase continued for 48 h. We then evaluated the synthesis of PAI-1 in HL-525 cells under various conditions. The PAI-1 mRNA level was hardly detectable in control HL-525 cells as well as in cells treated by RA alone for 72 h or longer (not shown). As shown in Fig.7 A, PMA alone has also no significant effect on the PAI-1 mRNA level, whereas the RA + PMA treatment resulted in a modest increase, which appeared 3 h after PMA addition and continued over 9 h to slightly decrease at 24 h. The accumulation of PAI-1 antigen that was not increased by either PMA or RA alone significantly increased in RA + PMA-treated HL-525 cells confirming previous data (22.Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Anti-TNFα reduced the level of PAI-1 mRNA in RA + PMA-treated HL-525 cells but, the inhibitory effect could not be firmly detected before 9 h (Fig.7 A). In HL-525 cells treated with PMA alone, rhTNFα did not significantly alter PAI-1 synthesis, both at mRNA and protein levels (not shown). However, when rhTNFα was added to RA + PMA-treated HL-525 cells, a rapid and strong enhancement of the PAI-1 mRNA level was observed at 3 h and continued to increase over 24 h. This enhancement resulted in an increase in PAI-1 antigen accumulation by a factor of 3 at 24 h and of 6.5 at 48 h (Fig. 7 B) when compared with RA + PMA-treated HL-525 cells. Unlike native rhTNFα, boiled rhTNFα was ineffective. Fig. 3,E–H shows that HL-525 cells treated by the combination of RA + PMA develop a marked adhesion with some spreading and cell extensions. These morphological patterns, particularly cell extensions, were strongly intensified when rhTNFα was added. We evaluated if the autocrine and stimulating effect of TNFα was specific to PMA-induced differentiation or also occurs with other agents known to trigger the monocytic differentiation program. The treatment of the promonocytic cell line U937 with rhTGF-β1/D3 for 24 h has been described to induce monocytic differentiation (41.Waltz D.A. Sailor L.Z. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google"
https://openalex.org/W2083212860,"Viruses were first inferred to exist by the diseases they caused. Although disease manifestations like rabies, paralytic poliomyelitis, smallpox, and measles were noted in antiquity, viruses as infectious agents were defined just over 100 years ago. Their discovery was made initially possible by the revolution in microbiology led by Louis Pasteur and refined in concept by Robert Koch and Joseph Lister at the last half of the nineteenth century. These and other scientists discovered that microscopic organisms produced disease and the presence of the microbe could be defined by several criteria such as their retention on a Pasteur–Chamberlain filter, visualization by light microscopy, and growth on agars and in broths. However, a subset of diseases failed these experimental tests and a new class of organisms were uncovered. Specifically, independent observations by Ivanovsky (1892, 1899) and by Beijerinck (1898) with a disease of tobacco leaves, and by Loeffler and Frosch (1898) with foot-and-mouth disease of cattle, demonstrated an infectious agent that passed through the porcelain filter to the bottom of the flask, was not visible by light microscopy, and failed to grow in agar/broth cultures (Table 1). Indeed it was not until 40 years later, in the 1930s (Kausche et al., 1939), that tobacco mosaic virus was observed by electron microscopy and nearly 50 years before poliovirus could be reproducibly grown in tissue culture cells (Enders et al., 1954). The ability to grow viruses in cultured cells was the technological breakthrough that freed virologists from the need to passage viruses in animals (3Gard, S. (1954). Nobel Award in Physiology and Medicine.Google Scholar) and allowed sufficient recovery of viruses to allow the birth and development of biochemical virology in the 1960s and its expansion to the molecular biology of viruses in the 1970s–1980s.Table 1Selected Milestones in VirologyDate(s)Virologist(s)(References)Discovery1892,1898D.I.

With sufficient amounts of virus on hand, viral structure, function, and genomic organization followed, leading to insights in replication, transcription, translation, latency, and integration and the beginning of our understanding of how virus transformed cells to a cancerous state or how viruses persisted in animals. Because viruses are small units of packaged genes and cis-acting signals ranging in size from a few hundred bases (viroids) to agents with 300 genes, viruses became useful instruments for the study of genetics, cell biology, structural biology, and biochemistry, allowing the study of many basic parameters of life and development. In addition, cell culture permitted the development of large-scale production of vaccines to prevent, for example, paralytic poliomyelitis (the first vaccine produced in cell culture), measles, congenital abnormalities caused by rubella, and most recently the prevention of cancer resulting from hepatitis B virus chronic infections. These achievements led to the eradication of viral diseases that had killed over 400 million people in the twentieth century alone, over 4-fold more than were killed by all the wars of this century (5Oldstone, M.B.A. (1998). Viruses, Plagues, and History. New York: Oxford University Press.Google Scholar). An estimated 12% to 20% of human cancers are caused by viruses (Zur Hausen, 1991; 2Gallo R.C. et al.Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1999; 111: 560-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and so the strategy utilized to prevent liver cancer caused by HBV will surely be applied to other cancers in the twenty-first century. Over the past 40 years viruses have played a central role in our present-day understanding of DNA structure and genomes, transcriptional signals (enhancers, promoters), the transcriptional machinery and transcription factors, RNA processing, splicing, poly A–addition, RNA transport, protein localization in cells, and protein processing. The oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were first uncovered using viruses. Viruses have been excellent probes into the mysteries of the cells and the host animal. Genetic manipulation of both the virus and host are defining the molecular basis of viral diseases (4Oldstone M.B.A Cell. 1996; 87: 799-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). But what does the future hold for virology as the millennium ends and the next one begins? First we need to appreciate that the demographics of human populations in the twenty-first century are changing in ways that will impact viruses that prey upon humans. In the next century the rate of population growth will slow, but we will increase our numbers from six billion (in 2000 AD) to eight to ten billion by 2050 AD. In the twenty-first century we will become a predominantly urban species. Today 47 percent of people live in cities; in 2050 AD the great majority of people will live in cities populated with greater than 10 million people (today there are 20 such cities worldwide). We will be more dependent upon our technologies to manage the potential for emerging viral infections. In the twenty-first century, many countries will have for the first time in history three times more people over the age of 60 years than under the age of 4 years. Because of this, influenza epidemics could be the most important emerging and evolving virus. Few people in the year 2050 AD will have been immunized for smallpox, a disease eradicated in the twentieth century. Is there any possibility it or a relative could return? The human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus will surely require novel approaches in the next century if we are to control these infections. The human immunodeficiency virus has caused a downturn in the population with a lessening of the mean expectation of life (in Africa) for the first time since the 1918/1919 influenza pandemic. While HIV and hepatitis C viruses have already spread throughout the world, the hemorrhagic fever viruses (ebola, dengue) and hantaan viruses appear to wait in the wings before widespread diseases appear. Animal viruses such as African swine fever virus are on the move; from Africa to Portugal in 1957, to Spain in 1960 and the Caribbean and South America by the late 1960s and early 1970s. New viruses are continuously being uncovered although for several their role in disease is still undetermined. How are we going to respond? The World Health Organization predicts the worldwide eradication of poliovirus by the end of the first decade of the next century. Measles is anticipated to be eliminated by 2015 AD. Shortly thereafter, the hepatitis B vaccinations of the twentieth century will prevent expected liver cancers in the Far East. New disciplines will be developed to respond to these challenges. Viral diagnoses in the field (PCR, large volume DNA sequencing) will develop a new field of molecular epidemiology, which could be rapidly translated to new modes of vaccine development and novel methods of immunization using dendritic cells or cytokines to enhance responses to antigens. Renewed efforts in viral drug development will produce novel drugs that selectively control or eliminate some viruses. Technology of DNA assays and informatics will provide a molecular understanding of virus–host cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. The field of gene therapy, which has promised a great deal, but only produced limited successes in the twentieth century, will depend upon the development of virus vectors in the twenty-first century. Recombinant and mutant viruses will be used in vaccines, in gene replacement therapy, and for the selective killing of tumor cells in people. Viral agents that cause old diseases will be uncovered, perhaps for type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or other neurological syndromes. Viruses that have evolved a way to enhance or inhibit inflammatory reactions, immunosuppress the host, or evade an immune response will be characterized and understood. These very viral genes and approaches will then be applied to relieve autoimmune diseases in humans. But surely viruses will continue to lead the way in the basic sciences, as well as in clinical sciences. Great questions remain in virology and its research laboratories. How does herpevirus latency in neurons or lymphoid cells occur and what are the events in reactivation of these viruses? How do viruses persist or maintain chronic active infections in their host? What new diseases do they cause? How do the cancer viruses cause a tumor to arise? We need to understand changes in viral evolution, altered host range specificity, the causes of virulence and attenuation via mutations, and the control of mutation rate in viruses. The RNA viruses are unique and live on the edge of their “error threshold”, which means that their mutation rates and their rate of evolution will be a big problem in our future. Viruses of our evolutionary past (retroviruses) may comprise 1%–10% of our genome. Did they play a role in our evolution and have we overlooked their role in disease? What is their impact upon our diversity, immune response, or response to other viruses? Finally, viruses will continue to be the tools in our ever-expanding revolution in the biological sciences. Basic science laboratories will continue to utilize viral genes and enzymes, viral promoters, viral proteins, and viral capsids to explore the fundamental questions of life processes. The twenty-first century will provide new challenges both to the viruses and to the virologists."
