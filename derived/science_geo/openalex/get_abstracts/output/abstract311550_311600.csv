https://openalex.org/W2050950717,"The C-region of the upper mantle has two transition regions 75 to 90 kilometers thick. In western North America these start at depths of 365 kilometers and 620 kilometers and involve velocity increases of about 9 to 10 percent. The locations of these transition regions, their general shape, and their thicknesses are consistent with, first, the transformation of magnesium-rich olivine to a spinel structure and, then, a further collapse of a material having approximately the properties of the component oxides. The velocity increases associated with each transition region are slightly less than predicted for the appropriate phase change. This can be interpreted in terms of an increasing fayalite content with depth. The location of the transition regions and the seismic velocities in their vicinity supply new information regarding the composition and temperature of the upper mantle. The depths of the transition regions are consistent with temperatures near 1500 degrees C at 365 kilometers and 1900 degrees C at 620 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2085558998,"Two new hydrous sodium silicates, NaSi(7)O(13)(OH)(3).3H(2)O (magadiite) and NaSi(11)O(20.5)(OH)(4).3H(2)O (kenyaite), were found in lake beds at Lake Magadi, Kenya. Both are well-crystallized layered silicates with large basal spacings. Concretions within the magadiite bed consist of kenyaite or quartz (chert) in the center, surrounded by kenyaite. In dilute acids magadiite and kenyaite are converted to 6SiO(2).H(2)O (SH), the first known crystalline hydrate of silica. The magadiite bed probably represents a chemical precipitate from alkaline brines. Percolating waters convert magadiite to kenyaite and eventually to chert. Thus a mechanism has been outlined for the formation of bedded chert deposits through inorganic precipitation. Alternations between silica-rich and iron-rich bands of iron formations may be due to concentration cycles in alkaline lakes."

Earthquake rates in New Guinea, but not in Panama, are sufficiently high so that substantial areas of disturbed, nonclimax forest may accumulate. In New Guinea, earthquake-caused landslides are as important as tree falls in the disturbance regime."
https://openalex.org/W2059020190,"Male giant water bugs (Abedus herberti Hidalgo) brood eggs attached to their backs by their mates. Brooders risk being ""cuckolded"" because females store sperm from previous matings. Males always copulate with females prior to receiving their eggs and mate repeatedly during oviposition. Experiments with a genetic marker reveal almost complete sperm precedence for the last male to mate with a female. The male's behavior therefore assures his paternity of the eggs he broods."
https://openalex.org/W2074968164,Field-caught larvae of the estuarine crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii have a tidal rhythm of vertical migration when maintained in constant conditions. Laboratory-reared larvae do not show this rhythm. Endogenous tidal vertical migrations aid the retention of these planktonic larvae in estuaries near the parent populations.
https://openalex.org/W2015703911,Causes for the reduced cover of native species of coastal sage scrub in certain southern Californian sites wvere sought among 43 habitat variables. The mean annual concentration of oxidants (which averaged 18 parts per 100 million on the 11 most polluted sites) is statistically indicated as the most likely causal factor. Sites of high oxidant levels in the region are also characterized by declining species richness and equitability.
https://openalex.org/W2045813831,"Theories of incest tabus usually stress the psychosocial advantages of marriage regulation. But marriage regulation may produce delays in mating and thus loss of fertility to a population. Computer microsimulation experiments measure the amount of fertility that must be achieved outside a normatively specified marriage system in order to keep population constant. This amount varies directly with scope of tabu and inversely with population size. For populations of hundreds it is negligible, but for populations of dozens it can be very great. In the latter, flexibility of marital arrangements may permit maintenance of fertility without repeated revision of rules of marriage."

https://openalex.org/W2028383349,"A layer of water at a depth of 200 meters containing 3 to 12 milligrams per liter of oil was found during February and March 1978 over a distance of 800 nautical miles in the southwest North Atlantic and the eastern Caribbean. The geochemistry and carbon-14 activity of the oil shows it to be a weathered crude, probably from a submarine seep. Although the dimensions of the oily layer were not determined, conservative estimates indicate that more than I megaton could have been present."

https://openalex.org/W2005603839,"The nuclear industries of Europe and Japan plan to use plutonium in commercial reactors. They will, by the end of the century, have separated and placed into commerce more than 300,000 kilograms of plutonium. This prospect derives from the decisions of several major countries, including France, Great Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy, to separate chemically the plutonium and uranium from the highly radioactive fission products contained in the spent fuel from their commercial reactors (a procedure called reprocessing) and to recycle this plutonium and uranium into reactor fuel for breeder reactors and light water reactors. Such recycling differs from the once-through fuel cycle in use today in that material usable in weapons is not isolated in the latter process."
https://openalex.org/W2032695652,"More than 1300 natural microdiamonds, mostly averaging 0.0015 carat, were studied for transparency to ultraviolet radiation, lambda2537. Of most of them, of this size, 16 percent were completely transparent (presumably type II); 27 percent, completely absorbent (presumably type I). The remainder transmitted partially. The number of type-II diamonds is unexpectedly very high; a considerable proportion of microdiamonds may begin life as type II, later incorporating absorbent type-I material."
https://openalex.org/W2119250006,"The choice of theme for this Nobel lecture presents some difficulty for me. Usually the lecture is connected with work recognized by the prize. In my case, the prize was awarded for work in low-temperature physics, at temperatures of liquid helium, a few degrees above absolute zero. It so happened that I left this field some 30 years ago, although at the institute under my directorship low-temperature research is still being done. Personally I am now studying plasma phenomena at those very high temperatures that are necessary for the thermonuclear reaction to take place. This research has led to interesting results and has opened new possibilities, and I think that as a subject for the lecture this is of more interest than my past low-temperature work. For, it is said, les extremes se touchent."

https://openalex.org/W4234929788,"In Bernard D. Davis' article ""Bacterial domestication: Underlying assumptions"" (Policy Forum, 13 Mar., p. 1329), the word ""no"" was erroneously omitted from the last sentence of the first full paragraph in column two on page 1334. The sentence should have read, ""But this view builds on a parallel between genetic engineering and the physical technologies, rather than on a much closer model, with very different predictions: the domestication of wild organisms, resulting in enormous benefits and no catastrophes."""

https://openalex.org/W4237266730,"The opening sentence of Igor B. Dawid's review (6 Feb., p. 695) of Gene Activity in Early Development by Eric H. Davidson was incorrectly printed. The first paragraph of the review should have read as follows. ""As in the two earlier editions of Davidson's standard work, much of this new book is devoted to discussion of quantitative work on RNA accumulation and distribution during development. Davidson also discusses in detail spatial regulation of gene expression in the embryo and its relationship to lineage determination, providing a strongly comparative point of view and generating broad and well-balanced interpretations of large bodies of connected facts. The result is an excellent book that represents the field from a personal yet broadly convincing vantage point."""
