https://openalex.org/W2888159029,"Physician questionnaires are commonly used in health services research; however, many survey studies are limited by low response rate. We describe the effectiveness of a method to maximize survey response without using incentives, the effectiveness of survey reminders over time, and differences in response rates based on survey mode and primary care specialty. As part of a study to assess vaccine policy issues, 13 separate surveys were conducted by internet and mail over the period of 2008 to 2013. Surveys were conducted among pre-recruited networks of pediatricians, family physicians and general internists. Each network was active for 2 years and responded to 3-6 surveys. Physicians who indicated preference to respond through an online survey received up to 9 e-mailed requests to complete the questionnaire and up to 2 mailed questionnaires. Physicians who chose to respond by mail received up to 3 mailed questionnaires and a reminder postcard. For 6 of the 13 surveys conducted over the 6 year period, an additional mailing using a hand-addressed envelope was mailed to non-responders at the end of the usual protocol. Effectiveness of survey methods was measured by response rates. The overall response rates varied from 66‒83%. Response rates declined 17 percentage-points on average between the first and last surveys administered within each physician network. The internet group consistently had higher response rates than the mail group (74% vs. 62% on average). An additional mailing in a hand-written envelope boosted the final response rate by 11 percentage-points. Self-selection of survey mode, multiple reminders, and hand-written envelopes are effective methods for maximizing response rates in physician surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2888244480,"Background To improve nutritional status and prevent chronic nutrition-related diseases, international organizations have recommended the use of multiple strategies, including front-of-package nutrition labelling (FOPL). In France, the Nutri-Score has been selected by health authorities in March 2017. However, to be effective in purchasing situations, the label needs to be well understood, which may be influenced by label format and sociodemographic characteristics. This study aimed at investigating the objective understanding of the Nutri-Score compared to other label formats, and more particularly among specific at-risk populations. Methods The objective understanding of four FOPLs—namely Nutri-Score, Multiple Traffic Lights (MTL), the simplified nutrition labelling system (SENS), and modified Reference Intakes (mRIs)—was investigated in a sample from the NutriNet-Santé French cohort (n = 3,751). Logistic regression mixed models were computed to assess the association of the four FOPLs, compared to a “no label” situation, on the consumers’ ability to rank products according to their overall nutritional quality. Objective understanding was also investigated according to sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Results Compared to a “no label” situation, all FOPLs were significantly associated to an increase in consumers’ ability to classify the products correctly, with wide disparities in results according to formats. The best performance was observed for the Nutri-Score (OR = 20.33(17.68–23.37)), followed by SENS (OR = 9.57(8.50–10.77)), MTL (OR = 3.55(3.20–3.93)) and mRIs (OR = 1.53(1.39–1.69)). This ranking was similar among all sub-populations and the ORs associated to the Nutri-Score were over 10, whichever the sub-group considered. Women, younger people, non-smokers, individuals with higher educational level and those with children had a higher capacity to identify healthier products (all P≤0.05). Conclusion Nutri-Score, with a summarized graded and color-coded format, using semantic colours, is associated to a higher objective understanding than monochrome and nutrient-specific labels. Furthermore, though objective understanding may differ according to individual characteristics of subjects, the magnitude of effect of the Nutri-Score largely outweighed this effect, even in the at-risk populations."
https://openalex.org/W2888447563,"Background Food insecurity is associated with a wide array of negative health outcomes and higher health care costs but there has been no population-based study of the association of food insecurity and mortality in high-income countries. Methods We use cross-sectional population surveys linked to encoded health administrative data. The sample is 90,368 adults, living in Ontario and respondents in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). The outcome of interest is all-cause mortality at any time after the interview and within four years of the interview. The primary variable of interest is food insecurity status, with individuals classed as “food secure”, “marginally food insecure”, “moderately food insecure”, or “severely food insecure”. We use logistic regression models to determine the association of mortality with food insecurity status, adjusting for other social determinants of health. Results Using a full set of covariates, in comparison to food secure individuals, the odds of death at any point after the interview are 1.28 (CI = 1.08, 1.52) for marginally food insecure individuals, 1.49 (CI = 1.29, 1.73) for moderately food insecure individuals, and 2.60 (CI = 2.17, 3.12) for severely food insecure individuals. When mortality within four years of the interview is considered, the odds are, respectively, 1.19 (CI = 0.95, 1.50), 1.65 (CI = 1.37, 1.98), and 2.31 (CI = 1.81, 2.93). Interpretation These findings demonstrate that food insecurity is associated with higher mortality rates and these higher rates are especially large for the most severe food insecurity category. Efforts to reduce food insecurity should be incorporated into broader public health initiatives to reduce mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2888026930,"Osteoarthritis (OA), a common chronic joint disorder in both humans and canines, is characterized by a progressive loss of articular cartilage. Canines can serve as an animal model of OA for human medicine, and this research can simultaneously establish effective veterinary treatments for canine OA. One attractive treatment that can lead to cartilage regeneration is the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, for canine OA, little information is available regarding the best source of MSCs. The purpose of this study was to identify a promising MSC source for canine cartilage regeneration. We collected synovial, infrapatellar fat pad, inguinal adipose, and bone marrow tissues from six canines and then conducted a donor-matched comparison of the properties of MSCs derived from these four tissues. We examined the surface epitope expression, proliferation capacity, and trilineage differentiation potential of all four populations. Adherent cells derived from all four tissue sources exhibited positivity for CD90 and CD44 and negativity for CD45 and CD11b. The positive rate for CD90 was higher for synovium-derived than for adipose-derived and bone marrow-derived MSCs. Synovium-derived and infrapatellar fat pad-derived MSCs displayed substantial proliferation ability, and all four populations underwent trilineage differentiation. During chondrogenesis, the wet weight was heavier for cartilage pellets derived from synovium MSCs than from the other three sources. The synovium is therefore a promising source for MSCs for canine cartilage regeneration. Our findings provide useful information about canine MSCs that may be applicable to regenerative medicine for treatment of OA."
https://openalex.org/W2888027311,"Prostate cancer (PCa) causes a common male urinary system malignant tumour, and the molecular mechanisms of PCa are related to the abnormal regulation of various signalling pathways. An increasing number of studies have suggested that mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs could play important roles in various biological processes that are associated with cancer pathogenesis. This study aims to reveal functional genes and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCa with bioinformatics.Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the online tool GEO2R based on the R software limma package. Interactions between differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs was selected to construct mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and transcription factors were annotated. Expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis.The results demonstrate that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue.Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs established a new prostate cancer network. In addition, we conducted functional module analysis within the network. In conclusion, this study provides new insight for exploration of the molecular mechanisms of PCa and valuable clues for further research into the process of tumourigenesis and its development in PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2888307256,"Introduction Prognostication in cancer is challenging and inaccurate. C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a cheap and sensitive marker of inflammation may help. This study investigated the relationship between CRP and prognosis in a large cohort of solid tumors with mixed cancer diagnoses and stages. Methods Electronic medical records of 4931 adults with solid tumors who attended the Taussig Cancer Institute from 2006–2012 were reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. Maximum CRP (mCRP) was identified for each individual. CRP was analysed as a time-dependent, continuous and categorical variable for association with survival. Results Two thirds of patients had a high mCRP. This was consistently associated with shorter survival, even after correction for time from diagnosis, and when analysed as a continuous or a categorical variable. When mCRP values above 10 mg/L were subcategorized, a higher mCRP was always worse. Even among those with normal values, statistically and clinically significant shorter survival was noted at mCRP levels >5 mg/L. Conclusions In a large representative cohort of consecutive solid tumor patients the risk of death was clinically and statistically significantly greater with a high mCRP. This was independent of other variables and regardless of statistical method from both dates of diagnosis and test. CRP appeared to be underutilized. Our results support the routine use of CRP as a universal cost-effective independent prognostic indicator in most solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2888470228,"Background This study evaluates an eight-session behavior change health intervention with women’s self-help groups (SHGs) aimed to promote healthy maternal and newborn practices among the more socially and economically marginalized groups. Methods Using a pre-post quasi-experimental design, a total of 545 SHGs were divided into two groups: a control group, which received the usual microcredit intervention; and an intervention group, which received additional participatory training around maternal, neonatal, and child health issues. Women members of SHGs who had a live birth in the 12 months preceding the survey were surveyed on demographics, practices around maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH), and collectivization. Outcome effects were assessed using difference-in-difference (DID) methods. Results Women from the SHGs with health intervention, relative to controls over time (time 1 to time 2), were more likely to: use contraceptive methods (DID: 9 percentage points [pp], p<0.001), have institutional delivery (DID: 9pp, p<0.05), practice skin-to-skin care (DID: 17pp, p<0.05), delay bathing for 3 or more days (DID: 19pp, p<0.001), initiate timely breastfeeding (DID: 21pp, p<0.001), exclusively breastfeed the child (DID: 27pp, p<0.001), and provide age-appropriate immunization (DID: 9pp, p<0.001). Additionally, women from the SHGs with health intervention when compared to the control group over time were more likely to report: collective efficacy (DID: 17pp, p<0.001), support through accompanying SHG members for antenatal care (DID: 8pp, p<0.05), receive a visit from SHG member within 2 days post-delivery (DID: 32pp, p<0.001), and receive reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health information from an SHG member (DID: 45pp, p<0.001). Conclusion Findings demonstrate that structured participatory communication on MNCH with women’s groups improve positive health practices. In addition, SHGs can reach a substantial proportion of women while providing an avenue for pregnant women and young mothers to be assisted by others in learning and practicing healthy behaviors, thus building social cohesion on health."
https://openalex.org/W2888595662,"Introduction Flavored e-cigarettes are enticing to new users and established cigarette smokers using e-cigarettes to quit smoking due to the wide variety of flavor options. However, specific flavor combinations that are popular among e-cigarette users are understudied. Recently, the Deeming rule extended the US Food and Drug Administration’s authority over all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Methods The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study Wave 2 data were analyzed to assess the prevalence of self-reported flavor categories that are used individually and in combination with other flavor categories among past 30-day youth and adult e-cigarette users in the US. Results Most youth and adult participants reported using a flavored e-cigarette. Reporting an individual flavor category was more common than reporting a combination of flavor categories. Fruit flavor was the most common flavor category reported among youth, and ‘menthol/mint’ was most common among adults. Fruit and candy/other sweets were the most common flavor categories reported together among both youth and adult past 30-day e-cigarette users. Conclusions The use of flavored e-cigarettes is very popular among youth and adults. Most consumers reported using a single flavor category, although some consumers did use a combination of flavor categories. Preference for menthol/mint among adults may represent a carryover from associations with tobacco cigarettes. Typically, sweeter flavors, such as fruit, were among the most popular flavor categories reported, both individually and in combination with other flavors, while more bitter flavors (i.e.: clove/spice) were less common. Implications This study identified predominant flavor categories among past 30-day youth and adult e-cigarette users. Findings indicate that the wide variety of flavors available and the freedom to “mix-and-match” flavors may maintain use of e-cigarettes among youth and adults, and future research should focus on the composition of the ENDS liquid/vapor to disentangle the contributions of sweeteners and flavorants."
https://openalex.org/W2888386364,"Background The risks of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) associated with antithrombotic drugs outside clinical trials are gaining increased attention. The aim of this nationwide study was to investigate the risk of ICH requiring hospital admission in users of antithrombotic drugs. Methods and findings Data from the Norwegian Patient Registry and Norwegian Prescription Database were linked on an individual level. The primary outcome was incidence rates of ICH associated with use of antithrombotic drugs. Secondary endpoints were risk of ICH and fatal outcome following ICH assessed by Cox models. Among 3,131,270 individuals ≥18 years old observed from 2008 through 2014, there were 729,818 users of antithrombotic medications and 22,111 ICH hospitalizations. Annual crude ICH rates per 100 person-years were 0.076 (95% CI, 0.075–0.077) in non-users and 0.30 (95% CI, 0.30–0.31) in users of antithrombotic medication, with the highest age and sex adjusted rates observed for aspirin-dipyridamole plus clopidogrel (0.44; 95% CI, 0.19–0.69), rivaroxaban plus aspirin (0.36; 95% CI, 0.16–0.56), warfarin plus aspirin (0.34; 95% CI, 0.26–0.43), and warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (0.33; 95% CI, 0.073–0.60). With no antithrombotic medication as reference, the highest adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for ICH were observed for aspirin-dypiridamole plus clopidogrel (6.29; 95% CI 3.71–10.7), warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (4.38; 95% CI 2.71–7.09), rivaroxaban plus aspirin (3.82; 95% CI, 2.46–5.95), and warfarin plus aspirin (3.40; 95% CI, 2.99–3.86). All antithrombotic medication regimens were associated with an increased risk of ICH, except dabigatran monotherapy (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.88–1.65) and dabigatran plus aspirin (HR 1.79; 95% CI, 0.96–3.34). Fatal outcome within 90 days was more common in users (2,603 of 8,055) than non-users (3,228 of 14,056) of antithrombotic medication (32.3% vs 23.0%, p<0.001), and was associated with use of warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (HR 2.89; 95% CI, 1.49–5.60), warfarin plus aspirin (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11–1.68), aspirin plus clopidogrel (HR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05–1.61), and warfarin (HR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09–1.31). Increased one-year mortality was observed in users of antithrombotic medication following hemorrhagic stroke, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic ICH (all p<0.001). Limitations include those inherent to observational studies including the inability to make causal inferences, certain assumptions regarding drug exposure, and the possibility of residual confounding. Conclusions The real-world incidence rates and risks of ICH were generally higher than reported in randomized controlled trials. There is still major room for improvement in terms of antithrombotic medication safety (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02481011)."
https://openalex.org/W2888769798,"Amoeboid movement is one of the most widespread forms of cell motility that plays a key role in numerous biological contexts. While many aspects of this process are well investigated, the large cell-to-cell variability in the motile characteristics of an otherwise uniform population remains an open question that was largely ignored by previous models. In this article, we present a mathematical model of amoeboid motility that combines noisy bistable kinetics with a dynamic phase field for the cell shape. To capture cell-to-cell variability, we introduce a single parameter for tuning the balance between polarity formation and intracellular noise. We compare numerical simulations of our model to experiments with the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Despite the simple structure of our model, we found close agreement with the experimental results for the center-of-mass motion as well as for the evolution of the cell shape and the overall intracellular patterns. We thus conjecture that the building blocks of our model capture essential features of amoeboid motility and may serve as a starting point for more detailed descriptions of cell motion in chemical gradients and confined environments."
https://openalex.org/W2888297578,"Objectives To examine longitudinal changes in structural and functional connectivity post-stroke in patients with motor impairment, and define their importance for recovery and outcome at 12 months. Methods First-time stroke patients (N = 31) were studied at 1–2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months post-injury with a validated motor battery and resting-state fMRI to measure inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC). Fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cortico-spinal tract (CST) was derived from diffusion tensor imaging as a measure of white matter organization. ANOVAs were used to test for changes in FC, FA, and motor performance scores over time, and regression analysis related motor outcome to clinical and neuroimaging variables. Results FA of the ipsilesional CST improved significantly from 3 to 12 months and was strongly correlated with motor performance. FA improved even in the absence of direct damage to the CST. Inter-hemispheric FC also improved over time, but did not correlate with motor performance at 12 months. Clinical variables (early motor score, education level, and age) predicted 80.4% of the variation of motor outcome, and FA increased the predictability to 84.6%. FC did not contribute to the prediction of motor outcome. Conclusions Stroke causes changes to the CST microstructure that can account for behavioral variability even in the absence of demonstrable lesion. Ipsilesional CST undergoes remodeling post-stroke, even past the three-month window when most of the motor recovery happens. FA of the CST, but not inter-hemispheric FC, can improve to the prediction of motor outcome based on early motor scores."
https://openalex.org/W2888588287,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder for which the current medical therapy is not completely effective. Bovine colostrum (BC) is a biological fluid rich in bioactive molecules that may have beneficial effects on several gastrointestinal disorders. The objectives of this study were to assess the preventive effects of BC supplementation in a mouse model of 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis using a multidisciplinary approach. Specifically, the following parameters were evaluated: (i) disease activity index (DAI), (ii) histological score, (iii) expression levels of TLR4, anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and (iv) count of some bacterial species of the intestinal microbiota. Mice received a daily suspension of BC (BC group, n = 12) or saline solution (control, CN group, n = 12) for 21 days before the intrarectal inoculation with 1% of TNBS solution. BC was well tolerated and did not induce any histological damage or clinical symptoms. After TNBS treatment, BC group showed a reduction of body weight (BW) loss (P<0.01) and histological score (P<0.05) compared to CN. Moreover, the expression levels of TLR4 (P<0.05), IL-1β (P<0.001), IL-8 (P<0.001), and IL-10 (P<0.001) were lower in mice administered with BC, while the concentrations of TNF-α did not show any differences between groups. Finally, the supplementation with BC resulted in a differential response to TNBS treatment in the bacterial count. In CN group, E. coli and Enterococci increased (P<0.001), while Anaerobes (P<0.01), Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria (P<0.001) reduced. Conversely, no significant changes in bacterial load were found after the inoculation of TNBS in BC pre-treated mice. This study confirms that TNBS-induced colitis model in mice is useful for studying the mechanisms involved in IBD pathogenesis and shows that pre-treatment with BC reduces the intestinal damages and clinical signs of the colitis. Molecular mechanisms and intestinal microflora could be involved in the protective effect of colostrum."
https://openalex.org/W2888735220,"We determined the range of normal spleen dimensions evaluated by ultrasonography (US) in children according to sex and age and the relationship between splenic measurements, auxological data and body proportions, in order to define splenomegaly parameters in support of the surgical mini-invasive approaches in pediatrics.We prospectively examined 317 caucasian children of both sexes. The patients were divided into three groups: 0-3 years; 4-10 years; 11-18 years. Sex, weight, height/length, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and xipho-pubic distance were determined for each child. US spleen evaluation included longitudinal/antero-posterior/transverse diameters, transverse area and volume. Spleen volume/abdominal volume, longitudinal spleen diameter/longitudinal left kidney diameter and longitudinal spleen diameter/xipho-pubic distance ratios were also calculated.For caucasian subjects, in different age groups spleen volume, transverse area and diameter increased while the spleen/abdominal volume ratio decreased significantly (p<0.001). A significant (p<0.001) decrease in longitudinal spleen diameter/xipho-pubic distance ratio was noted between the 0-3 years group and both 4-10 and 11-18 years group. Age and auxological data, except BMI, showed a high correlation with spleen dimension (r≥0.8).The current concept of splenomegaly is not applicable in pediatric surgery. A dedicated classification of splenomegaly is needed for children and would improve the safety and feasibility of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2888321881,"Callus distraction is sometimes associated with a delay in the maturation process and serious complications. It is believed that these complications are often caused by instability of the bone segment fixation. Typical fixation devices, such as ring-fixators, show significant deformations in all directions under external loading and muscle forces. This leads to axial compression and tension as well as shear movements in the healing area. Herein we investigated the hypothesis that the direction of interfragmentary movement after callus distraction affects the bone formation and revascularization during the maturation process. Two custom fixator systems were designed to apply a protocol of lateral callus distraction and subsequent cyclic stimulation of the regenerate tissue. One fixator system was used to apply either compressive or tensile stimulation while the other was used to apply shearing stimulation. The fixators were applied to the tibial surface of the right hind leg of sheep specimens. During lateral callus distraction, a titanium plate was elevated by 0.275 mm perpendicular to the long axis of the bone twice daily, resulting in a 5.5 mm gap at the end of the ten-day distraction phase. Following a seven-day consolidation phase, the regenerate in the gap between tibial cortex and titanium plate was stimulated once daily by cyclic movement for 120 cycles. The stimulation was applied for 18 days with amplitudes of 0.6 mm in compression (Group C) or tension (Group T), or a 1.0 mm shear amplitude (Group S). Seven weeks postoperatively the specimens were analyzed for quantity of bone formation, the presence of cartilage and fibrous tissue, and blood vessel density. There was a significantly higher blood vessel density (4.6 ± 1.6%) in Group C than in Group T (1.2 ± 0.4%) or Group S (1.0 ± 0.5%) (p < 0.01). The amount of bone was significantly higher in Group C (25.6% ± 13.0%) than in Group T (13.5 ± 4.9%) (p < 0.05). Group S showed a similar amount of bone (14.0 ± 10.7%) to Group T. The results show that bone formation and revascularization are dependent on the direction of interfragmentary movement and that the cyclic compression best stimulates the healing process."
https://openalex.org/W2888287254,"Recordings of smartphone use for contacts are increasingly being used as alternative or supplementary measurement methods for social interactions and social relations in the health sciences. Less work has been done to understand how these measures compare with widely used survey-based information. Using data from the Copenhagen Network Study, we investigated whether derived survey and smartphone measures on two widely studied concepts; Social integration and Tie strength were associated. The study population included 737 college students (mean age 21.6 years, Standard deviation: 2.6), who were followed with surveys and continuous recordings of smartphone usage over a one-month period. We derived self-reported and smartphone measures of social integration (social role diversity, social network size), and tie strength (contact frequency, duration and tie reciprocity). Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between smartphone derived and self-reported measures adjusting for gender, age and co-habitation. Larger call and text message networks were associated with having a high self-reported social role diversity, and a high self-reported social contact frequency was likewise associated with having both frequent call and text message interactions, longer call duration and a higher level of reciprocity in call and text message communication. Self-reported aspects of social relations and smartphone measures of social interactions have considerable overlap supporting a measurement of similar underlying concepts."
https://openalex.org/W2888114155,"Background The aim was to evaluate the impact of asthma on patients’ Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) by comparing asthmatic women and men with reference norms, to examine the factors which contributed to an impaired HRQoL, and to identify groups at higher risk. Methods Cross-sectional evaluation of 222 primary care patients with persistent asthma (18–40 years old). HRQoL impact was estimated with the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), which allows calculating Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) by applying society preferences. Participants self-completed the EQ-5D questionnaire online. Telephonic interviews collected information on medication and adherence, and administered the Asthma Control Questionnaire. Severity markers included asthma-related comorbidity, previous oral corticosteroids course prescription, and inhaled corticosteroids daily dose. After bivariate analyses, multiple linear regression models were constructed to examine the relations between HRQoL asthma impact and socio-demographic and clinical variables, using as dependent variable the deviation from general population-based EQ-5D reference norms. Results Deviation from the EQ-5D index norms was moderate in most age/gender groups (-0.1, which corresponds to 0.6 standard deviations), while it was large in women aged 18–24 years (-0.18, corresponding to 1.1 standard deviations). In regression models, a poor asthma control was the only factor independently associated to HRQoL impact in both women and men: β -0.18 (p<0.001) and -0.15 (p = 0.01) respectively. Translating these β coefficients to QALYs, they are interpretable as 66 fewer days of full health per year in women with uncontrolled asthma and 55 for men, compared with those with controlled asthma. Conclusion Persistent asthma has a moderately negative HRQoL impact on patients of both genders, and the youngest women have been identified as a high risk group which merits further research. We identified asthma control as the major contributor to impaired HRQoL in patients, regardless of their gender, suggesting that asthma HRQoL impact could be alleviated by achieving a good control of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2888358206,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in both geriatric cats and aging humans, and is pathologically characterised by chronic tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis in both species. Cats with CKD may represent a spontaneously occurring, non-rodent animal model of human disease, however little is known of feline renal cell biology. In other species, TGF-β1 signalling in the proximal tubular epithelium is thought to play a key role in the initiation and progression of renal fibrosis. In this study, we first aimed to isolate and characterise feline proximal tubular epithelial cells (FPTEC), comparing them to human primary renal epithelial cells (HREC) and the human proximal tubular cell line HK-2. Secondly, we aimed to examine and compare the effect of human recombinant TGF-β1 on cell proliferation, pro-apoptotic signalling and genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in feline and human renal epithelial cells. FPTEC were successfully isolated from cadaverous feline renal tissue, and demonstrated a marker protein expression profile identical to that of HREC and HK-2. Exposure to TGF-β1 (0–10 ng/ml) induced a concentration-dependent loss of epithelial morphology and alterations in gene expression consistent with the occurrence of partial EMT in all cell types. This was associated with transcription of downstream pro-fibrotic mediators, growth arrest in FPTEC and HREC (but not HK-2), and increased apoptotic signalling at high concentrations of TGF- β1. These effects were inhibited by the ALK5 (TGF-β1RI) antagonist SB431542 (5 μM), suggesting they are mediated via the ALK5/TGF-β1RII receptor complex. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-β1 may be involved in epithelial cell dedifferentiation, growth arrest and apoptosis in feline CKD as in human disease, and that cats may be a useful, naturally occurring model of human CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2888223238,"Mycobacterium bovis infection in cattle persists in Mexico, posing a threat to human health. Control of bovine tuberculosis, through the National Program Against Bovine Tuberculosis, has led to the decrease of disease prevalence in most of the country, except for high dairy production regions. Genotyping of M. bovis has been performed mainly by spoligotyping and variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), but higher resolution power can be useful for a finer definition of the spread of the disease. Whole genome sequencing and spoligotyping was performed for a set of 322 M. bovis isolates from different sources in Mexico: Baja California, Coahuila, Estado de Mexico, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Queretaro and Veracruz, from dairy and beef cattle, as well as humans. Twelve main genetic clades were obtained through WGS and genetic diversity analysis. A clear differentiation of the Baja California isolates was seen as they clustered together exclusively. However, isolates from the central states showed no specific clustering whatsoever. Although WGS proves to have higher resolving power than spoligotyping, and since there was concordance between WGS and spoligotyping results, we consider that the latter is still an efficient and practical method for monitoring bovine tuberculosis in developing countries, where resources for higher technology are scarce."
https://openalex.org/W2888478711,"Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is the world's most widely cultured fish species. Therefore, its nutritional physiology is of great interest from an aquaculture perspective. Studies conducted on several fish species, including tilapia, demonstrated the beneficial effects of dietary salt supplementation on growth; however, the mechanism behind these beneficial effects is still not fully understood. The fish intestine is a complex system, with functions, such as nutrient absorption, ion equilibrium and acid-base balance that are tightly linked and dependent on each other's activities and products. Ions are the driving force in the absorption of feed components through pumps, transporters and protein channels. In this study, we examined the impact of 5% increase in dietary NaCl on protein, lipid, ash and dry matter digestibility, as well as on the expression of intestinal peptide transporters (PepTs) and ion pumps (Na+/K+-ATPase, V-H+-ATPase, N+/H+-Exchanger) in Nile tilapia. In addition, effects on the gut microbiome were evaluated. Our results show that dietary salt supplementation significantly increased digestibility of all measured nutritional components, peptide transporters expression and ion pumps activity. Moreover, changes in the gut microbial diversity were observed, and were associated with lipid digestibility and Na+/K+-ATPase expression."
https://openalex.org/W2888487881,"Preclinical studies of novel compounds rely on quantitative readouts from animal models. Frequently employed readouts from histopathological tissue scoring are time consuming, require highly specialized staff and are subject to inherent variability. Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) now allow automating such scoring tasks. Here, we demonstrate this for the case of the Ashcroft fibrosis score and a newly developed inflammation score to characterize fibrotic and inflammatory lung diseases. Sections of lung tissue from mice exhibiting a wide range of fibrotic and inflammatory states were stained with Masson trichrome. Whole slide scans using a 20x objective were acquired and cut into smaller tiles of 512x512 pixels. The tiles were subsequently classified by specialized CNNs, either an “Ashcroft fibrosis CNN” or an “inflammation CNN”. For the Ashcroft fibrosis score the CNN was fine-tuned by using 14000 labelled tiles. For the inflammation score the CNN was trained with 3500 labelled tiles. After training, the Ashcroft fibrosis CNN achieved an accuracy of 79.5% and the inflammation CNN an accuracy of 80.0%. An error analysis revealed that misclassifications are almost exclusively with neighboring scores, which reflects the inherent ambiguity of parts of the data. The variability between two experts was found to be larger than the variability between the CNN classifications and the ground truth. The CNN generated Ashcroft score was in very good agreement with the score of a pathologist (r2 = 0.92). Our results demonstrate that costly and time consuming scoring tasks can be automated and standardized with deep learning. New scores such as the inflammation score can be easily developed with the approach presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2888761488,"Understanding the uterine source of the electrophysiological activity of contractions during pregnancy is of scientific interest and potential clinical applications. In this work, we propose a method to estimate uterine source currents from magnetomyography (MMG) temporal course measurements on the abdominal surface. In particular, we develop a linear forward model, based on the quasistatic Maxwell’s equations and a realistic four-compartment volume conductor, relating the magnetic fields to the source currents on the uterine surface through a lead-field matrix. To compute the lead-field matrix, we use a finite element method that considers the anisotropic property of the myometrium. We estimate the source currents by minimizing a constrained least-squares problem to solve the non-uniqueness issue of the inverse problem. Because we lack the ground truth of the source current, we propose to predict the intrauterine pressure from our estimated source currents by using an absolute-value-based method and compare the result with real abdominal deflection recorded during contractile activity. We test the feasibility of the lead-field matrix by displaying the lead fields that are generated by putative source currents at different locations in the myometrium: cervix and fundus, left and right, front and back. We then illustrate our method by using three synthetic MMG data sets, which are generated using our previously developed multiscale model of uterine contractions, and three real MMG data sets, one of which has simultaneous real abdominal deflection measurements. The numerical results demonstrate the ability of our method to capture the local contractile activity of human uterus during pregnancy. Moreover, the predicted intrauterine pressure is in fair agreement with the real abdominal deflection with respect to the timing of uterine contractions."
https://openalex.org/W2888547118,"Background Symptoms indicating acute coronary syndrome are commonly seen in emergency rooms, but only 10% of patients are actually diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The Guidelines for the diagnosis of patients with suspected AMI include either multiple testing of cardiac troponin (cTN) or a single combined test of cTN and copeptin, which facilitates earlier diagnosis or exclusion of AMI. The aim of the present analysis was to investigate the impact of combined copeptin/cTN testing on health care resource consumption and related costs both during and after initial hospital treatment. Methods and results The analysis was based on the BIC-8 trial and financial data of participating study sites. A cost analysis was carried out primarily from the hospital perspective and secondarily from the perspective of German statutory health insurers. The underlying assumptions of the investigation were tested for robustness in additional sensitivity analyses. In total, the data of 713 patients (n = 359 combined copeptin/cTN testing, n = 354 serial cTN testing) were evaluated. From a hospital perspective, the combined copeptin/cTN testing showed a reduced number of medical procedures and a lower frequency of inpatient admissions. The average staff time was significantly reduced by a mean of 49 minutes (95% confidence interval (CI) 46 to 53) per patient, accompanied by a significant mean reduction of 131 minutes (95%CI 104 to 158) in the time patients stayed in the emergency room. The initial hospital treatment was less cost-intensive. Over the entire study period, no significant cost differences were observed between the groups for health insurance. Conclusion The combined copeptin/cTN testing has the potential to save costs and staff time in acute care and for the entire hospital stay. The primary explanations for these findings are early identification and ruling out patients without AMI along with the associated reduced need for acute medical treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2888184304,"The “three stages” division of coal spontaneous combustion is fuzzy and lacks adequate risk and warning levels corresponding to its divisions; additionally, the targeted prevention measures for each stage have not been described. To address the shortcomings of the “three stages” division, the “five stages” division was proposed to more clearly analyze the stage changes of the spontaneous combustion of coal. The “five stages” method divides the process of the spontaneous combustion of coal into five stages, including: the latent stage, heat accumulating stage, evaporation stage, active stage, and hypoxic stage. The critical point of each stage was determined using adiabatic oxidation experiments and programmed heat experiments. As the critical point of the latent stage, the temperature of zero activation energy is approximately 55–70°C. In the heat accumulating stage, the critical point is the temperature (approximately 90°C) where the external moisture of coal evaporates violently while the internal moisture of coal has not yet fully evaporated. During the evaporation stage, the temperature (approximately 105°C) where the internal moisture has evaporated completely represents the end of this stage and the start of the active stage (105–170°C). When the oxygen concentration drops to 5%, the spontaneous combustion of coal enters the hypoxic stage. Thus, an oxygen concentration of 5% represents the critical point of the start of the hypoxic stage (above 170°C). After the analysis of each stage, risk and warning levels were determined. Considering the major prevention measures of the spontaneous combustion of coal, a staged warning and disposal table was created."
https://openalex.org/W2888133729,"Purpose The prospective, comparative evaluation of combined navigated laser photocoagulation and intravitreal ranibizumab in the treatment of diabetic macular edema has shown advantage of a combination therapy compared to ranibizumab monotherapy at year 1 with significantly reduced injections. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the long-term visual gains and need of injections in a 3 year-follow-up period. Methods Retrospective analysis of patients of the original study in the long-term follow-up from month 12 to 36. BCVA measurements following the original 1 year study were taken using logMAR charts. Injections were provided with standard of care using PRN, based on change in BCVA and CRT using SD-OCT scans. Main outcome measures were change in BCVA and mean number of injections from 12 to 36 months. Results BCVA was stable in both groups from 12 through 36 months, showing a change of 0.16 ± 0.1 log MAR. Following the initial reduction in required injections at month 12, combination therapy patients continued to require 1.3 times fewer injections over the next 24 months (2.91 ± 2.3 vs 3.85±3.7 injections for monotherapy). Conclusions Combination of navigated laser and ranibizumab achieved BCVA gains equivalent to anti-VEGF monotherapy. These results could be maintained through month 36. Required injections were 2.0 injections lower in year 1 and further 1.3 times fewer in year 2 and 3 in the combination group compared to monotherapy. Adding navigated laser photocoagulation to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may still represent a superior therapeutic approach to DME patients."
https://openalex.org/W2888623041,"This paper investigates suitability of supervised machine learning classification methods for classification of biomes using pollen datasets. We assign modern pollen samples from Africa and Arabia to five biome classes using a previously published African pollen dataset and a global ecosystem classification scheme. To test the applicability of traditional and machine-learning based classification models for the task of biome prediction from high dimensional modern pollen data, we train a total of eight classification models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. The ability of each model to predict biomes from pollen data is statistically tested on an independent test set. The Random Forest classifier outperforms other models in its ability correctly classify biomes given pollen data. Out of the eight models, the Random Forest classifier scores highest on all of the metrics used for model evaluations and is able to predict four out of five biome classes to high degree of accuracy, including arid, montane, tropical and subtropical closed and open systems, e.g. forests and savanna/grassland. The model has the potential for accurate reconstructions of past biomes and awaits application to fossil pollen sequences. The Random Forest model may be used to investigate vegetation changes on both long and short time scales, e.g. during glacial and interglacial cycles, or more recent and abrupt climatic anomalies like the African Humid Period. Such applications may contribute to a better understanding of past shifts in vegetation cover and ultimately provide valuable information on drivers of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2888241800,"High body mass index (BMI) is associated with development of hematological malignancies (HMs). However, although BMI is a well-established measurement of excess weight, it does not fully reflect body composition and can sometimes misclassify individuals. This study aimed at investigating what body composition measurements had highest association with development of HM. Body composition measurements on 27,557 individuals recorded by healthcare professionals as part of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study conducted in Sweden between 1991–1996 were matched with data from national registers on cancer incidence and causes of death. Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to test the association between one standard deviation increments in body composition measurements and risk of HM. During a median follow-up of 20 years, 564 persons developed an HM. Several body composition measurements were associated with risk of developing an HM, but the strongest association was found for multiple myeloma (MM). Waist circumference (HR 1.31, p = 0.04) and waist-hip ratio (HR 1.61, p = 0.05) had higher risk estimates than BMI (HR 1.18, p = 0.07) for MM. In conclusion, our study shows that measurements of abdominal adiposity better predict the risk of developing HM, particularly MM, compared to BMI."
https://openalex.org/W2888382934,"The control of Triatoma dimidiata, a major vector of Chagas disease, was believed to eliminate Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in Central America. This vector was known for its ability to repeatedly reinfest human dwellings even after initial insecticide spraying. Current vector control programs assume that community-based surveillance can maintain low levels of infestation over many years, despite a lack of evidence in the literature to corroborate this assumption. This study aims to evaluate long-term reinfestation risk in the Nicaraguan vector control program from 2010 to 2016.We collected data from a cohort of 395 houses in Pueblo Nuevo, Nicaragua. Primary data were collected through a field survey to assess post-intervention levels of T. dimidiata house infestation in 2016, two years after the large-scale insecticide spraying. We obtained secondary data from the records about past infestation levels and control activities between 2010 and 2015. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with post-intervention house infestation.The control program effectively reduced the infestation level from 2010 to 2014. Community-based surveillance was introduced in 2013; however, post-intervention infestation in 2016 had nearly reached pre-intervention levels in rural villages. Post-intervention house infestation was positively associated with poor wall construction, roofing tiles piled in the peri-domestic areas or the presence of dogs. Interestingly, the odds of post-intervention house infestation were one-fifth less when villagers sprayed their own houses regularly. Past infestation levels and the intensity of government-led insecticide spraying did not explain post-intervention house infestation.The vector control program failed to offer sustained reductions in T. dimidiata house infestation. This experience would suggest that community-based surveillance is an insufficient approach to suppressing T. dimidiata house infestation over many years. This study provides evidence to suggest that control policies for T. dimidiata should be reconsidered throughout Central America."
https://openalex.org/W2888570032,"International Guidelines for mineral bone disorders recommend that in Non Dialytic-Chronic Kidney Disease (ND-CKD) clinical decisions should be based on the trend of serum PTH changes over time rather than on a single value. However, the prognostic impact of these changes in ND-CKD patients remains unknown. We performed a multicenter cohort study in ND-CKD patients (stage 1-5) followed for 36 months in 24 Italian Nephrology Units. PTH changes (ΔPTH) were defined as the absolute differences between all available PTH measurements following the first control and basal value. Primary endpoint in this subanalysis was renal death (End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or all-causes death before ESRD). Association between renal death and ΔPTH was assessed by time-dependent Cox model for repeated measurements. Out of the original cohort (N = 884), we selected 543 patients (66.3±15.4 ys, 58.4% males) with at least two serum PTH measurements. At baseline, eGFR was 36 (IQR: 22.4-56.8) mL/min/1.73m2 and serum PTH 46 (IQR: 28-81) pg/mL. ΔPTH was in median 0 (IQR:-18/18) pg/mL. Basal predictors of longitudinal PTH increments were higher serum phosphate, more advanced CKD stages and lower serum PTH. Fully adjusted Cox model with ΔPTH quartiles as discrete time-dependent covariate showed a significant risk of renal death in the highest quartile (HR: 1.91; 95%CI:1.08-3.38; P = 0.026). Considering ΔPTH, as continuous time-dependent variable, (HR:1.02; 95%C.I.: 1.01-1.04; P = 0.004), risk of renal death progressively rose as ΔPTH increased. An increment in serum PTH over time is associated with a worse prognosis in ND-CKD patients, independently from baseline or any absolute concentration of serum PTH and phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2888590039,"All Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains whose DNA sequences have been determined possess filamentous phage sequences representing their full genomes. The presence of filamentous phage DNA sequences in all sequenced N. gonorrhoeae strains suggest that purified phage particles might be used as a gonococcal vaccine. To test this hypothesis, we purified filamentous NgoΦfil phages and immunized rabbits subcutaneously. The elicited sera contained large quantities of anti-phage IgG and IgA antibodies that bound to the surface of N. gonorrhoeae cells, as shown by ELISA and flow cytometry. The elicited sera bound to the structural NgoΦ6fil proteins present in phage particles and to N. gonorrhoeae cells. The sera did not react with gonococcal outer membrane proteins. The sera also had bactericidal activity and blocked adhesion of gonococci to tissue culture cells. These data demonstrate that NgoΦfil phage particles can induce antibodies with anti-gonococcal activity and may be a candidate for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2888571995,"Wall shear stress gradients (WSSGs) induce an inflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells (ECs) which is hypothesized to be mediated by mechanotransduction through the EC glycocalyx (GCX). We used a three-dimensional in vitro cell culture model with a 180o curved geometry to investigate if WSSGs created by curvature can cause EC inflammation and disruption of the GCX. The hydrodynamics of the model elicited a morphological response in ECs as well as a pattern of leukocyte adhesion towards the inner wall of curvature that was attenuated with enzymatic removal of GCX components. GCX degradation was also observed in regions of curvature which corresponded to increased activity of MMPs. Together, these results support the hypothesis that the EC GCX is involved in mechanotransduction of WSSGs and that components of the GCX are regulated by MMP activity in regions of curvature."
https://openalex.org/W2952324088,"Previous language production studies targeting the inferior frontal and superior temporal gyrus using anodal tDCS have provided mixed results. Part of this heterogeneity may be explained by limited target region focality of conventionally used electrode montages. We examined the focality of conventionally and alternative electrode montages. Electrical field distributions of anodal tDCS targeting IFG and pSTG were simulated in conventional setups (anodal electrode over left IFG/pSTG, reference electrode over right supraorbital region) and an alternative electrode montage in four different brains. Conventional montages showed maximum field strengths outside of the target regions. Results from alternative electrode montages showed that focality of tDCS could be improved by adjustments in electrode placement. Heterogeneity of findings of language production studies deploying conventional montages may in part be explained by diffuse electrical field distributions. Alternative montages may improve focality and provide more unequivocal results."
https://openalex.org/W2888250437,"Background Coronary artery calcification (CAC) and atherosclerotic inflammation associate with increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Vascular calcification is regulated by osteogenic proteins (OPs). It is unknown whether an association exists between CAC and plasma OPs and if they are affected by atherothrombotic inflammation. We tested the association of osteogenic and inflammatory proteins with CAC and assessed these biomarkers after MI. Methods Circulating OPs (osteoprotegerin, RANKL, fetuin-A, Matrix Gla protein [MGP]) and inflammatory proteins (C-reactive protein, oxidized-LDL, tumoral necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor [TGF]-β1) were compared between stable patients with CAC (CAC ≥ 100 AU, n = 100) and controls (CAC = 0 AU, n = 30). The association between biomarkers and CAC was tested by multivariate analysis. In patients with MI (n = 40), biomarkers were compared between acute phase and 1–2 months post-MI, using controls as a baseline. Results MGP and fetuin-A levels were higher within individuals with CAC. Higher levels of MGP and RANKL were associated with CAC (OR 3.12 [95% CI 1.20–8.11], p = 0.02; and OR 1.75 [95% CI 1.04–2.94] respectively, p = 0.035). After MI, C-reactive protein, OPG and oxidized-LDL levels increased in the acute phase, whereas MGP and TGF-β1 increased 1–2 months post-MI. Conclusions Higher MGP and RANKL levels associate with CAC. These findings highlight the potential role of these proteins as modulators and markers of CAC. In addition, the post-MI increase in OPG and MGP, as well as of inflammatory proteins suggest that the regulation of these OPs is affected by atherothrombotic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2888134672,"Objective To evaluate the long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcome of antenatal allopurinol treatment during suspected fetal hypoxia. Study design We studied children born from women who participated in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled multicenter study (ALLO-trial). Labouring women in whom the fetus was suspected to have fetal hypoxia were randomly allocated to receive allopurinol or placebo. At 5 years of age, the children were assessed with 2 parent reported questionnaires, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A child was marked abnormal for ASQ if it scored below 2 standard deviation under the normative mean of a reference population in at least one domain. For CBCL, a score above the cut-off value (95th percentile for narrowband scale, 85th percentile for broadband scale) in at least one scale was marked as abnormal. Results We obtained data from 138 out of the original 222 mildly asphyxiated children included in the ALLO-trial (response rate 62%, allopurinol n = 73, placebo n = 65). At 5 years of age, the number of children that scored abnormal on the ASQ were 11 (15.1%) in the allopurinol group versus 11 (9.2%) in the placebo group (relative risk (RR) 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64 to 4.17, p = 0.30). On CBCL 21 children (30.4%) scored abnormal in de allopurinol group versus 12 children (20.0%) in the placebo group (RR 1.52, 95% CI: 0.82 to 2.83, p = 0.18). Conclusion We found no proof that allopurinol administered to labouring women with suspected fetal hypoxia improved long-term developmental and behavioral outcome.

Participants carried a white dot with a delay to a target square while avoiding obstacle squares. The color of the target changed unpredictably between white and blue. A trial was considered as successful or failed if the dot reached the target while it was white or blue. Thus, actions during the task resulted in almost identical experiences of successful and failed trials. After each trial, the participants reported to what extent they felt that they had been in control of the dot. The results showed that SoA was higher with shorter delay (i.e., easier control) and in the successful trials. These findings indicate that the sense of online control and the evaluation of continuous action based on feedback independently influence SoA. Particularly, the evaluation retrospectively modulated SoA."
https://openalex.org/W2888402229,"In many animals the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity is controlled by an endogenous circadian clock. Using custom made housing and video tracking software in order to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution, we studied the statistical properties of the locomotor activity of wild type and two clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster. We show here that the distributions of activity and quiescence bouts for the clock mutants in light-dark conditions (LD) are very different from the distributions obtained when there are no external cues from the environment (DD). In the wild type these distributions are very similar, showing that the clock controls this aspect of behavior in both regimes (LD and DD). Furthermore, the distributions are very similar to those reported for Wistar rats. For the timing of events we also observe important differences, quantified by how the event rate distributions scale for increasing time windows. We find that for the wild type these distributions can be rescaled by the same function in DD as in LD. Interestingly, the same function has been shown to rescale the rate distributions in Wistar rats. On the other hand, for the clock mutants it is not possible to rescale the rate distributions, which might indicate that the extent of circadian control depends on the statistical properties of activity and quiescence."
https://openalex.org/W2888084391,"Aphids are serious agricultural insect pests which exploit the phloem sap of host plants and thus transmit pathogens to their hosts. However, the degree to which aphid parsitism affects the fitness of the host plants is not well understood. The aphid, Macrosiphoniella yomogicola, parasitizes the mugwort Artemisia montana in Japan. During summer most mugworts carry aphids, but most aphid colonies die out after the budding of A. montana inflorescences in late summer. A few aphid colonies survive to late autumn, at which point sexuparae appear to later lay overwintering eggs after copulation. The death of the aphid colonies seems to be caused by biochemical changes in the phloem sap in the host plant coincident with the budding of inflorescences. The surviving aphid colonies may suppress the budding of inflorescences to allow persistence of their genetic line into the following year. Our investigations demonstrate that aphid parasitism did not affect host plant growth, but that it did significantly decrease the number of inflorescences and the average weight of floral buds. Our results indicate that aphid parasitism has a strong negative effect on the fitness of host plants. The manner in which the aphids suppress floral budding in their hosts is worth examining from the perspective of the evolution of aphid-plant interactions."

Our objective was to investigate lipid, lipoprotein, apolipoprotein (apo), and glucose levels in individuals experiencing a CV event before 50 years of age.A first CV event [non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), coronary revascularisation, or CV related death] before age 50 was recorded in 2,939 (cumulative incidence 1.2% in males and 0.3% in females) of 361,353 individuals included in the prospective Swedish AMORIS (Apolipoprotein-related MOrtality RISk) study with health examinations 1985-1996 and follow-up through 2011. In a nested case-control analysis, cases with a CV event were matched to randomly selected controls. Population risk factor trajectories were calculated up to 20 years prior to an event. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and glucose levels were higher in cases than in controls as early as 20 years prior to the event with differences increasing over time. Low density lipoprotein, apoB, and the apoB/apoA-1 ratio were higher and increased over time, while HDL and apoA-1 were lower in cases compared to controls. The odds ratio was 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.6-3.7) for TC ≥5 mmol/L and TG ≥1.7 mmol/L in cases versus controls. The adjusted population-attributable fractions including lipids, glucose, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and obesity indicated that about 50% of CV events before age 50 may be associated with elevated lipid and glucose levels.Elevated TC, TG, LDL, apoB, and glucose levels and high apoB/apo A-1 ratio documented two decades before a CV event in subjects younger than 50 years may account for about half of CV events before age 50, which calls for early recognition and possibly treatment of modifiable CV risk factors in young individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2951103967,"Quorum sensing networks have been identified in over one hundred bacterial species to date. A subset of these networks regulate group behaviors, such as bioluminescence, virulence, and biofilm formation, by sending and receiving small molecules called homoserine lactones (HSLs). Bioengineers have incorporated quorum sensing pathways into genetic circuits to connect logical operations. However, the development of higher-order genetic circuitry is inhibited by crosstalk, in which one quorum sensing network responds to HSLs produced by a different network. Here, we report the construction and characterization of a library of ten synthases including some that are expected to produce HSLs that are incompatible with the Lux pathway, and therefore show no crosstalk. We demonstrated their function in a common lab chassis, Escherichia coli BL21, and in two contexts, liquid and solid agar cultures, using decoupled Sender and Receiver pathways. We observed weak or strong stimulation of a Lux receiver by longer-chain or shorter-chain HSL-generating Senders, respectively. We also considered the under-investigated risk of unintentional release of incompletely deactivated HSLs in biological waste. We found that HSL-enriched media treated with bleach were still bioactive, while autoclaving deactivates LuxR induction. This work represents the most extensive comparison of quorum signaling synthases to date and greatly expands the bacterial signaling toolkit while recommending practices for disposal based on empirical, quantitative evidence."

However, the exact underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed at evaluating a possible link between primary adult-type lactose malabsorption (PALM), HCY, FA and vitamin B12 metabolism and depressive disorder. Methods Plasma levels of HCY, FA and vitamin B12 were determined in 78 patients with PALM and 160 individuals with lactase persistence sub-grouped by the presence or absence of major depression. Results In 78 patients with PALM, the subgroup of 22 individuals with major depression showed significantly higher median (interquartile range) HCY (10.10 [8.46–12.03] vs. 8.9 [7.54–9.86] μmol/L, p = 0.029) and lower plasma FA levels (5.7 [4.68–9.14] vs. 6.95 [5.24–10.56] μmol/L, p = 0.272) compared to the subgroup of 56 individuals without depression, respectively. No such associations could be observed for those 160 individuals without PALM (i.e., lactase persistence) Plasma HCY levels were positively correlated with depressive symptoms (p = 0.052), and showed negative correlations with FA (p = < 0.001) and vitamin B12 (p = 0.029), respectively. Conclusion Depressed individuals with PALM were found with significantly higher HCY and lower FA levels compared to non-depressed individuals with PALM, however, this association was absent in the subgroup of lactase persistent individuals. These findings suggest an association between increased HCY levels, lactose malabsorption and depression."

We show that Glyphorynchus spirurus has a 2n = 80 karyotype with a fundamental number (FN) of 84, similar to the avian putative ancestral karyotype (PAK). Glyphorynchus spirurus pair 1 was heteromorphic in the Tapajós population whereby the short arms varied in sizes, possibly due to a pericentric inversion, as described in other Furnariidae birds. FISH with the Histone H5 probe revealed a signal in the pericentromeric region of G. spirurus chromosome 5 and rDNA 18S showed interstitial signal in GSP-1. Chromosome painting with Gallus gallus (GGA) macrochromosomes 1-9 probes showed disruption of chromosome syntenies of GGA-1, 2 and 4 by fission in Glyphorynchus spirurus. Our results confirm that the GGA1 centric fission is a synapomorphic character for the phylogenetic branch composed of Strigiformes, Passeriformes, Columbiformes and Falconiformes. On the other hand, the GGA-2 fission is reported here for the first time in Passeriformes.

Although the liver is main site of pyrimidine metabolism and contains high levels of TP, nonetheless, purification and characterization of human hepatic TP has not been accomplished. We here report the purification and characterization of native human hepatic TP. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by a procedure shorter and more efficient than previously reported methods. Human hepatic TP has an apparent Kthymidine of 285 ± 55 μM. Like the enzyme from other tissues, it is highly specific to 2'-deoxyribosides. However, in contrast to TP from other normal tissues, the hepatic enzyme is active in the phosphorolysis of 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, and the riboside 5-fluorouridine. Furthermore, native hepatic TP exists in different aggregates of 50 kDa subunits, with unknown aggregation factor(s) while TP from extra tissues exists as a homodimer. Isoelectric point was determined as 4.3. A total of 65 residues in the N-terminal were sequenced. The sequence of these 65 amino acids in hepatic TP has 100% sequence and location homology to the deduced amino acid sequence of the platelet derived-endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) cDNA. However, and contrary to PD-ECGF, the N-terminal of hepatic TP is blocked. The block was neither N-formyl nor pyrrolidone carboxylic acid moieties. The differences in substrate specificities, existence in multimers, and weak interaction with hydroxyapatite resin strongly suggest that hepatic TP is distinct from the enzyme in normal extrahepatic tissues. These results may have important clinical implications when TP is involved in activation or deactivation of chemotherapeutic agents in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2888278163,"Introduction Effective point-of-care testing (POCT) is reliant on optimal specimen collection, quality assured testing, and expedited return of results. Many of the POCT are designed to be used with fingerstick capillary blood to simplify the blood collection burden. However, fingerstick blood collection has inherent errors in sampling. An evaluation of the use of capillary and venous blood with CD4 POCT was conducted. Methods Three different specimen collection methods were evaluated for compatibility using the Alere Pima CD4 assay at 5 HIV/AIDS healthcare sites in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. At each site, whole blood specimens were collected from enrolled patients by venipuncture and fingerstick. Pima CD4 testing was performed at site of collection on venipuncture specimens (Venous) and fingerstick blood directly applied to a Pima CD4 cartridge (Capillary-Direct) and collected into an EDTA microtube (Capillary-Microtube). Venous blood was also tested at the laboratory by the reference CD4 method and Pima for comparison analysis. Results All three specimen collection methods were successfully collected by healthcare workers for use with the Pima CD4 assay. When compared to the reference CD4 method, Pima CD4 testing with the Capillary-Microtube method performed similarly to Venous, while Pima CD4 counts with the Capillary-Direct method were slightly more biased (-20 cells/μL) and variable (-229 to +189 cells/μL limit of agreement). Even though all three collection methods had similar invalid Pima testing rates (10.5%, 9.8%, and 8.3% for Capillary-Direct, Capillary-Microtube, and Venous respectively), the ability to perform repeat testing with Capillary-Microtube and Venous specimens increased the likelihood of acquiring a valid CD4 result with the Pima assay. Conclusions Capillary blood, either directly applied to Pima CD4 cartridges or collected in an EDTA microtube, and venous blood are suitable specimens for Pima CD4 testing. The advantages of capillary blood collection in an EDTA microtube are that it uses fingerstick collection which mimics venous blood and allows extra testing without additional blood collection."
https://openalex.org/W2888526732,"Anopheles balabacensis, the primary vector of Plasmodium knowlesi in Sabah, Malaysia, is both zoophilic and anthropophilic, feeding on macaques as well as humans. It is the dominant Anopheles species found in Kudat Division where it is responsible for all the cases of P. knowlesi. However there is a paucity of basic biological and ecological information on this vector. We investigated the genetic variation of this species using the sequences of cox1 (1,383 bp) and cox2 (685 bp) to gain an insight into the population genetics and inter-population gene flow in Sabah. A total of 71 An. balabacensis were collected from seven districts constituting 14 subpopulations. A total of 17, 10 and 25 haplotypes were detected in the subpopulations respectively using the cox1, cox2 and the combined sequence. Some of the haplotypes were common among the subpopulations due to gene flow occurring between them. AMOVA showed that the genetic variation was high within subpopulations as compared to between subpopulations. Mantel test results showed that the variation between subpopulations was not due to the geographical distance between them. Furthermore, Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs tests showed that An. balabacensis in Sabah is experiencing population expansion and growth. High gene flow between the subpopulations was indicated by the low genetic distance and high gene diversity in the cox1, cox2 and the combined sequence. However the population at Lipasu Lama appeared to be isolated possibly due to its higher altitude at 873 m above sea level."
https://openalex.org/W2888073437,"We address the problem of finding an optimal path for a vehicle in a planar environment where traversal costs are based on a time-varying spatial field defined over the environment. The resulting optimal path may contain instances of waiting, where the vehicle hovers, parks, or loiters. First, we consider path-planning on a uniform grid over the workspace. It is known that the computational complexity of the problem is significantly higher when waiting is allowed. We study the trade-off between the increased computational complexity and potential cost reductions in the resultant path with allowance for waiting. The results of numerical studies in this work identify characteristics of the threat fields in which optimal paths can involve waiting. Furthermore, we provide a local condition on the threat field that precludes waiting from providing any cost reductions in the resultant path. We show that this condition can be used in the path-planning algorithm to prune search trees and provide significant reductions in computation time without significant suboptimality. Next, we consider path-planning on a vehicle-centric multiresolution grid. We use a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition to evaluate the multiresolution path planner and compare against the uniform resolution grid using the same family of threat fields. We show that with a vehicle-centric multiresolution map and an appropriate path-planning algorithm, the added computational effort of allowance for waiting is negligible."
https://openalex.org/W2888347439,"Background Vitamin D has an important role in the immune system, and has been linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and coronary artery disease (CAD). The exact mechanisms by which vitamin D is involved in these processes are still unclear. Therefore, we wanted to search for differences in expression of genes involved in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation pathway and genes that are known to alter upon vitamin D stimulation, in the aortic adventitia of CAD patients with and without RA. Methods Affymetrix microarray was used to determine gene expression profile in surgical specimens from the adventitia of the ascending aorta of CAD patients with RA (n = 8) and without RA (n = 8) from the Feiring Heart Biopsy Study. Results We identified three vitamin D associated genes that were differentially expressed between RA and non-RA patients: Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 alpha (GADD45A) (FC = 1.47; p = 0.006), Nuclear Receptor Co-repressor 1 (NCOR1) (FC = 1,21; p = 0.005) and paraoxonases 2 (PON2) (FC = -1.37; p = 0.01). High expression of GADD45A in RA tissues was confirmed by real-time qRT-PCR. GADD45A expression correlated with plasma levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 (rs = 0.69; p = 0.003). Conclusions Microarray analyses revealed higher expression of GADD45A and NCOR1; and lower expression of PON2 in the aortic adventitia of RA than non-RA patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate if and how GADD45A, NCOR1 and PON2 are involved in the development of accelerated atherosclerosis in RA. In theory, some of these factors might have proatherogenic effects whereas others might reflect an underlying vascular pathology promoting atherogenesis (such as vascular stress)."
https://openalex.org/W2888403025,"Paracoccidioides spp. is a thermally dimorphic fungus endemic to Latin America and the etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a granulomatous disease acquired through fungal propagule inhalation by its mammalian host. The infection is established after successful mycelia to yeast transition in the host pulmonary alveoli. The challenging environment inside the host exposes the fungus to the need of adaptation in order to circumvent nutritional, thermal, oxidative, immunological and other stresses that can directly affect their survival. Considering that autophagy is a response to abrupt environmental changes and is induced by stress conditions, this study hypothesizes that this process might be crucially involved in the adaptation of Paracoccidioides spp. to the host and, therefore, it is essential for the proper establishment of the disease. By labelling autophagous vesicles with monodansylcadaverine, autophagy was observed as an early event in cells during the normal mycelium to yeast transition, as well as in yeast cells of P. brasiliensis under glucose deprivation, and under either rapamycin or 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Findings in this study demonstrated that autophagy is triggered in P. brasiliensis during the thermal-induced mycelium to yeast transition and by glucose-limited conditions in yeasts, both of which modulated by rapamycin or 3-MA. Certainly, further genetic and in vivo analyses are needed in order to finally address the contribution of autophagy for adaptation. Yet, our data propose that autophagy possibly plays an important role in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis virulence and pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2888115061,"Adult illiteracy is a major problem worldwide especially in developing countries. Adult Basic Education (ABE) programs working in this context are not very effective due to lack of motivation for the people who are not literate. The reason is inadequate learning content and content delivery methods. This situation calls for developing novel learning content and a learner-directed content delivery approach. This paper presents an exploratory study investigating the use of the Environmental Print Material (EPM) as learning content for the non-literate population of Pakistan. The EPM content is presented to the adult non-literate population in two ethnographic studies. The most frequently recognized content is selected and utilized as learning content in a Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) application. An empirical study is conducted upon two groups with 107 participants to compare the EPM-based learning content with Traditional Learning Content (TLC). As many as 54 participants participated in the experimental group (presented with EPM-based learning content), whereas 53 participants took part in the control group (presented with TLC content). The results reveal that the experimental group performed significantly better compared to the control group in recognition, pronunciation, and recall of the presented content. The meta-analysis of the results shows a large effect size of (1.05) with confidence interval in the range (0.798-1.315). The results claim that the EPM has potential to be considered as learning content in the ABE programs."
https://openalex.org/W2888409366,"Input-output (I/O) optimization at the low-level design of data layout on disk drastically impacts the efficiency of high performance computing (HPC) applications. However, such a low-level optimization is in general challenging, especially when using popular scientific file formats designed with an emphasis on portability and flexibility. To reconcile these two aspects, we present a novel low-level data layout for HPC applications, fully independent of the number of dimensions in the dataset. The new data layout improves reading and writing efficiency in large HPC applications using many processors, and in particular during parallel post-processing. Furthermore, its combination with a cached write mode, in order to aggregate multiple writes into larger ones, substantially decreased the writing times of the proposed strategy. When applied to our simulation framework for the forward calculation of the human electrocardiogram, the combined strategy resulted in drastic improvements in I/O performance, of up to 40% in writing and 93-98% in reading for post-processing tasks. Given the generality of the proposed strategies and scientific file formats used, our results may represent significant improvements in I/O performance of HPC applications across multiple disciplines, reducing execution and post-processing times and leading to a more efficient use of HPC resource envelopes."
