https://openalex.org/W2080807877,"At the individual level, higher HIV viral load predicts sexual transmission risk. We evaluated San Francisco's community viral load (CVL) as a population level marker of HIV transmission risk. We hypothesized that the decrease in CVL in San Francisco from 2004-2008, corresponding with increased rates of HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage and effectiveness, and population-level virologic suppression, would be associated with a reduction in new HIV infections.We used San Francisco's HIV/AIDS surveillance system to examine the trends in CVL. Mean CVL was calculated as the mean of the most recent viral load of all reported HIV-positive individuals in a particular community. Total CVL was defined as the sum of the most recent viral loads of all HIV-positive individuals in a particular community. We used Poisson models with robust standard errors to assess the relationships between the mean and total CVL and the primary outcome: annual numbers of newly diagnosed HIV cases. Both mean and total CVL decreased from 2004-2008 and were accompanied by decreases in new HIV diagnoses from 798 (2004) to 434 (2008). The mean (p = 0.003) and total CVL (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with new HIV cases from 2004-2008.Reductions in CVL are associated with decreased HIV infections. Results suggest that wide-scale ART could reduce HIV transmission at the population level. Because CVL is temporally upstream of new HIV infections, jurisdictions should consider adding CVL to routine HIV surveillance to track the epidemic, allocate resources, and to evaluate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and treatment efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2135144687,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate extensive local and global alterations in chromatin structure, many of which depend on the ATM kinase. Histone H2A ubiquitylation (uH2A) on chromatin surrounding DSBs is one example, thought to be important for recruitment of repair proteins. uH2A is also implicated in transcriptional repression; an intriguing yet untested hypothesis is that this function is conserved in the context of DSBs. Using a novel reporter that allows for visualization of repair protein recruitment and local transcription in single cells, we describe an ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing program in cis to DSBs. ATM prevents RNA polymerase II elongation-dependent chromatin decondensation at regions distal to DSBs. Silencing is partially dependent on E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168, whereas reversal of silencing relies on the uH2A deubiquitylating enzyme USP16. These findings give insight into the role of posttranslational modifications in mediating crosstalk between diverse processes occurring on chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2052131829,"The molecular understanding of autophagy has originated almost exclusively from yeast genetic studies. Little is known about essential autophagy components specific to higher eukaryotes. Here we perform genetic screens in C. elegans and identify four metazoan-specific autophagy genes, named epg-2, -3, -4, and -5. Genetic analysis reveals that epg-2, -3, -4, and -5 define discrete genetic steps of the autophagy pathway. epg-2 encodes a coiled-coil protein that functions in specific autophagic cargo recognition. Mammalian homologs of EPG-3/VMP1, EPG-4/EI24, and EPG-5/mEPG5 are essential for starvation-induced autophagy. VMP1 regulates autophagosome formation by controlling the duration of omegasomes. EI24 and mEPG5 are required for formation of degradative autolysosomes. This study establishes C. elegans as a multicellular genetic model to delineate the autophagy pathway and provides mechanistic insights into the metazoan-specific autophagic process."
https://openalex.org/W2028835848,"Reprogramming of somatic cells achieved by combination of the four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc has very low efficiency. To increase the reprogramming efficiency and better understand the process, we sought to identify factors that mediate reprogramming with higher efficiency. We established an assay to screen nuclear fractions from extracts of pluripotent mouse cells based on Oct4 reactivation. Using proteomics, we identified components of the ATP-dependent BAF chromatin-remodeling complex, which significantly increases reprogramming efficiency when used together with the four factors. The reprogrammed cells could transmit to the germline and exhibited pluripotency. Reprogramming remained highly efficient when c-Myc was not present but BAF components were overexpressed. BAF complex components mediate this effect by facilitating enhanced Oct4 binding to target promoters during reprogramming. Thus, somatic cell reprogramming using chromatin-remodeling molecules represents an efficient method of generating reprogrammed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048466125,"Background Monocyte-derived macrophages critically perpetuate inflammatory responses after liver injury as a prerequisite for organ fibrosis. Experimental murine models identified an essential role for the CCR2-dependent infiltration of classical Gr1/Ly6C+ monocytes in hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, the monocyte-related chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5 were recently recognized as important fibrosis modulators in mice. In humans, monocytes consist of classical CD14+CD16− and non-classical CD14+CD16+ cells. We aimed at investigating the relevance of monocyte subpopulations for human liver fibrosis, and hypothesized that ‘non-classical’ monocytes critically exert inflammatory as well as profibrogenic functions in patients during liver disease progression. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed circulating monocyte subsets from freshly drawn blood samples of 226 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and 184 healthy controls by FACS analysis. Circulating monocytes were significantly expanded in CLD-patients compared to controls with a marked increase of the non-classical CD14+CD16+ subset that showed an activated phenotype in patients and correlated with proinflammatory cytokines and clinical progression. Correspondingly, CD14+CD16+ macrophages massively accumulated in fibrotic/cirrhotic livers, as evidenced by immunofluorescence and FACS. Ligands of monocyte-related chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR1 and CCR5 were expressed at higher levels in fibrotic and cirrhotic livers, while CCL3 and CCL4 were also systemically elevated in CLD-patients. Isolated monocyte/macrophage subpopulations were functionally characterized regarding cytokine/chemokine expression and interactions with primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) in vitro. CD14+CD16+ monocytes released abundant proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, CD14+CD16+, but not CD14+CD16− monocytes could directly activate collagen-producing HSC. Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate the expansion of CD14+CD16+ monocytes in the circulation and liver of CLD-patients upon disease progression and suggest their functional contribution to the perpetuation of intrahepatic inflammation and profibrogenic HSC activation in liver cirrhosis. The modulation of monocyte-subset recruitment into the liver via chemokines/chemokine receptors and their subsequent differentiation may represent promising approaches for therapeutic interventions in human liver fibrosis."

Lipocalin 24p3 is an iron-trafficking protein that binds iron through association with a bacterial siderophore, such as enterobactin, or a postulated mammalian siderophore. Here, we show that the iron-binding moiety of the 24p3-associated mammalian siderophore is 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), which is similar to 2,3-DHBA, the iron-binding component of enterobactin. We find that the murine enzyme responsible for 2,5-DHBA synthesis, BDH2, is the homolog of bacterial EntA, which catalyzes 2,3-DHBA production during enterobactin biosynthesis. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of BDH2 results in siderophore depletion. Mammalian cells lacking the siderophore accumulate abnormally high amounts of cytoplasmic iron, resulting in elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, whereas the mitochondria are iron deficient. Siderophore-depleted mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos fail to synthesize heme, an iron-dependent mitochondrial process. Our results reveal features of intracellular iron homeostasis that are conserved from bacteria through humans. Intracellular iron homeostasis is critical for survival and proliferation.

The iron-binding moiety of the mammalian siderophore is 2,5-DHBA The mouse enzyme responsible for 2,5-DHBA synthesis is homologous to bacterial EntA Mammalian cells lacking the siderophore accumulate high amounts of cytoplasmic iron Iron is imported into mitochondria as an iron-siderophore complex The acquisition of iron by cells is critical for survival, growth, and differentiation (Andrews, 2008Andrews N.C. Forging a field: the golden age of iron biology.Blood. 2008; 112: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Cells require a constant source of iron, which serves as a functional component of hemoproteins and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing proteins. Almost all mammalian cells and tissues are thought to acquire iron by receptor-mediated endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin. After uptake, intracellular iron levels must be tightly regulated, as excess free iron can catalyze the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) (reviewed in Emerit et al., 2001Emerit J. Beaumont C. Trivin F. Iron metabolism, free radicals, and oxidative injury.Biomed. Pharmacother. 2001; 55: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition to its cytoplasmic function, iron also has a critical role in mitochondria, where heme and various Fe-S cluster-containing proteins are synthesized (Rouault and Tong, 2005Rouault T.A. Tong W.H. Iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis and mitochondrial iron homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial iron levels must be tightly regulated; an inadequate supply of iron can impair the metabolic and respiratory activities of the organelle, whereas excess mitochondrial iron promotes the generation of ROS, which are produced as a side reaction of mitochondrial electron transport (Foury and Cazzalini, 1997Foury F. Cazzalini O. Deletion of the yeast homologue of the human gene associated with Friedreich's ataxia elicits iron accumulation in mitochondria.FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Iron is ultimately delivered to proteins or transporters by metallochaperones, such as the mitochondrial iron chaperone frataxin (Bulteau et al., 2004Bulteau A.L. O'Neill H.A. Kennedy M.C. Ikeda-Saito M. Isaya G. Szweda L.I. Frataxin acts as an iron chaperone protein to modulate mitochondrial aconitase activity.Science. 2004; 305: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and the cytosolic iron chaperone PCBP1 (Shi et al., 2008Shi H. Bencze K.Z. Stemmler T.L. Philpott C.C. A cytosolic iron chaperone that delivers iron to ferritin.Science. 2008; 320: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, an unresolved question is the form in which iron, which has low solubility in aqueous solution, is trafficked from the transferrin-containing endosome to other cellular sites, such as mitochondria. Although most cytoplasmic iron is tightly bound to proteins, it is generally believed that a fraction of cytoplasmic iron is complexed with a low molecular weight carrier to form the “free” (also called labile or chelatable) iron pool (Breuer et al., 2008Breuer W. Shvartsman M. Cabantchik Z.I. Intracellular labile iron.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, several early studies suggested that mammalian cells and tissues contain low molecular weight siderophores that bind iron with high affinity (Fernandez-Pol, 1978Fernandez-Pol J.A. Isolation and characterization of a siderophore-like growth factor from mutants of SV40-transformed cells adapted to picolinic acid.Cell. 1978; 14: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Jones et al., 1980Jones R.L.

Med. 1980; 151: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, new evidence for the existence of a mammalian siderophore has emerged from studies of the lipocalin 24p3 (also known as lipocalin-2 [LCN2]). Lipocalins are a family of secreted proteins that can bind small molecular weight ligands and have diverse molecular recognition properties and functions (Akerstrom et al., 2000Akerstrom B. Flower D.R. Salier J.P. Lipocalins: unity in diversity.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). 24p3 has been found to be involved in multiple biological processes including apoptosis (Devireddy et al., 2005Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. A cell-surface receptor for lipocalin 24p3 selectively mediates apoptosis and iron uptake.Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), innate immunity (Flo et al., 2004Flo T.H. Smith K.D. Sato S. Rodriguez D.J. Holmes M.A. Strong R.K. Akira S. Aderem A. Lipocalin 2 mediates an innate immune response to bacterial infection by sequestrating iron.Nature. 2004; 432: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), and renal development (Yang et al., 2002Yang J. Goetz D. Li J.Y. Wang W. Mori K. Setlik D. Du T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strong R. Barasch J. An iron delivery pathway mediated by a lipocalin.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Several groups have shown that 24p3 can bind iron and deliver it to or remove it from cells (Devireddy et al., 2005Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R.

Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. The neutrophil lipocalin NGAL is a bacteriostatic agent that interferes with siderophore-mediated iron acquisition.Mol.

Strong R. Barasch J. An iron delivery pathway mediated by a lipocalin.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The iron status of 24p3 is the critical determinant of its activity. Iron-containing 24p3 (holo-24p3) binds to a cell surface receptor called 24p3R, is internalized, and releases its bound iron, thereby increasing intracellular iron concentration (Devireddy et al., 2005Devireddy L.R.

A cell-surface receptor for lipocalin 24p3 selectively mediates apoptosis and iron uptake.Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). By contrast, iron-lacking 24p3 (apo-24p3) binds to 24p3R, is internalized, chelates iron, and transfers it to the extracellular medium, thereby reducing intracellular iron concentration. 24p3 does not have an intrinsic ability to interact with iron, but rather binds iron through an associated, small molecular weight, iron-chelating compound (Devireddy et al., 2005Devireddy L.R.

Strong R. Barasch J. An iron delivery pathway mediated by a lipocalin.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Significantly, the classic bacterial siderophore, enterobactin, can bind 24p3 and function as the iron-chelating moiety (Yang et al., 2002Yang J. Goetz D. Li J.Y. Wang W. Mori K. Setlik D. Du T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strong R. Barasch J. An iron delivery pathway mediated by a lipocalin.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Interestingly, apo-24p3 produced in enterobactin-deficient bacteria acquires iron-binding ability after delivery to, and internalization in, mammalian cells (Devireddy et al., 2005Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. A cell-surface receptor for lipocalin 24p3 selectively mediates apoptosis and iron uptake.Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). These results indicate that mammalian cells contain a siderophore, which may have structural and functional similarities to bacterial enterobactin. Here, we characterize the iron-binding moiety of the 24p3-associated mammalian siderophore and identify one of the cellular enzymes involved in its synthesis. This information has enabled us to deplete the siderophore from mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos and study the role of the siderophore in intracellular iron homeostasis. We have previously shown that FL5.12 cells, a murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent pro-B lymphocytic cell line, harbor an intracellular cofactor that enables 24p3 to bind iron (Devireddy et al., 2005Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. A cell-surface receptor for lipocalin 24p3 selectively mediates apoptosis and iron uptake.Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the composition of this cofactor, we derived an FL5.12 cell line stably expressing an ecdysone-inducible, epitope-tagged derivative of 24p3 (FL5.12/Ec-24p3 cells). Figure 1A shows that treatment of FL5.12/Ec-24p3 cells with the ecdysone analog ponasterone A resulted in the accumulation of 24p3 in the conditioned medium (CM). To test whether the induced 24p3 was able to bind iron, we added radiolabeled iron (55FeCl3) to the CM, immunoprecipitated 24p3, and assessed 24p3 iron binding by measuring radioactivity in the 24p3 immunoprecipitate. Figure 1B shows that 24p3 present in the CM from ponasterone A-treated FL5.12/Ec-24p3 cells bound to 55Fe, indicating, as expected, that the 24p3 was siderophore associated. To identify the 24p3-associated siderophore, we immunoprecipitated 24p3 from the CM of ponasterone A-treated FL5.12/Ec-24p3 cells, eluted the putative 24p3-siderophore complex with acetic acid, and then separated protein from small molecules by size-exclusion chromatography. The small molecule flow-through fraction was derivatized with trimethylsilate (TMS) and subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As shown in Figure 1C, a single prominent GC peak was detected at 355 m/z (mass-to-charge ratio), and a search of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database of known MS spectra yielded a match to tri-TMS-2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (tri-TMS-2,5-DHBA), which was confirmed using a set of DHBA standards (Figure 1D). GC-MS analysis under milder conditions [N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA)-pyridine] did not yield a peak for tri-TMS-2,5-DHBA, whereas free 2,5-DHBA was fully derivatized (data not shown), indicating that the 24p3-associated 2,5-DHBA is a component of a larger molecule. Notably, 2,5-DHBA could also be detected and quantified by TMS derivatization and GC-MS analysis of cytoplasmic extracts from FL5.12 cells cultured in the presence of IL-3 (Figure S1A available online), which lack 24p3 (Devireddy et al., 2001Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Induction of apoptosis by a secreted lipocalin that is transcriptionally regulated by IL-3 deprivation.Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). 2,5-DHBA is related to 2,3-DHBA (Figure 1E), the iron-binding moiety of bacterial enterobactin (reviewed in Raymond et al., 2003Raymond K.N. Dertz E.A. Kim S.S. Enterobactin: an archetype for microbial iron transport.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3584-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We performed several experiments to determine whether, like 2,3-DHBA, 2,5-DHBA could also chelate iron and bind 24p3. The iron-binding pocket of 24p3 has a single tryptophan residue, and the occupation of this site by enterobactin or 2,3-DHBA quenches its intrinsic fluorescence (Goetz et al., 2002Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. The neutrophil lipocalin NGAL is a bacteriostatic agent that interferes with siderophore-mediated iron acquisition.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Figure 1F (left panel) shows, consistent with previous results, that addition of 2,3-DHBA quenched the intrinsic fluorescence emitted by tryptophan. Addition of 2,5-DHBA also quenched tryptophan fluorescence (Figure 1F, right panel), indicating that 2,5-DHBA bound to 24p3. 2,5-DHBA and 2,3-DHBA bound 24p3 with roughly comparable affinities of 12 and 8 nM, respectively, as calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. As expected, desferrichrome, a structurally unrelated siderophore that does not bind to 24p3 (Flo et al., 2004Flo T.H. Smith K.D. Sato S. Rodriguez D.J. Holmes M.A. Strong R.K. Akira S. Aderem A. Lipocalin 2 mediates an innate immune response to bacterial infection by sequestrating iron.Nature. 2004; 432: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, Goetz et al., 2002Goetz D.H.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), had no effect on tryptophan fluorescence (Figure S1B). We next assessed the ability of 2,5-DHBA to confer iron binding to 24p3. Purified apo-24p3 was incubated with 55FeCl3 and increasing concentrations of 2,5-DHBA or, as positive controls, 2,3-DHBA or enterobactin, and, after immunoprecipitation of 24p3, radioactivity was measured in the 24p3 immunoprecipitate. Figure 1G shows that addition of 2,3-DHBA, enterobactin, or 2,5-DHBA to apo-24p3 conferred the ability to bind iron, whereas desferrichrome did not. The greater level of iron binding observed with enterobactin compared to DHBA is most likely due to the higher affinity of enterobactin for 24p3 (Goetz et al., 2002Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. The neutrophil lipocalin NGAL is a bacteriostatic agent that interferes with siderophore-mediated iron acquisition.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Order-of-addition experiments confirmed that 2,5-DHBA could stably bind to 24p3 in the absence of iron (Figure S1C). In bacteria, synthesis of 2,3-DHBA from its precursor, 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-diDHBA), is catalyzed by the EntA protein (Liu et al., 1989Liu J. Duncan K. Walsh C.T. Nucleotide sequence of a cluster of Escherichia coli enterobactin biosynthesis genes: identification of entA and purification of its product 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 791-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the mammalian siderophore had structural similarities to enterobactin prompted us to perform database searches for proteins homologous to bacterial EntA. As shown in Figure 2A , these searches revealed putative human, mouse, zebrafish, and yeast homologs of EntA. The human homolog was identified as a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family member originally called DHRS6 and now referred to as BDH2 (Guo et al., 2006Guo K. Lukacik P. Papagrigoriou E. Meier M. Lee W.H. Adamski J. Oppermann U. Characterization of human DHRS6, an orphan short chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzyme: a novel, cytosolic type 2 R-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase.J.

RT-PCR analysis indicates that the murine Bdh2 gene was widely expressed in mouse tissues (Figure S2A ).Figure S2Additional Experiments, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Expression of Bdh2 in mouse adult tissue and embryos.

Molecular weight markers are shown on the right, in kDa. To determine whether BDH2 was in fact involved in synthesis of 24p3-associated 2,5-DHBA, we derived two unrelated short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed against murine Bdh2 (Bdh2-1 and Bdh2-2). The RT-PCR and immunoblot results of Figure 2B show that both shRNAs knocked down Bdh2 expression. Bdh2-1 was more efficient than Bdh2-2 at knocking down Bdh2 expression, which is relevant to results of some of the functional experiments presented below. We then repeated the GC-MS analysis of Figure 1C in BDH2 knockdown (KD) cells. Figure 2C shows that in contrast to parental FL5.12 cells, in BDH2 KD cells there was no detectable 24p3-associated 2,5-DHBA. Finally, we tested whether BDH2 was a functional homolog of bacterial EntA by asking whether it could catalyze an equivalent enzymatic reaction. The NAD+-dependent oxidation of 2,3-diDHBA to 2,3-DHBA can be monitored by ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence (Liu et al., 1989Liu J. Duncan K. Walsh C.T. Nucleotide sequence of a cluster of Escherichia coli enterobactin biosynthesis genes: identification of entA and purification of its product 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 791-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 2D (left panel) shows, as expected, that E. coli EntA efficiently catalyzed the production of 2,3-DHBA from 2,3-diDHBA, whereas this reaction was not catalyzed by an EntA derivative containing a point mutation (Tyr144 to Phe) within the predicted active site (Filling et al., 2002Filling C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25677-25684Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Significantly, 2,3-DHBA production was also catalyzed by recombinant BDH2 but not by a mutant BDH2 derivative (Tyr147 to Phe). As expected, in these same reactions wild-type EntA and BDH2 proteins, but not their mutant derivatives, catalyzed the conversion of NAD to NADH (Figure 2D, right panel). Collectively, these results indicate BDH2 is a homolog of bacterial EntA. The finding that after BDH2 knockdown there was no detectable 24p3-associated 2,5-DHBA suggested that 24p3 would be unable to bind iron in BDH2 KD cells. To test this prediction, we analyzed 24p3 iron-binding activity in cells expressing a Bdh2 shRNA. Figure 3A shows that 24p3 present in the CM from IL-3-deprived FL5.12 cells or ponasterone A-treated FL5.12/Ec-24p3 cells bound to 55Fe, whereas 24p3 iron-binding activity was markedly decreased in BDH2-depleted cells despite near-equivalent amounts of 24p3 in the CM. We next performed a series of experiments to analyze the ability of 24p3 to mediate iron transport in BDH2-depleted cells. After receptor-mediated internalization, apo-24p3 chelates intracellular iron and exits the cell via the recycling endosome, thereby transferring iron to the extracellular medium. The resultant decrease in intracellular iron concentration induces apoptosis (Devireddy et al., 2005Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. A cell-surface receptor for lipocalin 24p3 selectively mediates apoptosis and iron uptake.Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We predicted that in the absence of a functional siderophore, apo-24p3 would be unable to deplete intracellular iron and therefore fail to induce apoptosis. As a first test of this prediction, we analyzed the ability of apo-24p3 to transfer iron to the extracellular medium in BDH2 KD cells. FL5.12 cells were loaded with radiolabeled iron by preincubation with 55FeCl3 followed by reculturing in fresh medium lacking 55Fe. 55Fe-loaded cells were treated with apo-24p3 or, as a control, the membrane-permeable iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO), and the accumulation of 55Fe in the medium was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Figure 3B shows that addition of apo-24p3 or DFO to control nonsilencing shRNA-treated cells led to the time-dependent accumulation of 55Fe in the medium. By contrast, in BDH2 KD cells, DFO but not apo-24p3 was able to transfer 55Fe to the extracellular medium. We next analyzed the ability of 24p3 to induce apoptosis. We have previously shown that in FL5.12 cells, IL-3 deprivation induces 24p3 expression, resulting in apoptosis (Devireddy et al., 2001Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Induction of apoptosis by a secreted lipocalin that is transcriptionally regulated by IL-3 deprivation.Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Figure 3C shows that in BDH2 KD FL5.12 cells, the level of apoptosis resulting from IL-3 deprivation was markedly reduced compared to cells treated with a nonsilencing shRNA. Remarkably, addition of 2,5-DHBA restored the ability of BDH2 KD FL5.12 cells to induce apoptosis after IL-3 deprivation. Notably, in FL5.12 cells cultured in the presence of IL-3, and which therefore do not express 24p3, addition of 2,5-DHBA did not promote apoptosis. Collectively, these results indicate that BDH2 is required for synthesis of the 24p3-associated mammalian siderophore and thus for 24p3-mediated iron binding and trafficking activities. Next, we performed a series of experiments to determine the role of the siderophore in intracellular iron homeostasis. First, we used a colorimetric assay to measure cytoplasmic iron concentration in cells containing or lacking the siderophore. The results of Figure 4A show that total cytoplasmic iron levels were markedly elevated in BDH2 KD cells. Second, we measured free iron concentration using calcein, a fluorescent cell-permeable dye whose emission is quenched by iron binding (Kakhlon and Cabantchik, 2002Kakhlon O. Cabantchik Z.I. The labile iron pool: characterization, measurement, and participation in cellular processes(1).Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Figure 4B shows that BDH2 KD cells contained substantially higher free iron levels, as evidenced by a decrease in fluorescence intensity.

Here, we show via RNAi-mediated knockdown that ELYS, a nucleoporin critical for the recruitment of the essential Nup107/160 complex to chromatin, is required for NPC assembly at the end of mitosis but not during interphase. Conversely, the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. Strikingly, recruitment of the Nup107/160 complex to an intact NE involves a membrane curvature-sensing domain of its constituent Nup133, which is not required for postmitotic NPC formation. Our results suggest that in organisms with open mitosis, NPCs assemble via two distinct mechanisms to accommodate cell cycle-dependent differences in NE topology."

We have generated mouse models in which Sox2 is upregulated in epithelial cells of the lung during development and in the adult. In both cases, overexpression leads to extensive hyperplasia. In the terminal bronchioles, a trachea-like pseudostratified epithelium develops with p63-positive cells underlying columnar cells. Over 12-34 weeks, about half of the mice expressing the highest levels of Sox2 develop carcinoma.

Here we report that an axon guidance receptor, Neuropilin-2 (Nrp2), and its repulsive ligand, Semaphorin-3F (Sema3F), are expressed by OSNs in a complementary manner that is important for establishing olfactory map topography. Sema3F is secreted by early-arriving axons of OSNs and is deposited at the anterodorsal OB to repel Nrp2-positive axons that arrive later. Sequential arrival of OSN axons as well as the graded and complementary expression of Nrp2 and Sema3F by OSNs help to form the topographic order along the D-V axis."
https://openalex.org/W2013859796,"DICER is a central regulator of microRNA maturation. However, little is known about mechanisms regulating its expression in development or disease. While profiling miRNA expression in differentiating melanocytes, two populations were observed: some upregulated at the pre-miRNA stage, and others upregulated as mature miRNAs (with stable pre-miRNA levels). Conversion of pre-miRNAs to fully processed miRNAs appeared to be dependent upon stimulation of DICER expression--an event found to occur via direct transcriptional targeting of DICER by the melanocyte master transcriptional regulator MITF. MITF binds and activates a conserved regulatory element upstream of DICER's transcriptional start site upon melanocyte differentiation. Targeted KO of DICER is lethal to melanocytes, at least partly via DICER-dependent processing of the pre-miRNA-17 approximately 92 cluster thus targeting BIM, a known proapoptotic regulator of melanocyte survival. These observations highlight a central mechanism underlying lineage-specific miRNA regulation which could exist for other cell types during development."

In the case of the actin cytoskeleton, a great deal is known about the components that include higher order structures, such as lamellar meshes, filopodial bundles, and stress fibers. Each of these cytoskeletal structures contains actin filaments and cross-linking proteins, but the role of cross-linking proteins in the initial steps of structure formation has not been clearly elucidated. We employ an optical trapping assay to investigate the behaviors of two actin cross-linking proteins, fascin and α-actinin, during the first steps of structure assembly. Here, we show that these proteins have distinct binding characteristics that cause them to recognize and cross-link filaments that are arranged with specific geometries. α-Actinin is a promiscuous cross-linker, linking filaments over all angles. It retains this flexibility after cross-links are formed, maintaining a connection even when the link is rotated. Conversely, fascin is extremely selective, only cross-linking filaments in a parallel orientation. Surprisingly, bundles formed by either protein are extremely stable, persisting for over 0.5 h in a continuous wash. However, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence decay experiments, we find that the stable fascin population can be rapidly competed away by free fascin. We present a simple avidity model for this cross-link dissociation behavior. Together, these results place constraints on how cytoskeletal structures assemble, organize, and disassemble in vivo.

The structure indicates that upon sequence recognition MTERF1 unwinds the DNA molecule, promoting eversion of three nucleotides. Base flipping is critical for stable binding and transcriptional termination. Additional structural and biochemical results provide insight into the DNA binding mechanism and explain how MTERF1 recognizes its target sequence.

However, an incomplete understanding of signaling pathways regulating myometrial contraction hinders the development of improved therapeutics. Here we used a peptidomimetic inhibitor of parturition in mice, PDC113.824, whose structure was based on the NH(2)-terminal region of the second extracellular loop of FP receptor, to gain mechanistic insight underlying FP receptor-mediated cell responses in the context of parturition. We show that PDC113.824 not only delayed normal parturition in mice but also that it inhibited both PGF2alpha- and lipopolysaccharide-induced preterm labor. PDC113.824 inhibited PGF2alpha-mediated, G(alpha)(12)-dependent activation of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathways, actin remodeling, and contraction of human myometrial cells likely by acting as a non-competitive, allosteric modulator of PGF2alpha binding. In contrast to its negative allosteric modulating effects on Rho/ROCK signaling, PDC113.824 acted as a positive allosteric modulator on PGF2alpha-mediated protein kinase C and ERK1/2 signaling. This bias in receptor-dependent signaling was explained by an increase in FP receptor coupling to G(alpha)(q), at the expense of coupling to G(alpha)(12). Our findings regarding the allosteric and biased nature of PDC113.824 offer new mechanistic insights into FP receptor signaling relevant to parturition and suggest novel therapeutic opportunities for the development of new tocolytic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2077176459,"Background and Objective Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality amongst the gynecological cancers worldwide, especially in developing countries. It is imperative for at least health professionals in developing countries like Pakistan to have a sound knowledge about the disease. This study was carried out to assess the knowledge and awareness about cervical cancer and its prevention amongst health professionals in tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods and Design A cross-sectional, interview based survey was conducted in June, 2009. Sample of 400 was divided between the three tertiary care centers. Convenience sampling was applied as no definitive data was available regarding the number of registered interns and nurses at each center. Results Of all the interviews conducted, 1.8% did not know cervical cancer as a disease. Only 23.3% of the respondents were aware that cervical cancer is the most common cause of gynecological cancers and 26% knew it is second in rank in mortality. Seventy-eight percent were aware that infection is the most common cause of cervical cancer, of these 62% said that virus is the cause and 61% of the respondents knew that the virus is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Majority recognized that it is sexually transmitted but only a minority (41%) knew that it can be detected by PCR. Only 26% of the study population was aware of one or more risk factors. Thirty seven percent recognized Pap smear as a screening test. In total only 37 out of 400 respondents were aware of the HPV vaccine. Conclusion This study serves to highlight that the majority of working health professionals are not adequately equipped with knowledge concerning cervical cancer. Continuing Medical Education program should be started at the hospital level along with conferences to spread knowledge about this disease."

Bio-MEMS technologies present a unique opportunity to study fundamental biological processes at a level unrealized with previous methods. The capability to miniaturize analytical systems enables researchers to perform multiple experiments in parallel and with a high degree of control over experimental variables for high-content screening applications.We have demonstrated a biological microelectromechanical system (BioMEMS) based on silicon cantilevers and an AFM detection system for studying the physiology and kinetics of myotubes derived from embryonic rat skeletal muscle. It was shown that it is possible to interrogate and observe muscle behavior in real time, as well as selectively stimulate the contraction of myotubes with the device. Stress generation of the tissue was estimated using a modification of Stoney's equation. Calculated stress values were in excellent agreement with previously published results for cultured myotubes, but not adult skeletal muscle. Other parameters such as time to peak tension (TPT), the time to half relaxation ((1/2)RT) were compared to the literature. It was observed that the myotubes grown on the BioMEMS device, while generating stress magnitudes comparable to those previously published, exhibited slower TPT and (1/2)RT values. However, growth in an enhanced media increased these values. From these data it was concluded that the myotubes cultured on the cantilevers were of an embryonic phenotype. The system was also shown to be responsive to the application of a toxin, veratridine.The device demonstrated here will provide a useful foundation for studying various aspects of muscle physiology and behavior in a controlled high-throughput manner as well as be useful for biosensor and drug discovery applications."
https://openalex.org/W2089924047,"Human dopamine transporter gene (DAT1 or SLC6A3) has been associated with various brain-related diseases and behavioral traits and, as such, has been investigated intensely in experimental- and clinical-settings. However, the abundance of research data has not clarified the biological mechanism of DAT regulation; similarly, studies of DAT genotype-phenotype associations yielded inconsistent results. Hence, our understanding of the control of the DAT protein product is incomplete; having this knowledge is critical, since DAT plays the major role in the brain's dopaminergic circuitry. Accordingly, we reevaluated the genomic attributes of the SLC6A3 gene that might confer sensitivity to regulation, hypothesizing that its unique genomic characteristics might facilitate highly dynamic, region-specific DAT expression, so enabling multiple regulatory modes. Our comprehensive bioinformatic analyzes revealed very distinctive genomic characteristics of the SLC6A3, including high inter-individual variability of its sequence (897 SNPs, about 90 repeats and several CNVs spell out all abbreviations in abstract) and pronounced sensitivity to regulation by epigenetic mechanisms, as evident from the GC-bias composition (0.55) of the SLC6A3, and numerous intragenic CpG islands (27 CGIs). We propose that this unique combination of the genomic features and the regulatory attributes enables the differential expression of the DAT1 gene and fulfills seemingly contradictory demands to its regulation; that is, robustness of region-specific expression and functional dynamics."

The sustained DAT down-regulation in response to PKC activation is believed mainly to be a result of DAT endocytosis through a clathrin-dependent mechanism (6Chi L. Reith M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In addition, DAT trafficking is regulated by other protein kinases, such as MAPK and Akt (14Garcia B.G. Wei Y. Moron J.A. Lin R.Z. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Morón J.A. Zakharova I. Ferrer J.V. Merrill G.A. Hope B. Lafer E.M. Lin Z.C. Wang J.B. Javitch J.A. Galli A.

Biol. 2009; 20: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). DAT also undergoes a marked constitutive endocytosis, a property that first was described in heterologous cell lines (6Chi L. Reith M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Sorkina T. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutational analyses suggested that this constitutive internalization is promoted by a non-conventional trafficking motif in the DAT C terminus (10Sorkina T. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Holton K.L. Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and possibly negatively regulated by residues residing in the membrane-proximal DAT N terminus (19Sorkina T. Richards T.L. Rao A. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1361-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated by using the fluorescent cocaine analogue JHC 1-64 as label that DAT endogenously expressed in cultured midbrain dopaminergic neurons undergoes constitutive internalization (8Eriksen J. Rasmussen S.G. Rasmussen T.N. Vaegter C.B. Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Newman A.H. Gether U. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6794-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The constitutive DAT internalization was dynamin-dependent, and internalized transporter partially co-localized with the early endosomal marker Rab5 and with endocytosed transferrin (8Eriksen J. Rasmussen S.G. Rasmussen T.N. Vaegter C.B. Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Newman A.H. Gether U. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6794-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A major question is the fate of the constitutively internalized transport protein. Previous studies in heterologous cells have indicated that DAT might be sorted to a recycling pathway (10Sorkina T. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); however, postendocytic sorting of constitutively internalized DAT has not yet been analyzed in dopaminergic neurons, and postendocytic sorting of constitutively internalized DAT in heterologous cells has not been analyzed in dynamic imaging experiments using co-expressed markers of distinct endocytic compartments. In the present study, we investigated the postendocytic sorting of constitutively internalized DAT in both heterologous cells and cultured dopaminergic neurons. We took advantage of a fusion protein between the one-transmembrane segment protein Tac and DAT, which provides a transporter (TacDAT) with an extracellular N-terminal antibody epitope. In the absence of a DAT antibody directed toward an endogenous extracellular epitope, TacDAT enables the application of antibody feeding experiments and implementation of ELISA-based trafficking assays. Moreover, by use of the fluorescent cocaine analogue JHC 1-64, we are able to analyze postendocytic sorting of DAT in cultured dopaminergic neurons. Taken together, our data suggest that constitutively internalized DAT is sorted to a late endosomal/lysosomal degradative pathway as well as in part to a “short loop” recycling pathway in both neurons and cell lines. TacDAT was generated by a two-step PCR procedure. First, FLAG-Tac was amplified from pcDNA3 FLAG-Tac (20Madsen K.L. Eriksen J. Milan-Lobo L. Han D.S. Niv M.Y. Ammendrup-Johnsen I. Henriksen U. Bhatia V.K. Stamou D. Sitte H.H. McMahon H.T. Weinstein H. Gether U. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1327-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with primers generating an overhang identical to the N-terminal part of DAT. Second, DAT was amplified from a synthetic cDNA encoding the human DAT (synDAT) (21Loland C.J. Grånäs C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3228-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in pcDNA3 with a 5′ overhang identical to the C-terminal part of FLAG-Tac. The products from the first round of PCR were used as template for generating a TacDAT fragment that subsequently was cloned into the pcDNA3 synDAT vector using KpnI and BamHI. The HA-DAT 3KR mutant in pcDNA3 was made by changing lysines 19, 27, and 35 to arginines in HA-DAT (8Eriksen J. Rasmussen S.G. Rasmussen T.N. Vaegter C.B. Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Newman A.H. Gether U. J.

The plasmid pcDNA3.1 FLAG-β2-adrenergic receptor was a kind gift from Dr. Mark von Zastrow, University of California, San Francisco, CA; pJPA5 transferrin receptor-GFP was a kind gift from Dr. Bo van Deurs, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; and pEGFP-Rab4 was a kind gift from Dr. José A. Esteban, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain. The plasmids pEGFP-Rab7 and pEGFP-Rab11 were kind gifts from Dr. Katherine W. Roche, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, MD. The plasmids pHsSynXW enhanced GFP (EGFP)-Rab7 and -Rab11 were generated by PCR, amplifying the cDNA encoding region EGFP-Rab7 and -Rab11 from pEGFP-Rab7 and pEGFP-Rab11, respectively. After digestion with BsiWI + MluI, fragments were ligated into the lentiviral transfer vector pHSynCXW (8Eriksen J. Rasmussen S.G. Rasmussen T.N. Vaegter C.B. Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Newman A.H. Gether U. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6794-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). EGFP-Rab4 was cloned into pHsSynXW by excising EGFP-Rab4 from pEGFP-Rab4 with NheI and SalI and ligated into pHsSynXW digested with SpeI and SalI. The sequences of the cDNAs were verified by sequencing. HEK293 cells and 1Rb3An27 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FCS and transfected using standard Lipofectamine 2000 protocols (Invitrogen) 2 days prior to the experiment. Postnatally derived rat midbrain dopaminergic neurons were prepared as described previously (8Eriksen J. Rasmussen S.G. Rasmussen T.N. Vaegter C.B. Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Newman A.H. Gether U. J.

Rajendran G. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4264-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultures were obtained from the ventral midbrain of 1–3-day-old pups. The dissected tissue sample was digested in a papain solution for 30 min at 37 °C while slowly superfusing with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The digested tissue was carefully triturated into single cells using increasingly smaller pipette tips. The cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in warm SF1C consisting of 50% modified Eagle's medium, 40% DMEM, and 10% Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (all from Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.35% d-glucose, 0.5 mm glutamine, 1% heat-inactivated calf serum (Invitrogen), 5 mm kynurenic acid, 12 units/ml penicillin, 12 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.05% liquid catalase, and diPorzio (24di Porzio U. Daguet M.C. Glowinski J. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1980; 288: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The neurons were plated on a monolayer of glial cells grown in Lab-Tek wells (Nunc). The cells were allowed to settle for ∼2 h before addition of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) (10 ng/ml). The next day 5-fluorodeoxyuridine was added to inhibit growth of glial cells. Lentiviral vectors were produced as described previously (8Eriksen J. Rasmussen S.G. Rasmussen T.N. Vaegter C.B. Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Newman A.H. Gether U. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6794-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) according to procedures modified from Naldini et al. (25Naldini L. Blömer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4000) Google Scholar). HEK293T packaging cells were transiently triple transfected with the following: 1) packaging plasmid encoding viral structure proteins (pBRΔ8.91), 2) envelope plasmid encoding the envelope protein vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (pMD.G), and 3) transfer plasmid containing the gene of interest (pHsSynXW EGFP-Rab4, -Rab7, or -Rab11). The transfections were performed in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) using calcium phosphate precipitation. Medium was replaced with fresh medium after 5 h. Approximately 48 and 72 h after transfection, media containing lentivirus were collected, centrifuged, filtered, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The virus-containing pellet was resuspended in modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) at1280 of the original volume and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The neuronal cultures were incubated with concentrated lentivirus on days 2–3 in vitro, and experiments were performed 8–12 days after infection. Uptake assays were carried out as described previously (21Loland C.J. Grånäs C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3228-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using 2,5,6-[3H]dopamine (30–60 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and HEK293 cells transfected with equal amounts of pcDNA3 synDAT or pcDNA3 TacDAT plated in 24-well plates (105 cells/well). The uptake assays were carried out 2 days after transfection for 3 min at room temperature (20–22 °C) in uptake buffer (25 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm l-ascorbic acid, 5 mm d-glucose, and 1 m catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Ro 41-0960 (Sigma), pH 7.4). A serial dilution of non-labeled dopamine, cocaine, or nomifensine was added to the cells prior to initiation of uptake with ∼10 nm [3H]dopamine. Binding experiments were carried out using [3H]CFT (76 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) essentially as described (26Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells transiently transfected with equal amounts of pcDNA3 synDAT or pcDNA3 TacDAT were plated in 24-well plates (105 cells/well) 1 day after transfection, and the binding experiment was carried out 2 days after transfection. A serial dilution of non-labeled CFT was added to the cells prior to addition of 3 nm [3H]CFT and incubation for 60 min at 4 °C in uptake buffer. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 Tac or pcDNA3 TacDAT using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a 1:3 ratio to obtain similar surface expression and seeded in 96-well plates (35,000 cells/well) the next day. The experiment was performed 2 days after transfection. First, the cells were incubated with M1 (1 μg/ml) in DMEM for 30 min at 4 °C, and then medium was replaced with 37 °C DMEM and placed at 37 °C (or 4 °C for surface quantification) for various periods with different compounds to drive internalization. To strip off surface M1, the cells were incubated with an acid strip buffer (0.5 m NaCl and 0.2 m acetic acid) for 5 min on ice, then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and again washed twice in PBS. The cells were then blocked and permeabilized in PBS with 5% goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 30 min (background subtraction was done with cells that were not permeabilized). Then the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse antibody (1:1000; Pierce) in PBS + 5% goat serum for 30 min and washed two times in blocking buffer and two times in PBS. SuperSignal ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) was added to the wells, and the luminescence was detected in a Wallac Victor2 plate reader after 2 min. HEK293 cells, transfected with plasmids encoding HA-hDAT, TacDAT, FLAG-β2-adrenergic receptor, or transferrin receptor-GFP, were seeded in 96-well plates (35,000 cells/well) the day before the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the cells were incubated with monensin (25 μm) or vehicle for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min on ice; washed twice in PBS; blocked in PBS + 5% goat serum for 30 min; and incubated with M1 (1:5000) for TacDAT and FLAG-β2-adrenergic receptor, HA.11 antibody (1:1000; Covance, Princeton, NJ) for HA-DAT, and anti-GFP for GFP-transferrin receptor (1:2000) in PBS + 5% goat serum for 60 min. Following four washes in PBS, the cells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody against M1 and HA.11 or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody against anti-GFP for 30 min and subsequently washed four additional times in PBS. The horseradish peroxidase activity was measured as described above. HEK293 cells or 1Rb27An3 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 2 days prior to the experiment and seeded on coverslips treated with polyornithine the next day. The cells were incubated with M1 antibody (1 μg/ml) in DMEM for 30 min at 4 °C. The medium was then replaced with 37 °C DMEM and placed at 37 °C for various periods to drive internalization. The internalization was stopped by washing with cold PBS followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized in PBS with 5% goat serum and 0.2% saponin. Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes) against M1 in PBS + 5% goat serum was added for 30 min, and then the specimens were washed three times in PBS prior to mounting. For the co-localization experiments, cells were transfected with equal amounts of plasmid encoding TacDAT or FLAG-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor and EGFP-Rab4, -Rab7, or -Rab11 and seeded on coverslips treated with polyornithine. On the day of the experiment, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated M1 antibody for 30 min at 4 °C, and the medium was then replaced with 37 °C DMEM (+10 μm isoproterenol for experiments with the β2-adrenergic receptor) and placed at 37 °C for 1 h to allow internalization. The cells were subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and mounted. The stained cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope using an oil immersion numerical aperture 1.4 63× objective (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). EGFP was excited with the 488 nm laser line from an argon-krypton laser, and the emitted light was detected using a 505–550-nm band pass filter, whereas the Alexa Fluor 568 dye was excited at 543 nm with a helium-neon laser, and the emitted light was detected using a 585-nm long pass filter. The resulting images were combined using ImageJ3 software. Quantification of co-localization with EGFP-tagged Rab4, Rab7, and Rab11 was done using the RG2B co-localization plug-in to ImageJ 3W. S.

Single cells were defined as regions of interest to avoid noise from untransfected cells and nonspecific staining. A minimum threshold pixel intensity of 120 was set for each channel, and the minimum ratio for pixel intensity between the two channels was set to 0.5. Results are displayed as percent co-localization as determined by dividing the area of co-localization pixels by the total area over the threshold of the M1 signal. 30–35 cells were used for quantification under each condition. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. 1Rb3An27 cells or dopaminergic neurons were grown in poly-l-ornithine-treated Lab-Tek chambers. On the day of the experiment, the cells were incubated with the rhodamine-conjugated fluorescent cocaine analogue JHC 1-64 (28Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Adkins E.M. Rasmussen S.G. Loland C.J. Schoenenberger B. Gether U. Newman A.H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 7513-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in uptake buffer for the designated time periods. To detect internalization in midbrain dopaminergic neurons and 1Rn27An3 cells, the cultures were incubated with 5 nm JHC 1-64 in uptake buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, the buffer was removed and replaced with 37 °C uptake buffer, and the cultures were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. For the LysoTracker co-localization experiment, we used LysoTracker Green (100 nm; Molecular Probes) in the last 10 min of incubation, and subsequently the cells were washed in uptake buffer. After incubation, the living cells were imaged at room temperature using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope with a 63× numerical aperture 1.4 objective. JHC 1-64 was visualized using a 543 nm helium-neon laser line and a 585-nm long pass filter, EGFP was detected with a 488 nm argon-krypton laser line and a 505–550-nm band pass filter, and the distribution of JHC 1-64 on the neurons were analyzed with a Z-scan. To enable the study of DAT trafficking with high specificity and to detect even small amounts of DAT endocytosis, we wanted to generate a DAT construct with a high affinity extracellular antibody epitope. Instead of disrupting the extracellular loops, we decided to add an extra transmembrane segment to the DAT N terminus. This was done by taking advantage of the single transmembrane segment protein Tac and making a “head-to-tail” fusion of the DAT and a Tac construct containing an M1 antibody FLAG epitope after the Tac signal sequence (20Madsen K.L. Eriksen J. Milan-Lobo L. Han D.S. Niv M.Y. Ammendrup-Johnsen I. Henriksen U. Bhatia V.K. Stamou D. Sitte H.H. McMahon H.T. Weinstein H. Gether U. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1327-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Note that Tac fusion proteins have been used previously as a “silent reporter” in several trafficking studies (18Holton K.L. Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. Nat.

Horton A.C. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2003; 40: 581-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The resulting construct, TacDAT, was expressed transiently in HEK293 cells, and immunostaining with the M1 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated in the absence of permeabilization a clear surface staining, confirming that the N-terminal antibody epitope is exposed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane and that the protein is expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1B). TacDAT was functionally analyzed in [3H]dopamine uptake experiments in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1C). TacDAT mediated uptake with a Km value of ∼0.40 μm as compared with ∼0.92 μm for DAT and displayed a partially reduced uptake capacity (Fig. 1C and Table 1). We also performed binding assays with the high affinity cocaine analogue [3H]CFT, which showed an affinity for TacDAT of ∼8 nm compared with ∼19 nm for DAT and a partially reduced Bmax (Table 1). The DAT inhibitors cocaine and nomifensine also showed a slightly higher apparent affinity (∼2-fold increase) for TacDAT as compared with DAT. Taken together, the data show that TacDAT is functional with a pharmacology very similar to that of DAT. Because our experiments would involve TacDAT with M1 bound, we also made sure that binding of the M1 antibody to TacDAT did not affect transporter function as determined by measuring [3H]dopamine uptake in the presence of bound M1 antibody (Fig. 1D).TABLE 1Functional properties of TacDAT compared with DATDATTacDAT[3H]Dopamine Km (μm)0.92 (0.62–1.4)0.40 (0.36–0.47)[3H]Dopamine Vmax (fmol/min/105)2486 ± 236511 ± 104Cocaine Ki (nm)154 (128–187)86.4 (66.6–112)Nomifensine Ki (nm)75.1 (49.3–114)45.7 (31.9–65.4)[3H]CFT Kd (nm)18."

Laura Bonetta reports on new studies that provide a glimpse of the opportunities ahead. The ever-decreasing cost of sequencing is ushering in a new era in genomic medicine. Laura Bonetta reports on new studies that provide a glimpse of the opportunities ahead. Only 5 years ago, it was a multimillion-dollar proposition. But today, the 3 billion base pairs of a human genome can be sequenced for about $50,000, and prices are expected to drop by more than half by year's end. It's still a hefty price tag, especially if you add to it the time and resources needed to interpret the data. But the drop in costs now makes it feasible to sequence the entire genome of patients and their families to find elusive disease-causing mutations. Researchers currently rely on microarrays containing common human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to quickly scan the genomes of hundreds or thousands of individuals at once to pull out variations associated with disease. But despite an explosion of data from these so-called genome-wide association studies, the variations identified only account for a small proportion of the genetic risk of developing a disease. Whole-genome sequencing promises to uncover this hidden genetic risk. By sequencing the entire genome of an individual and then comparing the sequence to that of a reference human genome, researchers can catalog every single variation in the DNA code of that particular individual. Bioinformatics tools can then home in on the variations associated with a particular trait or condition. Once enough genome sequences have been amassed, whole-genome sequencing then could be used to diagnose disease or to inform the best therapeutic options. As sequencing costs continue to plummet and bioinformatics tools mature, whole-genome sequencing is poised to replace other tools of the genomics trade. “It's definitely the way forward,” says Richard Gibbs of the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, whose group has just reported a pioneering study using whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations that cause the hereditary disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (N. Engl. J. Med., 2010, 362, 1181–1191). Since coming on the market in 2005, next-generation sequencing methods have greatly increased sequencing speeds and have driven down costs, compared to the original Sanger sequencing method used by the Human Genome Project. The immediate application of whole-genome sequencing using next-generation technologies is to search for mutations responsible for single-gene (Mendelian) diseases or monogenic traits. Gibbs sequenced the whole genome of his colleague James Lupski, a prominent medical geneticist who has Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness. Mutations in over 30 different genes, many of them identified by Lupski himself, give rise to this condition, but Lupski did not carry any of them. Comparison of Lupski's full genome sequence to the Human Genome Project reference sequence revealed many differences that greatly exceeded the number of known SNPs and other variations. As a result, Gibbs and Lupski had to determine which of these variations were disease-associated mutations, harmless variations, or just errors in sequencing. “This is going to be a common problem for all sequencing projects,” says Gibbs. “We are going to find many more mutations than are currently in databases, so you need to find a way to narrow down the hits.” So, the researchers focused on select variations found in genes previously linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and other nerve disorders. They found two compelling mutations, one in each allele, of a gene called SH3TC2, which is expressed in the Schwann cells that wrap the myelin sheath around nerves. Of Lupski's seven siblings, the three with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease carried both mutations and the four without the disease did not, confirming that the disease-causing mutations had been identified. “This is the first demonstration of using full blown sequencing in a clinically relevant approach,” says Gibbs. Similarly, Leroy Hood and David Galas at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle analyzed the entire genomes of four members of one family in which two children had different single-gene recessive diseases (Miller syndrome and primary ciliary dyskinesia; Science, 2010, 328, 636–639). By comparing the four sequences, “we found that sequencing errors are about 1000 times more prevalent than true mutations,” says Galas. “Distinguishing errors from variations in the sequence is more difficult to do if you are just sequencing unrelated individuals and comparing them to a reference genome.” Once they had eliminated sequencing errors and obtained a list of possible genetic variations in each individual, the group looked specifically for rare missense mutations (which would cause amino acid changes) in the coding sequences of genes located within chromosome segments inherited by both siblings. They reduced the number of possible variations responsible for the two conditions to four. “We used a simple model of rare SNPs in exons that cause missense mutations and found that applying that model eliminates all but four genes,” says Galas. “We were amazed at how well it worked.” They also obtained the first direct estimate of how much the genome changes from one generation to the next and found the mutation rate (1.1 × 10−8 mutations per position per generation per haploid genome) to be about half the predicted number. Galas and colleagues are now gearing up to sequence 30 individuals over 4 generations to obtain a more precise estimate. “Then we could ask things like, ‘What does the mutation rate depend on?’” says Galas. Finding answers about basic biological processes, such as mutation rates or disease mechanisms, is another application of whole-genome sequencing. “Individual genome sequencing so far has been primarily descriptive. It has been used to look at the features and landscape of the genome,” says Stephen Kingsmore of the National Center for Genome Resources in Santa Fe. Kingsmore recently used whole-genome sequencing to examine why in monozygotic (identical) twins discordant for multiple sclerosis—an autoimmune disease that destroys the myelin sheath protecting nerve cells—one twin has the disease and the other does not (Nature, 2010, 464, 1351–1356). His group sequenced the complete genomes of a monozygotic twin pair discordant for multiple sclerosis to look for variations that might explain the difference in disease manifestation but did not find any. “We did not find any sequence differences between twins in any unique genome sequence,” says Kingsmore. “This was a pioneering study to show how sequencing can be used to examine hypotheses.” Kingsmore also used sequencing to analyze differences in epigenetic markers and in transcripts between the genomes of this twin pair and again did not find any telltale differences. “A new paradigm in genome analysis is to include the functional genome and epigenome in relevant tissues,” he says, “in addition to just sequencing the canonical, static genome.” Whole-genome sequencing requires tremendous computational power—for example, one complete human genome at 30-fold coverage requires 90 Gb of computer space—and sophisticated analyses. “The paper we published makes it look fairly straight forward. But that work involved large teams of people with expertise in biology and bioinformatics, and we spent a lot of time analyzing the data,” says Gibbs. Another challenge is that most high-speed, next-generation instruments sequence DNA in very short segments, or reads, of about 100 base pairs, according to Jeff Schloss of the National Genome Research Institute. “This is a huge problem for understanding the structure of the genome.” Short reads make it impossible to independently assemble a genome sequence from scratch. Thus, researchers need to overlay their sequence data on a reference genome. But the sequence data cannot be sorted into the two sets of parental chromosomes, or haplotypes. And short reads make it difficult to detect variations other than single base-pair changes or very small deletions and insertions. “There are new technologies that promise longer reads and are probably not going to be much more costly,” says Schloss. “Many people will want to get their hands on them.” Pacific Biosciences and Life Technologies plan to market these so-called third-generation sequencing machines within the next year or so. These instruments provide single-molecule resolution—in other words, sequence information from a single DNA strand—and can sequence reads of a thousand bases or more. In addition, some third-generation sequencing instruments should allow detection of methylation changes and the ability to directly sequence RNA. Another problem is that the reference genome is not optimal for comparisons that involve complex datasets. In addition, databases of genome variations, such as SNP databases, are not sufficiently well populated to enable researchers to find matches for the thousands of changes they find in their sequencing efforts. Also, algorithms for interpreting sequence data are still not sufficiently mature to handle data from large numbers of individuals with many different diseases. Given these challenges and the cost of whole-genome sequencing, some labs have opted only to sequence the exons, or exome, of an individual. Exome sequencing (about 1% of the whole genome) costs $5000 and requires simpler analysis. “We are interested in monogenic disorders and most mutations are found in coding regions of genes,” says Michael Bamshad at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. “At the moment, we think exome sequencing is a better use of resources.” Bamshad and colleague Jay Shendure sequenced the exomes of four individuals from three families that had a child with Miller syndrome. They mapped the mutation to the gene DHODH (which encodes an enzyme involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis) that was also identified by Hood and Galas (Nat. Genet., 2010, 42, 30–35). Bamshad predicts that soon there will be many more reports of disease mutations identified by exome sequencing. “We and others have found additional genes using this method that will be published soon,” he says. Of course, exome sequencing will miss mutations that are in noncoding regions of the genome or in coding regions that have not yet been annotated. “We will probably get 1 in 2 or 1 in 3 mutations. This is because a lot of mutations are too subtle or they are not in what is known to be a transcript,” says Kingsmore. Nonetheless, Kingsmore's group has taken advantage of exome sequencing to develop a sequence-based test to identify people who carry mutations in a panel of 500 genes that predispose to several childhood diseases. “It will be used for carrier testing, much like was done for Tay Sachs and other genetic diseases,” he says. Launching at the end of the year, it will be one of the first gene sequencing-based tests to come on the market. “These types of panels will be a great way to usher in genomics-based medicine,” he says. One of the most exciting applications of whole-genome sequencing is to decipher the molecular basis of complex diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autism, and schizophrenia, which are thought to be caused by combinations of several mutations and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies have picked up many of the more common variants associated with particular diseases. “But these studies have told us that the vast majority of the genetic risk of most common diseases is not explained by common variants and that most disease-related common variants have very small effects on disease risk,” says Richard Lifton at Yale University in Connecticut. “These findings suggest an alternative model in which individually rare variants with relatively large effects will play a substantial role.” His group has demonstrated that rare heterozygous mutations in genes that cause recessive forms of low blood pressure fit this model. “Those alleles are found collectively in 2% of the population, but each one reduced the risk of hypertension by about 60%,” says Lifton. He thinks that the same principle will apply to more common types of disease. “Because these variants are rare in the population, you will need large cohorts to distinguish functional variants from those that have no consequence,” he says. “That will be a significant challenge.” Matthew State, also at Yale, is applying exome sequencing to elucidate the mechanisms involved in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. “There is a lot of evidence that multiple rare mutations will account for a good deal of autism,” says State. “Already the rare variants that have been identified so far have changed the way people think about autism.” For example, some of the known variants are involved in the mechanism by which nerve impulses in a presynaptic neuron increase the probability that the postsynaptic neuron will fire an action potential. Using a large DNA repository from 1700 families (comprising an autistic child, the parents, and an unaffected sibling), State and colleagues have started sequencing exomes. “Initially, we are sequencing trios—two parents and a child—and then picking out rare missense and nonsense mutations that arise de novo in the affected children,” he says. “There is already a good deal of evidence that new mutations are important in autism and this approach is a great way of winnowing down the tremendous amount of rare variations we see in the exome.” Although State believes that rare variants will reveal a great deal about both the genetic predisposition for and the molecular mechanisms underlying autism, he is cautiously optimistic. “I also think there is a good chance that the genetic risks have been overestimated,” he says. “We will probably have to take into account other mechanisms such as epigenetics and environmental contributions.” One of the biggest efforts to look for variants associated with complex traits is the Exome Sequencing Project funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The project aims to sequence about 8000 exomes of individuals with common cardiovascular and lung diseases like early myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whether rare alleles will individually account for a large proportion of genetic risk is debatable. “My expectation is that we will find many rare variants associated with common diseases but individually they will not account for a large proportion of cases of disease,” says Kari Stefansson, president of the Icelandic company DeCode Genomics. “The epidemiological data does not support this conclusion.” Instead, Stefansson predicts that common diseases will be caused by the “rare confluence of variants rather than just individual rare variants giving large effects,” he explains. DeCode plans to sequence the entire genomes of 2000–2500 Icelanders, a population for which the company has already gathered extensive genotypic and medical data. This sequencing project and other population-based studies such as the 1000 Genomes Project—an international collaboration between China, Germany, the UK, and the US to sequence the whole genomes of about 2000 individuals—will help to answer questions about the prevalence and role of rare variants in disease. “Once we have the sequence data, we won't have to postulate any more and I predict we will all be very surprised,” says Stefansson. Other whole-genome sequencing projects are looking at the sequences of different cancers. “In cancer, it is clear that each cancer cell will have thousands to tens of thousands of mutations. Most of them will be random, what we call passenger mutations,” says Peter Campbell at the UK's Sanger Institute. “But some, and we don't know the number, will be driver mutations responsible for cancer development.” Campbell's group is part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium, which plans to describe all genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic changes in 50 different tumor types in 25,000 cancer samples. “What whole-genome sequencing is providing is discovery of all mutations without bias. We were sequencing genes before, but based on candidate genes we already knew were probably involved in cancer. So the sequencing merely allowed us to delve deeper into the mutations,” says John McPherson, at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Toronto, whose group is sequencing the pancreatic cancer genome. “With unbiased sequencing we can find anything. We will find new genes. This will help in the basic understanding of cancer mechanisms but also will help us define new subtypes.” The picture emerging from cancer genomics is that specific cellular pathways are important in cancer development. “Driver mutations occur in certain genes at a higher frequency than they would only by chance, but they are still rare in the patient population. That is because one patient will have a mutation in one gene and another patient with the same type of cancer will have a different mutation in another gene, but the two genes are part of the same pathway,” says Campbell. “Each mutation is only found in a few percent of patients. But the pathway accounts for a large proportion of patients.” There are still many challenges before whole-genome sequencing goes mainstream, but most geneticists agree that these are exciting times. “Five years ago, it was not clear what path these next-generation sequencing technologies would take because they had not been tested,” says Lifton. “It is quite astounding to be at this point now, where we can routinely get whole genome sequences of patients.” And as sequencing costs continue to plummet, more and more labs are getting into the sequencing game. “Large projects are still the domain of genome centers, but we are seeing more groups starting to sequence and providing valuable information,” says Gibbs. “We are seeing a healthy proliferation of sequencing projects.”"
https://openalex.org/W1969963076,"In all organisms, successful cell division requires accurate copying of chromosomal DNA. To duplicate their genomes, all cells use a multiprotein apparatus known as the replisome (reviewed by Benkovic et al., 2001; McHenry, 2003; Yao and O’Donnell, 2009). The fundamental components of the replisome are conserved across viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (Table). They include a helicase to unwind the double-stranded DNA, a polymerase(s) to synthesize new strands of DNA, and a clamp loader to organize the complex on the DNA. The replisome assemblies at a region of the DNA, called the replication fork, where the double-stranded DNA is separated into two individual strands, which are both subsequently copied in the 5′ to 3′ direction of the DNA. In this SnapShot, we compare the specific components of the replisome in Escherichia coli with those of the replisome in eukaryotes. In addition, we describe how the lagging strand is synthesized from Okazaki fragments.

Among the constituents of green tea, (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) is the most effective at inhibiting carcinogenesis. However, the concentrations of EGCG that are required to elicit the anticancer effects in a variety of cancer cell types are much higher than the peak plasma concentration that occurs after drinking an equivalent of 2-3 cups of green tea. To obtain the anticancer effects of EGCG when consumed at a reasonable concentration in daily life, we investigated the combination effect of EGCG and food ingredient that may enhance the anticancer activity of EGCG on subcutaneous tumor growth in C57BL/6N mice challenged with B16 melanoma cells.All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) enhanced the expression of the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) and increased EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition in B16 melanoma cells. The cell growth inhibition seen with the combined EGCG and ATRA treatment was abolished by treatment with an anti-67LR antibody. In addition, the combined EGCG and ATRA treatment significantly suppressed the melanoma tumor growth in mice. Expression of 67LR in the tumor increased upon oral administration of ATRA or a combined treatment of EGCG and ATRA treatment. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha attenuated the ATRA-induced enhancement of 67LR expression in the melanoma cells. An RAR agonist enhanced the expression levels of 67LR and increased EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition.Our findings provide a molecular basis for the combination effect seen with dietary components, and indicate that ATRA may be a beneficial food component for cancer prevention when combined with EGCG."
https://openalex.org/W2074821310,"Genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility genes for development of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to examine whether a subset of these (comprising FTO, IDE, KCNJ11, PPARG and TCF7L2) were transcriptionally restricted to or enriched in human beta cells by sorting islet cells into alpha and beta - specific fractions. We also aimed to correlate expression of these transcripts in both alpha and beta cell types with phenotypic traits of the islet donors and to compare diabetic and non-diabetic cells.Islet cells were sorted using a previously published method and RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed and used as the template for quantitative PCR. Sorted cells were also analysed for insulin and glucagon immunostaining and insulin secretion from the beta cells as well as insulin, glucagon and GLP-1 content. All five genes were expressed in both alpha and beta cells, with significant enrichment of KCNJ11 in the beta cells and of TCF7L2 in the alpha cells. The ratio of KCNJ11 in beta to alpha cells was negatively correlated with BMI, while KCNJ11 expression in alpha cells was negatively correlated with age but not associated with BMI. Beta cell expression of glucagon, TCF7L2 and IDE was increased in cells from islets that had spent more time in culture prior to cell sorting. In beta cells, KCNJ11, FTO and insulin were positively correlated with each other. Diabetic alpha and beta cells had decreased expression of insulin, glucagon and FTO.This study has identified novel patterns of expression of type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes within sorted islet cells and suggested interactions of gene expression with age or BMI of the islet donors. However, expression of these genes in islets is less associated with BMI than has been found for other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2000850318,"Background Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), the causative agent of botulism, a serious neuroparylatic disease, is produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum and consists of a family of seven serotypes (A-H). We previously reported production of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies to BoNT serotype A. Methods and Findings Recombinant peptide fragments of the light chain, the transmembrane and receptor-binding domains of the heavy chain of botulinum neurotoxin type B (BoNT/B) were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST-fusion proteins and purified. These proteins were used to immunize BALB/cJ mice for the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Antibody-producing hybridomas were detected using either a direct binding ELISA binding to plate-immobilized BoNT/B, or with a capture-capture ELISA whereby the capacity of the antibody to capture BoNT/B from solution was tested. A total of five mAbs were selected, two of which bound the toxin light chain and three bound the receptor-binding domain of BoNT/B heavy chain. MAb MCS6-27 was identified via capture-capture ELISA and was the only mAb able to bind BoNT/B in solution under physiological conditions. MAbs F24-1, F26-16, F27-33 and F29-40 were identified via direct binding ELISA, and were able to capture BoNT/B in solution only in the presence of 0.5–0.9 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). MAb MCS6-27 and an anti-BoNT/B polyclonal antibody were incorporated into a sandwich ELISA that did not require SDS. Conclusions We report here the generation of monoclonal antibodies to serotype B and the subsequent development of a sensitive sandwich immunoassay. This immunoassay has a detection limit of 100 fg BoNT/B, fifty times more sensitive than the mouse bioassay detection limit of 5 pg BoNT/B. Additionally, this assay detected as little as 39 pg/mL of toxin in skim, 2% and whole milk."
https://openalex.org/W2003859727,"Although the circadian clock in the mammalian retina regulates many physiological processes in the retina, it is not known whether and how the clock controls the neuronal pathways involved in visual processing.By recording the light responses of rabbit axonless (A-type) horizontal cells under dark-adapted conditions in both the day and night, we found that rod input to these cells was substantially increased at night under control conditions and following selective blockade of dopamine D(2), but not D(1), receptors during the day, so that the horizontal cells responded to very dim light at night but not in the day. Using neurobiotin tracer labeling, we also found that the extent of tracer coupling between rabbit rods and cones was more extensive during the night, compared to the day, and more extensive in the day following D(2) receptor blockade. Because A-type horizontal cells make synaptic contact exclusively with cones, these observations indicate that the circadian clock in the mammalian retina substantially increases rod input to A-type horizontal cells at night by enhancing rod-cone coupling. Moreover, the clock-induced increase in D(2) receptor activation during the day decreases rod-cone coupling so that rod input to A-type horizontal cells is minimal.Considered together, these results identify the rod-cone gap junction as a key site in mammals through which the retinal clock, using dopamine activation of D(2) receptors, controls signal flow in the day and night from rods into the cone system."
https://openalex.org/W2055532157,"Background H37Rv and H37Ra are well-described laboratory strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived from the same parental strain, H37, that show dramatically different pathogenic phenotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, the transcriptomes of the two strains during axenic growth in broth and during intracellular growth within murine bone-marrow macrophages were compared by whole genome expression profiling. We identified and compared adaptations of either strain upon encountering an intracellular environment, and also contrasted the transcriptomes of the two strains while inside macrophages. In the former comparison, both strains induced genes that would facilitate intracellular survival including those involved in mycobactin synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. However, this response was stronger and more extensive for H37Rv than for H37Ra. This was manifested as the differential expression of a greater number of genes and an increased magnitude of expression for these genes in H37Rv. In comparing intracellular transcriptional signatures, fifty genes were found to be differentially expressed between the strains. Of these fifty, twelve were under control of the PhoPR regulon. Further differences between strains included genes whose products were members of the ESAT-6 family of proteins, or were associated with their secretion. Conclusions/Significance Along with the recent identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms in H37Ra when compared to H37Rv, our demonstration of differential expression of PhoP-regulated and ESX-1 region-related genes during macrophage infection further highlights the significance of these genes in the attenuation of H37Ra."
https://openalex.org/W2064129825,"Mitochondria contribute to the dynamics of cellular metabolism, the production of reactive oxygen species, and apoptotic pathways. Consequently, mitochondrial function has been hypothesized to influence functional decline and vulnerability to disease in later life. Mitochondrial genetic variation may contribute to altered susceptibility to the frailty syndrome in older adults.To assess potential mitochondrial genetic contributions to the likelihood of frailty, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation was compared in frail and non-frail older adults. Associations of selected SNPs with a muscle strength phenotype were also explored. Participants were selected from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a population-based observational study (1989-1990, 1992-1993). At baseline, frailty was identified as the presence of three or more of five indicators (weakness, slowness, shrinking, low physical activity, and exhaustion). mtDNA variation was assessed in a pilot study, including 315 individuals selected as extremes of the frailty phenotype, using an oligonucleotide sequencing microarray based on the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence. Three mtDNA SNPs were statistically significantly associated with frailty across all pilot participants or in sex-stratified comparisons: mt146, mt204, and mt228. In addition to pilot participants, 4,459 additional men and women with frailty classifications, and an overlapping subset of 4,453 individuals with grip strength measurements, were included in the study population genotyped at mt204 and mt228. In the study population, the mt204 C allele was associated with greater likelihood of frailty (adjusted odds ratio = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.07-3.60, p = 0.020) and lower grip strength (adjusted coefficient = -2.04, 95% CI = -3.33- -0.74, p = 0.002).This study supports a role for mitochondrial genetic variation in the frailty syndrome and later life muscle strength, demonstrating the importance of the mitochondrial genome in complex geriatric phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2082488872,"A GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) alpha1 subunit mutation, A322D (AD), causes an autosomal dominant form of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (ADJME). Previous studies demonstrated that the mutation caused alpha1(AD) subunit misfolding and rapid degradation, reducing its total and surface expression substantially. Here, we determined the effects of the residual alpha1(AD) subunit expression on wild type GABA(A)R expression to determine whether the AD mutation conferred a dominant negative effect. We found that although the alpha1(AD) subunit did not substitute for wild type alpha1 subunits on the cell surface, it reduced the surface expression of alpha1beta2gamma2 and alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors by associating with the wild type subunits within the endoplasmic reticulum and preventing them from trafficking to the cell surface. The alpha1(AD) subunit reduced surface expression of alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors by a greater amount than alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors, thus altering cell surface GABA(A)R composition. When transfected into cultured cortical neurons, the alpha1(AD) subunit altered the time course of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current kinetics and reduced miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitudes. These findings demonstrated that, in addition to causing a heterozygous loss of function of alpha1(AD) subunits, this epilepsy mutation also elicited a modest dominant negative effect that likely shapes the epilepsy phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2145445252,"The often dramatic effects of urbanization on community and ecosystem properties, such as primary productivity, abundances, and diversity are now well-established. In most cities local primary productivity increases and this extra energy flows upwards to alter diversity and relative abundances in higher trophic levels. The abiotic mechanisms thought to be responsible for increases in urban productivity are altered temperatures and light regimes, and increased nutrient and water inputs. However, another abiotic factor, wind speed, is also influenced by urbanization and well known for altering primary productivity in agricultural systems. Wind effects on primary productivity have heretofore not been studied in the context of urbanization.We designed a field experiment to test if increased plant growth often observed in cities is explained by the sheltering effects of built structures. Wind speed was reduced by protecting Encelia farinosa (brittlebush) plants in urban, desert remnant and outlying desert localities via windbreaks while controlling for water availability and nutrient content. In all three habitats, we compared E. farinosa growth when protected by experimental windbreaks and in the open. E. farinosa plants protected against ambient wind in the desert and remnant areas grew faster in terms of biomass and height than exposed plants. As predicted, sheltered plants did not differ from unprotected plants in urban areas where wind speed is already reduced.Our results indicate that reductions in wind speed due to built structures in cities contribute to increased plant productivity and thus also to changes in abundances and diversity of higher trophic levels. Our study emphasizes the need to incorporate wind speed in future urban ecological studies, as well as in planning for green space and sustainable cities."

In this study, we chose zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model to elucidate the role of lumican in the development of axial myopia. The zebrafish lumican gene (zlum) spans ∼4.6 kb of the zebrafish genome. Like human (hLUM) and mouse (mlum), zlum consists of three exons, two introns, and a TATA box-less promoter at the 5′-flanking region of the transcription initiation site. Sequence analysis of the cDNA predicts that zLum encodes 344 amino acids. zLum shares 51% amino acid sequence identity with human lumican. Similar to hLUM and mlum, zlum mRNA is expressed in the eye and many other tissues, such as brain, muscle, and liver as well. Transgenic zebrafish harboring an enhanced GFP reporter gene construct downstream of a 1.7-kb zlum 5′-flanking region displayed enhanced GFP expression in the cornea and sclera, as well as throughout the body. Down-regulation of zlum expression by antisense zlum morpholinos manifested ocular enlargement resembling axial myopia due to disruption of the collagen fibril arrangement in the sclera and resulted in scleral thinning.

Myopia is a very common ocular disorder, which is characterized by excessive elongation of the eyeball. In Taiwan, the prevalence of myopia is about 84% of schoolchildren aged 16–18, and the prevalence of high myopia (less than −6.0 D) at 18 years of age is 24% in girls and 18% in boys (1Lin L.L.

Recently, our prospective case control study also showed that genetic variation in the regulatory domains of the lumican gene (rs3759223 and rs3741834) were associated with high myopia susceptibility among the Han Chinese (12Chen Z.T.

It has been proposed that the horseshoe-shaped lumican core protein binds collagen molecules to modulate collagen fibril diameter, whereas the N-linked glycosaminoglycan chains regulate fibril spacing and stromal hydration for the formation and maintenance of transparent corneas (22Iozzo R.V.

Funderburgh J.L. Xia Y. Liu C.Y. Conrad G.W. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 82: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, lumican plays essential roles in wound healing by modulating epithelial cell migration (25Saika S. Shiraishi A. Liu C.Y. Funderburgh J.L. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Kao W.W. J. Biol.

Lumican-null (Lum−/−) mice and lumican- and fibromodullin-null (Lum−/−Fmod−/−) mice showed alterations of collagen fibril arrangement in interstitial connective tissues. Lum−/− Fmod−/− mice exhibited elongated axial lengths and thin sclera, which are characteristics of high myopia, and lumican-null mice (Lum−/−) also had a slight elongation of the eyeball (27Austin B.A. Coulon C.

These findings indicated that these proteoglycans may be directly or indirectly involved in scleral development, resulting in the pathoetiology of high myopia. The zebrafish is an excellent model to study vertebrate genetics and development (29Udvadia A.J. Linney E. Dev. Biol. 2003; 256: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Xu Y.S. Kantorow M.

As a disease model, transgenic zebrafish provide several advantages, such as shorter duration of embryonic development and optically transparent embryos; its development also provides easy access for observation and treatment schemes during embryogenesis in comparison with transgenic mouse models. In this study, we examined the structure, expression pattern, promoter activity, and function of zlum. Our data indicated that lumican is highly conserved between zebrafish and mammals (e.g. human and mouse) in respect to gene structure, expression patterns, and protein function. In particular, ocular enlargement and scleral thinning with changes in the ultrastructure of the sclera were noted when zLum expression was down-regulated by antisense zlum morpholinos (MO). Furthermore, in vivo zebrafish larvae assays were performed to elucidate the potential application of several muscarinic receptor antagonists to attenuate increased scleral coats caused by zlum knockdown with MO. Our results suggest that zebrafish can be used as an in vivo model for screening compounds of treating myopia. Zebrafish were raised and maintained according to protocols established previously (32Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). Briefly, adult zebrafish and embryos were maintained at 28.5 °C on a 14-h light and 10-h dark cycle. Embryos were sorted at the different stages required for each experiment and staged according to Kimmel et al. (33Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8418) Google Scholar). Chorions were removed manually with Dumont Watchmaker's Forceps No. 5. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Taiwan University and performed in compliance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. To identify the zebrafish expressed sequence tag clone encoding a putative protein sharing high sequence similarity with the human and mouse SLRP family proteins, we applied the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of the GenBankTM database using the full-length human lumican cDNA sequence. An ∼4.6-kb NotI/MluI zebrafish genomic DNA fragment containing the 5′ portion of the zebrafish lumican gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The insert was sequenced, using T3, T7, and walk-in primers, by the DNA core of the Department of Molecular Genetics, National Taiwan University. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the zlum mRNA were amplified using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end (5′-RACE) and 3′-RACE systems, respectively (Invitrogen). For the 5′-RACE experiment, 1 μg of total RNA from zebrafish eyes was reverse-transcribed with a lumican-specific primer (5′-AAGTAGAGGTATTTGATTCCGGTC-3′) corresponding to a sequence in exon 2 of the zlum gene. The RNA templates were degraded by treatment with an RNase mix. A poly(dCTP) tail was added to the 3′-end of the cDNAs with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The cDNA was amplified with a second gene-specific primer (5′-GCACAAGAAGGTGATGAAACG-3′) corresponding to a sequence from the junction between exon 1 and 2 in conjunction with the abridged anchor primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′). The resulting PCR products were diluted 100-fold and used as templates to be reamplified with a third gene-specific primer (5′-CAGACTTAGAAGTCCAGCCAAC-3′) in conjunction with the universal amplification primer (5′-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′). For 3′-RACE, PCRs were performed using a gene-specific primer (5′-GCCTCAGAGATCATCTTTGAATAG-3′) corresponding to a sequence in exon 3 of the zlum gene. The cycling conditions were as follows: 34 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C at the end of the cycles. Finally, the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE PCR products were gel-purified, and the sequences were determined with a dideoxy sequencing protocol. The transcription initiation and termination sites of the zlum gene were determined by a sequence comparison between genomic DNA, the 5′-RACE product, and the 3′-RACE product, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) were initially aligned using the ClustalW program, as described previously (34Yeh L.K. Liu C.Y. Chien C.L. Converse R.L. Kao W.W. Chen M.S. Hu F.R. Hsieh F.J. Wang I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The aligned amino acid sequences used were subsequently analyzed with the Neighbor-Joining distance analysis method to construct a phylogenetic tree by using Geneious Pro software (version 4.7). Bootstrap values were calculated from 100 replicates, and values >50% are indicated at each divergence point. Unless otherwise specified, RT-PCR reagents used in this procedure were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). RevertAidTM H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit was purchased from Fermentas (St-Leon-Rot, Germany). Zebrafish cDNA was synthesized using 40 μl of 5× reverse transcription buffer, 20 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 8 μl of 25 mm dNTPs, 10 μl of RNasin (40 units/ml), 10 μl of 50 mm random hexamers (GE Healthcare), 10 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (9.5 units/μl), and 1 μg of heat-denatured corneal poly(A)+ RNAs. Diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water was added to bring the final reaction volume to 200 μl, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, 42 °C for 90 min, 100 °C for 2 min, and 0 °C for 5 min. Twenty microliters of each of the above RT reactions was added to 80 μl of a PCR mixture containing the following: 8 μl of 10× PCR buffer without MgCl2, 8 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 10 μl of 20 ng/μl primers, 0.5 μl of Taq polymerase (5 units/μl), and 45.5 μl of H2O. The cycling conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a 15-min extension at 72 °C at the end of these cycles. Primers used were as follows: CCGCTCGAGCGGATGTTTGCTCTGGGATCCATTC (forward 5′-XhoI cut site) and TCCCCGCGGGGACTATTCAAAGATGATCTCTGAGG (reverse 3′-SacII cut site). The PCR product was confirmed by an appropriate restriction enzyme digestion and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. To develop an anti-zLum antibody, an oligopeptide deduced from zLum cDNA was synthesized (N-terminal peptide, CNERNLKFIPIVPTGIKY). The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for antibody production in rabbits. The antibodies were purified through an immune absorbent column of the above zebrafish lumican oligopeptide conjugated to SulfoLink gel (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing purified anti-zebrafish lumican antibody were pooled and concentrated, and the protein concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at 280 nm. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with PBS three times, transferred into 100% methanol, and stored at −20 °C until use. To prevent melanization, embryos raised to time points beyond the 24-h post-fertilization (hpf) stage were treated with 0.003% phenylthiourea. Whole mount RNA in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (34Yeh L.K. Liu C.Y. Chien C.L. Converse R.L. Kao W.W. Chen M.S. Hu F.R. Hsieh F.J. Wang I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes were obtained from Bio Basic Inc. (Ontario, Canada). The oligonucleotide sequence (5′-3′) was GTTTCCATCCAAGCGCAGGGTCCTCAGTCTAGAGTAGTTGACCGGTGAGCTAAATCTGCA. The hybridization signals were visualized with anti-digoxigenin antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugates using procedures recommended by Roche Applied Science. The sections were counterstained with 0.5% neutral red and mounted. Images were obtained using an AxioCam digital camera on a dissection microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Adult zebrafish corneal tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffinized sections (5 μm) of adult zebrafish corneal tissue were placed on slides and processed for deparaffinization and immunohistochemistry. Before immunostaining, tissue sections were incubated with 0.5 unit/ml keratanase at 37 °C overnight. After blocking with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, the samples were incubated with either the primary affinity-purified anti-zebrafish lumican antibody (0.1 μg/ml) or monoclonal anti-keratan sulfate antibody, washed in PBS, and then incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG). After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with streptavidin-HRP (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), then washed in PBS, and incubated with the 3′,3-diaminobenzidine chromogen for 5–10 min. Negative control samples were obtained using preimmune rabbit IgG. Total proteins were extracted from adult fish eyes using lysis solution (10 ml containing 1 ml of 200 mm HEPES/KOH buffer (pH 7.5), 200 mm sucrose (0.86 g), 50 mm KCl (0.04 g), 2.5 mm MgCl2 (0.005 g), and 100 μl of 100 mm DTT). To remove keratan sulfate chains, protein aliquots were incubated with 0.1 unit/ml endo-β-galactosidase (Sigma) and 1 unit/ml keratanase (Sigma) at 37 °C overnight. The zebrafish corneal extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then probed with the anti-zebrafish lumican N-terminal peptide antibody (0.1 μg/ml) as described above. The immunocomplex was visualized by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:2500 (Novagen, Madison, WI)) and Western Blue®-stabilized substrate (Promega). Genomic DNA, both 1.7 and 0.48 kb from the 5′-untranslated region of the zlum gene, were amplified with specific PCR primers and inserted into the multiple cloning sites of pBluescript II SK vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing an EGFP sequence. PCR primers are as follows: 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCCATTAATTCGACAGACCAG-3′ and 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAGGTAGACAACACGGTTATGT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CGACGCGTGGCTGCACAACTTAAATTAAACCT-3′ (reverse primer). The recombinant plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified with a Qiagen plasmid purification maxi kit. Purified plasmid DNA was adjusted to 50 ng/μl in distilled water and microinjected into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos under a dissecting microscope. Embryos with GFP expression were observed and imaged under a fluorescence microscope. A morpholino-antisense oligonucleotide (Gene Tools, Philomath, OR) was designed to target the 5′-untranslated and/or -flanking regions, including the translation start codon of the respective genes. The MO sequence was designed as follows: zlum-MO, 5′-GATCCCAGAGCAAACATGGCTGCAC-3′. This oligonucleotide complemented the sequence from −8 through +17 with respect to the translation initiation codon. A search of the database did not identify any sequence similarity of known zebrafish genes to zlum-MO. A random sequence MO (RS-MO) serves as a control for zlum-MO, 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. This RS-MO was obtained from Gene Tools as a standard control oligonucleotide with no target specificity. Solutions were prepared and injected at the 1–4-cell stage as described by Nasevicius and Ekker (35Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). Corneas of zlum-MO-injected, RS-MO-injected, and wild type zebrafish at 7 and 12 days post-fertilization (dpf) stage were fixed in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at room temperature. After re-fixation in 1% osmium tetraoxide for 4 h at room temperature, the samples were washed in phosphate buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812 epoxy resin. Semi-thick sections (100 nm) were stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin 50-nm sections were collected on 75 mesh copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and images were photographed with a Hitachi 7100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an AMT digital camera. Collagen fibril diameters and scleral thickness were measured with Image-Pro Plus version 4.5. Corneal stroma, anterior sclera, and posterior sclera from six zlum-MO and six wild type zebrafish at each 7- and 12-dpf stage were analyzed. Six to 12 areas of collagen fibrils were analyzed for each region in each group, generating 772–1678 measurements for each condition, and 27–84 measurements were generated by analysis of scleral thickness for anterior and posterior sclera in each group at the 12-dpf stage. Collagen fibers and scleral thickness (in micrometers) are represented as the mean ± S.D., and all measurements were analyzed using Student's t tests assuming unequal variances. To apply our zebrafish model for myopia drug screening, different muscarinic receptor antagonists, atropine, pirenzepine (M1), and methoctramine (M2) purchased from Sigma were used according to protocols previously described with some modifications (36Luft W.A. Ming Y. Stell W.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1330-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Williams F.E. Messer W.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. Toxicol.

Briefly, before drug screening test, the maximal sublethal concentration of each drug was determined, and the drug concentration was selected by the survival rate of embryos greater than 60% at 6 dpf stage. Zebrafish larvae were placed in a 96-well plate at 1 fish per well. In this assay, the zlum-MO-injected larvae were exposed to 0.5% atropine, 0.25% pirenzepine, and 0.01% methoctramine starting at 3 dpf for 48 h, respectively, after which the larvae were anesthetized with Tricaine, immobilized in 3% methylcellulose, and observed under dissecting microscopy. The axial length of eyeball, diameter of scleral coat, and the ratio of RPE diameter/scleral coat diameter were measured. Student's t test was used to compare these parameters between control group and treated groups, respectively. The difference of significance was defined as p < 0.05. We identified zlum by performing a BLAST search of the publicly available zebrafish databases with human LUM. The zlum gene is 11 kb upstream of zkera (keratocan) (Fig. 1). We have isolated clones representing the full open reading frames (ORF) of zebrafish lumican. A cDNA clone encoding the lumican ORF was subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The ORF of the zlum gene was 1032 bp long and encoded 344 amino acid residues. The proved nucleotide sequence of the zebrafish lumican gene (zlum) gene was submitted to the GenBankTM database under GenBankTM accession number GQ376197. This sequence has been scanned against the database and is significantly related to the sequence NM_001002059.1, which is derived from BC071347.1 and has not yet been subject to final NCBI review (39Strausberg R.L.

The zlum gene spans ∼4.6 kb (4610 bp) and contains three exons and two introns (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis revealed that exon 1 contains 26 untranslated nucleotides, exon 2 contains 24 noncoding and 880 coding nucleotides, and exon 3 contains 152 bases of coding sequence and 1106 bases of 3′-untranslated sequence. The transcription initiation site marked +1 was determined by 5′-RACE, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first translation initiation ATG codon is located at the 844th base downstream of the beginning of exon 1. There was no TATA consensus sequence found in the ∼2.58 kb of proximal 5′-flanking region. The full-length zlum cDNA clone (∼1.9 kb) contains a 1032-bp ORF of 344 amino acids of zLum core protein.

https://openalex.org/W2046622576,"Background In March 2009, pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A(H1N1)pdm) emerged in Mexico and the United States. In Japan, since the first outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm in Osaka and Hyogo Prefectures occurred in the middle of May 2009, the virus had spread over 16 of 47 prefectures as of June 4, 2009. Methods/Principal Findings We analyzed all-segment concatenated genome sequences of 75 isolates of A(H1N1)pdm viruses in Japan, and compared them with 163 full-genome sequences in the world. Two analyzing methods, distance-based and Bayesian coalescent MCMC inferences were adopted to elucidate an evolutionary relationship of the viruses in the world and Japan. Regardless of the method, the viruses in the world were classified into four distinct clusters with a few exceptions. Cluster 1 was originated earlier than cluster 2, while cluster 2 was more widely spread around the world. The other two clusters (clusters 1.2 and 1.3) were suggested to be distinct reassortants with different types of segment assortments. The viruses in Japan seemed to be a multiple origin, which were derived from approximately 28 transported cases. Twelve cases were associated with monophyletic groups consisting of Japanese viruses, which were referred to as micro-clade. While most of the micro-clades belonged to the cluster 2, the clade of the first cases of infection in Japan originated from cluster 1.2. Micro-clades of Osaka/Kobe and the Fukuoka cases, both of which were school-wide outbreaks, were eradicated. Time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for each micro-clade demonstrated that some distinct viruses were transmitted in Japan between late May and early June, 2009, and appeared to spread nation-wide throughout summer. Conclusions Our results suggest that many viruses were transmitted from abroad in late May 2009 irrespective of preventive actions against the pandemic influenza, and that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm had become a pandemic stage in June 2009 in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2117712638,"Dendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal regulatory role in activation of both the innate as well as the adaptive immune system by responding to environmental microorganisms. We have previously shown that Lactobacillus acidophilus induces a strong production of the pro-inflammatory and Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12 in DC, whereas bifidobacteria do not induce IL-12 but inhibit the IL-12 production induced by lactobacilli. In the present study, genome-wide microarrays were used to investigate the gene expression pattern of murine DC stimulated with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium bifidum Z9. L. acidophilus NCFM strongly induced expression of interferon (IFN)-β, other virus defence genes, and cytokine and chemokine genes related to the innate and the adaptive immune response. By contrast, B. bifidum Z9 up-regulated genes encoding cytokines and chemokines related to the innate immune response. Moreover, B. bifidum Z9 inhibited the expression of the Th1-promoting genes induced by L. acidophilus NCFM and had an additive effect on genes of the innate immune response and Th2 skewing genes. The gene encoding Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2), a transcription factor regulating the activation of JNK, was one of the few genes only induced by B. bifidum Z9. Neutralization of IFN-β abrogated L. acidophilus NCFM-induced expression of Th1-skewing genes, and blocking of the JNK pathway completely inhibited the expression of IFN-β. Our results indicate that B. bifidum Z9 actively inhibits the expression of genes related to the adaptive immune system in murine dendritic cells and that JPD2 via blocking of IFN-β plays a central role in this regulatory mechanism."

However, here we report that rather than PKC, direct binding of PEs/diacylglycerol to the NHE1 lipid-interacting domain (LID) and the subsequent tighter association of LID with the plasma membrane mainly underlies NHE1 activation. We show that (i) PEs directly interact with the LID of NHE1 in vitro, (ii) like PKC, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled LID translocates to the plasma membrane in response to PEs and receptor agonists, (iii) LID mutations markedly inhibit these interactions and PE/receptor agonist-induced NHE1 activation, and (iv) PKC inhibitors ineffectively block NHE1 activation, except staurosporin, which itself inhibits NHE1 via LID. Thus, we propose a PKC-independent mechanism of NHE1 regulation via a PE-binding motif previously unrecognized.

The ubiquitous Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 isoform) is a well-documented PE-activated membrane protein (3Moolenaar W.H. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W.

Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). NHE1 catalyzes electroneutral Na+/H+ exchange and is an important regulator of intracellular pH (pHi), Na+ concentration, and cell volume (6Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol.

NHE1 is activated in response to various stimuli, including hormones, growth factors, and mechanical stress, and thereby optimizing the intracellular ionic environment for many cellular functions including cell proliferation, cell migration, and volume regulation (6Wakabayashi S.

Furthermore, this activation is also thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as cancer and heart failure (11Karmazyn M. Sawyer M. Fliegel L. Curr. Drug Targets Cardiovasc Haematol. Disord. 2005; 5: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Nakamura T.Y. Iwata Y. Arai Y. Komamura K. Wakabayashi S. Circ.

Regulation of NHE1 is thought to occur through the interaction of multiple signaling molecules with the carboxyl (C)-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NHE1, their post-translational modifications, and subsequent conformational changes in the amino (N)-terminal transmembrane domain responsible for catalyzing the Na+/H+ exchange reaction (6Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 10Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A for membrane topology). Furthermore, this regulation is attributable to a change in the affinity for intracellular H+ (6Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 14Paris S. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10989-10994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lacroix J. Poët M.

Of the signaling molecules, calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1, a ubiquitous isoform of CHPs) was suggested to play an essential role in maintaining the structure/function of NHE1 as an obligatory subunit (16Pang T.

We predicted that NHE1 is activated through PKC-independent mechanisms such as direct interaction with PE/diacylglycerol (DAG). The NHE1 region adjacent to the CHP-binding site (18Ammar Y.B.

Because this ∼60-residue region (Fig. 1A), which includes the PIP2-binding site, is also essential for hormonal NHE1 activation (6Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 22Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that change in the interaction of this region (lipid-interacting domain, LID) with cell membranes may be critical for regulation of NHE1. Here, we investigated the biochemical properties of LID, and found that it contains a novel PE/DAG-binding domain, which plays a critical role in NHE1 regulation. The template plasmid carrying cDNA coding for the NHE1 human isoform with some unique restriction sites cloned into the pECE mammalian expression vector has been described previously (24Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). All the constructs were produced by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy as described previously (24Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In brief, PCR products generated using forward and reverse primers were inserted into the appropriate restriction sites of expression vectors. For construction of GFP- or mCherry-tagged wild-type and mutant LID, the cytoplasmic region (amino acids 542–598) of NHE1 was amplified by PCR using pECE constructs as templates and inserted into mammalian expression vectors, pEGFP-C1 or pmCherry-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. For construction of mCherry-PKCδ-C1a, PKCδ-C1a domain (amino acids 159–208) of cloned human PKCδ was amplified and inserted into pmCherry-C1 vector, and for construction of MARCKS-GFP, the entire coding region of cloned human MARCKS was inserted into pEGFP-N1 vector. The cDNA coding for mouse α1-adrenergic receptor was purchased from Invitrogen and cloned into the expression vector pT-REx-DEST30 (Invitrogen). GFP-labeled PLCδ-PH domain (25Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Tobias Meyer (Stanford University). The DNA sequences of the PCR fragments were confirmed using an Applied Biosystems Model 3130 autosequencer. Exchanger-deficient PS120 cells (26Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) or PS120 cells stably expressing the wild-type NHE1 (our basic confocal observations described in this report did not differ across these two cell types) were co-transfected with GFP- or mCherry-labeled LID and other constructs for 6–8 h by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA). Cells were trypsinized and plated onto glass-bottom 35-mm dishes. Fluorescent signals were observed by confocal microscopy with an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope 16–24 h after trypsinization. Various reagents such as PMA, OAG, and receptor agonists were added directly to dishes at 22–25 °C. Imaging data were usually taken each 15 or 30 s over 10–20 min. Changes in fluorescence intensities around plasma membranes (Figs. 1C and 6D) were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). Fluorescence intensities in areas including plasma membranes and the whole cells were measured after these areas were selected by eye through an experimental series. Statistical analysis of colocalization was performed using software included with the confocal system (Fig. 1D). For co-transfection with mCherry-LID and GFP-PLCδ-PH (supplemental Figs. S5 and S6), line scanning of fluorescence intensity was performed at each cell, and fluorescence intensities in plasma membrane (Imem) and cytosol (Icyt) were measured using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.). The relative membrane-localization index (Imem − Icyt)/(Imem + Icyt) was calculated as described (25Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, we first stably transfected PS120 cells with mouse α1-adrenergic receptor under selection with G418. The cDNAs encoding the wild-type and mutant NHE1 variants were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into either PS120 or PS120 cells expressing α1-adrenergic receptor. Stable cell populations with Na+/H+ exchange activity were selected by acid-killing selection procedure as previously described (22Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli-induced change in pHi was measured using the dual-excitation ratiometric pH-indicator BCECF/AM, as previously described (27Hisamitsu T. Ben Ammar Y. Nakamura T.Y. Wakabayashi S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13346-13355Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing NHE1 variants were serum-depleted more than 2 h and loaded for 3 min with 0.3 μm BCECF/AM (Invitrogen) at room temperature in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing: 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.0). Cells were then placed in a flow chamber connected to a perfusion system and superfused (0.6 ml/min) with HBS at 35 °C. We measured fluorescence at 510–530 nm with alternating excitations at 440 and 490 nm through a 505-nm dichroic reflector. Images were collected every 10–20 s using a cooled CCD camera (ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu photonics K.K., Japan) mounted on an inverted microscope (IX 71, Olympus) with a ×20 objective (UApo/340, Olympus), and processed with AQUACOSMOS software (Hamamatsu Photonics). Change in pHi was monitored by switching perfusions from normal medium to HBS containing various reagents. The resting pHi was calibrated as previously reported, using a high [K+] solution containing: 140 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.005 mm nigericin, and adjusted to various pH values ranging from 7.0 to 7.5. The change in pHi was also measured by the [14C]benzoic acid-equilibration method (22Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 28L'Allemain G. Paris S. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5809-5815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, serum-depleted cells were preincubated for 30 min in bicarbonate-free HEPES-buffered DMEM (pH 7.0), and then incubated in the same medium containing [14C]benzoic acid (1 μCi/ml) and various agents for 15 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were preincubated in HEPES-buffered DMEM containing wortmannin (10 μm) or PKC inhibitors (1 μm) and then switched to radioisotope medium containing PMA or phenylephrine and each inhibitor. After washing four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cellular uptake of 14C-radioactivity was measured. The change in pHi was calculated according to the following equation: ΔpHi = log10 (14Cstim/14Cref), where 14Cstim and 14Cref are the intracellular 14C-radioactivity in the presence or absence of extracellular stimuli, respectively. 22Na+ uptake activity was measured by the K+/nigericin pHi clamp method as described previously (29Wakabayashi S. Hisamitsu T. Pang T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, serum-depleted cells in 24-well plates were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a Na+-free choline chloride/KCl medium containing: 20 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4), 1.2–140 mm KCl (adjusted to total 140 mm by choline chloride), 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 0.005 mm nigericin. 22Na+ uptake was initiated by adding the same choline chloride/KCl solution containing 22NaCl (37 kBq/ml; final concentration, 1 mm), 1 mm ouabain, and 0.1 mm bumetanide. In some wells, the uptake solution contained 0.1 mm EIPA. One min later, cells were rapidly washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to terminate 22Na+ uptake. pHi was calculated from [K+]i/[K+]o = [H+]i/[H+]o by assuming an intracellular [K+] of 120 mm. EIPA-inhibitable 22Na+ uptake was fitted by nonlinear least squares analysis to a Hill equation using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc.), as shown in Equation 1, where Vmax is the maximal uptake activity at very low pHi, K is the dissociation constant for H+, and n is the Hill coefficient. Data were plotted against pHi after normalization to the Vmax value. In some experiments, calphostin C (1 μm) or staurosporin (1 μm) was included throughout the preincubation and 22Na+ uptake periods. The data were normalized based on the protein concentration, which was measured using a bicinchoninic assay system (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Binding of the fluorescent PE, SAPD, to peptides was quantified essentially as described previously (30Slater S.J. Ho C. Kelly M.B. Larkin J.D. Taddeo F.J. Yeager M.D. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4627-4631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) by measuring the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from tryptophans to the 2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl fluorophore attached at the 12-position of the phorbol moiety. The fluorescence intensities, obtained upon excitation of the tryptophan fluorophore at 280 nm, were determined using a spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi, FL4500) at 340 and 440 nm, corresponding to the emission maxima of tryptophan and SAPD, respectively. Peptides used in the experiments contain one tryptophan residue (Trp-546 of NHE1 for GP57 and GC20, Trp-663 of NHE1 for IL54). The solution (0.5 ml) consisted of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm each peptide. In one experiment, liposomes (0.17 mg) consisting of 89% PC, 5% PS, 5% PA, and 1% PIP2 (weight %) was added to the cuvette. In some experiments, PMA, 4α-PMA, and OAG were added at the indicated concentrations. SAPD was titrated from stock solutions of the required concentration prepared from a Me2SO solution. To isolate the fluorescence signal resulting from FRET, the observed fluorescence intensities at each SAPD concentration were corrected for volume changes incurred during the titration procedure and normalized for the contribution from the direct excitation of the SAPD fluorophore according to Equation 2, where Fi,+P and Fi,-P are the fluorescence intensities measured after each SAPD addition in the presence and absence of peptides, respectively, and F0,+P and F0,-P are the fluorescence intensities measured in the absence of SAPD in the presence and absence of peptides, respectively. The data were fitted by nonlinear least squares analysis to a Hill equation, as shown in Equation 3, View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)where Fmax and Fmin are the maximum and minimum corrected FRET signals, Kd is the binding constant for SAPD, cSAPD is the concentration of SAPD, and n is the Hill coefficient.

After obtaining Kd,app by curve fitting, Kd,C was calculated using the Kd,SAPD value for SAPD. For liposome preparation, a lipid mixture was made in chloroform and dried under nitrogen gas. Dried lipid mixture was agitated vigorously by vortexing in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol and sonicated for 1 min on ice in a bath-type sonicator. The resultant liposomes (0.2 mg) were mixed with peptides (140 μm) in the above Tris buffer (total volume 25 μl), incubated 10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. An aliquot of supernatant was subjected to PAGE with a 4–12% gradient gel (Invitrogen), together with a peptide mixture without centrifugation as a reference (total). Peptide bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and analyzed using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). The relative amount of peptides bound to liposomes was calculated by subtracting the amount of peptides remaining in the supernatant from the initial input as follows in Equation 6, where Pt is the amount of total peptide without lipids, while Ps is the amount of peptide in the supernatant after centrifugation. In this study, the following N-terminally biotinylated peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic regions of NHE1 were synthesized with >85% purity by GL Biochem Ltd.: GP57, GHHHWKDKLNRFNKKYVKKCLIAGERSKEPQLIAFYHKMEMKQAIELVESGGMGKIP; GP57-LI1, GHHHWKDKLNRFNKKYVKKCAAAGERSKEPQLIAFYHKMEMKQAIELVESGGMGKIP; GP57-LI2, GHHHWKDKLNRFNKKYVKKCLIAGERSKEPQAAAFYHKMEMKQAIELVESGGMGKIP; GC20, GHHHWKDKLNRFNKKYVKKC; and IL54, IRKILRNNLQKTRQRLRSYNRHTLVADPYEEAWNQMLLRRQKARQLEQKINNYL. SAPD was purchased from Calbiochem, PMA and 4α-PMA from Sigma, OAG and other membrane lipids from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and 22NaCl and [14C]benzoic acid from PerkinElmer Life Science Inc. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. We first determined whether PEs modulate the interaction of LID with the plasma membrane. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled LID expressed in fibroblasts (exchanger-deficient PS120 cells) targeted the plasma membrane and was located within cells (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) greatly facilitated the translocation of LID to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B and supplemental movie S1), which is also a characteristic of the PKC regulatory domain C1, where direct PE binding facilitates anionic membrane interactions (31Rosse C. Linch M. Kermorgant S. Cameron A.J. Boeckeler K. Parker P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We also observed that GFP-LID and mCherry-PKCδ-C1a translocated to the plasma membrane in response to PMA over a similar time course within the same cells (Fig. 1, B and C) and finally colocalized in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D). Such translocation did not occur in the case of the GFP-labeled 27 N-terminal residues (amino acids 542–568) of LID (Fig. 1E and supplemental movie S2), indicating that the C-terminal region is required for this phenomenon. Furthermore, LID accumulated in the plasma membrane in response to a membrane-permeable DAG analogue, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) (Fig. 1F and supplemental movie S3), thrombin (supplemental Fig. S1), and α1-adrenergic receptor (α1AR) agonist phenylephrine only when its receptor was expressed (Fig. 1G and supplemental movie S4). These results strongly suggest that PEs and the endogenous second-messenger DAG directly bind LID, thereby increasing the latter's affinity to plasma membranes. To study the LID-PE interaction in vitro, we determined whether fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs between the two. We synthesized a 57-residue peptide (GP57, Gly-542—Pro-598) spanning LID and examined whether FRET occurs between the tryptophan residue (Trp-546) of GP57 and the fluorescent PMA analogue, sapintoxin D (SAPD), as described previously (32Slater S.J. Taddeo F.J. Mazurek A. Stagliano B.A. Milano S.K. Kelly M.B. Ho C. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23160-23168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inclusion of GP57 markedly increased the fluorescence intensity of SAPD with a slight blue-shift at the maximal emission wavelength of SAPD (440 nm), indicating clear FRET from tryptophan to the 2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl fluorophore of SAPD (Fig. 2A). FRET was not observed in the 20 N-terminal residues (GC20, Gly-542—Cys-561) of LID or in a control peptide (IL54, Ile-631—Leu-684 of NHE1) (Fig. 2B), and was greatly reduced by competition with 100 μm non-fluorescent PMA (Fig. 2C), suggesting that LID, particularly its 37 C-terminal residues, directly interacts with PEs. The affinity of GP57 for SAPD increased in the presence of liposomes (Kd, from 16.5 to 8.1 μm) (Fig. 2D and Table 1), suggesting that PEs may bind LID with higher affinity in membranes. Competition experiments revealed that OAG and even the inactive PE analogue 4α-PMA interact with LID, though with lower affinity (Fig. 2E and Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of FRET data obtained with GP57Added chemicalsKd,app for SAPDCalculated Kd,C for added competitorsHill coefficientμmμmNone16.5 ± 3.11.36 ± 0.25PMA (10 μm)24.0 ± 3.822.31.90 ± 0.42OAG (100 μm)26.0 ± 6.4174.72.30 ± 0.814α-PMA (100 μm)24.3 ± 5.1213.41.83 ± 0.49Liposomes8.07 ± 1.11.16 ± 0.16 Open table in a new tab Besides these lipophilic compounds, we also examined the interaction of LID with membrane lipids by testing for direct binding. GP57 was incubated with liposomes consisting of various membrane lipids and then centrifuged; the unbound supernatant was analyzed using gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. We found that LID interacts with multiple membrane lipids, particularly, acidic phospholipids such as PIP2, phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidic acid (PA) (Fig. 3, A and B). GP57 exhibited the following order of binding strength: PIP2 > PS, phosphatidylinositol (PI), PA > phosphatidylglycerol (PG) > phosphatidylcholine (PC) (supplemental Fig. S2). To study the role of LID in the regulation of NHE1 activity, we generated alanine-scanning mutations. Six mutations of conserved residues (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S3) abrogated PE-promoted translocation of LID to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1H and supplemental Fig. S3 and movie S5), suggesting that the whole region of LID is important for membrane interaction. Mutations (particularly LI2, in which Leu-573 and Ile-574 were replaced with two alanine residues) also markedly inhibited the interaction of LID with PEs and phospholipids (Figs. 2F and 3C). Rapid and persistent cytoplasmic alkalinization, a consequence of increased cytosolic H+ affinity, has been used as a reliable indicator of NHE1 activation (3Moolenaar W.H. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1984; 312: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28L'Allemain G. Paris S. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5809-5815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PMA, OAG, and SAPD induced such alkalinization in cells expressing wild-type full-length NHE1 (Fig. 4, A–C). PE-induced alkalinization occurred at relatively low concentrations (>0.03 μm SAPD) (Fig. 4C). Phenylephrine also induced alkalinization only in cells co-expressing α1ARs (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, such alkalinization was dramatically inhibited by LI1, LI2 (Fig. 4, A–C), and other mutations (supplemental Fig. S3) incorporated into the entire NHE1 molecule, suggesting that the PE/DAG-promoted interaction of LID with the plasma membrane may be essential for NHE1 activation. Moreover, these mutations decreased cytosolic H+ affinity for NHE1 as shown by the acidic shift of pHi dependence (Fig. 4D and Table 2) as well as the maximal activity at acidic pHi (supplemental Fig. S4), thus reducing the basal exchange activity particularly in neutral pHi range. These observations suggest that LID-membrane interaction is also required for optimal NHE1 function in the resting state. PIP2 would be the most important lipid for this function (20Aharonovitz O. Zaun H.C. Balla T. York J.D. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Fuster D. Moe O.W. Hilgemann D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10482-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, under rapid PIP2 breakdown after receptor stimulation, most LID probes remain in the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S5 and movie S6), and exchange activity is uninhibited (no decrease in pHi) even when PIP2 re-synthesis is blocked by wortmannin (Fig. 4, A and B, supplemental Fig. S6 and movie S7), suggesting that basal activity is preserved even under conditions of reduced PIP2, possibly because of interactions between LID and predominant acidic lipids within membranes. Thus, the broad lipid specificity of LID may facilitate rapid NHE1 activation after receptor stimulation.TABLE 2Summary for 22Na+ uptake activity (Fig. 4D) measured in cells expressing the NHE1 variantsMutantVmaxExpression-normalized VmaxpK for pHiHill coefficientnmol/mg/min%WT30.0 ± 1.0100 ± 3.46.69 ± 0.031.41 ± 0.12LI112.0 ± 0.588.2 ± 3.86.49 ± 0.031.38 ± 0.10LI210.9 ± 0.436.9 ± 1.46.30 ± 0.061.33 ± 0.17 Open table in a new tab We next examined the possible involvement of PKC in NHE1 regulation by us"

However, the relationship between seeing and information processing is seldom considered. In this study, we aimed to reveal this relationship using simultaneous eye-tracking measurements and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in face identification tasks.22 healthy adult subjects (8 males and 14 females) were shown facial morphing movies in which an initial facial image gradually changed into another facial image (that is, the subject's own face was changed to a familiar face). The fixation patterns on facial features were recorded, along with changes in oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) levels in the frontal lobe, while the subjects identified several faces. In the self-face condition (self-face as the initial image), hemodynamic activity around the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was significantly greater than in the familiar-face condition. On the other hand, the scanning strategy was similar in almost all conditions with more fixations on the eyes and nose than on other areas. Fixation time on the eye area did not correlate with changes in oxyHb levels, and none of the scanning strategy indices could estimate the hemodynamic changes.We conclude that hemodynamic activity, i.e., the means of processing facial information, is not always modulated by the face-scanning strategy, i.e., the way of seeing, and that the right IFG plays important roles in both self-other facial discrimination and self-evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W1999776105,"Cysteine string protein (CSPalpha) is a synaptic vesicle protein that displays unique anti-neurodegenerative properties. CSPalpha is a member of the conserved J protein family, also called the Hsp40 (heat shock protein of 40 kDa) protein family, whose importance in protein folding has been recognized for many years. Deletion of the CSPalpha in mice results in knockout mice that are normal for the first 2-3 weeks of life followed by an unexplained presynaptic neurodegeneration and premature death. How CSPalpha prevents neurodegeneration is currently not known. As a neuroprotective synaptic vesicle protein, CSPalpha represents a promising therapeutic target for the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders.Here, we demonstrate that the flavonoid quercetin promotes formation of stable CSPalpha-CSPalpha dimers and that quercetin-induced dimerization is dependent on the unique cysteine string region. Furthermore, in primary cultures of Lymnaea neurons, quercetin induction of CSPalpha dimers correlates with an inhibition of synapse formation and synaptic transmission suggesting that quercetin interfers with CSPalpha function. Quercetin's action on CSPalpha is concentration dependent and does not promote dimerization of other synaptic proteins or other J protein family members and reduces the assembly of CSPalpha:Hsc70 units (70kDa heat shock cognate protein).Quercetin is a plant derived flavonoid and popular nutritional supplement proposed to prevent memory loss and altitude sickness among other ailments, although its precise mechanism(s) of action has been unclear. In view of the therapeutic promise of upregulation of CSPalpha and the undesired consequences of CSPalpha dysfunction, our data establish an essential proof of principle that pharmaceutical agents can selectively target the neuroprotective J protein CSPalpha."

Cell. 2004; 13: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The transcription of these genes is initiated by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), but is inhibited shortly thereafter by Pol II pausing (1Zhou Q. Yik J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

This pause is alleviated by P-TEFb, which increases Pol II processivity by hyperphosphorylating the Ser-2 sites of its C-terminal domain, thus promoting the transition from abortive to productive mRNA elongation (1Zhou Q.

Importantly, HIV-1 transcription can be prevented by inhibiting P-TEFb phosphorylation of Pol II, such as by siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK9 or by treating infected cells with the potent CDK9 inhibitor, flavopiridol (5Chiu Y.L.

Brd4 recruits P-TEFb to promoters by binding both acetylated histone proteins and components of the Mediator complex (7Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. J. Biol.

P-TEFb not only interacts with Brd4 at cellular promoters, but also binds specific transcription factors such as NFκB during cellular and HIV transcription (10Amini S. Clavo A. Nadraga Y. Giordano A.

Thus, P-TEFb may function in coupling chromatin modification to transcription.Histone H1 is a highly abundant linker histone protein that binds to nucleosomes and the DNA that connects them (12Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Fan Y. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). H1 facilitates the compaction of chromatin, thus maintaining chromatin patterns during differentiation and development (13Bustin M. Catez F. Lim J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 617-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R. Bouhassira E.E. Stein A. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Cell. 2005; 123: 1199-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in chromatin compaction, H1 exists in equilibrium between chromatin-bound and -free states (13Bustin M. Catez F. Lim J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 617-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Catez F. Ueda T. Bustin M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with the equilibrium shifting to free H1 when it is phosphorylated (15Catez F. Ueda T. Bustin M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). H1 is phosphorylated by CDK2 during the G1/S phase transition to promote its dissociation from DNA during DNA replication fork progression (16Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Besides this general phosphorylation event, histone H1 phosphorylation may be an important step in the transcription of specific genes. For example, H1 is phosphorylated at the MMTV promoter when transcription is activated and then dephosphorylated when transcription is inhibited (17Bhattacharjee R.N. Archer T.K. Virology. 2006; 346: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, H1 phosphorylation has not been examined during cellular transcription.To investigate the role of P-TEFb in coupling chromatin remodeling to transcription, we examined the relationship between P-TEFb and histone H1. We found that P-TEFb phosphorylated the C-terminal domain of histone H1 at S/TPXK consensus sequences important in regulating chromatin binding (19Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20028-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). P-TEFb activity in cell-based assays correlated with H1 phosphorylation as well as H1 dissociation from DNA in the ChIP assay. Additionally expression of a mutant histone H1.1 that is not phosphorylated by P-TEFb also inhibits Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR in a reporter cell line. Because P-TEFb phosphorylation of H1 is necessary for both H1 mobility and HIV-1 transcription, we propose a new role for P-TEFb in transcription as a histone H1 kinase.DISCUSSIONOur results show that the activity of P-TEFb correlates with in vivo phosphorylation of histone H1 and its dissociation from DNA. P-TEFb mediated H1 phosphorylation in a Tat-specific manner in both HeLa cells transfected with Tat and in HIV-1 infected H9 cells. Furthermore, P-TEFb phosphorylated the H1.1 isoform at a specific C-terminal phosphorylation site to enhance histone mobility and transcription from the HIV-1 LTR and the c-fos and hsp70 genes. As determined by ChIP, active transcription from the HIV-1 LTR in MAGI cells and the c-fos and hsp70 genes in HeLa cells resulted in a release of H1 from their respective transcriptional start sites and downstream coding regions. Taken together, our results imply histone H1 is a novel substrate for P-TEFb, suggesting a new role for this elongation factor in RNA Pol II transcription.In this study, we have identified histone H1 as a potential substrate of P-TEFb both in vitro and in cell culture. Inhibiting P-TEFb activity by specific knockdown with siRNA, chemical inhibition by flavopiridol, or overexpression of dominant-negative CDK9 all decreased H1 phosphorylation. Conversely, releasing P-TEFb from its inactive complex with 7SK and HEXIM1/2, e.g. by UV irradiation or Tat expression, increased levels of phosphorylated H1. These experiments were performed in serum-starved cells to slow their growth, ensuring that CDK9 was active while CDK2 was inactive (29Garriga J. Bhattacharya S. Calbó J. Marshall R.M. Truongcao M. Haines D.S. Graña X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5165-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In sum, these data imply that P-TEFb phosphorylates H1 in the cell.In addition to the dependence of histone H1 phosphorylation on P-TEFb activity, our data also indicate that H1 is phosphorylated in a Tat-dependent manner during HIV-1 infection. Because Tat is necessary to increase H1 phosphorylation during HIV-1 infection, this phosphorylation may be important in activating HIV-1 transcription. Moreover, H1 phosphorylation did not increase in cells infected with a Tat-mutant viral strain, ruling out the possibility that H1 was phosphorylated simply as part of a cellular stress response induced by the virus during integration. Since this mutant virus transcribes host DNA independently of Tat and P-TEFb, H1 phosphorylation during HIV-1 infection may be specific to Tat- and P-TEFb-mediated transcription. Because Tat activates the transcription of cellular genes in addition to viral genes (39de la Fuente C. Santiago F. Deng L. Eadie C. Zilberman I. Kehn K. Maddukuri A. Baylor S. Wu K. Lee C.G. Pumfery A. Kashanchi F. BMC Biochemistry. 2002; 3: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Izmailova E. Bertley F.M. Huang Q. Makori N. Miller C.J. Young R.A. Aldovini A. Nat.

Virol. 2010; 91: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), Tat and P-TEFb may also have synergistic effects on H1 phosphorylation at both cellular and HIV genes.It is important to note that while we characterize H1 phosphorylation as a function of P-TEFb activity, there is a possibility that this effect is indirect. However, the methods used here specifically inhibit or activate P-TEFb independently of other kinases.Having shown that P-TEFb phosphorylates histone H1 in vitro, we asked whether a specific site on histone H1 was phosphorylated. Although P-TEFb could phosphorylate multiple H1 isoforms, we used the H1.1 isoform because its two phosphorylation sites can be studied independently. Using histone H1.1 phosphorylation site mutants, we found that P-TEFb preferentially phosphorylates WT and T152A H1.1 in vitro. Additionally, S183A H1.1 expression in MAGI cells prevented full transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR, while WT, T152A, and the phosphorylation mimic S183E did not affect β-galactosidase expression. Importantly, the S183E mutant was sensitive to C22G Tat expression because the P-TEFb complex is not recruited to the LTR to phosphorylate Pol II. HeLa cells expressing GFP-S183A H1.1 also expressed lower levels of c-Fos and Hsp70 mRNA and were insensitive to flavopiridol treatment. The S183E phosphorylation mimic, however, did not reduce c-Fos and Hsp70 transcription and was sensitive to flavopiridol treatment because the prior step of Pol II phosphorylation is inhibited.Taken together, we surmise that P-TEFb preferentially phosphorylates Ser-183 in vivo. This specificity of P-TEFb for Ser-183 contrasts with previous results, suggesting that in actively dividing cells Thr-152 is preferentially phosphorylated by other CDKs (19Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20028-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We also found that CDK2 preferentially phosphorylates WT and S183A H1.1 in vitro. Each H1.1 site could therefore be phosphorylated under different cellular conditions and during different processes, i.e. cellular replication or transcription. Whereas H1 is phosphorylated by CDK2 on a global scale at all genes (16Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we observed changes in H1 enrichment at P-TEFb-specific genes but not β-actin or 18 S, which are constitutively expressed.Our results also show the potential function of P-TEFb phosphorylation of H1, namely, to increase H1 dissociation from actively transcribed DNA. The movement of histone H1 is inversely proportional to the stability of H1-chromatin binding (21Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 22Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Likewise, GFP-H1.1 recovered more slowly in serum-starved cells treated with flavopiridol than in DMSO-treated control cells (supplemental Fig. 5A). Because decreased mobility of H1 has been correlated with its increased binding to DNA (21Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 22Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), P-TEFb inhibition likely stabilized H1 binding to chromatin. To test this hypothesis, we performed histone H1 ChIP assays. In WT Tat-transfected MAGI cells, we observed a loss of H1 at both the LTR transcription start site and a downstream coding region of the β-galactosidase gene compared with C22G Tat-transfected cells. Likewise, when flavopiridol was used to inhibit P-TEFb in HeLa cells, more H1 was bound to the transcription start site and downstream coding region of the c-Fos gene than when cells were treated with DMSO alone. The loss of H1 at these sites of active P-TEFb-mediated transcription supports the mechanism suggested by the H1 FRAP data, namely, that P-TEFb phosphorylation of H1 leads to its dissociation from DNA.Upon seeing the effect of WT Tat and P-TEFb together on H1 phosphorylation, and knowing the effect of P-TEFb activity on H1 mobility and DNA binding, we wanted to ascertain the importance of H1 phosphorylation for P-TEFb-mediated transcription. We found that S183A H1.1 expression suppresses WT Tat transactivation, c-Fos and Hsp70 transcription compared with cells expressing WT, T152A, or the phosphorylation mimic S183E H1.1. From these data, we can deduce that P-TEFb phosphorylation of histone H1 might be a necessary step in the transcription of HIV genes as well as cellular genes that need active P-TEFb to be expressed.The control of gene expression via H1 phosphorylation has been noted, and regulation of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter is the most well-studied example (18Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here we show the effect of P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation of H1 on gene expression.Additionally, P-TEFb is known to interact with proteins that bind and modify chromatin, and we report a specific and functionally relevant interaction between P-TEFb and histone H1. P-TEFb is recruited to cellular promoters by the bromodomain-containing protein Brd4 (8Jang M.K. Mochizuki K. Zhou M. Jeong H.S. Brady J.N. Ozato K. Mol.

This recruitment results in H3K36 methylation, marking chromatin at sites of Pol II elongation. Taking our data into account, H1 phosphorylation could potentially aid in chromatin remodeling by allowing chromatin modifying machinery to access nucleosomes. This increased accessibility would allow Pol II to transcribe through chromatin more efficiently.Based on our results, we propose a model in which P-TEFb phosphorylates histone H1 during Pol II transcription. When activated from the 7SK/HEXIM complex, P-TEFb would be recruited to phosphorylate Pol II complexes thereby promoting elongation. P-TEFb would also phosphorylate H1 concomitantly with Pol II transcription, increasing the processivity of the polymerase.In summary, here we identify histone H1 as a substrate of P-TEFb and suggest a novel role for P-TEFb during elongation. Because P-TEFb phosphorylation of H1 could destabilize the interaction of H1 with chromatin, transcribed genes may be more readily remodeled. Our results describe a new mechanism of P-TEFb function in regulating the expression of both cellular and HIV-1 genes.

Yik J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 646-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,2Peterlin B.M. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 297-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Importantly, HIV-1 transcription can be prevented by inhibiting P-TEFb phosphorylation of Pol II, such as by siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK9 or by treating infected cells with the potent CDK9 inhibitor, flavopiridol (5Chiu Y.L.

Brd4 recruits P-TEFb to promoters by binding both acetylated histone proteins and components of the Mediator complex (7Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13141-13145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 8Jang M.K. Mochizuki K. Zhou M. Jeong H.S. Brady J.N. Ozato K. Mol.

P-TEFb not only interacts with Brd4 at cellular promoters, but also binds specific transcription factors such as NFκB during cellular and HIV transcription (10Amini S. Clavo A. Nadraga Y. Giordano A. Khalili K. Sawaya B.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5797-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Barboric M. Nissen R.M. Kanazawa S. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol.

Thus, P-TEFb may function in coupling chromatin modification to transcription.Histone H1 is a highly abundant linker histone protein that binds to nucleosomes and the DNA that connects them (12Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Fan Y. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). H1 facilitates the compaction of chromatin, thus maintaining chromatin patterns during differentiation and development (13Bustin M. Catez F. Lim J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 617-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R. Bouhassira E.E. Stein A. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Cell. 2005; 123: 1199-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in chromatin compaction, H1 exists in equilibrium between chromatin-bound and -free states (13Bustin M. Catez F. Lim J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 617-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Catez F. Ueda T. Bustin M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with the equilibrium shifting to free H1 when it is phosphorylated (15Catez F. Ueda T. Bustin M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). H1 is phosphorylated by CDK2 during the G1/S phase transition to promote its dissociation from DNA during DNA replication fork progression (16Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Besides this general phosphorylation event, histone H1 phosphorylation may be an important step in the transcription of specific genes. For example, H1 is phosphorylated at the MMTV promoter when transcription is activated and then dephosphorylated when transcription is inhibited (17Bhattacharjee R.N. Archer T.K. Virology. 2006; 346: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, H1 phosphorylation has not been examined during cellular transcription.To investigate the role of P-TEFb in coupling chromatin remodeling to transcription, we examined the relationship between P-TEFb and histone H1. We found that P-TEFb phosphorylated the C-terminal domain of histone H1 at S/TPXK consensus sequences important in regulating chromatin binding (19Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20028-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). P-TEFb activity in cell-based assays correlated with H1 phosphorylation as well as H1 dissociation from DNA in the ChIP assay. Additionally expression of a mutant histone H1.1 that is not phosphorylated by P-TEFb also inhibits Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR in a reporter cell line. Because P-TEFb phosphorylation of H1 is necessary for both H1 mobility and HIV-1 transcription, we propose a new role for P-TEFb in transcription as a histone H1 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1997205438,"Background The basal forebrain is a series of nuclei that provides cholinergic input to much of the forebrain. The most posterior of these nuclei, nucleus basalis, provides cholinergic drive to neocortex and is involved in arousal and attention. The physiological properties of neurons in anterior basal forebrain nuclei, including medial septum, the diagonal band of Broca and substantia innominata, have been described previously. In contrast the physiological properties of neurons in nucleus basalis, the most posterior nucleus of the basal forebrain, are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we investigate the physiological properties of neurons in adult mouse nucleus basalis. We obtained cell-attached and whole-cell recordings from magnocellular neurons in slices from P42-54 mice and compared cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons, distinguished retrospectively by anti-choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry. The majority (70–80%) of cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons were silent at rest. Spontaneously active cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons exhibited irregular spiking at 3 Hz and at 0.3 to 13.4 Hz, respectively. Cholinergic neurons had smaller, broader action potentials than non-cholinergic neurons (amplitudes 64±3.4 and 75±2 mV; half widths 0.52±0.04 and 0.33±0.02 ms). Cholinergic neurons displayed a more pronounced slow after-hyperpolarization than non-cholinergic neurons (13.3±2.2 and 3.6±0.5 mV) and were unable to spike at high frequencies during tonic current injection (maximum frequencies of ∼20 Hz and >120 Hz). Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that neurons in nucleus basalis share similar physiological properties with neurons in anterior regions of the basal forebrain. Furthermore, cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons in nucleus basalis can be distinguished by their responses to injected current. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the physiological properties of cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons in the posterior aspects of the basal forebrain complex and the first study of basal forebrain neurons from the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2010223780,"Phytochromes enable plants to sense light information and regulate developmental responses. Phytochromes interact with partner proteins to transmit light signals to downstream components for plant development. PIRF1 (phytochrome-interacting ROP guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RopGEF 1)) functions as a light-signaling switch regulating root development through the activation of ROPs (Rho-like GTPase of plant) in the cytoplasm. In vitro pulldown and yeast two-hybrid assays confirmed the interaction between PIRF1 and phytochromes. PIRF1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of phytochromes through its conserved PRONE (plant-specific ROP nucleotide exchanger) region. PIRF1 also interacted with ROPs and activated them in a phytochrome-dependent manner. The Pr form of phytochrome A enhanced the RopGEF activity of PIRF1, whereas the Pfr form inhibited it. A bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis demonstrated that PIRF1 was localized in the cytoplasm and bound to the phytochromes in darkness but not in light. PIRF1 loss of function mutants (pirf1) of Arabidopsis thaliana showed a longer root phenotype in the dark. In addition, both PIRF1 overexpression mutants (PIRF1-OX) and phytochrome-null mutants (phyA-211 and phyB-9) showed retarded root elongation and irregular root hair formation, suggesting that PIRF1 is a negative regulator of phytochrome-mediated primary root development. We propose that phytochrome and ROP signaling are interconnected through PIRF1 in regulating the root growth and development in Arabidopsis.

We propose that phytochrome and ROP signaling are interconnected through PIRF1 in regulating the root growth and development in Arabidopsis. Light is the one of various environmental factors affecting plant root growth and development (1De Simone S. Oka Y. Inoue Y. J. Plant Res. 2000; 113: 63-69Crossref Google Scholar). Light-sensing photoreceptors such as phytochromes and cryptochromes regulate root growth and development, including lateral root growth (2Kiss J.Z. Miller K.M. Ogden L.A. Roth K.K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), gravitropism (3Kiss J.Z. Mullen J.L. Correll M.J. Hangarter R.P.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The root hair formation is particularly sensitive to light signals perceived by phytochromes (1De Simone S. Oka Y. Inoue Y. J. Plant Res. 2000; 113: 63-69Crossref Google Scholar). In phytochrome-mediated root developmental events such as lateral root growth and gravitropism, positive photomorphogenic factor HY5 plays a crucial regulatory role in Arabidopsis (5Cluis C.P.

Phytochromes synthesized as inactive Pr forms in the dark change conformations into active far-red light-absorbing Pfr forms by red light. This photochromism of phytochromes enables plants to modulate red/far-red light signals to regulate developmental responses (7Neff M.M. Fankhauser C. Chory J.

To discover the role of the phytochrome in roots, we studied the possible involvement of the phytochrome-interacting protein. In this regard, RopGEF (Rho of plants guanine nucleotide exchange factor) identified previously as a phytochrome-interacting protein (18Phee B.K. Shin D.H. Cho J.H. Kim S.H. Kim J.I. Lee Y.H.

ROPs play a signaling role in diverse developmental processes and regulate primary root elongation, lateral root formation, and root hair polarity in response to various environmental factors (19Li H.

A previous study suggested the possible involvement of ROPs in the phytochrome signaling pathway, as the production of GTP by an NDPK2 enzyme was specifically activated by the Pfr form of phytochrome A (29Shen Y. Kim J.I. Song P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5740-5749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we suggest that RopGEF11 (PIRF1; phytochrome interacting RopGEF 1) activated an ROP in a phytochrome-dependent manner for root development in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, we found that cytoplasmic PIRF1 interacted with the N-terminal region of phytochromes A and B localized in the cytoplasm. Based on studies with PIRF1 knock-out and overexpression mutant plants, we explore the functional role of the cytoplasmic phytochromes and PIRF1 in regulating root development through activation of an ROP. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant (pirf1, Salk_126725) of PIRF1 and the phytochrome-null mutants (phyA-211 and phyB-9) were obtained from the Salk Institute and Arabidopsis Stock Center, respectively. A homozygote of pirf1 was selected by genomic PCR, and the inhibition of PIRF1 gene expression in pirf1 was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) 3The abbreviations used are: RT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRYFPyellow fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseGUSβ-glucuronidase. analysis using the gene-specific primers (see supplemental Table S1). The PIRF1 overexpression mutant (PIRF1-OX) was generated by transformation of the 35S-myc-PIRF1 construct into wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0). The overexpression of myc-PIRF1 in PIRF1-OX was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis with monoclonal anti-myc antibodies (Millipore, Billerica, MA) (data not shown). For seedling growth and light response experiments, Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized and sown on plates containing one-half Murashige & Skoog medium, pH 5.7 and 0.8% Phyto agar (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands). The plates were positioned vertically to allow root growth along the gel surface. Images of plant samples were captured using a Nikon D-70s digital camera, and the primary root lengths were measured using Image-Tool software (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). reverse transcription-PCR yellow fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase β-glucuronidase. Seedlings were irradiated with either continuous far-red (FRc; 730 nm, 23 μmol m−2 s−1) or red (Rc; 660 nm, 12 μmol m−2 s−1) light. Monochromatic red or far-red light was generated by light-emitting diodes (GFLE-102R, GoodFeeling, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea). Light intensities were measured using a Quantum-Photo Radiometer HD9021 (Delta OHM SRL, Selvazzano, Italy). For yeast two-hybrid analyses of PIRF1 and phytochromes, PIRF1 protein was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The N terminus (phyA-N or phyB-N) and C terminus (phyA-C or phyB-C) of phytochromes A (phyA) and B (phyB) were subcloned into the pGADT7 vector to express truncated proteins fused with the GAL4-activation domain. Yeast two hybrid assays were then performed according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions (Matchmaker Two-hybrid System, Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The myc-tagged PIRF1-OX plants were grown in darkness for 4 days at 22 °C after germination. The seedlings were then harvested and homogenized with an extraction buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 35% ethylene glycol, 98 mm (NH4)2SO4, 7 mm EDTA, 14 mm sodium metabisulfite) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Monoclonal anti-myc antibodies (Millipore) were incubated with the crude protein extracts at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with protein G-agarose (Millipore) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were then washed six times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). Anti-myc (4A6, Millipore), anti-phyA (mAA for Arabidopsis phyA (30Shinomura T.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody, and the signals were detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL reaction (GE Healthcare). For histochemical β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays for PIRF1, ∼0.9 kb of the promoter region of the PIRF1 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pBI101 binary vector (Clontech). The resulting construct was then transformed into wild type Arabidopsis plants (Col-0), and transformants were selected on one-half mass spectrometry media containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Histochemical staining and microscopic analyses were performed as described previously (31Somers D.E. Quail P.H. Plant J. 1995; 7: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The GDP/GTP exchange activity of PIRF1 with ROP proteins was measured by the nitrocellulose filter binding method at room temperature essentially as described previously by Zheng et al. (32Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the measurement of GDP binding, purified recombinant maltose binding protein tagging ROPs (MBP-ROPs) were rendered nucleotide-free by incubation for 5 min in a loading buffer containing 2 mm EDTA and 3 mm [3H]GDP, followed by the addition of 5 mm MgCl2 and a further incubation for 20 min. Purified GST-PIRF1 was equilibrated for 15 min in an exchange buffer containing 1 mm GTP and then added to the ROP-containing solution. The reaction was then continued for the indicated periods. For the binding of [35S]GTP (guanosine 5′-[γ-thio]-triphosphate), 3 μm unlabeled GDP instead of [3H]GDP was used in the loading buffer and 5 μm [35S]GTP instead of unlabeled GTP in the exchange assay buffer. Bound and free nucleotides were separated by filtration with nitrocellulose. To confirm the subcellular co-localization and interaction between PIRF1 and phytochromes, we adopted a BiFC analysis using Arabidopsis protoplast cells. The cDNAs of phytochrome A and B were individually subcloned into BiFC vector (33Bracha-Drori K. Shichrur K. Katz A. Oliva M. Angelovici R. Yalovsky S. Ohad N. Plant J. 2004; 40: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) containing the N-terminal region of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and designated NE-PHYA and NE-PHYB, respectively. The cDNA of PIRF1 was also cloned into the BiFC vector containing the C-terminal region of YFP to yield CE-PIRF1. Protoplast preparations and transient transformations were performed according to the methods described by Yoo et al. (34Yoo S.D. Cho Y.H. Sheen J. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). Protoplasts were isolated by incubating 3-week-old Arabidopsis leaves in enzyme solution containing cellulase and macerozyme, and the transformation of protoplasts was achieved by incubating plasmid DNA and protoplast in polyethylene glycol-calcium solution (40% PEG 4000, 0.2 m mannitol, 100 mm CaCl2). Protoplasts co-transformed with CE-PIRF1 and NE-PHYA and NE-PHYB were incubated in darkness for 14 h, and the fluorescence emissions were measured. To examine the effects of light quality on the co-localization of PIRF1 and phytochromes, the transformed protoplasts were incubated in darkness for 14 h and kept in darkness or exposed subsequently to red or far-red light for 5 min and kept a further 30 min in darkness. Confocal imaging was then carried out using a LSM 510 META laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Image analysis was carried out with LSC Image 5 Examination software (Carl Zeiss). In our previous study, we used the co-immunoprecipitation matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/mass spectrometry method to screen holophytochrome-interacting proteins and identified a 66-kDa protein in Arabidopsis (18Phee B.K.

Genomic analysis further revealed the presence of an ortholog of this protein on chromosome 1. Based on genomic and database analyses, the 66-kDa protein and its ortholog were identified as the RopGEF family proteins, RopGEF11 (PIRF1) and RopGEF13 (PIRF2), respectively. The characteristic conserved PRONE domain of RopGEF family members (27Gu Y. Li S. Lord E.M. Yang Z. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 366-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Shin D.H. Kim T.L.

Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2446-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was found in these two proteins (see supplemental Fig. S1A). PIRF1 consisted of a 1620-bp open reading frame encoding 539 amino acids for a 58.6-kDa protein. A sequence alignment of PIRF1 and -2 shows 66.3% overall homology, which rises up to 80.9% within the conserved PRONE domain regions. PIRF1 and PIRF2 are phylogenetically distinguishable from other RopGEF members (see supplemental Fig. S1B). To confirm the interaction between PIRF1 and phytochromes, we generated a recombinant GST-PIRF1 protein and performed in vitro pulldown assays with several recombinant oat phyAs. Full-length oat phytochrome A interacted with GST-PIRF1. In addition the N-terminal region (AN) of phyA was sufficient for the interaction with PIRF1 (see supplemental Fig. S2). The specific interactions between phytochromes and PIRF1 were further confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays, showing that both phytochromes A and B interacted with PIRF1 through their N-terminal but not through C-terminal domains (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S3). To further establish the interaction between PIRF1 and phytochromes in vivo, we generated myc-tagged PIRF1-overexpressing transgenic plants (PIRF1-OX). The myc-PIRF1 proteins were immunoprecipitated by myc antibodies from the crude protein extracts of PIRF1-OX seedlings. Western blotting analysis revealed that PIRF1 interacted with phyA and phyB in PIRF1-OX seedlings (Fig. 1, B and C). RopGEF family proteins contain a conserved central PRONE domain with the variable N- and C-terminal regions. Their GEF activity toward ROPs reside in the PRONE domain (27Gu Y. Li S. Lord E.M. Yang Z. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 366-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The variable regions of RopGEFs, however, are responsible for the regulation of PRONE function of RopGEF proteins (36Zhang Y. McCormick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18830-18835Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To better understand the structural requirement for the PIRF1 and phytochrome interactions, we generated various truncated GST-PIRF1 proteins and performed in vitro pulldown assays (Fig. 2). Phytochrome A bound with full length and PRONE domain-containing (NP and PD) recombinant PIRF1 proteins. However, neither the N terminus (NE) nor C terminus (CE) alone interacted with phytochrome A. These results indicate that the N-terminal domain of the phytochrome A and the PRONE domain of PIRF1 provide docking sites for PIRF1-phytochrome interactions. In plants, ROPs are involved in diverse developmental processes through their activation by RopGEFs (22Nibau C. Wu H.M. Cheung A.Y. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 309-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Gu Y. Wang Z Yang Z. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We examined the interaction and activation of PIRF1 over ROPs using in vitro pulldown assay and GDP/GTP exchange assay to verify the activity of PIRF1 as a functional RopGEF. Three typical ROPs (ROP2, ROP6, and ROP8) were selected from 11 ROPs for in vitro pulldown assay. Results revealed that PIRF1 directly interacted with three ROPs (Fig. 3A). We then tested the GEF activity of PIRF1 with one of the ROPs tested. The dissociation of [3H]GDP from MBP-ROP8 was accelerated with the addition of increasing concentrations of PIRF1 (Fig. 3B). The rates of both [3H]GDP dissociation and [35S]GTP binding to MBP-ROP8 were markedly enhanced by PIRF1 (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S4). These results suggest that PIRF1 plays a functional role as a RopGEF protein in plants. ROP signaling is modulated by an interacting RopGEF proteins through regulation of their GEF activities. In tomato, pollen-specific receptor kinases LePRK1 and -2 interact with a tomato RopGEF homolog, LeKPP, and regulate its GEF activity (36Zhang Y. McCormick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18830-18835Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Kaothien P. Ok S.H. Shuai B. Wengier D. Cotter R. Kelley D. Kiriakopolos S. Muschietti J. McCormick S. Plant J. 2005; 42: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because PIRF1 interacts with phytochromes and ROPs, we tested whether phytochromes have any effect on PIRF1 activity. Surprisingly, PIRF1 activity was enhanced highly by the Pr form of phytochrome A, whereas the Pfr form decreased the activity (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the Pr form of phytochromes modulates ROP signaling by controlling the GEF activity of PIRF1 in Arabidopsis. Another surprising finding in our study was that the interaction between PIRF1 and phytochromes occurred in the cytoplasm. The subcellular translocation of signaling molecules including photoreceptors plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and protein degradation in plant photomorphogenesis (38Wang H. Deng X.W. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, 2002Google Scholar). Light induces the translocation of phytochromes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where gene expression is directly modulated to control many developmental processes in plants (8Quail P.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 9Huq E. Quail P.H. Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, Weinheim, Germany2005: 151-170Google Scholar). Thus, many phytochrome signaling proteins such as PIF3 and PIF-like (PIL) are localized and interact with phytochromes in the nucleus (39Castillon A. Shen H. Huq E. Trends Plant Sci. 2007; 12: 514-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 40Bae G. Choi G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 281-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To explore the functional role of PIRF1, subcellular localization was analyzed using green fluorescent protein-tagged PIRF1 protein in Arabidopsis protoplast cells. PIRF1 was found to be localized in the cytoplasm of protoplast cells regardless of light exposure (see supplemental Fig. S5). To assess the possibility of the cytoplasmic interaction between PIRF1 and phytochromes at different light conditions, we used the BiFC method by co-transformation of PIRF1 (CE-PIRF1) and either phyA (NE-PHYA) or phyB (NE-PHYB). The interaction between PIRF1 and phytochromes in the transformed cells was observed in the dark (Fig. 5A) but absent in red light exposure (Fig. 5B), whereas the interaction between PIF3 and phytochromes in the nucleus was activated by the same light treatment (see supplemental Fig. S6). To confirm that PIRF1 interacts with phytochrome in cytoplasm, we monitored the changes of fluorescent cells as well as fluorescence transition from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by light illuminating the protoplast cells. Protoplasts were co-transformed with the NE-PHYA and CE-PIRF1, CE-PIF3, or CE-PHYA. As expected, the dimerized phytochromes, NE-phyA and CE-phyA, were translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with a red light pulse where the interaction was still maintained. In addition, translocated NE-phyA interacted with CE-PIF3 in the nucleus. However, NE-phyA and CE-PIRF1 interaction in the cytoplasm was markedly decreased by red light pulses (see supplemental Fig. S7). Therefore, PIRF1 is localized in the cytoplasm, where it probably binds the Pr form of phytochrome in the dark, whereas this association is abrogated by the red light induced translocation of phytochromes into the nucleus. Our results suggest that PIRF1 as a phytochrome partner protein may play a role in the cytoplasm. We showed that the GEF activity of PIRF1 was differentially regulated by Pr and Pfr forms of phytochrome, suggesting that the interaction between PIRF1 and phytochrome was Pr-specific, whereas an in vitro pulldown assay showed no significant differences in interaction between PIRF1 and Pr or Pfr form of phytochromes (see supplemental Fig. S8). However, phytochrome Pr form interacted preferentially with PIRF1 when it was complexed with ROP8 (Fig. 6). This result explains why the Pr form of phytochrome is more specific in activating the GEF activity of PIRF1 (Fig. 4). A quantitative mRNA analysis showed that PIRF1 expression was stronger in roots and flowers than in other tissues examined, whereas PIRF2 was weakly expressed only in mature flowers (Fig. 7A). These distinct expression patterns of PIRF1 and PIRF2 suggest that the former, rather than the latter, likely plays a crucial role in vegetative development of Arabidopsis. In addition, histochemical analysis of PIRF1 promoter-glucuronidase transgenic plants (PIRF1-GUS) revealed that PIRF1 was expressed strongly in actively elongating regions of roots (also in pollen) (Fig. 7B). The dominant expression patterns of PIRF1 in roots and pollen closely matched those of PHYB expression in PHYB-GUS transgenic mutants (31Somers D.E. Quail P.H. Plant J. 1995; 7: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting that PIRF1 together with phyB plays a role in the development of these tissues. Having isolated and characterized the phytochrome-interacting protein PIRF1, we searched for its function in plant photomorphogenesis. Light signaling (3Kiss J.Z. Mullen J.L. Correll M.J.

Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) plays important roles in root development, including primary root elongation and root hair formation. First, we attempted to establish the phenotypic functional relationship between PIRF1 and phytochromes by generating T-DNA insertion knock-out (pirf1) (Salk_126725) (Fig. 8A) and overexpression mutants (PIRF1-OX) of A. thaliana. We analyzed the de-etiolation responses of these mutant seedlings, including hypocotyl growth, cotyledon opening, and greening under different light conditions. We could not observe any distinct difference in phenotype in pirf1 during early seedling development, but PIRF1-OX displayed inhibited root growth. We then looked at root phenotypes in these mutant plants under different light conditions. Primary roots of seedling in wild type plants were markedly elongated under white light, but the growth was retarded in the dark (see supplemental Fig. S9). However, primary root elongation was markedly lower in PIRF1-OX seedlings under continuous white, red, and far-red lights than wild type and pirf1 seedlings (see supplemental Fig. S9). The elongation of primary roots in the phytochrome null mutants, phyA-211 and phyB-9, also was inhibited under both continuous red (Rc) or far-red (FRc) light conditions suggesting the involvement of both phytochromes A and B (Fig. 8, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S9). In addition, pirf1 and phytochrome B null mutants showed elongated root growth in the dark. Inhibitions of primary root growth by PIRF1 overexpression, and elongation of root in the pirf1 and phytochrome B null mutants in the dark, strongly suggest PIRF1 as a negative regulator by modulating its ROPs activity. This suggestion is consistent with the primary root elongation in transgenic ROP overexpressors (41Schultheiss H. Hensel G. Imani J. Broeders S. Sonnewald U. Kogel K.H. Kumlehn J. Hückelhoven R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The lack of a distinct root growth phenotype in the pirf1 mutant is probably due to a functional redundancy among the RopGEF family members, similar to that among ROP families (42Zheng Z.L. Yang Z. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the primary root lengths in PIRF1-OX and phy mutants were shorter than those of the wild type plants at fluence rates >0.1 mol−2 s−1, which suggest that PIRF1 f"
https://openalex.org/W2036533931,"Troponin T (TnT) and troponin I (TnI) are two evolutionarily and functionally linked subunits of the troponin complex that regulates striated muscle contraction. We previously reported a single amino acid substitution in the highly conserved TnT-binding helix of cardiac TnI (cTnI) in wild turkey hearts in concurrence with an abnormally spliced myopathic cardiac TnT (cTnT) (Biesiadecki, B. J., Schneider, K. L., Yu, Z. B., Chong, S. M., and Jin, J. P. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 13825-13832). To investigate the functional effect of this cTnI mutation and its potential value in compensating for the cTnT abnormality, we developed transgenic mice expressing the mutant cTnI (K118C) in the heart with or without the deletion of the endogenous cTnI gene to mimic the homozygote and heterozygote of wild turkeys. Double and triple transgenic mice were created by crossing the cTnI-K118C lines with transgenic mice overexpressing the myopathic cTnT (exon 7 deletion). Functional studies of ex vivo working hearts found that cTnI-K118C alone had a dominantly negative effect on diastolic function and blunted the inotropic responses of cardiac muscle to beta-adrenergic stimuli without abolishing the protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI. When co-expressed with the cTnT mutation, cTnI-K118C corrected the significant depression of systolic function caused by cTnT exon 7 deletion, and the co-existence of exon 7-deleted cTnT minimized the diastolic abnormality of cTnI-K118C. Characterization of this naturally selected pair of mutually rescuing mutations demonstrated that TnI-TnT interaction is a critical link in the Ca(2+) signaling and beta-adrenergic regulation in cardiac muscle, suggesting a potential target for the treatment of troponin cardiomyopathies and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2074380465,"By employing information theoretic measures, this study presents a structure and functional analysis of a multidrug-proton antiporter Mdr1p of Candida albicans. Since CaMdr1p belongs to drug-proton antiporter (DHA1) family of Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters, we contrasted DHA1 (antiporters) with Sugar Porter family (symporters). Cumulative Relative Entropy (CRE) calculated for these two sets of alignments enabled us to selectively identify conserved residues of not only CaMdr1p but for the entire DHA1 family. Based on CRE, the highest scoring thirty positions were selected and predicted to impart functional specificity to CaMdr1p as well as to other drug-proton antiporters. Nineteen positions wherein the CaMdr1p residue matched with the most frequent amino acid at a particular alignment position of DHA1 members were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis and were replaced with either alanine or leucine. All these mutant variants, except one, displayed either complete or selective sensitivity to the tested drugs. The enhanced susceptibility of these mutant variants was corroborated with the simultaneously abrogated efflux of substrates. Taken together, based on scaled CRE between two MFS sub-families, we could accurately predict the functionally relevant residues of CaMdr1p. An extrapolation of these predictions to the entire DHA1 family members as validated from previously published data shows that these residues are functionally critical in other members of the DHA1 family also."

Here, we analyzed the ability of PIs to interfere with differentiation program of monocytes toward dendritic cell (DCs) lineage, a key process in the inflammatory response.Monocytes from healthy donors were isolated and induced to differentiate in vitro in the presence or absence of saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir or amprenavir (sqv, rtv, nlfv, idv, apv, respectively). These drugs demonstrated a differential ability to sustain the generation of immature DCs (iDCs) with an altered phenotype, including low levels of CD1a, CD86, CD36 and CD209. DCs generated in the presence of rtv also failed to acquire the typical phenotype of mature DCs (mDCs), and secreted lower amounts of IL-12 and IL-15. Accordingly, these aberrant mDCs failed to support activation of autologous Natural Killer (NK) cells, and resulted highly susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.Our findings uncover novel functional properties of PIs within the DC-NK cell cross-talk, unveiling the heterogeneous ability of members of this class drugs to drive the generation of atypical monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) showing an aberrant phenotype, a failure to respond appropriately to bacterial endotoxin, a weak ability to prime autologous NK cells, and a high susceptibility to NK cell killing. These unexpected properties might contribute to limit inflammation and viral spreading in HIV-1 infected patients under PIs treatment, and open novel therapeutical perspectives for this class drugs as immunomodulators in autoimmunity and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2065067125,"Insect predators and parasitoids exploit attractive chemical signals from lower trophic levels as kairomones to locate their herbivore prey and hosts. We hypothesized that specific chemical cues from prey non-hosts and non-habitats, which are not part of the trophic chain, are also recognized by predators and would inhibit attraction to the host/prey kairomone signals. To test our hypothesis, we studied the olfactory physiology and behavior of a predaceous beetle, Thanasimus formicarius (L.) (Coleoptera: Cleridae), in relation to specific angiosperm plant volatiles, which are non-host volatiles (NHV) for its conifer-feeding bark beetle prey.Olfactory detection in the clerid was confirmed by gas chromatography coupled to electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) for a subset of NHV components. Among NHV, we identified two strongly antennally active molecules, 3-octanol and 1-octen-3-ol. We tested the potential inhibition of the combination of these two NHV on the walking and flight responses of the clerid to known kairomonal attractants such as synthetic mixtures of bark beetle (Ips spp.) aggregation pheromone components (cis-verbenol, ipsdienol, and E-myrcenol) combined with conifer (Picea and Pinus spp.) monoterpenes (alpha-pinene, terpinolene, and Delta(3)-carene). There was a strong inhibitory effect, both in the laboratory (effect size d = -3.2, walking bioassay) and in the field (d = -1.0, flight trapping). This is the first report of combining antennal detection (GC-EAD) and behavioral responses to identify semiochemical molecules that bypass the trophic system, signaling habitat information rather than food related information.Our results, along with recent reports on hymenopteran parasitoids and coleopteran predators, suggest that some NHV chemicals for herbivores are part of specific behavioral signals for the higher trophic level and not part of a background noise. Such bypass-trophic signals could be of general importance for third trophic level players in avoiding unsuitable habitats with non-host plants of their prey."
https://openalex.org/W2139525265,"Potassium fluxes integrate mitochondria into cellular activities, controlling their volume homeostasis and structural integrity in many pathophysiological mechanisms. The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is thought to play a passive role in this process because K(+) is believed to equilibrate freely between the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space. By patch clamping mitochondria isolated from the central nervous systems of adult mitoCFP transgenic mice, we discovered the existence of I(OMMKi), a novel voltage-dependent inwardly rectifying K(+) conductance located in the OMM. I(OMMKi) is regulated by osmolarity, potentiated by cAMP, and activated at physiological negative potentials, allowing K(+) to enter the mitochondrial intermembrane space in a controlled regulated fashion. The identification of I(OMMKi) in the OMM supports the notion that a membrane potential could exist across this membrane in vivo and suggests that the OMM possesses regulated pathways for K(+) uptake."

We report here that in fact all three subunits of the 9-1-1 complex are ubiquitylated. However, in contrast to previous results, we found modification of Rad17 to be independent of DNA damage, the Rad6-Rad18 complex, the putative acceptor site (lysine 197), and loading of the complex onto DNA. Consistently, we were unable to observe enhanced damage sensitivity or defects in checkpoint signaling in a rad17(K197R) mutant. Instead, our findings suggest that ubiquitylation of the 9-1-1 complex may be a background reaction that in some cases can mediate proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2043322945,"The bacterial metabolism of epoxypropane formed from propylene oxidation uses the atypical cofactor coenzyme M (CoM, 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate) as the nucleophile for epoxide ring opening and as a carrier of intermediates that undergo dehydrogenation, reductive cleavage, and carboxylation to form acetoacetate in a three-step metabolic pathway. 2-Ketopropyl-CoM carboxylase/oxidoreductase (2-KPCC), the terminal enzyme of this pathway, is the only known member of the disulfide oxidoreductase family of enzymes that is a carboxylase. In the present work, the CoM analog 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) is shown to be a reversible inhibitor of 2-KPCC and hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase but not of epoxyalkane:CoM transferase. Further investigations revealed that BES is a time-dependent inactivator of dithiothreitol-reduced 2-KPCC, where the redox active cysteines are in the free thiol forms. BES did not inactivate air-oxidized 2-KPCC, where the redox active cysteine pair is in the disulfide form. The inactivation of 2-KPCC exhibited saturation kinetics, and CoM slowed the rate of inactivation. Mass spectral analysis demonstrated that BES inactivation of reduced 2-KPCC occurs with covalent modification of the interchange thiol (Cys(82)) by a group with a molecular mass identical to that of ethylsulfonate. The flavin thiol Cys(87) was not alkylated by BES under reducing conditions, and no amino acid residues were modified by BES in the oxidized enzyme. The UV-visible spectrum of BES-modifed 2-KPCC showed the characteristic charge transfer absorbance expected with alkylation at Cys(82). These results identify BES as a reactive CoM analog that specifically alkylates the interchange thiol that facilitates thioether bond cleavage and enolacetone formation during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1992946399,"The fast accumulation of mutant mouse strains in recent years has provided an invaluable resource for phenotype-based genetic screens. However, study of lymphoid phenotypes can be obscured or impractical if homozygous mutations cause early embryonic defects. To aid phenotype screening of germ line mutations in the lymphoid system, we developed a method to induce loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in developing lymphocytes through chromosome deletion. Chromosome deletion was triggered by Cre/loxP-mediated inverse sister chromatid recombination in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle, leading to the generation of daughter cells missing part of or the entire recombinant chromosome. We show that the resulting cells were viable and capable of additional rounds of cell division, thus providing raw materials for subsequent phenotypic assessment. We used the recombination system to induce LOH at the E2A locus in developing B cells. A significant loss of pro-B and pre-B cells was observed when the wild-type allele was removed by chromosome deletion from the E2A heterozygous mice, a result consistent with the required role for E2A in B cell development. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of Cre-mediated chromosome deletion in the LOH assay for HEB function in T cell development. Thus, the Cre-mediated chromosome deletion provides a new and effective method for genome-wide assessment of germ line mutations in the lymphoid system."
https://openalex.org/W2020511002,"Background The probe percent bound value, calculated using multi-state equilibrium models of solution hybridization, is shown to be useful in understanding the hybridization behavior of microarray probes having 50 nucleotides, with and without mismatches. These longer oligonucleotides are in widespread use on microarrays, but there are few controlled studies of their interactions with mismatched targets compared to 25-mer based platforms. Principal Findings 50-mer oligonucleotides with centrally placed single, double and triple mismatches were spotted on an array. Over a range of target concentrations it was possible to discriminate binding to perfect matches and mismatches, and the type of mismatch could be predicted accurately in the concentration midrange (100 pM to 200 pM) using solution hybridization modeling methods. These results have implications for microarray design, optimization and analysis methods. Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of incorporating biophysical factors in both the design and the analysis of microarrays. Use of the probe “percent bound” value predicted by equilibrium models of hybridization is confirmed to be important for predicting and interpreting the behavior of long oligonucleotide arrays, as has been shown for short oligonucleotide arrays."

To understand better how F508del perturbs CFTR architecture, high resolution structures of murine (m) and human (h) NBD1 as well as of human F508del-NBD1 (11Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K.

However, the structure of human NBD1 incorporates a series of mutations, which rescue in vivo the cell surface expression and function of F508del-CFTR (13Pissarra L.S. Farinha C.M. Xu Z. Schmidt A. Thibodeau P.H. Cai Z. Thomas P.J. Sheppard D.N. Amaral M.D. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 62-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the available crystal structure of F508del-NBD1 plausibly corresponds to a partially corrected conformation of this domain. Based on these NBD1 structures and atomic resolution structures of other ABC transporters (14Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P. Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), molecular models of the CFTR protein have been developed (15Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 16Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Callebaut I. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2594-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These molecular models are a valuable guide for studies of CFTR structure and function. Another powerful approach to investigate the structure and function of hCFTR is to examine interspecies differences to identify conserved and divergent regions. Since the identification and cloning of the hCFTR gene (4Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar), various homologues have been isolated from different species (e.g. mouse, sheep, pig, Xenopus, macaque, rabbit, bovine, killifish, and salmon); all possess a domain organization similar to that of hCFTR (17Chen J.M. Cutler C. Jacques C. Boeuf G. Denamur E. Lecointre G. Mercier B. Cramb G. Férec C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 1771-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, significant interspecies differences in CFTR processing and function have been reported previously. For example, human and murine CFTR Cl− channels exhibit different patterns of channel gating (18Lansdell K.A. Delaney S.J. Lunn D.P. Thomson S.A. Sheppard D.N. Wainwright B.J. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Lansdell K.A. Kidd J.F. Delaney S.J. Wainwright B.J. Sheppard D.N. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which are specified, in part, by amino acid sequence differences in the NBDs (20Scott-Ward T.S. Cai Z. Dawson E.S. Doherty A. Da Paula A.C. Davidson H. Porteous D.J. Wainwright B.J. Amaral M.D. Sheppard D.N. Boyd A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16365-16370Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ostedgaard et al. (21Ostedgaard L.S. Rogers C.S. Dong Q. Randak C.O. Vermeer D.W. Rokhlina T. Karp P.H. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) identified differences in the processing of the F508del mutation between human, porcine, and murine CFTR. In that study, both porcine and murine F508del-CFTR proteins were found to be at least partially processed like their WT counterparts, and this processing was unaffected by the origin of the cell line where the mutant proteins were expressed. Thus, cross-species CFTR chimeras appear to be an excellent resource to investigate the folding and functional consequences of interdomain interactions in CFTR. Indeed, insights into the biochemical properties of mCFTR subdomains in the context of hCFTR, such as those provided by the present study, will help to further understanding of the structural and functional effects of disease-causing mutations in both NBDs and validate existing structural models (15Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 16Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Callebaut I.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39051-39057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the present work, we aimed to identify the structural features of hCFTR (mis)folding using a human-murine comparative approach by investigating whether CFTR domains (NBDs and RD) are structurally interchangeable between human and murine CFTR. Our data reveal that two chimeras (one in NBD1 and another in NBD2) failed to be processed into their mature forms. Systematic mutagenesis of the divergent murine residues present in these chimeras followed by biochemical and functional studies revealed that K584E is responsible for the maturation defect of the hmNBD1 chimera. Furthermore, replacement of Leu581 (interacting with Lys584 in the structure of hNBD1) by the corresponding murine amino acid (Phe581) rescued the maturation of K584E-CFTR. Thus, our results demonstrate that hmCFTR chimeras can be used to identify critical residues responsible for both structural and functional differences between human and murine CFTR. Furthermore, the CFTR mutants generated here constitute a valuable resource to characterize the possible binding sites and mechanism of action of small molecules used in CFTR assist therapies (23Amaral M.D. Curr. Drug Targets. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar). Human-murine CFTR chimeras containing sequences from murine NBD1, NBD2, and RD were constructed by homologous recombination as described previously (20Scott-Ward T.S. Cai Z. Dawson E.S. Doherty A. Da Paula A.C. Davidson H. Porteous D.J. Wainwright B.J. Amaral M.D. Sheppard D.N. Boyd A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16365-16370Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into the pNUT WT-CFTR cDNA. Each mutation was verified by sequencing. For a list of primers used, see supplemental Table 2. We transiently expressed wild-type and chimeric CFTRs in HEK-293 cells using Lipofectin® (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with 1 μg of cDNA for all CFTR variants. 48 h after transfection, we extracted total protein from HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type and chimeric CFTRs and assayed for CFTR expression by Western blotting. To generate cell lines stably expressing high levels of CFTR variants, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were transfected with CFTR cDNAs (3 μg) using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and selected for stable transfectants using methotrexate (500 μm). For each CFTR variant, 10 BHK clones were analyzed by Western blotting. Of these, the clone expressing the highest level of CFTR protein was selected for further analyses, ensuring that CFTR expression levels among the different CFTR variants were equivalent. Cells were cultured, seeded, and used as described previously (24Roxo-Rosa M. Xu Z. Schmidt A. Neto M. Cai Z. Soares C.M. Sheppard D.N. Amaral M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17891-17896Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In some experiments (see figure legends), cell surface expression of F508del-CFTR was enhanced by incubating cells at 26 °C for 24 h. To assay for CFTR protein expression by Western blot (WB), cells expressing CFTR variants were lysed, and extracts were analyzed as described (25Farinha C.M. Mendes F. Roxo-Rosa M. Penque D. Amaral M.D. Mol. Cell. Probes. 2004; 18: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using the anti-CFTR antibody 596 (CF Foundation). Densitometry was performed as described previously (25Farinha C.M. Mendes F. Roxo-Rosa M. Penque D. Amaral M.D. Mol. Cell. Probes. 2004; 18: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-free α-modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) before being radiolabeled for 25 min in the same medium supplemented with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN Biomedicals). For the chase (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h), the labeling medium was replaced by α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (8%, v/v; Invitrogen) and non-radioactive methionine (1 mm; Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1 ml) containing deoxycholic acid (1%, w/v; Sigma-Aldrich), Triton X-100 (1%, v/v; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences), SDS (0.1%, w/v; Invitrogen), Tris (50 mm, pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich), and NaCl (150 mm). CFTR protein was immunoprecipitated as described by Farinha et al. (26Farinha C.M. Penque D. Roxo-Rosa M. Lukacs G. Dormer R. McPherson M. Pereira M. Bot A.G. Jorna H. Willemsen R. Dejonge H. Heda G.D. Marino C.R. Fanen P. Hinzpeter A. Lipecka J. Fritsch J. Gentzsch M. Edelman A. Amaral M.D. J. Cyst. Fibros. 2004; 3: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) after centrifugation of samples at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. To detect specifically CFTR, the supernatant was incubated overnight with 1.5 μg of the anti-CFTR monoclonal antibody M3A7, which recognizes NBD2 and the C terminus of CFTR (residues 1197–1480; Chemicon), at 4 °C, and then protein G-agarose beads (25 μg; Roche Applied Science) were added for a further 4 h at 4% (v/v). Beads were washed four times using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1 ml), and protein was eluted for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with cracking buffer (80 μl) containing dithiothreitol (0.5 mm; Sigma-Aldrich), bromphenol blue (0.001%, w/v), glycerol (5%, v/v), SDS (1.5%, w/v), and Tris (31.25 mm), pH 6.8. Samples were separated electrophoretically on 7% (v/v) polyacrylamide gels. Then, gels were prefixed (methanol (30%, v/v) and acetic acid (10%, v/v)) for 30 min, washed thoroughly in water, and soaked in salicylic acid (1 m) for 1 h. After drying at 80 °C under vacuum for 2 h, gels were exposed to x-ray film (Fujifilm Medical Systems). Fluorograms of gels were digitized (Sharp JX-330, Sharp Europe), and integrated peak areas were determined using ImageMaster® software (GE Healthcare). CFTR-mediated iodide efflux was measured at room temperature as described (19Lansdell K.A. Kidd J.F. Delaney S.J. Wainwright B.J. Sheppard D.N. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using the cAMP agonist forskolin (10 μm) and the CFTR potentiator genistein (50 μm; Sigma-Aldrich). Prior to commencing experiments, BHK cells expressing CFTR variants were incubated for 1 h in loading buffer containing 136 mm NaI, 3 mm KNO3, 2 mm Ca(NO3)2, 20 mm Hepes, and 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4 with 1 m NaOH and then washed thoroughly with efflux buffer (136 mm NaNO3 replacing 136 mm NaI in the loading buffer). The amount of iodide in each sample of efflux buffer was determined using an iodide-selective electrode (MP225, Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA). BHK cells were loaded, and experiments were performed at RT (∼23 °C). Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (27Mendes F. Wakefield J. Bachhuber T. Barroso M. Bebok Z. Penque D. Kunzelmann K. Amaral M.D. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 16: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, BHK cells expressing CFTR variants were rinsed twice with cold PBS and fixed with ice-cold 4% p-formaldehyde (Fluka BioChemica) in PBS for 20 min. After four washes with cold PBS at RT, nonspecific staining was prevented by blocking with BSA (1%, w/v) in PBS for 30 min. Cells were stained with anti-wheat germ agglutinin for 1 h, coupled with Texas Red, and then permeabilized with Triton (0.2%, w/v) for 20 min. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS (10 min each at RT) and incubated with (i) monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody 570 and then (ii) secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse, for 1 h each. Cells were again washed three times with PBS (10 min each at RT), and slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) to stain nuclei and covered with a glass coverslip. Immunofluorescence staining was investigated using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SPE). No background staining or autofluorescence was observed with untransfected BHK cells (data not shown). CFTR Cl− currents were recorded in excised inside-out membrane patches using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (MDS Analytical Technologies) and pCLAMP data acquisition and analysis software (versions 6.0.4 and 9.2, MDS Analytical Technologies) as described previously (18Lansdell K.A. Delaney S.J. Lunn D.P. Thomson S.A. Sheppard D.N. Wainwright B.J. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The pipette (extracellular) solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 140 mm aspartic acid, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm TES, pH 7.3 with Tris ([Cl−], 10 mm). The bath (intracellular) solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CsEGTA, and 10 mm TES, pH 7.3 with HCl ([Cl−], 147 mm; [Ca2+]free, <10−8 m) and was maintained at 37 °C. After their excision, membrane patches were voltage-clamped at −50 mV, and CFTR Cl− channels were activated by the addition of ATP (1 mm; Sigma-Aldrich) and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (75 nm; Promega UK) to the intracellular solution within 5 min of patch excision. In this study, we used membrane patches containing small numbers of active channels (≤5). We determined the number of channels in a membrane patch from the maximum number of simultaneous channel openings observed during the course of an experiment. To minimize errors when counting the number of active channels, we used the strategies described by Cai et al. (28Cai Z. Taddei A. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1970-1977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We recorded, filtered, and digitized data as described (18Lansdell K.A. Delaney S.J. Lunn D.P. Thomson S.A. Sheppard D.N. Wainwright B.J. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To measure single channel current amplitude (i), Gaussian distributions were fit to current amplitude histograms. For open probability (Po) analyses, lists of open and closed times were created using a half-amplitude crossing criterion for event detection. Transitions <1 ms in duration were excluded from the analyses, and Po was calculated as described previously (28Cai Z. Taddei A. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1970-1977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of n observations. To compare sets of data, we used Student's t test for iodide efflux and single channel data. Pulse-chase data were analyzed by comparing degradation rates (slopes of regression lines) by Student's t test. On a regression modeling procedure, the slope is known to follow a t distribution (29Kleinbaum D.G. Kupper L.L. Muller K.E. Applied Regression Analysis and Other Multivariate Methods.4th Ed. Duxbury Press, Pacific Grove, CA2008: 114-138Google Scholar, 30Helliwell P.S. Jackson S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1994; 53: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, slopes of two straight lines can be compared using a t distribution with n1 + n2 − 4 degrees of freedom where n1 and n2 are the number of points used on the regression procedure in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Differences between groups of data were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. A previously described recombination strategy was used to generate hmCFTR chimeras (20Scott-Ward T.S. Cai Z. Dawson E.S. Doherty A. Da Paula A.C. Davidson H. Porteous D.J. Wainwright B.J. Amaral M.D. Sheppard D.N. Boyd A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16365-16370Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because of the high degree of homology between hCFTR and mCFTR sequences, homologous recombination frequently occurred within the murine domains rather than at the chimeric junction defined by the PCR primers. From the library of chimeras generated by Scott-Ward et al. (20Scott-Ward T.S. Cai Z. Dawson E.S. Doherty A. Da Paula A.C. Davidson H. Porteous D.J. Wainwright B.J. Amaral M.D. Sheppard D.N. Boyd A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16365-16370Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in the present work, we focused on the following constructs (Fig. 1A): 562c-NBD1 (limits of inserted mCFTR sequence, Leu433–Val586), 12b-NBD1 (Lys518–Val586), 323c-NBD2 (Met1260–Ser1419), 114c-NBD2 (Met1260–Arg1412), 64a-RD (Ser654–Leu834), and NBD1+2 (Lys518–Val586; Met1260–Ser1419). The latter NBD1+2 refers to chimera 12b+323c, which is not the same as that previously described (20Scott-Ward T.S. Cai Z. Dawson E.S. Doherty A. Da Paula A.C. Davidson H. Porteous D.J. Wainwright B.J. Amaral M.D. Sheppard D.N. Boyd A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16365-16370Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); hence, we term it hereafter 12b-NBD1+323c-NBD2. As controls, we also analyzed WT- and F508del-hCFTR as well as mCFTR. The traffic of CFTR protein to the cell membrane can be assessed indirectly by its maturation. Indeed, WT-CFTR synthesized in the ER as a core-glycosylated, immature form undergoes additional glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus to generate its mature form (band C; ∼170–190 kDa) (9Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 31Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). By contrast, due to its ER retention, F508del-CFTR can only be detected as the core-glycosylated, ER-specific immature form of CFTR (band B; ∼150 kDa) (31Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Quantification of these immature and mature forms at steady state by WB provides a measure of the extent of maturation of a given CFTR variant and also, indirectly, of whether its in vivo folding has been achieved by ERQC protein conformation criteria. Thus, such data can also be interpreted as indicative of structural divergence between WT- and mutant CFTR. When we evaluated the maturation efficiency of the hmCFTR chimeras by assessing their production of immature and mature CFTR protein at steady state by WB analysis in the same cell line, we found that two chimeras failed to generate the mature form of CFTR (band C): clone 12b-NBD1 (Fig. 1B, lane 9) and clone 114c-NBD2 (Fig. 1B, lane 7). Indeed, both these chimeras were only detected as their immature core-glycosylated ER-specific forms (150 kDa; band B) (31Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). These results contrast with all the other chimeras analyzed: 12b-NBD1+323c-NBD2 (Fig. 1B, lane 2), 323c-NBD2 (lane 3), 562c-NBD1 (lane 4), 64a-RD (lane 5), human CFTR (lane 1), and murine CFTR (lane 8). For each of these CFTR constructs, the mature form was detected, albeit at varying levels. After quantification of independent experiments (n = 10), the rank order of processing efficiency was as follows (WT-CFTR taken as 100%): 323c-NBD2 (129 ± 6%) ≫ murine (86 ± 5%) = human (83 ± 3%) = 562c-NBD1 (80 ± 4%) = 64a-RD (77 ± 4%) > 12b-NBD1+323c-NBD2 (67 ± 5%). Additional chimeric constructs analyzed by WB in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells included the following: 20b-NBD1 (Thr531–Tyr647), 966c-NBD1 (Ile481–Val546), 158a-NBD2 (Met1220–Asp1409), 189b-NBD2 (Met1220–Tyr1381), 207c-NBD2 (Val1226–Asn1420), 51a-RD (Phe653–Met837), 52a-RD (Thr654–Val693), 71a-RD (Thr654–Leu834), and 85a-RD (Thr654–Val837). Like hCFTR and mCFTR, each of these hmCFTR chimeras was processed normally (data not shown). When we compared the murine amino acid sequences of the two non-processed chimeric proteins (12b-NBD1 and 114c-NBD2) with their corresponding regions in human CFTR, we found that 12 and 27 amino acid residues diverge between the human and murine sequences of 12b-NBD1 and 114c-NBD2, respectively (see also supplemental Fig. 1). To identify which of these residues could account for the failure of these chimeric proteins to mature, we selected as most probable those residues with greatest sequence divergence between human and murine CFTR based on their values for physicochemical distance (32Grantham R. Science. 1974; 185: 862-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Thus, we identified six residues in 12b-NBD1 (E527Q, E528Q, S531T, K536Q, I539T, and K584E) and 12 residues in 114c-NBD2 (T1263I, P1290T, K1302Q, Y1307N, Q1309K, S1311K, R1325K, V1338T, C1344Y, L1367I, D1394G, and E1409D) (see supplemental Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1, A and B). The above six NBD1 and 12 NBD2 point mutants (mCFTR residues) were introduced into full-length human CFTR, the constructs were used to generate stable BHK cell lines, and CFTR protein expression was assessed by WB analysis (Fig. 2). With one exception (K584E; Fig. 2A, lane 8), all point mutants derived from 12b-NBD1 were processed (lanes 3–7) similarly to WT-hCFTR (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Like F508del (Fig. 2A, lane 2), K584E (lane 8) only generated immature CFTR protein (band B; 150-kDa). By contrast, all point mutants derived from 114c-NBD2 were processed to the fully glycosylated (band C; 170–190-kDa) form (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–6 and 9–14) like WT-hCFTR (lane 7). These data suggest that all CFTR constructs except K584E are delivered to the cell surface. Results from quantification of the mature form (as percentage of total expressed) for each of the CFTR point mutants studied (Table 1) show that physicochemical distance (supplemental Table 1, A and B) is not inversely correlated with extent of protein processing.TABLE 1Summary information of CFTR point mutants analyzed in present studyCFTR variantsClinical dataaData from the CFTR mutation database.Band C/band BbPercentage of processing given by (band C/band B) × 100.

https://openalex.org/W2001233146,"Constructing an accurate predictive model for clinical decision-making on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor samples with high-dimensional microarray data remains a very challenging problem. The validity of such models has been seriously questioned due to their failure in clinical validation using independent samples. Besides the statistical issues such as selection bias, some studies further implied the probable reason was improper sample selection that did not resemble the genomic space defined by the training population. Assuming that predictions would be more reliable for interpolation than extrapolation, we set to investigate the impact of applicability domain (AD) on model performance in microarray-based genomic research by evaluating and comparing model performance for samples with different extrapolation degrees. We found that the issue of applicability domain may not exist in microarray-based genomic research for clinical applications. Therefore, it is not practicable to improve model validity based on applicability domain."
