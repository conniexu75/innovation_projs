https://openalex.org/W2007534543,"Mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease (L90M, G48V, and L90M/G48V) arise when HIV is passaged in the presence of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. These mutations yield a virus with less sensitivity to the drug (L90M > G48V ≫ L90M/G48V). L90M, G48V, and L90M/G48V proteases have 1/20, 1/160, and 1/1000 the affinity for saquinavir compared to WT protease, respectively. Therefore, the affinity of mutant protease for saquinavir decreased as the sensitivity of the virus to saquinavir decreased. Association rate constants for WT and mutant proteases with saquinavir were similar, ranging from 2 to 4 × 107M−1 s−1. In contrast, the dissociation rate constants for WT, L90M, G48V, and L90M/G48V proteases complexed with saquinavir were 0.0014, 0.019, 0.128, and 0.54 s−1, respectively. This indicated that the reduced affinity for mutant proteases and saquinavir is primarily the result of larger dissociation rate constants. The increased dissociation rate constants may be the result of a decrease in the internal equilibrium between the bound inhibitor with the protease flaps up and the bound inhibitor with the flaps down. Interestingly, the affinity of these mutant proteases for VX-478, ABT-538, AG-1343, or L-735,524 was not reduced as much as that for saquinavir. Finally, the catalytic constants of WT and mutant proteases were determined for eight small peptide substrates that mimic the viral cleavage sites in vivo. WT and L90M proteases had similar catalytic constants for these substrates. In contrast, G48V and L90M/G48V proteases had catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) values with TLNF-PISP, RKIL-FLDG, and AETF-YVDG that were 1/10 to 1/20 the value of WT protease. The decreased catalytic efficiencies were primarily the result of increased Km values. Thus, mutations in the protease decrease the affinity of the enzyme for saquinavir and the catalytic efficiency with peptide substrates.

Three protease inhibitors, saquinavir (Ro-31,8959), ritonavir (ABT-538), and indinavir (L-735,524) are effective in clinical trials in treating HIV disease (4Jacobsen H. Brun-Vezinet F. Duncan I.

Other protease inhibitors in earlier stage clinical trials are VX-478 and AG1343. Notwithstanding these early successes, viral resistance to individual inhibitors and cross-resistance to multiple inhibitors occurs in vivo (7Richman D.D.

The mutations that confer viral resistance to protease inhibitors are located in the HIV protease gene. In many cases, the mutations generated from selection pressure in vitro are the same as those observed clinically (19Tisdale M. Int. Antiviral News. 1996; 4: 41-43Google Scholar). These results suggest that resistance studies in vitro could provide insight in what to expect in clinical trials.Studies to understand the molecular mechanism of HIV resistance to protease inhibitors have begun (20Ridky T. Leis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29621-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the cases of saquinavir and A77003, mutant proteases that confer viral resistance to the inhibitor have reduced affinity for that inhibitor (12Maschera B. Furfine E. Blair E.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5431-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ho D.D. Toyoshima T. Mo H. Kempf D.J. Norbeck D. Chen C.-M. Wideburg N.E. Burt S.K. Erickson J.W. Singh M.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies indicate that the reduced affinity of these mutant proteases for some inhibitors is, in part, due to the disruption of van der Waals interactions (21Baldwin E.T. Bhat T.N. Liu B. Pattabiraman N. Erickson J.W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Chen Z. Li Y. Schock H.B. Hall D. Chen E. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21433-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In some cases, the decreased affinity of the mutant protease for the inhibitor correlates with reduced catalytic efficiency of the mutant protease (23Moody M.D. Pettit S.C. Shao W. Everitt L. Loeb D.D. Hutchinson C.A. Swanstrom R. Virology. 1995; 207: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Gulnik S.V. Suvorov L.I. Liu B. Yu B. Anderson B. Mitsuya H. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9282-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Changes in the substrate sequence can compensate for loss of catalytic efficiency of mutant proteases (23Moody M.D. Pettit S.C. Shao W. Everitt L. Loeb D.D. Hutchinson C.A. Swanstrom R. Virology. 1995; 207: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and, in fact, processing sites of viruses resistant to BILA1906/2011BS and BILA 2185BS have compensatory amino acid substitutions (25Lamarre, D., Doyon, L., Croteau, G., Pilote, L., Thibeault, D., (1995) HIV Drug Resistance Fourth International Workshop, Sardinia, Italy, Abstr. 62.Google Scholar). However, these compensatory mutations in HIV protease substrates have not been observed in vivo. Herein, we define the kinetic mechanism of viral resistance to saquinavir (Ro31-8959) by determining the rate constants for association and dissociation of saquinavir with WT and proteases with mutations that confer resistance to saquinavir. We propose a molecular model to explain these kinetic results. Furthermore, we examined the effect of these mutations on the catalytic efficiency with a variety of substrates that mimic the protease processing sites in vivo.DISCUSSIONThree mutations in HIV protease that confer HIV resistance to saquinavir are L90M, G48V, and G48V/L90M (10Craig J.C. Whittaker L. Duncan I.B. Roberts N.A. Antiviral Chem. & Chemother. 1993; 4: 335-339Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Dianzani F. Antonelli G. Turriziani O. Riva E. Dong G. Bellarosa D. Antiviral Chem. & Chemother. 1993; 4: 329-333Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Maschera B. Furfine E. Blair E.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5431-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jacobsen H. Yasargil K. Winslow D.L. Craig J.C. Krohn A. Duncan I.B. Mous J. Virology. 1995; 206: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As the rank order of affinity for saquinavir to these three mutant proteases decreases, the rank order of the respective viral sensitivity to saquinavir decreases (12Maschera B. Furfine E. Blair E.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5431-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Herein, we have determined that these mutant proteases have 1/20, 1/160, and 1/1000 the affinity for saquinavir compared with WT protease, respectively.In this model, k2 and k−2 refer to the flap closing and opening, respectively. However, the binding of saquinavir to WT and mutant proteases appears to be the one-step process of Equation 1a. If k2 was much greater than k−1, such that most encounters to form E·I result in the formation of E·I*, the two-step process would appear as a one-step process (30Furfine E.S. D'Souza E.D. Ingold K.J. Leban J.J. Spector T. Porter D.J.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7886-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was estimated by molecular modeling that flap closing could occur within 12 ps, which suggests that k2 could be as large as 1011 s−1 (33Collins J.R. Burt S.K. Erickson J.W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a separate case, with an analogue of saquinavir, k−1 was estimated to be 10 s−1 (30Furfine E.S. D'Souza E.D. Ingold K.J. Leban J.J. Spector T. Porter D.J.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7886-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that k2 could be very much greater than k−1. If k2 was much greater than k−1, then the observed association rate constant (kon) is defined by the single parameter k1. Furthermore, k1 and k−1 are association and dissociation from a “loose complex” that has limited molecular interactions; therefore, it is likely that mutations would not significantly affect these rate constants. Because the decrease in affinity of saquinavir and mutant proteases is mediated primarily by the single parameter koff (the dissociation rate constant), it is attractive to attribute the increase in koff to a single step in the mechanism. k2 and k−2 define the equilibrium (K2 = k2/k−2) between the “tight and loose complex” (flaps closed or open, respectively). In the “tight complex,” intricate molecular interactions between enzyme and inhibitor occur. Therefore, these active site mutations would likely significantly affect k2 and k−2 (or the equilibrium constant K2). Furthermore, since we proposed that K2 is a rapid equilibrium (k2 >>> k−1) that greatly favors the tight complex, then koff would increase proportionally with a decrease in K2 (koff = k−1/K2). Finally, in molecular modeling studies, mutation M46I, which, in combination with other mutations, confers viral resistance to VX-478, alters K2 in the absence of any inhibitor (33Collins J.R. Burt S.K. Erickson J.W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that the reduction in affinity of L90M, G48V, and G48V/L90M proteases for saquinavir is completely the result of decreasing K2, the equilibrium for flap closing of E·I.Catalytic efficiencies of WT and mutant proteases were determined to test for additional effects of the L90M and G48V mutations. Eight octapeptides that were analogues of the eight cleavage sites that occur during HIV proliferation were used as substrates. The catalytic efficiencies measured for WT protease (Table III) were approximately 1/10 the analogous values reported by Tozser et al. (34Tozser J. Blaha I. Copeland T.D. Wondrak E.M. Oroszlan S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and 10 times the analogous values reported by Moore et al. (35Moore M.L. Bryan W.M. Fakhoury S.A. Magaard V.M. Huffman W.F. Dayton B.D. Meek T.D. Hyland L. Dreyer G.B. Metcalf B.W. Strickler J.E. Gorniak J.G. Debouck C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) or Tomasselli et al. (36Tomasselli A.G. Hui J.O. Sawyer T.K. Staples D.J. Bannow C. Reardon I.M. Howe W.J. DeCamp D.L. Craik C.S. Heinrikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14675-14683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HIV protease activity is highly dependent upon assay conditions, such as salt concentration (data not shown); therefore, we were not surprised to see this variation in catalytic efficiency values. L90M and WT protease had similar catalytic efficiencies with the eight substrates. This result was not surprising because some mutations increase catalytic efficiency and reduce affinity for inhibitors (31Lin Y. Lin X. Hong L. Foundling S. Heinrickson R.L. Thaisrivongs S. Leelamanit W. Raterman D. Shah M. Bunn B.M. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, G48V and G48V/L90M protease had greatly (90 to 95%) reduced catalytic efficiency for TLNF-PISP, RKIL-FLDG, and AETF-YVDG (Table III). However, these mutant enzymes did not have greatly reduced catalytic efficiencies compared to WT enzyme with four of the eight substrates ((kcat/Km)mutant/(kcat/Km)wt≥ 1/3, Table III). The decreases in catalytic efficiency was primarily due to increases in the Km for these substrates. Gulnik et al. (24Gulnik S.V. Suvorov L.I. Liu B. Yu B. Anderson B. Mitsuya H. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9282-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) determined that mutant proteases with reduced affinity for A-77003 also had a reduced catalytic efficiency as a result of increased Km values for Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Tyr-Phe(NO2)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2. They have suggested vitality factors ((Ki·kcat/Km)mutant/(Ki·kcat/Km)wt) as better predictors of viral resistance to drugs than Ki values because the vitality factor normalizes the decrease in enzyme affinity for the compensatory loss in catalytic efficiency. While the vitality factor is potentially a useful tool to indicate drug resistance, our studies indicate a more sophisticated tool may be required because mutant enzymes do not show the same reduction in catalytic efficiency for all substrates. Finally, since mutations that reduce protease affinity for inhibitors often reduce the protease catalytic efficiency, it is possible that these mutations ultimately hinder viral proliferation and may self-limit viral resistance to protease inhibitors. In fact, some mutations that confer resistance to A-77003 result in catalytically hampered enzyme and virus with impaired growth (32Rose R.E. Gong Y.-F. Greytok J.A. Bechtold C.M. Terry B.J. Robinson B.S. Alam M. Colonno R.J. Lin P.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1648-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Whereas L90M, G48V, and G48V/L90M proteases had substantial reductions in affinity for saquinavir, they did not have similar relative decreases in affinity for three other protease inhibitors presently under clinical evaluation (L-735,524, AG-1343, and VX-478). ABT-538 had significantly less affinity for the G48V and G48V/L90M protease than WT protease, but the decreases were not as large as for saquinavir. As predicted from the affinity of G48V/L90M protease for inhibitors, G48V/L90M virus was nearly as sensitive to L-735,524, AG1343, ABT-538, and VX-478 as was WT virus. In a few cases, with other mutant enzymes, changes in affinity for inhibitors does not correlate well with changes in respective virus inhibition. For example, a relatively small increase in Ki of ABT-538 for I50V protease (26-fold) correlates with a relatively large increase (6-fold) in respective virus IC50. 3B. Maschera, G. Darby, G. Palú, L. L. Wright, M. Tisdale, R. Myers, E. D. Blair, and E. S. Furfine, unpublished results. The vitality factor (data not available) might correlate with antiviral activity better than the Ki value. Nonetheless, in general, Ki values determined herein for mutant proteases are reasonable predictors of the respective virus susceptibility to inhibitors. Therefore, the kinetic parameters of mutant proteases are useful tools to test “next generation” compounds for their cross-resistance profiles.

In many cases, the mutations generated from selection pressure in vitro are the same as those observed clinically (19Tisdale M. Int. Antiviral News. 1996; 4: 41-43Google Scholar). These results suggest that resistance studies in vitro could provide insight in what to expect in clinical trials.Studies to understand the molecular mechanism of HIV resistance to protease inhibitors have begun (20Ridky T. Leis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29621-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the cases of saquinavir and A77003, mutant proteases that confer viral resistance to the inhibitor have reduced affinity for that inhibitor (12Maschera B. Furfine E. Blair E.D. J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies indicate that the reduced affinity of these mutant proteases for some inhibitors is, in part, due to the disruption of van der Waals interactions (21Baldwin E.T. Bhat T.N. Liu B.

In some cases, the decreased affinity of the mutant protease for the inhibitor correlates with reduced catalytic efficiency of the mutant protease (23Moody M.D. Pettit S.C. Shao W. Everitt L.

However, these compensatory mutations in HIV protease substrates have not been observed in vivo. Herein, we define the kinetic mechanism of viral resistance to saquinavir (Ro31-8959) by determining the rate constants for association and dissociation of saquinavir with WT and proteases with mutations that confer resistance to saquinavir. We propose a molecular model to explain these kinetic results. Furthermore, we examined the effect of these mutations on the catalytic efficiency with a variety of substrates that mimic the protease processing sites in vivo."

In this study, to understand how cardiac hypertrophy develops, we examined AngII-evoked signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), which are reportedly critical for the development of cardiac hypertrophy, in cultured cardiac myocytes isolated from neonatal rats. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) with calphostin C or down-regulation of PKC by pretreatment with a phorbol ester for 24 h abolished AngII-induced activation of Raf-1 and ERKs, and addition of a phorbol ester conversely induced a marked increase in the activities of Raf-1 and ERKs. Pretreatment with two chemically and mechanistically dissimilar tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin, did not attenuate AngII-induced activation of ERKs. In contrast, genistein strongly blocked insulin-induced ERK activation in cardiac myocytes. Although pretreatment with manumycin, a Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor, or overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Ras inhibited insulin-induced ERK activation, neither affected AngII-induced activation of ERKs. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Raf-1 completely suppressed ERK2 activation by AngII, endothelin-1, and insulin. These results suggest that PKC and Raf-1, but not tyrosine kinases or Ras, are critical for AngII-induced activation of ERKs in cardiac myocytes."

Cross-correlation analysis showed a high degree of correlation between sites where mitochondria are present and peaks in the amplitude and rate of rise of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response.

https://openalex.org/W2004266373,"The mechanism of inhibition of cytochrome (cyt) c oxidase by nitric oxide (NO) has been investigated by stopped flow transient spectroscopy and singular value decomposition analysis. Following the time course of cyt c oxidation at different O2/NO ratios, we observed that the onset of inhibition: (i) is fast and at a high NO concentration is complete during the first turnover; (ii) is sensitive to the O2/NO ratio; and (iii) is independent of incubation time of the oxidized enzyme with NO.

The ability of NO to efficiently compete with O2 and the quick reversal of the inhibition are not easily understood on the basis of what is known about the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction of these two gases with the reduced cyt a3-CuB binuclear center (6Blackmore R.S.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When the oxidized enzyme was incubated with NO, the magnetic coupling between cyt a33+ and CuB2+ relaxes, and the EPR signal of cyt a3 was detected (10Stevens T.H. Brudwig G.W. Bocian D.F. Chan S.I.

J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), on the basis of experiments carried out with the detergent-solubilized enzyme, postulated that the inhibited state is a complex of NO with reduced cyt a3 and proposed that CuB plays a key role in the mechanism of inhibition. In this article we report rapid-mixing stopped flow spectroscopic experiments, which provide a clue to the mechanism of inhibition of beef heart cyt c oxidase by NO and its reversal in the presence of O2. Cytochrome c oxidase from beef heart was purified according to the method of Soulimane and Buse (12Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); this preparation protocol, which yields a homogeneous “fast” enzyme, was used throughout. Oxidase concentration is expressed as functional units (cyt aa3). Stock solutions of NO (Air Liquide, Paris, France) were prepared before use by equilibrating degassed buffer in a tonometer ([NO] in solution = 2 mM at 20°C). Lauryl maltoside was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Horse heart cyt c (type VI) and ascorbate were from Sigma. Ruthenium hexamine was from Aldrich. Cyt c concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient (reduced − oxidized) ΔE = 19 mM−1 cm−1 at 550 nm. Stopped flow experiments were carried out either with a Durrum-Gibson instrument equipped with a diode array (TN6500; Tracor Northern, Madison, WI) or with a sequential stopped flow spectrophotometer (DX.17MV; Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom). The diode array stopped flow spectrometer can acquire up to 80 spectra of 1024 elements; the following time acquisition mode was used throughout: 30 spectra from 10 ms to ~1.5 s; 20 spectra up to ~40 s; and the last 10 spectra up to ~140 s. Data analysis was carried out with MATLAB (MathWorks, South Natick, MA) running on an Intel 486-based computer. Time-resolved optical spectra were analyzed by SVD according to the method of Henry and Hofrichter (13Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Kinetic simulations were carried out using a differential equations solver algorithm implemented by Dr. E. Henry (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) running on a Silicon Graphics work station. Fig. 1 shows the result of a double mixing stopped flow experiment designed as shown in Scheme I. An anaerobic solution of oxidized oxidase was mixed with a degassed buffer with or without NO; after a preset delay (e.g. 10 ms) this mixture was mixed (second mixing) with an air-equilibrated solution of cyt c2+. In the absence of NO, oxidation of cyt c2+ proceeds to completion (Fig. 1A, trace a) following an exponential decay (k = 2.3 s−1); in the presence of NO at different concentrations 2NO stock in dilute buffer or water was taken to be 2 mM from solubility; its final concentration drops with manipulations, due to contaminating O2, which is known to react with NO to generate NO2−, according to a complex mechanism with the following stoicheiometry (14Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12078-12084Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar): 4 NO + O2+ 2 H2O → 4 NO2−+ 4 H+. The rate law for this reaction is second order in NO and first order in O2, with a rate constant of k = 2.3 × 106M−2 s−1 (14Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12078-12084Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). from 30 to 250 μM the time course of cyt c oxidation becomes clearly biphasic, and total amplitude is progressively reduced. Cyt c2+ oxidized in the fast and slow phases is plotted in Fig. 1B, as a function of the NO/O2 ratio; as this ratio increases, the total cyt c oxidized decreases, indicating that inhibition depends on the NO/O2 ratio. Similar results (data not shown) were obtained by changing the [O2] at a constant [NO]. Analysis of Fig. 1, trace f, shows that the burst phase (k1 = 55 s−1) corresponds to ~1.5 electrons/cyt aa3 delivered to oxidase (with an apparent bimolecular rate constant of ~7 × 106M−1 s−1); An additional 1.5 electrons/cyt aa3 are delivered before the reaction stops.Fig. IView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At an intermediate NO concentration (45 μM; Fig. 1, trace c) the delay time in the first mixing was varied systematically from 10 ms to 30 min. No significant change in the time course was observed (data not shown), indicating that anaerobic preincubation of the oxidized enzyme with NO is irrelevant with respect to inhibition, which thus requires enzymatic turnover. When oxidase in air is mixed with an anaerobic solution of ascorbate and ruthenium hexamine containing NO, reduction of the enzyme will be associated with binding of either O2 or NO (if present) and eventually will lead to inhibition. 3Using deoxyhemoglobin as an NO indicator, we have shown that in the presence of ascorbate and ruthenium hexamine the NO concentration does not change for more than 1 h. On the other hand, addition of 50 mM dithionite to a 200 μM solution of NO in buffer destroys NO completely in much less than 50 s (in agreement with the literature, e.g. Ref. 15). When degassed, oxidized oxidase was mixed with a solution of NO preincubated with excess dithionite, the enzyme was initially reduced (t1/2, ~1 s) but thereafter and very slowly (many minutes to 0.5 h) converted to the nitrosylated derivative. These observations confirm that NO reacts with dithionite and that some product of this reaction (possibly NO2−), when incubated with dithionite-reduced oxidase, very slowly regenerates the nitrosylated enzyme (as already reported by Yonetani et al.; Ref. 16). Since inhibition was shown to be reversible (4Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 5Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), it is also expected that under excess O2 enzymatic activity will be restored. Fig. 2 shows the time courses and the relevant optical species detected under three experimental conditions. It may be seen that the initial species (the fully oxidized enzyme, Fig. 2, spectrum a) decays in approximately 0.1 s to a first intermediate (Fig. 2, spectrum b) characterized by a peak growing at 444 nm, indicating partial reduction of the hemes. The fate of this intermediate is different depending on experimental conditions: (i) in the absence of O2 and in the presence of NO (Fig. 2A, dotted line) a second relaxation (~0.2 s) yields a stable species (Fig. 2, spectrum c) with two maxima at 430 and 442 nm, typical of NO-bound fully reduced oxidase; (ii) in the absence of NO (Fig. 2A, dashed line) spectrum b shifts to a turnover intermediate (Fig. 2, spectrum d), characterized by a main peak around 428 nm; when O2 is exhausted, the enzyme becomes fully reduced (Fig. 2, spectrum e); and (iii) in the presence of both NO and O2, (Fig. 2A, solid line) spectrum b relaxes (~0.5 s) to the NO-bound, fully reduced form (spectrally identical to that seen in the absence of O2; Fig. 2, spectrum c); this NO complex, however, is not stable, and it is seen to decay (t1/2, ~50 s) to the turnover intermediate (Fig. 2, spectrum d, observed as the main species in the absence of NO). After oxygen exhaustion, the enzyme again becomes fully reduced, with spectral features identical to Fig. 2, spectrum e, observed in the absence of NO, showing that meanwhile NO has disappeared from solution by reaction with O2 (14Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12078-12084Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The relatively quick conversion of the NO derivative (Fig. 2, spectrum c) into the main turnover intermediate (Fig. 2, spectrum d) shows that, in the presence of excess O2, inhibition is reversed, and oxidase function is recovered. Mixing directly the NO-bound, reduced oxidase with an excess of O2 (Fig. 3A) the initial species decays into the turnover intermediate, following a biphasic time course (Fig. 3A, inset). SVD analysis shows that the fast phase (k = 0.13 s−1) corresponds to NO dissociation from, and coupled to oxidation of, cyt a3, whereas the slow phase (k = 0.02 s−1) mainly represents cyt a oxidation (Fig. 3B). Since the first rate constant is much greater than typical values reported for dissociation of NO from other reduced heme proteins (such as hemoglobin; Ref. 17), the question is whether NO is chemically modified by reaction with O2 while on the enzyme or whether it dissociates from the reduced binuclear center as such. Given that this question is crucial to our understanding of reversal of inhibition, and thus of the regulatory role of NO at the mitochondrial level, we have independently determined the rate constant for NO dissociation in the absence of O2 by a different experimental approach. This was determined by mixing under anaerobic conditions the NO derivative of reduced oxidase with excess deoxyhemoglobin in the presence of a small amount of dithionite. Hemoglobin (12 μM total heme) was in excess with respect to total NO (25 μM total heme) to efficiently trap any free NO as it dissociates from oxidase. The raw data are reported in Fig. 4 as absolute (Fig. 4A) and difference (Fig. 4B) spectra. Despite the unfavorable signal/noise ratio, SVD analysis allows us to sort out spectral species and their time courses. The most relevant optical component, occurring at k = 0.13 s−1 (Fig. 4C, dashed line), combines the spectral contributions of NO dissociation from reduced cyt a3 and NO binding to deoxyhemoglobin. Indeed, by subtracting from this deconvoluted difference spectrum the contribution of NO binding to reduced cyt a3 obtained independently (Fig. 4C, solid line), the resulting difference is similar to the optical transition characteristic of NO binding to hemoglobin (Fig. 4D). The bottom line of this experiment is that NO dissociates from reduced cyt a3 with the same rate constant (k = 0.13 s−1) both in the presence and in the absence of O2. Therefore, we conclude that reversal of NO inhibition does not demand some chemical reaction between O2 and bound NO but occurs via NO dissociation from the fully reduced cyt a3-CuB center. A possible mechanism to account for NO inhibition has been tested by computer simulations. The redox states of the cyt a3-CuB binuclear center involved in this model are shown in Fig. 5; each of these represents several substates, because cyt a and CuA, although included in the simulation as a two-electron acceptor site, are not indicated in the scheme. The main features of this model are: (i) the appearance of reduced CuB or cyt a3 occurs at k1 = 15 s−1, independent of the redox state of the other metals; (ii) CuB and cyt a3 are in fast redox equilibrium (k2 = 1 × 103 s−1 and k−2 = 1 × 105 s−1), CuB having a higher redox potential, as inferred from flash photolysis studies (18Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11860-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); (iii) the reduced cyt a3·NO complex is characterized by a combination rate constant of k4 = 4 × 107M−1 s−1 (8Gibson Q.H. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and a dissociation rate constant of k−4 = 0.13 s−1, independent of the redox state of the other metals; (iv) O2 binds to the reduced cyt a3-CuB binuclear center with a rate constant of k3 = 2 × 108M−1 s−1 and to reduced CuB with the same combination rate constant but very low affinity (Keq = 1 × 102/7 × 103M−1; see Refs. 6Blackmore R.S. Greenwood C. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19245-19249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 19Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3079-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); and (v) the oxidation of the partially reduced cyt a3-CuB site (with bound oxygen), proceeding at K0, is rate-limited by the transfer of the second electron to this site; thus this rate approximates the rate of the internal electron transfer (k0≈ k1). As proposed by Torres et al. (11Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), crucial to this mechanism is the difference in reactivity of O2 and NO with the half-reduced states of the binuclear center. Nevertheless, in that article (11Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) they proposed that of the two possible half-reduced species of the binuclear center, reduced CuB is the preferential NO binding metal, whereas we propose that reduced cyt a3 is the target (see below). Using the model of Fig. 5, we were able to simulate (Fig. 6) the fast onset of inhibition of oxidase activity, the high inhibitory effect, and the competition between O2 and NO seen in pre-steady-state and steady-state experiments. It is noteworthy that in steady-state experiments, simulation predicts half-inhibition at an O2/NO ratio of ~30, to be compared with the value of ~40 experimentally determined by Torres et al. (11Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The onset of inhibition of cyt c oxidase by NO was time resolved by double mixing stopped flow experiments carried out using cyt c2+ as the electron donor. At the highest NO concentrations, the onset of inhibition is complete within the first turnover. The onset of inhibition was sensitive to the NO/O2 ratio, a finding consistent with the dependence of inhibition on [O2] (5Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 20Takehara Y. Kanno T. Yoshioka T. Inoue M. Utsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed that incubation (up to 30 min) of the oxidized anaerobic enzyme with NO has no effect on the onset of inhibition. This finding suggests that even if binding to oxidized CuB had occurred, it would be irrelevant with respect to inhibition. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy shows (Fig. 2) that the inhibited state of the enzyme is the fully reduced NO derivative of cyt a3, in agreement with Torres et al. (11Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The inhibition was found to be reversible. The nitrosyl derivative generated during the first second(s) decays to a fully active turnover intermediate, optically indistinguishable from the one generated at steady state in the absence of NO (see Fig. 2B). After oxygen is exhausted, the enzyme becomes fully reduced, showing that over the same period NO has run out of solution, because of the reaction with free oxygen (14Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12078-12084Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Our observations account for the recovery of respiration observed by others (5Brown G.C. Cooper C.E.

Biophys. 1995; 323: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) in the presence of O2, based on experiments in the time range of minutes. The rate at which NO is displaced by O2 from the cyt a32+-NO adduct (with recovery of function) was found to be equal to the rate of NO dissociation in the absence of O2 (k = 0.13 s−1); the latter was determined by mixing the nitrosyl derivative of oxidase with excess deoxyhemoglobin (used as a NO scavenger). This finding seems to exclude that O2 reacts with NO while bound to reduced cyt a3 and indicates that recovery of activity occurs via NO dissociation, driven by removal of free NO from the bulk. The measured rate constant for NO dissociation is faster than expected based on comparison with other heme proteins; for example, the rate constant for NO dissociation from hemoglobin R state is 10−3/10−4 s−1 (17Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands: Frontiers in Biology. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). This unexpected finding poses some problem of interpretation. The structure of the binuclear cyt a3-CuB center, now known at atomic resolution from crystallography (21Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar, 22Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomikazi T. Yamaguchi H. Shinwaza-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), unfortunately provides no clue to explain this observation. A possible role of Tyr244 on subunit I in providing H bonding to bound NO may be envisaged but cannot be assessed at this point. Since the rate constants for O2 and NO binding to reduced oxidase are similar (kon = 2 × 108 and 4 × 107M−1 s−1, respectively), a scheme involving a simple kinetic competition between O2 and NO for the fully reduced cyt a3-CuB center cannot explain both the rapid onset of inhibition and the competition between the two gases. Therefore, Torres et al. (11Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) postulated the existence of a turnover intermediate with an affinity for NO much higher than that for O2; our results support and extend this hypothesis. We have simulated the onset of inhibition of cyt c2+ oxidation and the O2/NO competition under turnover conditions, using the kinetic scheme shown in Fig. 5; this scheme accounts for the observations and describes successfully the O2/NO competition, which, together with the high inhibitory efficiency of NO, is a particularly compelling feature of the experimental data. In particular, simulation of O2 consumption under steady-state conditions shows that half-inhibition is achieved at an O2/NO ratio of ~30, consistently with the findings of Torres et al. (11Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, we believe that inhibition by NO depends crucially on the rapid and tight binding of NO to reduced cyt a3 and not to reduced CuB in the half reduced binuclear center, as reported by Torres et al. (11Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In fact, since binding of O2 to reduced CuB has been reported to have very low affinity (6Blackmore R.S. Greenwood C. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19245-19249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3079-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), direct competition of NO for this reduced metal would not account for both the high inhibitory effect and the observed competition. Brown and Cooper (5Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), working on brain synaptosomes, reported that in the presence of 30 μM O2 the oxidase activity was half-inhibited at 60 nM NO. Thus, the apparent KI for NO estimated here is about 10-fold higher than that determined by Brown and Cooper (5Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) yet compatible with the NO concentrations determined with different stimulated tissues (0.1-5 μM; see Ref. 23). The origin of this discrepancy, if real, remains to be understood. In conclusion, we provide new evidence that, because of its peculiar reactivity with a partially reduced cyt a3-CuB binuclear center, NO is a potent but reversible inhibitor of oxidase. Thus our data support the view that oxidase inhibition by NO may occur in tissues even under physiological conditions. Indeed, during cellular stress and depending on the relative concentrations of NO and O2, the presence of NO may lead in the extreme to serious cellular damage and onset of pathology. We are particularly grateful to Dr. Eric Henry for stimulating discussions about the kinetic model and its simulations."

The latter, which contains two epidermal growth factor-like domains, binds the receptor tyrosine kinase p185neu, suggesting that the complex is bifunctional as well as heterodimeric. Immunoblot analyses using monoclonal antibodies prepared against the complex demonstrate high levels of expression in rat lactating mammary gland and colon.

Immunoblot analyses using a COOH-terminal-specific polyclonal antibody indicate that the soluble form of ASGP-2 is missing its COOH-terminal domains.

Chem. 1980; 255: 783-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complex, which is encoded on a single gene (3Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contains a highly glycosylated mucin subunit, ASGP-1, that is tightly, but noncovalently, linked to the membrane via the transmembrane glycoprotein ASGP-2 (4Carraway K.L. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar, 5Carraway K.L. Fregien N. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 1995; 7: 31-44Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis studies showed that it is synthesized as a large (≈300 kDa) polypeptide precursor that is cleaved to the two subunits early in its transit to the cell surface (6Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mucin ASGP-1 consists of a polypeptide of ≈220 kDa bearing a heterogeneous collection of O-linked, sialic acid-rich oligosaccharides (7Hull S.R. Laine R.A. Kaizu T. Rodriguez I. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4866-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the metastasis (8Steck P.A. Nicolson G.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 147: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and resistance to killing by natural killer cells (9Moriarty J. Skelly C.M. Bharathan S. Moody C.E. Sherblom A.P.

The complex is particularly interesting because of the structure of the transmembrane subunit ASGP-2, which appears to have functional activities other than linking the mucin to the membrane (4Carraway K.L. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar). ASGP-2 contains an 80-kDa polypeptide with ≈17 N-linked oligosaccharides (10Hull S.R. Sheng Z. Vanderpuye O.A. David C. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning and sequencing identified seven domains of ASGP-2 (11Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): two N-glycosylated hydrophilic domains, two EGF-like sequences (EGF-1 and EGF-2), a non-EGF-like cysteine-rich domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. The presence of the EGF-like domains in these highly proliferative 13762 cells suggested the possibility of an autocrine growth factor-like activity associated with ASGP-2 (4Carraway K.L. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, both EGF-1 and EGF-2 contain all of the consensus residues found in EGF-like sequences of proteins known to possess growth factor activity (11Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using an insect cell expression system, ASGP-2 has been shown to bind to the extracellular domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase p185neu when the two proteins are co-expressed. 2K. L. Carraway III, E. A. Rossi, M. E. Carvajal, P. M. Guy, D. Lorenzo, L. C. Cantley, R. A. Cerione, N. L. Fregien, C. A. C. Carraway, and K. L. Carraway, submitted for publication. ASGP-2 and p185neu are both present in plasma membranes of 13762 ascites cells (12Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Li Y. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5582-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can be co-immunoprecipitated from solubilized membranes from these cells.2 This ability of ASGP-2 to act as a receptor ligand, plus the presence of the mucin subunit, suggests that that the sialomucin complex is bifunctional as well as heterodimeric and may have important roles in tissues in which it is expressed. In an effort to understand the physiological functions and identify potential target tissues of ASGP-2, we have screened a variety of rat tissues for the expression of ASGP-2 using mAbs elicited by immunization with SMC. ASGP-2 expression was found to be particularly abundant in lactating mammary gland and colon. In contrast to its cell surface expression in the ascites tumor cells, ASGP-2 is a secreted product in mammary gland and colon. Immunological and biochemical analyses demonstrated both membrane-associated and soluble forms in both mammary gland and milk but only a soluble form in the colon. The soluble form arises due to the absence of its COOH-terminal domains. Surprisingly, the membrane form of ASGP-2 fractionates differently from alkaline phosphatase of the milk fat globule membrane, suggesting that its distribution in milk fractions may be different from that of other known membrane-associated milk proteins. The MAT-B1 and MAT-C1 ascites sublines of the 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma were maintained by weekly passage as described previously (13Carraway K.L. Doss R.C. Huggins J.W. Chesnut R.W. Carraway C.A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). SMC used for immunizations and immunoblot analyses (10Hull S.R. Sheng Z. Vanderpuye O.A. David C. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and microvilli used as a positive control for immunoblot analyses (14Carraway C.A.C. Cerra R.F. Bell P.B. Carraway K.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were prepared from MAT-C1 ascites cells as described previously. Female Balb/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 50 μg of SMC emulsified in 250 μl of PBS and 250 μl of TitreMax Adjuvant (Vaxcel, Inc., Norcross, GA). On days 14 and 28 post-immunization, mice were injected with the same emulsion. The mouse with the best titre by ELISA was given a final injection in the tail vein with 50 μg of SMC in 100 μl of PBS on day 50. On the third day after the final injection, activated splenocytes were isolated and fused with p3×63Ag8 myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580), using the procedures outlined by Harlow and Lane (15Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 150-210Google Scholar). For splenocyte isolation the spleen was aseptically dissected, and the splenocytes were teased out into 50 ml of PBS using a cell sieve dissociator (Sigma) and washed twice with PBS. The splenocytes were mixed with 4 × 108 p3×63Ag8 myeloma cells, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Polyethylene glycol 1500 (1 ml of 50%) was slowly added to the combined cell pellet at 37°C. Following a 3-min incubation at 37°C, the polyethylene glycol cell suspension was slowly diluted with PBS at 37°C over 15 min to 50 ml. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200 ml of HAT medium (20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5% p388D1 conditioned medium, 100 μM hypoxanthine, 400 nM aminopterin, 16 μM thymidine). The p388D1-conditioned medium was prepared from a confluent culture of p388D1 cells (ATCC, TIB 63) in Hybrimax HY medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and stimulated with 5 μg/ml Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide for 2 days. The hybridomas were plated at 100 μl/well into twenty 96-well tissue culture plates that were fed with HAT (100 μl/well) after 7 days. On day 9 post-fusion, the hybridomas were screened by ELISA for production of anti-SMC antibodies. From each tissue culture well, 50 μl of conditioned medium was transferred to corresponding wells of ELISA plates that were coated with SMC at 1 μg/well. Anti-SMC antibodies were detected with a goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Optical densities (405 nm) of greater than 0.1 after 60 min of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate development were graded as positive. Tissue culture conditioned medium from ELISA-positive cultures was screened by immunoblotting to determine protein specificity. SMC (150 ng/lane) was electrophoresed on 7% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with a 1:10 dilution of conditioned medium and then probed with goat anti-mouse-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL. Hybridomas secreting ASGP-1- or ASGP-2-specific antibodies were cloned by limiting dilution. Cells were diluted to 3 cells/ml and plated (100 μl/well) into 96-well tissue culture plates. After 8 days, clones were screened by anti-SMC ELISA, and those yielding the strongest signal were expanded. Female BALB/c mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 0.5 ml of pristane (Sigma) to prime the peritoneum for ascites hybridoma growth. After 7-10 days, primed mice were inoculated with 106 cloned hybridoma cells. mAb-rich ascites fluid was harvested after 8-12 days. CΔ683, which deletes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of ASGP-2, was expressed as a secreted glycoprotein in High 5 insect cells (Invitrogen) by baculovirus infection. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplimer that contained the coding sequence for the entire extracellular domain of ASGP-2 was made by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription of MAT-C1 RNA. This sequence was cloned into the Acgp67 transfer vector (Pharmingin) in frame with the coding sequence for the gp67 signal peptide to induce secretion of the recombinant ASGP-2 product. SF-9 insect cells were co-transfected with this vector and Baculogold DNA (Pharmingin) to generate ASGP-2-expressing baculovirus by homologous recombination at the polH locus. The truncated recombinant ASGP-2 was expressed in and harvested from High 5 insect cell culture conditioned medium. NΔ53 was expressed as a transmembrane glycoprotein in MCF-7 stable transfectants. ASGP-2 sequence from a cDNA clone, which lacks 159 bases from the 5′ end of the ASGP-2 coding sequence, was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA I (Invitrogen) in frame with the cathepsin D signal sequence to generate the pcDNAI/C12M construct. This construct encoded an ASGP-2 glycoprotein that was truncated by 53 amino acid residues from the amino terminus. Stable transfectants were generated by transfection of MCF-7 cells with this construct using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The truncated recombinant ASGP-2 was present in cell lysates but not conditioned medium. NΔ53-CΔ683 was expressed transiently as a secreted glycoprotein in COS-7 cells. The construct pcDNA3/C12S was made by the deletion of 135 bases at the 3′ end of the ASGP-2 coding sequence from the pcDNAI/C12M construct (above) followed by subcloning into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). In addition to the pre-existing amino-terminal truncation, this deletion results in a 45-amino acid residue carboxyl-terminal deletion that removes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and allows secretion of the glycoprotein. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/C12S using LipofectAMINE. The recombinant double deletion mutant was harvested from tissue culture-conditioned medium. Anti-ASGP-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitations has been described previously (6Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mAb to an undetermined frog T-cell antigen, which does not cross-react with rat and was used as a control for nonspecific immunofluorescence, was kindly provided by Dr. Martin Flajnick (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). The anti-C-pep antibody is a rabbit polyclonal antibody that was raised against a synthetic peptide (NH2-CSMNKFSYPDSEL-COOH) from the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ASGP-2, amino acids 714-728. The peptide synthesis and antibody production were performed by Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc. SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions using 6% polyacrylamide gels and the mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, which were subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20. Following a 1-h incubation in primary antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20, the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega) diluted 1:14,000. The signal was detected with the Renaissance Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (DuPont NEN). Anti-ASGP-2 and anti-C-pep immunoprecipitations were performed with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma) and 20 μl of antiserum. Anti-ASGP-1 immunoprecipitations were conducted with 20 μl of anti-IgM agarose (Sigma) and 20 μl of ascites fluid. All immunoprecipitations were rotated overnight at 4°C and washed a minimum of six times (10-20 min) in the appropriate buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Ascites 13762 MAT-B1 cells (1 × 108) were washed three times with PBS and incubated in prelabeling medium (Cys- and Met-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum) for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were metabolically labeled with 2 mCi of [35S]Cys/Met in 9 ml of prelabeling medium for 10 min at 37°C. After washing with prelabeling medium, one half of the cells was immediately prepared for immunoprecipitation, whereas the other half was incubated at 37°C for 80 min in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum before preparation for immunoprecipitation. For each sample, cells were boiled for 1 min in 2 ml of 2% SDS. Lysates were homogenized with a 23-gauge needle and syringe and diluted with 10 ml of 2.5% Triton X-100, 6 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 kallikrein-inactivating unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin (all protease inhibitors from Sigma). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, and 1.5-ml aliquots were immunoprecipitated with nonimmune rabbit serum, anti-ASGP-2 polyclonal anti-serum, anti-ASGP-1 mAb 11C5, anti-ASGP-1 mAb 15H5, or nonimmune mouse IgM. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times (10-20 min) with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, 5 mM EDTA and then boiled in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Mammary gland was dissected from post-partum Fischer 344 rats and fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde/PBS for 3 h at 4°C and then incubated overnight in 0.6 M sucrose. Samples were frozen in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. embedding compound (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN) with liquid N2-cooled isopentane. 4-μm frozen cross-sections were prepared with a cryostat and mounted on microscope slides. Mounted slides were treated with acetone for 10 min at 4°C and then washed twice for 10 min with PBS. All of the following steps were performed at room temperature with incubations in a humidified chamber using 100 μl of solution. The sections were incubated with 50 mM glycine in PBS for 20 min to quench reactive para-formaldehyde, rinsed, and then blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 20 min. Rinsed sections were incubated with primary antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (globulin-free)/PBS for 60 min. Following a rinse and three 15-min PBS washes, the sections were incubated for 45 min with biotinylated goat anti-mouse whole IgG (preadsorbed against rat serum, Sigma) diluted 1:100 in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. After a rinse and three 15-min washes, the sections were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of extravidin/TRITC (Sigma) for 30 min. Coverslips were applied with Gel/Mount signal saver after a rinse and three 15-min washes. Colon tissue was dissected from adult Fischer 344 female rats. Some rats were treated with either scopolamine or carbachol (Sigma) by intraperitoneal injection of 20 μg of the drug 5 min prior to sacrifice. Colon samples were fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde/PBS for 3 h at 4°C followed by an overnight incubation in 0.6 M sucrose. All samples were frozen in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. embedding compound with liquid N2-cooled isopentane. 4-μm frozen cross-sections were prepared with a cryostat and mounted on microscope slides. Mounted slides were treated with acetone for 10 min at 4°C and then washed twice for 10 min with PBS. All of following steps for immunoperoxidase staining were performed at room temperature, with incubations in a humidified chamber using 100 μl of solution, unless otherwise stated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was reduced by incubating in 1% H2O2 in MeOH. The slides were rinsed and washed twice for 10 min in PBS, then incubated for 30 min in 10% NGS/PBS. Following two 5-min washes, the samples were incubated with primary antibody diluted in 3% NGS/PBS overnight at 4°C. The samples were rinsed and then washed three times for 10 min. The sections were incubated with a 1:300 dilution of a goat anti-mouse IgG-horse radish peroxidase conjugate (Promega) diluted in 3% NGS/PBS for 60 min. Following a rinse and three 10-min washes, the sections were incubated with Stable DAB (Research Genetics, Huntsville AL) substrate solution for 15 min. The sections were counterstained with 0.1% hematoxylin for 2 min and 0.1% eosin for 1 min. Finally, the sections were dehydrated with ethanol and coverslips were applied with glycerin. Tissues dissected from female Fischer 344 rats were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid N2 and stored as a powder at −80°C. Fresh rat whole milk was diluted 1:4 with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (containing protease inhibitors: 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 kallikrein-inactivating unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin) and homogenized with a 23-gauge needle and syringe. The diluted serum was isolated from the cream and insoluble material following centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g and 4°C. For immunoblotting, tissue powders were solubilized directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and milk sera were diluted 1:2 in 2 × sample buffer. For quantitation of total protein, powders were solubilized in 0.5% SDS, boiled, and then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined by A280 from reconstituted trichloroacetic acid precipitates of the cleared SDS lysates. Protein concentrations of MAT-B1 cell lysates and milk sera were determined similarly. For immunoprecipitations, powdered tissue was solubilized in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and homogenized with a probe sonicator. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Immunoprecipitates were washed with high salt (0.5 M LiCl) in RIPA buffer. For cellular fractionation, powders were homogenized in a hypotonic lysis buffer (0.5 mM EDTA, 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 kallikrein-inactivating unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin) using a probe sonicator. The homogenates were brought to 5% sucrose and fractionated by consecutive centrifugations at 600 × g for 10 min, 12,000 × g for 30 min, and 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellets of each centrifugation and the 100,000 × g supernatant fluid were analyzed by anti-ASGP-2 immunoblotting. The pellets were diluted to the volume from which they were pelleted and 2.5 μl of each sample was analyzed. For velocity sedimentation analysis, the supernatant fluid of the 100,000 × g centrifugation (100S) was loaded onto a 5-20% sucrose gradient in PBS and centrifuged in a SW 40 rotor for 16 h at 23,000 RPM and 4°C. An equivalent (100S) sample was brought to 0.5% Triton X-100 and loaded onto a similar gradient that contained 0.1% Triton X-100. Each gradient was collected in 13 × 1-ml fractions from the bottom, and 5 μl of each sample was analyzed by anti-ASGP-2 immunoblotting. Alkaline phosphatase activity in milk and lactating mammary fractions was measured with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. Fractions were diluted 1:5000 in substrate solution (1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 M diethanolamine, pH 9.8) and A405 readings were taken after a 30-min incubation at room temperature. Lactoperoxidase activity in mammary fractions was measured using 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] (ABTS) as a substrate. Fractions were diluted 1:5000 in ABTS solution (Boehringer Mannheim), and A405 readings were taken after a 10-min incubation at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated from ascites 13762 MAT-C1 cells or lactating mammary gland using TRI REAGENT™ (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), and 1 μg was reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) following the supplier's suggested protocol. The polymerase chain reaction was performed in a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research, Inc.) with 1/5 of the cDNA using Taq™ polymerase (Promega) with 25 cycles (1 min at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C). PCR primer names and sequences are as follows: SL20 (5′-CCTCTCCAACAAGTGCAGTG-3′); KL20 (5′-CAGAACCATTCCTGTCCTGT-3′); SR20 (5′-CGCATGTCCAAGTTCTCTAG-3′); CtR20 (5′-GGAGAACTTGTTCATGGAGC-3′); and CR20 (5′-GTATTCTAGGTGCAGCTGCC-3′). PCR reactions were conducted with three primer sets: set X used primers SL20 and SR20; set Y used primers KL20 and CtR20; and set Z used primers KL20 and CR20. mAbs specific for ASGP-1 and ASGP-2 were produced to assess their expression and localization in normal tissues and tumors. Spleen cells from mice immunized with SMC (ASGP-1/ASGP-2) were fused to myeloma cells, and the resulting hybridomas were screened for anti-SMC antibodies by ELISA. Of the 1920 wells into which the fusion mixture was plated, approximately 1500 contained viable colonies after 1 week of selective growth in HAT medium, and 315 wells produced conditioned medium that yielded A405 values >0.1 in the ELISA. Conditioned medium from the 48 wells yielding the highest signals (A405 > 0.300) were screened by immunoblot analysis. Of these, 30 mAbs specifically recognized ASGP-2 and nine mAbs stained ASGP-1. Ascites fluids generated from 10 of the anti-ASGP-2-secreting hybridomas were assayed by immunoblot analysis using purified SMC and three recombinant ASGP-2 deletion mutants to generate a gross epitope map (Fig. 1). The three deletion mutants were CΔ683, which is missing the COOH-terminal 45 amino acids containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains; NΔ53, which is missing the NH2-terminal 53 amino acids; and NΔ53-CΔ683, which is missing both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains. Fig. 1A shows immunoblots with one mAb (4F12) of five that recognized only full-length ASGP-2 and CΔ683. This staining pattern suggests that these five mAbs are specific for epitopes that are located within the 53 amino acid residues of the NH2 terminus of ASGP-2. Fig. 1B shows immunoblots of one mAb (13C4) of five that recognized all of the three deletion mutants, suggesting specificity for an epitope located between amino acid residues 53 and 683. None of the mAbs tested showed specificity for the COOH-terminal 43 amino acids. The isotype of each of the 10 anti-ASGP-2 mAbs was determined to be IgG1 using an isotyping kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Four anti-ASGP-1 mAbs (15H5, 11C5, 9D6, and 2E6) are IgMs, and anti-ASGP-1 mAb 15H10 is an IgG1. All of the hybridomas express kappa light chains. As shown for 11C5 in Fig. 2A, the anti-ASGP-1 mAbs specifically bind to a very high Mr band in immunoblots of 13762 MAT-B1 whole cell lysates. To verify that the anti-ASGP-1 antibodies are reacting with ASGP-1, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments on ascites lysates with both anti-ASGP-2 and anti-ASGP-1 antibodies. A band co-migrating with ASGP-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-ASGP-2 (Fig. 2B), and ASGP-2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-ASGP-1 (Fig. 2C). Because ASGP-1 is a mucin that contains large amounts of O-linked carbohydrates, the epitopes for the anti-ASGP-1 antibodies could contain carbohydrate. The nature of the epitope was investigated by pulse-chase analysis. Biosynthesis of ASGP-1 and ASGP-2 proceeds through high Mr precursor forms pSMC-1 and pSMC-2, which are not significantly O-glycosylated (6Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These precursors are recognized by polyclonal anti-ASGP-2 (6Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but should not be recognized by antibodies whose epitopes contain O-linked carbohydrate. In contrast, antibodies against O-linked carbohydrate epitopes should recognize mature, glycosylated ASGP-1, but not precursor. Anti-ASGP-2 monoclonal antibodies, of course, should recognize the precursors and mature ASGP-2 but not ASGP-1. For these experiments ascites 13762 MAT-B1 cells were metabolically pulse-chase labeled with [35S]Met + [35S]Cys in vitro and lysed with SDS after a 10-min pulse or a 10-min pulse and an 80-min chase. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ASGP-1 mAbs or anti-ASGP-2 polyclonal antibody. As pre"

We propose that this conformational change makes the branch point pairing sequence of U2 RNA accessible for pairing with the intron allowing formation of the pre-spliceosome. Splicing of introns in nuclear pre-mRNA takes place in a complex structure, the spliceosome, which is assembled de novo for each splicing event. Once assembled, the spliceosome catalyzes two sequential trans-esterification reactions that remove the intron from the pre-mRNA and ligates the exons. In the first reaction, the 2′-OH of a particular adenosine residue near the 3′ splice site attacks the phosphodiester bond at the 5′ splice site giving the intermediates in the reaction, exon 1, and the lariat intron, exon 2, a branched structure in which the 5′-nucleotide is connected to the branch point adenosine via a 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond. In the second reaction, the 3′-OH of exon 1 attacks the phosphodiester bond at the 3′ splice site, resulting in the formation of the spliced mRNA product and releasing the intron in lariat form (1Green M.J.

The group II self-splicing introns are spliced by an identical pathway, leading to the principal tenets of this field that pre-mRNA splicing is an RNA-catalyzed reaction and that the two processes share a distant evolutionary ancestor (4Weiner A. Cell. 1993; 72: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The spliceosome contains five ribonucleoprotein particles, snRNPs, 1The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoprotein(s)ntnucleotide(s)PEGpolyethylene glycolDTTdithiothreitolFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiseIF-4aeukaryotic translation initiation factorNTAnitrilotriacetic acid. called U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 and is assembled stepwise in a dynamic process in which the pre-mRNA and the snRNAs undergo a series of base pairing interactions resulting finally in the catalytically competent structure, presumably a structure sharing common chemical and catalytic features with the group II self-splicing introns. The process of spliceosome assembly is quite different from the other complex ribonucleoprotein machine with which it can be compared, the ribosome (5Noller H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The ribosome can self-assemble from pure RNA and protein components in vitro without the requirement for ATP hydrolysis or trans-acting proteins.

Yeast genetic studies of proteins absolutely required for pre-mRNA splicing has thus far revealed only one source of the ATP requirement in spliceosome assembly. The proteins Prp2, Prp5, Prp16, Prp22, and Prp28 are all members of a superfamily defined by the first member of the family, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-4a (6Schmid S.R.

These proteins share a number of sequence motifs including a characteristic ATP binding site which includes the sequence DEAD, giving rise to one name for the family, the DEAD box proteins (12Linder P. Lasko P.F. Ashburner M. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Schnier J. Slonimski P.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). DEAD box proteins are ubiquitous in nature. They have been found in all three major lines of descent, the bacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes and usually in multiple copies. There are at least five in Escherichia coli. A recent data base search of the almost completed yeast genome found at least 66 DEAD- or DEAH-related genes, and extrapolating from the completed 2% of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome sequence there are probably at least 100 in higher eukaryotes. Biochemical studies of the DEAD box proteins almost invariably reveal that they are RNA-dependent ATPases, and in a few cases they have been shown to be RNA helicases, that is they can separate the strands of double-helical RNA in an ATP-dependent reaction so they have also been called RNA helicases (13Ray B.K. Lawson T.G. Kramer J.C. Cladaras M.H. Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Merrick W.C. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7651-7658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rozen F. Edery I.

However, the latter reaction cannot be demonstrated for most of the proteins, so a safer term for the DEAD box proteins required for pre-mRNA splicing might be “spliceosomal ATPases.” Studies on the role of the spliceosomal ATPases in assembly suggest that each ATP-dependent step might be mediated by a single family member. The formation of the pre-spliceosome, an early intermediate in the pathway containing only the U1 and U2 snRNPs, requires Prp5 and the consecutive steps at the end of the pathway; activation of the spliceosome, activation of the second step, and release of the products require in order Prp2, Prp16, and Prp22, all members of a subclass of this family which share, instead of DEAD, a DEAH sequence and which are homologous over an additional 300 amino acids at their C termini (9Burgess S. Couto J.R. Guthrie C. Cell. 1990; 60: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Company M. Arenas J. Abelson J.

Lin R.-J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). What reaction could these proteins be catalyzing in the spliceosome assembly? The assembly pathway is punctuated by a series of RNA rearrangement that could better be understood as strand displacement reactions or structural isomerizations than helical disruptions (3Madhani H.D. Guthrie C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 28: 677-687Google Scholar). Thus a working hypothesis is that each structural isomerization is mediated by a specific spliceosomal ATPase. Clearly to understand exactly what these proteins are doing and how they do it must be a major objective for the study of pre-mRNA splicing, indeed for biochemistry since, as a class, these proteins are involved in a wide range of RNA-protein interactions. A possible reason why specific reactions have not been observed for any of the spliceosomal ATPases is that they work in combination with other proteins. eIF-4A has little if any helicase activity on its own, but in conjunction with eIF-4B, it has a weak but detectable helicase activity (13Ray B.K. Lawson T.G. Kramer J.C. Cladaras M.H. Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Merrick W.C. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7651-7658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, p68 has strong RNA helicase activity on its own (15Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It is possible that the spliceosomal ATPases act together with other proteins or act in the context of the snRNP or a spliceosome intermediate. In this regard, genetic studies suggest either a physical or functional interaction between Prp5 and three proteins, Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21, which have been shown by biochemical and genetic experiments to be tightly associated (19Brosi R. Groning K. Behrens S.-E. Luhrmann R. Kramer A. Science. 1993; 262: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Bennett M. Reed R.

Chapon C. Science. 1993; 262: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The genetic studies also suggest an interaction between Prp5 and U2 RNA (21Ruby S.W. Chang T.-H. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Wells S.E. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Yan D. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To understand how Prp5 functions, we have expressed the protein in E. coli and purified it to homogeneity. Like other spliceosomal ATPases Prp5 is an RNA-dependent ATPase, but unlike other members of this family it exhibits a weak but real specificity for U2 RNA, presumably its in vivo substrate. We also demonstrate an interesting ATP-dependent conformational change in the U2 RNA within the context of the snRNP. These studies are the basis for continuing efforts to understand just how and what Prp5 does to facilitate the formation of the pre-spliceosome. Pet 19 vector was purchased from Novagen. Isopropyl-1-thio-β–galactopyranoside was purchased from Calbiochem. Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen. Superose 12, Mono Q, and S FPLC columns were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Polyethyleneimine cellulose plates were from Brinkman. GeneClean was purchased from BIO101. A random priming kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. Analysis was performed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using Imagequant software. 4A, 5′-CTTGGTCACACACACATACGGCGCGGAAGGCGTGTTTGCTGAC-3′; 4B, 5′-GGAAACGTCAGCAAACACGCCTTCCGCGCCGTATGTGTGTGTGAC-3′; 5A, 5′-GTTTCCGAAAGGAACGGGTGGATCTTATAATTTTTGATTTATTTTAA-3′; 5B, 5′-AGCTTTAAAATAAAYCAAAAATTATAAGATCCACCCGTTCCTTTC-3′. An NdeI site was placed by site-directed mutagenesis in the 5′ end of the gene corresponding to the primary methionine. An NdeI-BamHI fragment was then placed into a NdeI-BamHI-cleaved pET19 vector supplied by Novagen. This plasmid contains 10 N-terminal histidines followed by the enterokinase cleavage site. The PRP5 gene was inserted immediately following this site starting with its terminal methionine. Other constructs were made containing the N-terminal flag peptide, but the pET 19 version was used for purification. The plasmid was transformed into a BL21-pLysS strain of E. coli. 10 liters of the transformed cells were grown to 40 klett units and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside. The cells were grown for an additional 4.5 h, harvested, washed, and resuspended in 50 MM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.75 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM Imidizole. The resuspended cells were lysed on ice by sonication for two 1-min bursts with a 1-min chill between bursts. The lysate was spun for 30 min to remove debris. The supernatant was cleared of nucleic acids by adding polyethyleneimine to 1% while stirring for 1/2 h. The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 42,000 rpm in a Ti50 rotor. The lysate was then loaded on a 2 ml of NTA metal chelating column. The lysate was loaded at 0.25 ml/min and washed with 10-column volumes of the loading buffer. Step elutions were carried out in 4 column volumes by increasing the imidizole to 40, 80, and then 200 mM. Prp5 mostly eluted in the 80 mM eluant as verified by immunoblot analysis. The 80 and 200 mM eluants were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and loaded on a Sepharose S (Pharmacia) FPLC column equilibrated in the same buffer. The proteins were eluted in a gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl. 250 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed. Fractions containing Prp5 were pooled and dialyzed in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. The protein was then loaded on a Mono Q (Pharmacia) FPLC column equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a gradient of 100 to 750 mM NaCl. Fractions were analyzed for ATPase activity and the presence of Prp5 by immunoblot analysis. Peak ATPase activity correlated with the peak of Prp5 protein. Total yield of protein was about 200 μg. prp5-1 and prp5-3 extracts were prepared as described (25Lin R.-J. Newman A.J. Cheng S.-C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14780-14792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were inactivated for 30 min at 37°C. Control extracts were incubated at room temperature. For RNA splicing reactions extract was diluted to 40% with buffer containing 3 mM ATP, 50 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.0, 2% PEG 8000, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 1 nM [32P]UTP-labeled actin, and Prp5 from 2 to 100 nM. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and extracted as described (25Lin R.-J. Newman A.J. Cheng S.-C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14780-14792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl of 1 μM Prp5 was loaded onto a Superose 12 column equilibrated in 100 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA. The void volume was determined by blue dextran, and standards were run separately to determine a standard curve for size determination. ATPase activity was determined as follows. RNAs from 50 to 500 nM were annealed in 60 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 4% PEG 8000, 2 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl in 10 μl. This solution was heated to 70°C for 5 min and snap-cooled on ice. 10 μl of buffer containing 7 mM MgCl2, 500 μM ATP, 1 mCi of [32P]ATP, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 nM Prp5 were added to start the assay. Reactions were incubated at 23°C, and 2-μl aliquots were taken every 5 min and spotted on a polyethyleneimine TLC plate. Plates were developed in 0.75 M LiCl, 1 M formic acid for 2 h, dried, and analyzed by PhosphorImager for the fraction of ATP hydrolyzed. T7 transcripts of U1, U2, U2Δ107, U4, U5, and U6 were made. U1ΔNC is an internal deletion of U1 created by a cleavage of the DNA template at the StyI and HindIII sites of the yeast U1 gene and religation with the four oligonucleotides, 4a 4b, 5a, and 5b. Oligonucleotides 4a and 5a constitute the coding strand. The sequence of U1ΔNC is similar to the biologically active U1 constructs prepared by Siliciano et al. (26Siliciano P.G. Kivens W.J. Guthrie C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6367-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Truncations of U2 were made by cutting the T7U2 plasmid at the BanI and EcoN1 sites. The 3′ end of U2, U2 3′ end, was created by PCR from nucleotide 126 of U2Δ107 (27Shuster E.O. Guthrie C. Cell. 1988; 55: 41-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to its 3′ end. This PCR product, also containing the T7 promoter, was then cloned and transcribed (see Fig. 5). Transcription reactions typically contained 50 μg of plasmid, 80 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 12 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NTPs in each, 40 nM DTT, 0.1 units of pyrophosphatase, and 1200 units of T7 RNA polymerase/ml. Reactions were carried out at 37°C for 4 h. Transcripts were loaded on a 4-mm 6-8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (20:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). The transcripts were visualized by UV shadowing, excised, eluted in 500 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.3, 10 mM EDTA. Eluants were filtered, extracted with 1:1 phenol/chloroform equilibrated in 0.2 M NaOAc, pH 5.3, extracted with chloroform, and precipitated twice. Concentrations were determined by optical density. Polyuridine obtained from Sigma was dissolved to 10 mg/ml in water. Samples were prepared at 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mM Na2CO3:NaHCO3, pH 9.2. The samples were incubated at 90°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of sodium acetate. A small sample was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase and then added to the reaction to visualize bands. Samples were loaded onto a 20% denaturing sequencing gel with several small labeled RNAs to calibrate the size. Bands were excised as 5-8-, 9-11-, 12-15-, 16-18-, 19-21-, 22-25-, 26-30-, 60-80-, 80-100-, and 100-120-mers. Longer pieces were similarly isolated by running the samples on an 8% gel. ATPase activity was assayed as described above except for the following alterations. 10 nM RNA was assayed in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 4% PEG 8000, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. ATP concentrations remained the same. Extracts were inactivated at 37°C for 30 min as described previously. Extracts were diluted in splicing buffer with or without the presence of 10 nM Prp5. The Sru2 oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 29-43 of U2 RNA was added to 220 nM to start the reaction. The RnaseH is endogenous to the extract (28McPheeters D.S. Fabrizio P. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2124-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Assays were incubated at 30°C for the indicated amount of time. In the same manner oligonucleotide d1 was added for RNaseH probing of U6 RNA as described by Fabrizio et al. (29Fabrizio P. McPheeters P.S. Abelson J.

The gel was blotted onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen) in 25 mM K2HPO4, pH 6.5, overnight at 25 V. The blot was cross-linked, washed in water, and pre-hybridized in 1 × HYB (100 mM PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, 1 M NaCl), 1% SDS, 100 (μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) at 65°C for 2 h. Random primed probes (Boehringer Mannheim) were prepared using as template excised fragments of U1, U2, U4, and U6 DNA purified on glassmilk or GeneClean (BIO-101). A random primed probe was added to the blot and incubated overnight at 65°C. The blot was washed once in 1/2 × HYB 1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. The blot was washed two more times in 1/2 × HYB at 65°C and autoradiographed. Previously Dalbadie-McFarland and Abelson (8Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4236-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) reported the sequence of PRP5 gene clones from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Utilizing the cloned gene, we constructed vectors for expression of Prp5 in E. coli and yeast. Fig. 1A shows an SDS-PAGE of histidine-tagged Prp5 expressed in E. coli and purified by chromatography on Ni-NTA, Sepharose S, and Mono Q as described under “Materials and Methods.” Expression levels for Prp5 protein were consistently low under a variety of growth conditions. However, we were able to purify significant quantities of the protein using affinity tagged constructs (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis of Prp5 produced in E. coli using anti-Prp5 sera revealed multiple sized polypeptides and very little full-length protein (data not shown). Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of PRP5 indicated that several sites within the gene could be prokaryotic translation start sites. Probably the Prp5 fragments represent initiation at internal sites because when Prp5, N-terminally tagged with the flag peptide, was expressed only full-length protein was detected by the anti-flag antibody. Prp5 protein was overexpressed in 10 liters of LB broth. Cells were lysed by sonication; the nucleic acids precipitated by polyethyleneimine, and the debris removed with a high speed spin. The extract was passed over a Ni-NTA column in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer. Attempts to purify protein at a higher pH or with Tris buffer resulted in very low recovery. The histidine tag may have been only partially accessible to the affinity ligand. The pI of Prp5 is approximately neutral, and this was exploited by successive chromatographic separations on Sepharose S at pH 6.5 and Mono Q at 8.0. Analyses of the pooled fractions from the different column separations by SDS-PAGE are shown in Fig. 1A. The purified protein was stored at −70°C. Storage at −20% in 50% glycerol as well as freezing and thawing of the protein resulted in partial loss of activity. Purified Prp5 was assayed for the ability to reconstitute the splicing activity of heat-inactivated yeast extracts from the prp5-1 mutant strain. As seen in Fig. 1B, the splicing activity on the prp5-1 extract was evident but poor before heat treatment. Incubation at 37°C abolished all activity. Addition of increasing concentrations of purified Prp5 to the heat-treated extract resulted in increasing levels of splicing activity. Recombinant Prp5 can reconstitute splicing activity at concentrations as low as 2 nM, but splicing activity is enhanced at higher concentrations (Fig. 1B). Purified Prp5 also reconstituted splicing activity of heat-treated extracts from the prp5-3 mutant strain (data not shown). Purified His-tagged Prp5 expressed in yeast was equally as active as the E. coli expressed protein (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that purified Prp5 contains all of the activities required to complement extracts in which the protein has been inactivated. The native molecular weight of Prp5 was determined by size exclusion chromatography. A Superose 4B column was calibrated, and Prp5 was loaded in 100 mM NaCl to determine its multimeric state. Although Prp5 had some tendencies to aggregate during the purification procedure, size exclusion chromatography detected a protein of about 100 kDa, the approximate size of Prp5. Although more experiments would have to be done to determine whether or not Prp5 functions as a dimer as do many DNA helicases (30Geider K. Hoffmann-Berling H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31Lohman T.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), in the absence of substrate it is primarily a monomer. Most members of the DEAD family of proteins are RNA-dependent ATPases. On its own, purified Prp5 showed virtually no ATPase activity. However, in the presence of RNA homopolymers, significant levels of ATPase activity were seen with the purified protein. Analysis of several different nucleic acid homopolymers indicated that poly(rU) and poly(rI) were best able to stimulate activity. In general the activity of poly(rI) is greater than or equal to poly(rU) > poly(rA) > poly(rC) (Fig. 2). This activity is relative since the average size of the homopolymers was not controlled. Deoxyribonucleic acids were not active (data not shown). Activity stimulated by poly(U,G) was found to be similar to poly(U). Using size-fractionated rU homopolymers, we investigated the size dependence of the RNA stimulatory activity. Polyuridine was partially base-hydrolyzed, and polymers of defined lengths were isolated. At saturating levels of RNA, Prp5 had virtually no ATPase activity until the polymer length was approximately 25-30 nt, and maximum activity was observed at about 100 nt (see Fig. 3). Longer polymer mixtures (~800 nt average length) did not stimulate the ATPase activity to a greater extent than the 100-nt polymer (data not shown). Apparently the optimum binding site is about 100 nt in length.Fig. 3ATPase activity of recombinant Prp5 using various length uridine polymers.

The sizes of these snRNAs are extremely variable; therefore, to facilitate our analysis we utilized truncated versions of the U1 and U2 snRNAs, U1ΔNC and U2Δ107, respectively, to make RNAs of similar lengths. The U1ΔNC clone is similar in size to mammalian U1 and to a similar deletion studied by Siliciano et al. (26Siliciano P.G. Kivens W.J. Guthrie C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6367-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and found to be active in vivo. U2Δ107 is a truncation of the yeast U2 RNA which is also active in vivo (27Shuster E.O. Guthrie C. Cell. 1988; 55: 41-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Of the five snRNAs tested, U2Δ107 exhibited the highest ATPase stimulatory activity (Fig. 4A). The U5 snRNA showed a level of stimulation similar to the 100-nt poly(rU) fragment. A comparison of the RNAs tested and their apparent Km and kcat values are tabulated in Table I. As seen in Fig. 4 and in Table I, U2 is about 2.5 times better in overall specificity as compared with the next best substrate, U5. When Km and kcat values were calculated, it was found that U5 bound slightly tighter, but had a 4-fold lower kcat. Similarly poly(U100) has a similar Km but has a 4-fold lower Vmax. The activities of the other snRNAs were too low to determine with any reliability.Table I.Prp5 substratesRNALengthKmVmaxkcat/KmntnMμmol ATP/min literU2Δ1072834382.565.8U1ΔNC223NAaNA, activity too low to be determined.NA<0.43U52672670.602.25U4161NANA<0.43U6113NANA<0.43pU (25-30)25-30NANA<0.43pU (80-100)80-1006440.731.14a NA, activity too low to be determined. Open table in a new tab Although U1ΔNC-stimulated ATPase activity above background, ATPase activity did not increase linearly with substrate (Fig. 4, A and B). It is possible that this RNA is saturating at low concentration but has very little activity. However, in competition experiments (not shown) U1ΔNC RNA was not an effective competitor of U2 RNA in the RNA-dependent ATPase reaction. The experiments shown in Fig. 4 and Table I were repeated a number of times, and although the absolute value for Km/kcat varied as much as 2-fold from experiment to experiment the ranking of RNAs in activity remained the same. U2 RNA always was most effective in stimulating the ATPase activity. To identify specific regions of the U2 snRNA responsible for stimulation of Prp5 ATPase activity, we assayed several U2 deletions for activity. Two 3′ deletions and one 5′ deletion were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” A diagram of these RNAs as well as the full-length U2 snRNA (U2FL) are shown in Fig. 5. ATPase assays with Prp5 and the various U2 RNAs were performed, and the kinetic parameters Km and kcat were determined if possible for each RNA (Table II). Both U2Δ107 and U2FL had similar Km values; the full-length having a 2-3-fold larger kcat than U2Δ107 and almost 7-fold greater specificity than the next best substrate, U5. With the U2Ban deletion, the kcat lowered at least 10-fold, and no activity was seen with U2EcoN1. These values agree with the activity of these U2 variants in the reconstitution assay (28McPheeters D.S. Fabrizio P. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2124-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Full-length U2 is best able to reconstitute activity but U2Δ107 can also reconstitute activity to at least 50% of wild type. U2Ban has both a low reconstitution activity and a low ATPase stimulatory activity. EcoN1 and the 3′ end fragment were inactive in both assays. Thus a good correlation can be made between splicing activity and ATPase activity, but we were unable to delineate a specific region of U2 that interacts with Prp5 to activate the ATPase.Table II.U2 RNA variantsRNALengthKmVmaxkcat/KmntnMμmol ATP/min literU2Δ1072834382.565.8U2FL11775748.6915U2Ban1251840.080.43U2EcoN178NAaNA, activity too low to be determined.NA<0.43U23end159NANA<0.43a NA, activity too low to be determined.

N-Acetylhexosaminidases are distributed throughout nature, from bacteria to man, and have been studied for many decades (1Walker P.G. Balazs E.A. Jeanloz R.W. The Amino Sugars.

In general, the β-GlcNAcidases hydrolyze β-glycosides of GlcNAc and GalNAc, are not specific for the aglycon group although they prefer aryl substituents, and exhibit optimal activity between pH 4 and 6. The latter observation is expected, since many of these enzymes are of lysosomal origin. However, several bacterial enzymes have been reported that also show acid pH optima. Many β-GlcNAcidases have been cloned and/or purified and, as indicated under “Results” and “Discussion,” these include the genes and gene products from several marine Vibrios (3Soto-Gil R.W.

This report is concerned with a second periplasmic enzyme, a β-GlcNAcidase designated ExoI to distinguish it from other β-GlcNAcidases produced by this organism. Although the enzyme can hydrolyze (GlcNAc)n, 2Chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)n (n = 2-6), are β-1,4-linked oligomers of GlcNAc. Glycosides are indicated by combinations of abbreviations, such as PNP-GlcNAc; unless otherwise indicated the anomeric configuration is β. n = 2-6, our studies suggest that (GlcNAc)2 is not significantly hydrolyzed under physiological conditions. Thus, the periplasmic β-GlcNAcidase is not a chitobiase in the usual sense. The unique properties of this enzyme are essential for the proper function and regulation of the chitin catabolic cascade, as explained in detail under “Discussion.” The following chemicals, reagents and materials were purchased from the indicated sources: chitin, GlcNAc, and PNP-glycosides from Sigma; chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)n, n = 2-6, Seikagaku America, Inc. (Rockville, MD); MUF-GlcNAc and MUF-(GlcNAc)2 from Calbiochem; reagents for bacterial media from Difco and J.T. Baker; HEPES from Research Organics Inc. (Cleveland, OH). Reagents for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Life Technologies, Inc., Stratagene, and Boehringer Mannheim. Radioisotopes were purchased from DuPont NEN. Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride and nitrocellulose transfer membranes were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Other buffers and reagents were of the highest purity available commercially. N-Acetylglucosamine was determined by the Morgan-Elson method (10Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vols. I-III, and supplements, John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared by electroblotting the proteins from the SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Samples for N-terminal amino acid sequence determination were electroblotted onto Millipore Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were then stained for protein using Coomassie Blue and the desired protein band on the membrane subjected to sequence analysis. N-terminal analysis of the purified β-GlcNAcidase was performed by Dr. Tomas Kempe, PNA Laboratory, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, College Park. The N terminus was determined with the Edman (15Edman P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1949; 22: 475PubMed Google Scholar) method using an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer. The phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were analyzed on a model 120A amino acid analyzer. Strain SR1514 was grown at 30°C in minimal-lactate medium (16Yu C. Lee A.M. Bassler B.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24260-24267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing HEPES/Cl−-buffered 50% artificial sea water (lactate-50% ASW medium). The cells were induced to express ExoI by adding 0.6 mM (GlcNAc)2 (7Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inocula were grown overnight in LMB broth (10 g of Bacto-tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 20 g of NaCl/liter), diluted 1:50 into the lactate-50% ASW medium with or without 0.6 mM (GlcNAc)2, and grown to mid-exponential phase. The β-GlcNAcidase gene, exoI, cloned into pBR322 as a ClaI 4.5-kb insert (7Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained two internal NcoI sites separated by 0.8 kb. The 0.8-kb fragment was deleted from the insert by digesting the plasmid with NcoI followed by ligation of the residual plasmid DNA. Finally, the 3.7-kb insert was isolated by treating the plasmid with ClaI, “blunt-ended” by filling in the overhanging ends of the fragment with Klenow polymerase, and purified by gel electrophoresis. This fragment was inserted into the IPTG-inducible overexpression vector pVex (17Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 61-63Google Scholar). Since pVex does not contain a ClaI site in its muliple cloning site, the vector was digested with SmaI, which produces blunt ends, followed by treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase to reduce the probability of regenerating the plasmid during ligation. The 3.7-kb V. furnissii DNA fragment was then ligated into pVex, transformed into E. coli HB101, and single colony purified. Two orientations of the exoI gene were expected in the vector, and indeed two plasmids were isolated from different clones. The plasmids were characterized by restriction mapping with NcoI and BamHI (pVex contains the BamHI and the Vibrio insert contains the NcoI site). One of the plasmids, designated pVex:exoI3.7, contained the insert in the desired orientation with respect to the T7 promoter. The HB101-transformed cells harboring pVex:exoI3.7 produced 40 times more enzyme than did the pBR322:exoI transformants. It should be emphasized, however, that significant quantities of enzyme were also produced by cells harboring pVex:exoI3.7 in the opposite orientation, indicating that the V. furnissii DNA fragment carries its own promoter. Maximal quantities of the enzyme were obtained as follows. (a) The plasmid was used to transform E. coli BL21 cells, which contains a genomic copy of the T7 polymerase gene under lac promoter control. IPTG is used to induce T7 polymerase production, which then stimulates transcription from the T7 promoter on the pVex plasmids (17Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 61-63Google Scholar). (b) IPTG induction of the T7 polymerase dramatically reduces growth of the cells. Therefore, the cells were grown for various periods of time in LB medium containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml, and induced for 2 h with 1 mM IPTG. Cell density had little effect on the specific activity of the induced enzyme, and therefore the cells were grown to late exponential phase prior to induction. (c) The effect of induction time by 1 mM IPTG was studied, and maximum expression of ExoI was obtained at 2 h. Double-stranded DNA prepared from the recombinant clone pVex:exoI3.7 was sequenced by the dideoxy method using a Sequenase V2.0 sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. (18Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar, 19U. S. Biochemical Corp., (1993) Protocols for DNA Sequencing with Sequenase (V 2.0) T 7 DNA Polymerase, 7th Ed., U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH.Google Scholar). The analyses of DNA and amino acid sequences were conducted with the GCG sequence analysis package (Version 7, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The data bases used for nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities searches (using FASTA) were: GenBank™ Release 79, and Swiss Protein Release 26. Predicted amino acid sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W version 1.5; similarities were shown by shading using BOXSHADE/DOS 2.7, kindly performed by Michael Cleveland. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared in Pasteurella free rabbits. Preimmune sera showed no reaction on Western blots with the purified β-GlcNAcidase, or with crude extracts of E. coli and V. furnissii. The rabbit was subdermally immunized according to the following schedule: (a) 100 μg of pure β-GlcNAcidase (0.5 ml) mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (1.5 ml); (b) after 15 days, 50 μg of β-GlcNAcidase (0.25 ml) mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (1.75 ml); and (c) after 15 days, 25 μg of β-GlcNAcidase (0.125 ml) in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (1.85 ml). Ten days after the last injection, the rabbit was bled and the immune sera analyzed for reactivity with the β-GlcNAcidase. The IgG fraction of the antibody sera was purified by affinity chromatography on a Bioprobe International, Inc. Avidgel-F Protein A column using the manufacturer's recommended procedure. To study the subcellular distribution of the enzyme in V. furnissii, the cells were ruptured in a French pressure cell, the soluble and thoroughly washed membrane fractions isolated, and Western blots obtained as described (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vols. I-III, and supplements, John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar), using the IgG fraction at 1:1000 dilution and horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel Organon Teknika, Durham, NC). Enzyme activity was detected in colonies growing on agar plates by use of methylumbelliferone-GlcNac (MUF-GlcNAc). Colonies were lifted onto sterile Whatman No. 1 paper, which was then sprayed with 0.6 mM MUF-GlcNAc in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The paper was incubated at 37°C for 10-20 min and subsequently sprayed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution to enhance the fluorescence of the hydrolysis product, MUF. Colonies expressing the β-GlcNAcidase gene product glowed bright blue when illuminated under UV light. Two quantitative enzyme assays were used when PNP-GlcNAc was the substrate, and a third (Morgan-Elson) assay when the natural oligosaccharides were the substrates. Cell extracts or protein fractions were incubated at 37°C for 5-20 min in 100 μl volumes containing the following: 0.66 mM PNP-GlcNAc, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl. The reaction was quenched with 3 ml of 1 M Tris base, pH 11, and the absorbance was measured at 400 nm. An extinction coefficient of 18,300 (M× cm)−1 was used to calculate p-nitrophenol produced per minute. Product formation was proportional to time of incubation and the quantity of protein used in the assay. No hydrolysis of PNP-GlcNAc was detected in the controls, containing boiled extracts of E. coli or V. furnissii. Hydrolysis of PNP-GlcNAc was quantitated by continuously monitoring the rate of PNP formation at A400 using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3 spectrophotometer and R-100A recorder. The temperature was maintained at 37°C with a Lauda circulator. Reactions were initiated by adding protein fractions or purified protein (2-5 μl) to 500 μl of the assay mixture described above. The rate of PNP formation (nmol/min/μg of enzyme) was determined using an extinction coefficient experimentally determined in the incubation buffer. Initial rates of PNP formation were proportional to protein concentration, and no detectable hydrolysis of the substrate was observed with the controls described above. One important control consisted of extracts of E. coli transformed with the pVex vector with no Vibrio DNA insert. When the substrates consisted of GlcNAc-terminated oligomers, such as the chitin oligosaccharides, the product of hydrolysis, GlcNAc, was determined by the Morgan-Elson assay (10Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Morgan W. Elson L. Biochem. J. 1934; 28: 988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, incubation mixtures contained 0.1-10 mM chitin oligosaccharides in the indicated buffers, and reactions were initiated by adding 0.01-0.1 μg of purified enzyme to the substrates at 37°C. Aliquots (0.1 ml) were taken at the indicated times, and the samples heated at 100°C to stop the reactions. GlcNAc was determined by adding 0.1 ml of 0.8 M sodium borate, pH 9.2, heated at 100°C for 12 min, cooled to room temperature, and treated with 550 ml of freshly prepared, diluted Ehrlich reagent (10 g of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 90 ml of glacial acetic acid, 10 ml of concentrated HCl, diluted 1:10 in acetic acid before use). After 20 min at 37°C, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and after 15 min the absorbance was determined at 585 nm. The effects of these parameters on activity were studied with the purified enzyme at 37°C. The discontinuous assays were used with 330 μM PNP-GlcNAc or 1 mM chitin oligosaccharide and the following buffer systems: McIlvaine's sodium phosphate-citric acid broad-range buffer from pH 2.0-8.6, Bates' and Bowers' boric acid-KCl buffer (ranging from 8.0-10.0), sodium phosphate, Tris-HCl, Bis-Tris-HCl, and Hepes-NaOH (20Perrin D.D. Dempsey B. Buffers for pH and Metal Ion Control. Chapman and Hall, London1987: 128-156Google Scholar). Where possible, overlapping pH ranges were used with different buffers. At the same pH values, essentially the same rates were obtained with different buffers. Reactions were initiated by adding 0.01-0.1 μg of purified enzyme, and initial rates were plotted against pH provided that they were constant with time of incubation and proportional to protein concentration. The effect of ionic strength on enzyme activity was determined as follows. A solution containing 330 μM PNP-GlcNAc in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was mixed with the same solution containing 2 M NaCl or 2 M KCl, giving final salt concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0 M. Reactions were started by adding 0.01-0.1 μg of purified protein, and PNP formation was followed by the continuous spectrophotometric assay. The temperature optimum and thermostability of the β-GlcNAcidase were investigated using PNP-GlcNAc as substrate, and the discontinuous spectrophotometric assay. The temperature optimum was determined by incubating reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, and 330 μM substrate PNP-GlcNAc over a temperature range from 0°C to 75°C. Reaction mixtures were preincubated at the desired temperatures before adding 0.01-0.1 μg (1-5 μl) of purified protein. The stability of the enzymes was measured by adding enzyme (0.01-0.1 μg) to 250 μl of buffer without substrate, incubating at the desired temperature for 15 min, cooling to room temperature, and maintaining the solution at room temperature for 5 min before assay by the continuous spectrophotometric method at 37°C. Three 6-liter flasks containing 2 liters each of LB medium (10 g of Bacto-tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl/liter) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with 40 ml each of an overnight culture of E. coli strain BL21 harboring the plasmid pVex:exoI. The cultures were shaken vigorously at 37°C until an A600 = 1.0 was attained, after which IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the cultures returned to the shaker incubator for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifuging at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. All remaining steps were conducted at 0-4°C unless otherwise stated. The cell pellet was washed with 3 liters and then with 1 liters of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The final cell pellet (10 g wet weight) was resuspended in 40 ml of the buffer without NaCl and disrupted by passage (two to three times) through a Wabash French press. Unlysed cells, as well as some cell debris, were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. To precipitate nucleic acids, streptomycin sulfate (160 μl of a 10% stock/ml of crude extract) was added dropwise with stirring at 4°C. The mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min and centrifuged at 235,000 × g for 60 min. Adding more streptomycin sulfate did not give any detectable precipitate. Proteins in the streptomycin sulfate-treated supernatant (55 ml at 25 mg/ml) were precipitated by the dropwise addition of saturated ammonium sulfate (22 ml) to a final concentration of 30% of saturation. The solution was stirred for 1 h and centrifuged at 235,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was treated with 110 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate (to 70% saturation) and the mixture stirred for 12 h before the pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 235,000 × g for 1 h. The 30-70% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in approximately 20 ml of 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol and extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. The 30-70% ammonium sulfate fraction was transferred to a 30-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column that had been equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. After placing the sample on the column, it was washed with 90 ml of the same buffer. A gradient was then applied to elute the column; the linear gradient consisted of 0.01-0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer, 300 ml total volume. The activity eluted as a sharp peak between 0.25 and 0.30 M NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 ml in an Amicon concentrator with a Millipore PTTK membrane (30,000 molecular weight cutoff). Buffer without salt was added to bring the sample to 50 ml, and the sample was reconcentrated. A 1.8 × 85-cm gel filtration ACA-34 column was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl. The active pool from Step 4 was placed on the column in two batches, and the column was eluted with the Tris/NaCl solution. The active peaks from the two runs were combined and concentrated to 1.0 ml as described above. The pooled sample from Step 5 was transferred to a Bio-Rad (7.5 × 75 mm) Bio-Gel TSK-DEAE-5-PW HPLC column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM EDTA. The column was eluted at room temperature with 10 ml of the same buffer, followed by a 0-0.4 M NaCl gradient in the buffer (0.5-ml fractions). Purified β-GlcNAcidase eluted at 0.3 M NaCl. Purity was monitored throughout the fractionation by SDS-PAGE and enzyme activity. The buffer and salt in the purified enzyme were exchanged with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 M NaCl, using an Amicon Centriprep (10,000 molecular weight cut-off). The purified enzyme was stored in small aliquots at −70°C, and under these conditions was stable for at least 6 months. The gene exoI, which encodes the β-GlcNAcidase ExoI, was subcloned from the original isolate (7Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the overexpression vector pVex, and the enzyme purified from the transformed cells. A summary of the purification procedure is given in Table I. The enzyme was isolated in about 22% yield and purified about 40-fold to apparent homogeneity. The estimated molecular weight from SDS-PAGE was 70 kDa. Preliminary experiments with gel filtration columns suggest that the enzyme may dimerize (data not shown). ExoI is stable both at room temperature and 37°C for at least 24 h.Table I.Purification of recombinant β-GlcNAcidaseStepTotal proteinTotal activityaPNP-GlcNAc hydrolyzed (μmol/min) in the continuous spectrophotometric assay.Specific activitybPNP-GlcNAc hydrolyzed, μmol/min · mg protein.Purification factormgunitsunits/mg-fold1.

Open table in a new tab The effect of ionic strength on enzymatic activity was measured at the optimum pH (see below) and in the NaCl and KCl concentration ranges: 0-2.0 M. Activity was maximal over a broad range, 0.05-0.5 M salt; the enzyme retained 80% of its activity at 1 M, and 50% of its activity at 2 M salt. Thus, ExoI would be fully active in the periplasmic space of the organism, regardless of extreme variations in salinity found in estuarine and marine waters. Sea water also contains significant concentrations of divalent cations, especially Mg2+ and Ca2+. However, the enzyme retained >90% of its activity in 1-10 mM EDTA/EGTA. The effects of Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+ were examined in reaction mixtures containing 0.0-5.0 mM concentrations of these cations. Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ had no effect on enzyme activity up to 5.0 mM; however, 1 mM Hg2+ (330 μM PNP-GlcNAc) inhibited β-GlcNAcidase activity by 50%, and only 10% of the enzyme activity remained at 5 mM Hg2+. The enzyme may contain sensitive -SH groups. The optimum temperature and the thermal stability of the β-GlcNAcidase activity at pH 7.5 was studied as described under “Methods.” The temperature optimum for assay was 35-40°C, and the β-GlcNAcidase was stable for at least 15 min from 4-42°C. Above 42°C, however, the enzyme decreased in stability until a 15-min incubation at 65°C resulted in complete loss of activity. The effect of pH on activity was studied by the continuous spectrophotometric assay with PNP-GlcNAc as substrate, and by the Morgan-Elson discontinuous method with (GlcNAc)n, n = 2-6, as the substrates. With PNP-GlcNAc, the pH was varied from 2.5 to 12, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. The pH optimum was between 7.0 and 8.0, but the range was broad. The enzyme exhibited about 50% of its activity at pH 6.0 and 9.0. The enzyme also exhibited full activity at pH 7.5 after preincubation for 15 min at 25°C in the pH range 5.5-9.5. The most intriguing and potentiallly important results were obtained in pH studies with the natural substrates, (GlcNAc)n, n = 2-6. The data are shown in Fig. 2. With the tri- through hexasaccharides, a broad peak was observed with an optimum close to pH 7. At the pH of sea water, 8.0-8.3, the enzyme exhibits 50-60% of maximal activity. With the disaccharide, however, quite different results were obtained. Again the peak was relatively broad, but the optimum was now pH 5.8, 1.2 pH units below the optimum for (GlcNAc)n, n = 3-6. At the present time, there is no obvious explanation for these results. At pH 8.0-8.3, the rate of hydrolysis of the disaccharide is not detectable. The potential physiological implications of this phenomenon are considered below. Kinetic constants were determined at pH 7.5 (the pH of the growth medium) for all substrates tested except (GlcNAc)2. The dependence of the β-GlcNAcidase activity on substrate concentration was measured by the continuous spectrophotometric assay with two artificial substrates, PNP-GlcNAc and PNP-GalNAc. Km and Vmax values were calculated from Woolf-Augustinson (v versus v/[S]) plots, and are given in Table II. PNP-GlcNAc is the more effective substrate, with about half the Km and 3 times the Vmax of PNP-GalNAc.Table II.Kinetic data for the β-GlcNAcidase ExoISubstrateKmVmaxmMμmol/min/mgPNP-GlcNAc0.090270PNP-GalNAc0.33130(GlcNAc)2aKm and Vmax values determined at pH 6.0.1.753.6(GlcNAc)30.83335(GlcNAc)40.78376(GlcNAc)53.7365(GlcNAc)63.5376a Km and Vmax values determined at pH 6.0. Open table in a new tab The Km and Vmax for the natural oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)n, n = 2-6, are also shown in Table II. The Km values for these oligosaccharides are 10-40-fold greater than the Km for the artificial substrate. However, the Vmax values for (GlcNAc)n, n = 3-6, are about 30% higher than the Vmax for PNP-GlcNAc. For reasons discussed in the Introduction, we were particularly interested in the kinetic constants for (GlcNAc)2. At pH 5.8, the Km for the disaccharide was in the same range as the other oligosaccharides, but the Vmax was 6-7-fold lower. As indicated under “Discussion,” the natural environment for marine organisms is generally above pH 7.5. At pH 8.0-8.3, the pH of sea water, (GlcNAc)2 hydrolysis was so low as to be questionable. At pH 7.5, a slow hydrolysis appeared to take place, but it was not reproducible from one experiment to another, did not remain constant sufficiently long to obtain an initia"

Immunological detection of phospholamban phosphorylation sites showed that the isoproterenol concentration-dependent increase in phospholamban phosphorylation was due to increases in phosphorylation of both Ser16 and Thr17 residues. When isoproterenol concentration was increased at extremely low Ca2+ supply to the myocardium, phosphorylation of Thr17 was virtually absent. Under these conditions, 32P incorporation into phospholamban, due to Ser16, decreased by 50%. Changes in Ca2+ supply to the myocardium either at constant β-adrenergic stimulation or in the presence of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, exclusively modified Thr17 phosphorylation. Changes in phospholamban phosphorylation due to either Ser16 and/or Thr17 were paralleled by changes in myocardial relaxation. The results indicate that cAMP- (Ser16) and Ca2+-calmodulin (Thr17)-dependent pathways of phospholamban phosphorylation can occur independently of each other. However, in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation, phosphorylation of Thr17 could only be detected after simultaneous activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and inactivation of phosphatase.

The marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii can utilize chitin as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen; the cascade involves several signal transduction processes and a multitude of proteins (1Yu C.

These cells also rapidly catabolize GlcNAc and soluble chitin oligosaccharides, and the rate of GlcNAc utilization is comparable to that for the optimal rate of glucose catabolism by Escherichia coli. The enzymatic hydrolysis of chitin has been studied for almost a century (5Tracy M.V. Rev. Pure Appl. Chem. 1957; 7: 1-14Google Scholar). In 1939, Zechmeister and Toth (6Zechmeister L. Toth G.

Despite the extensive literature, the enzymes described here and in the accompanying paper, a chitodextrinase (EndoI) and a β-GlcNAcidase1 (ExoI) respectively, exhibit unique properties that are essential for functioning of the chitin catabolic cascade in V. furnissii.

(Rockville, MD); MUF-GlcNAc and MUF-(GlcNAc)2 were from Calbiochem; reagents for bacterial media were from Difco and J.T. Baker; HEPES was from Research Organics Inc. (Cleveland, OH). Reagents for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Life Technologies, Inc., Stratagene, and Boehringer Mannheim. Radioisotopes were purchased from DuPont NEN. Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride and nitrocellulose transfer membranes were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Other buffers and reagents were of the highest purity available commercially. The structural gene that encodes the chitinase produced by Aeromonas hydrophila has been cloned into E. coli (21Roffey P.E. Pemberton J.M. Curr. Microbiol. 1990; 21: 329-337Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the transformant was kindly made available to us by Dr. J. M. Pemberton. We thank Dr. C.

[3H]Acetyl-labeled chitin was prepared as follows. Commercial chitosan was completely deacetylated by fusion with KOH (23Horowitz S.T. Roseman S. Blumenthal H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 5046-5049Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the chitosan reacetylated with 3H-labeled acetic anhydride (24Roseman S. Daffner I. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1743-1746Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Cabib E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 424-426Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the latter step, the solution is vigorously stirred, and as the chitin is formed it yields very fine particles, close to a colloidal dispersion that makes a good substrate for chitinases (25Cabib E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 424-426Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that there is extensive degradation of the polymer during the preparation, especially in the KOH treatment, producing, we believe, a highly polydisperse population of molecules with respect to chain length. Commercial E. coli strains HB101, BL21, and XL-Blue were stored as frozen cultures in LB. Typically, strains were grown overnight in LB media (plus appropriate antibiotics where indicated) with vigorous shaking. Fresh medium was inoculated with cells from the overnight culture at a 1:50 dilution, and this culture was grown to the desired density, usually mid-exponential (OD660 = 0.3-0.4). Protein concentrations were measured by the SDS-Lowry method (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or, alternatively, by the Bio-Rad protein assay, which involves the binding of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 to proteins (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Preparation and analysis of DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digests, ligation, and transformations were performed using standard techniques (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar, 29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

For DNA sequence analysis, the 6.1-kb HindIII insert containing the chitodextrinase gene in pBR322 (3Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into two single-strand producing phagemids, the pBluescript SK+ and SK− vectors and sequenced from these constructs (30Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar, 31U. S. Biochemical Corp., (1993) Protocols for DNA Sequencing with Sequenase (V 2.0) T 7 DNA Polymerase, 7th Ed., U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH.Google Scholar). The 6.1-kb insert was further subcloned to 3.6 kb using HindIII and AvaI. The analyses of DNA and amino acid sequences were conducted with the GCG sequence analysis package (Version 7, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The data bases used for nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities searches (using FASTA) were: GenBank™ Release 79 and Swiss Protein Release 26. Predicted amino acid sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W version 1.5; similarities were shown by shading using BOXSHADE/DOS 2.7, kindly performed by Michael Cleveland. Enzyme activity was qualitatively determined from colonies growing on agar plates by use of the synthetic analogue, MUF-(GlcNAc)2, which, when hydrolyzed, yields a fluorescent product, 4-methylumbelliferone. Colonies were lifted onto sterile Whatman No. 1 paper, which was then sprayed with 0.6 mM MUF-(GlcNAc)2 in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The paper was incubated at 37°C for 10-20 min and subsequently sprayed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution in order to enhance the fluorescence yield. Colonies expressing the chitodextrinase gene product glowed bright blue when illuminated under a UV source. The fraction to be assayed was adjusted to 100 μl with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and mixed with 100 μl of the same buffer containing 50 mM NaCl and the substrate, 0.66 mM PNP-(GlcNAc)2. Incubations were conducted at 25°C or 37°C, depending on the activity, for periods of 5-20 min. The reaction was quenched with 3 ml of 1 M Tris base, pH 11, and absorbance measured at 400 nm. An extinction coefficient of 18,300 (M× cm)−1 was used to calculate p-nitrophenol produced/min. Rates were constant with time of incubation and proportional to the quantity of enzyme assayed. No hydrolysis of substrate was observed with boiled enzyme controls. Hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate PNP-(GlcNAc)2 was quantitated by continuously monitoring the rate of PNP formation at A400. Temperature was maintained at 37°C with a Lauda circulator. Unless otherwise specified, reactions were initiated by adding protein fractions or purified protein (2-5 μl) to 1-cm path length cuvettes containing: 0.66 mM PNP-(GlcNAc)2 in 0.5 ml of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 0.1 M NaCl. The reaction rate remained constant for at least 15 min and was proportional to protein concentration. The rate of PNP formation (nmol/min/μg of enzyme) was calculated using the extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenol experimentally determined in the phosphate-NaCl assay buffer. A discontinuous assay was used for determining the kinetics of hydrolysis of chitin oligosaccharides by the chitodextrinase. Standard reaction mixtures contained the following components in 0.1 ml:0.05-1.0 mM of one of the oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)n, n = 2-6, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 0.1 M NaCl. The reactions were initiated by adding enzyme; boiled or no enzyme incubations served as controls. After incubating for 1-10 min at 37°C, the mixtures were heated at 100°C for 10 min, centrifuged (12,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatants analyzed by HPLC. The conditions were selected so that less than 10% of the substrate was hydrolyzed, and the reaction rate was proportional to the quantity of protein added and constant with time of incubation. The products of hydrolysis were assayed by modifying the published procedure (3Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for separating the oligosaccharides on HPLC. GlcNAc and chitin oligomers ranging from GlcNAc to (GlcNAc)6 could be separated and quantified using an ISCO model 2350 HPLC system with a TosoHaas Amide 80 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm) and a Hewlett Packard 3390A Integrator. A guard column with a Thomson TSK guard gel Amide 80 cartridge was also used. The solvent system consisted of either 65% or 70% acetonitrile:water, using a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with no washing of the column between injections. At 65% acetonitrile each (GlcNAc)n oligomer eluted as a split peak that probably represented partial separation of the α and β anomers. At 70% acetonitrile the chitin oligomers eluted as single peaks. Oligosaccharides were detected at A205 using an ISCO V4 Variable Wavelength Absorbance Detector. Retention time for the singlet peaks (min) were: GlcNAc = 6.65, (GlcNAc)2 = 7.78, (GlcNAc)3 = 9.09, (GlcNAc)4 = 10.73, (GlcNAc)5 = 12.61, and (GlcNAc)6 = 14.99. The following variables were studied with the homogeneous enzyme to determine optimal conditions for kinetic characterization. McIlvaine's sodium phosphate-citric acid broad-range buffer from pH 2.0-8.6, Bates' and Bowers' boric acid-KCl buffer (ranging from 8.0-10.0), sodium phosphate, Tris-HCl, Bis-Tris-HCl, and Hepes-NaOH were tested over the corresponding buffering ranges. The pH was measured before and after the hydrolysis reactions. The discontinuous spectrophotometric assay was used with PNP-(GlcNAc)2, and the HPLC method for the oligosaccharides. The effect of ionic strength on the purified recombinant V. furnissii chitodextrinase enzymes was determined using solutions of 330 μM PNP-(GlcNAc)2 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and in 10 mM Tris-HCl containing 2 M NaCl or 2 M KCl. The two solutions were mixed to give salt concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0 M. Assay reactions were started by adding 0.01-0.1 μg of purified protein and PNP formation was followed by the continuous spectrophotometric method. The temperature optimum and the thermostabilty of the chitodextrinase were investigated by incubating reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl, and 330 μM substrate (PNP-(GlcNAc)2) over the range 0°C to 75°C. Reaction mixtures were preincubated at the desired temperatures before 0.01-0.1 μg (1-5 μl) of purified protein were added. Activity was monitored by the discontinuous spectrophotometric assay. The thermostability of the enzymes was measured by preincubating the enzyme (0.01-0.1 μg) in 250 μl of buffer at the indicated temperature for 15 min. The reaction mixture was then allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min before it was added to a cuvette containing 0.25 ml of 660 μM substrate and the activity measured by the continuous spectrophotometric assay at 37°C. Protein samples were heated to 100°C for 5-10 min in Laemmli buffer (65 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, with 0.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue) unless otherwise noted. Samples were electrophoresed in a vertical 8-10% polyacrylamide slab gel, pH 8.0, with a 6% stacking gel, pH 6.8 (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vols. I-III and supplements, John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. The SDS-PAGE system was modified in order to resolve the two high molecular weight proteins in the purified chitodextrinase preparations described below. From 0.5 to 3.0 μg of purified protein/0.5-cm lane was used employing the same stacking gel, but with a 15-cm-long 5% resolving gel. Electrophoresis was continued for 1 h after the dye front had electroeluted (3 h total). After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked three times for 10 min each in a solution of 25% isopropanol, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by three identical washes in buffer alone. A 1% agarose overlay containing 660 μM MUF-(GlcNAc)2 in the phosphate buffer was then poured on top of the acrylamide gel. After 10 min, the fluorescent hydrolysis product was visualized using a UV illuminator. The two protein bands observed on the SDS gels were electroblotted to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After the transfer, the blot was lightly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the two bands were separately cut out, and the N-terminal sequence determined from the membrane fragments. The N-terminal analyses were performed by Dr. Wu-Schyong Liu (Dept. of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine) using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequencer. Two liters each of LB medium supplemented with 75 μg/ml ampicillin in two 6-liter flasks were inoculated with 120 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli strain BL21 harboring the plasmid pBR-ENDO. The culture was shaken vigorously at 37°C until A600 was about 3.0, and the cells harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The following steps in the purification were conducted at 0-4°C unless otherwise stated. The cell pellet was washed twice with 800 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA, resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA, using 4.0 ml of buffer/g (wet weight) of cells, and the cells disrupted by three passages through a Wabash French press. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated with a solution of streptomycin sulfate (160 μl of 10% stock/ml crude extract), which was added dropwise with stirring. The white precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 235,000 × g for 60 min and discarded. Saturated ammonium sulfate solution (120 ml) was added dropwise, with stirring at 4°C, to the streptomycin supernatant (50 ml) to a final concentration of 70%. After stirring for 12 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 235,000 × g for 1 h, the pellet resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05 mM DTT, and extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. The 70% ammonium sulfate fraction was transferred to a 30-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 90 ml of the Tris-EDTA-DTT buffer, followed by 150 ml of buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl. A gradient (300 ml) from 0.2 M NaCl to 1.0 M NaCl in the buffer was applied, 3.0-ml fractions collected, and a broad peak of activity detected between 0.45 and 0.75 M NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 ml on a Millipore filter (30,000 molecular weight cutoff). To remove most of the salt, buffer without salt was added to bring the sample to 50 ml, the sample was concentrated, and the process was repeated. The DEAE pool was transferred to a 30-ml hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with the Tris-DTT buffer (no EDTA). The column was washed with 90 ml of buffer containing 0.005 M MgCl2, followed by 150 ml of buffer with 1.0 M MgCl2. The 0.005 M MgCl2 removes basic proteins, and the 1.0 M MgCl2 elutes proteins with isoelectric points between 5.5 and 8.0 (32Gorbunoff M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The chitodextrinase activity was eluted with a 300-ml gradient of sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, from 0 to 50 mM PO4. The activity eluted between 20-40 mM phosphate. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated as described above, and the salt exchanged for the Tris-NaCl buffer used in the next step. An ACA-34 (2 × 83 cm) was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl. The pooled, concentrated fractions from Step 5 were transferred to the column, and eluted with the same buffer. The void volume of the column was ~80 ml, and the activity eluted between 80 and 100 ml. The active, pooled fractions were concentrated to 1 ml and transferred to an HPLC-DEAE column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, containing 0.1 M NaCl. The column consisted of a Bio-Gel TSK-DEAE 5-PW HPLC column (7.5 × 75 mm) and was eluted at room temperature with 10 ml of the buffer, followed by a linear gradient, 0.1 to 1.0 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.5. The active fractions eluted between 0.6-0.7 M NaCl. Throughout the fractionation, samples were assayed both for activity and by SDS-PAGE. The final preparations were stable for at least several months at −80°C. The enzyme was purified from E. coli BL21 harboring pBR-ENDO as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A summary of the results is given in Table I.Table I.Purification of recombinant β-chitodextrinaseStepTotal proteinTotal activityaPNP-(GlcNAc)2 hydrolyzed (μmol/min) in the continuous spectrophometric assay.Specific activitybPNP-(GlcNAc)2 hydrolyzed, μmol/min/mg protein.Purification factormgunitsunits/mg-fold1.

Open table in a new tab The chitodextrinase was purified about 460-fold from the crude extract in 15% yield. SDS-PAGE of the crude extract and the final product are shown in Fig. 1A. The HPLC fraction appeared to be homogeneous, with an Mr ~ 120,000 Da. When the lane contained 0.1-0.3 μg of protein instead of 3 μg as shown in Fig. 1A, it appeared that the single band might consist of a doublet. To clearly visualize the two protein bands, SDS-PAGE conditions were optimized for resolving high molecular weight proteins. A 5% resolving gel and longer electrophoresis time separated the proteins (Fig. 1C), and both bands exhibited chitodextrinase activity after they were renatured in the gel (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal sequences of each of the two protein bands on the SDS gels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first 21 amino acids of the higher molecular weight protein exhibited the following sequence: Ala-Val-Asp-Cys-Ser-Ala-Leu-Ala-Glu-Trp-Gln-Ser-Asp-Thr-Ile-Tyr-Thr-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gln. The first 9 amino acids of the lower molecular weight product displayed the same sequence: Ala-Val-Asp-Cys-Ser-Ala-Leu-Ala-Glu. Since the N termini of the two protein bands are identical, the most likely explanation for the slight difference in molecular sizes is a change at the C termini, perhaps because of proteolysis, but this possibility was not further investigated. The following parameters were systematically investigated using PNP-(GlcNAc)2 as the substrate for the enzyme: The activity remained relatively constant over the range 50-250 mM NaCl (pH 7.0), but decreased significantly below and above these concentrations. In KCl in place of NaCl, the activity decreased 10-30%. There was no apparent effect of many different buffering ions on the activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Enzyme activity was not affected by 5 mM EDTA or EGTA, nor by the addition of up to 5 mM Ca2+ or Zn2+. Mg2+ was slightly stimulatory, with a 20-25% increase in activity at 2 mM, and Hg2+ acted as a weak inhibitor, decreasing activity by 25% at 5 mM. These effects were measured in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.0. The optimum assay temperature was 35-37°C, and when the enzyme was pretreated for 15 min over the range 5-65°C, some activity was lost between 40-50°C, and the enzyme was completely inactivated at 52°C. As shown in the accompanying paper (20Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), there is a large shift in the pH optimum of the periplasmic β-GlcNAcidase when the substrate is (GlcNAc)2 compared to the other chitin oligosaccharides and the artificial substrate, PNP-GlcNAc. Furthermore, we believe that this shift is of great physiological significance because it permits the disaccharide to traverse the periplasmic space and act as an inducer for a variety of V. furnissii proteins. Thus, it was important to conduct similar studies with the periplasmic chitodextrinase. The effects of pH on the activity with the synthetic and natural substrates are shown in Fig. 2. Different buffering ions had little effect on the activity with the synthetic substrate, PNP-(GlcNAc)2, but this parameter could not be tested with the oligosaccharides. Hydrolysis of the oligosaccharides was followed by the HPLC procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the only suitable buffer for the column was phosphate; flow rates decreased significantly and nonreproducibly in the presence of the other buffers. For this reason, the pH range shown in the figure was covered by using phosphate buffer, adjusting the pH to the desired value with a glass electrode prior to adding the enzyme, and measuring the pH continuously during the reaction. In all cases, the pH optima were between pH 6.5 and 7.0. Furthermore, there are three potential cleavage sites in (GlcNAc)6; two would yield the disaccharide, and the third would give the trisaccharide. Fig. 2D shows that the ratios of the two products remained about the same over the tested pH range. EndoI exhibits from 58 to 70% of optimum activity with the oligosaccharides at the pH of the growth medium, pH 7.5, and from 25 to 47% of its activity at pH 8-8.3, the pH of sea water. The effect of concentration of the artificial substrate, PNP-(GlcNAc)2, on the activity of the enzyme is shown in Fig. 3. Because of solubility problems, the maximum concentration that could be used was 2.4 mM. Initial rates of hydrolysis are p"

A 21-base pair-long neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) was identified in the proximal part of this region. This element was recognized by the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), previously shown to regulate expression of other neuron-specific genes. The ChAT NRSE was inactive in both cholinergic and non-cholinergic neuronal cells, but repressed expression from a heterologous promoter in non-neuronal cells. Specific deletion of this element allowed ChAT gene promoter activity in non-neuronal cells, and overexpression of NRSF repressed ChAT gene promoter activity in cholinergic cells. The distal part of the ChAT gene promoter showed cholinergic-specific enhancing activity, which stimulated promoter activity in cholinergic cells, but was inactive in non-cholinergic neuronal and non-neuronal cells. This enhancer region suppressed the activity of the ChAT NRSE in cholinergic cells, even after NRSF overexpression. Thus, at least two kinds of regulatory elements cooperate to direct ChAT gene expression to cholinergic neurons, namely a neuron-restrictive silencer element and a cholinergic-specific enhancer.

https://openalex.org/W2027083106,"Earlier experiments in this laboratory identified a highly expressed 65-68-kDa protein in both mouse and human corneas (Cuthbertson, R. A., Tomarev, S.

Here, we demonstrate that this protein is transketolase (TKT; EC 2.2.1.1), an enzyme in the nonoxidative branch of the pentose-phosphate pathway, based on peptide and cDNA isolation and sequence analysis of mouse cornea protein and RNA samples, respectively. While expressed at low levels in a number of tissues, the 2.1-kilobase TKT mRNA was expressed at a 50-fold higher level in the adult mouse cornea. The area of most abundant expression was localized to the cornea epithelial cell layer by in situ hybridization. Western blot analysis confirmed TKT protein abundance in the cornea and indicated that TKT may comprise as much as 10% of the total soluble protein of the adult mouse cornea. Soluble cornea extracts exhibited a correspondingly high level of TKT enzymatic activity. TKT expression increased progressively through cornea maturation, as shown by Northern blot, in situ hybridization, Western blot, and enzymatic analyses. TKT mRNA and protein were expressed at low levels in the cornea prior to eye opening, while markedly increased levels were observed after eye opening. Taken together, these observations suggest that TKT may be a cornea enzyme-crystallin, and suggest that the crystallin paradigm and concept of gene sharing, once thought to be restricted to the lens, apply to other transparent ocular tissues. Earlier experiments in this laboratory identified a highly expressed 65-68-kDa protein in both mouse and human corneas (Cuthbertson, R. A., Tomarev, S. I., and Piatigorsky J. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 4004-4008). Here, we demonstrate that this protein is transketolase (TKT; EC 2.2.1.1), an enzyme in the nonoxidative branch of the pentose-phosphate pathway, based on peptide and cDNA isolation and sequence analysis of mouse cornea protein and RNA samples, respectively. While expressed at low levels in a number of tissues, the 2.1-kilobase TKT mRNA was expressed at a 50-fold higher level in the adult mouse cornea.

Taken together, these observations suggest that TKT may be a cornea enzyme-crystallin, and suggest that the crystallin paradigm and concept of gene sharing, once thought to be restricted to the lens, apply to other transparent ocular tissues. The cornea and lens are both transparent avascular tissues responsible for the refraction of light. The cornea accounts for two-thirds while the lens accounts for the remaining one-third of the refraction in the eyes of terrestrial vertebrates (1Land M.F. Contemp. Phys. 1988; 29: 435-455Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Land M.F. Fernald R.D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Abundant (80-90%) water-soluble proteins called crystallins are required for the transparency and refractive properties of the lens (3Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The taxon-specific crystallins are either related or identical to metabolic enzymes and thus are known as the enzyme crystallins (4Piatigorsky J. Wistow G.J.

The high concentration of the enzyme-crystallins in the lens contributes to its high refractive index and focusing power. The enzyme-crystallins exhibit the property of gene sharing, in which a single gene encodes a single protein with multiple, yet distinct functions (7Piatigorsky J. O'Brien W.E. Norman B.L. Kalumuck K. Wistow G.J. Borras T. Nickerson J.M. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3479-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The enzyme-crystallins perform both a metabolic role as an enzyme and a structural role in determining refractive index. The cornea is comprised of an anterior epithelial surface composed of six cell layers, an extracellular collagenous stromal matrix encasing a sparse keratocyte population, and a posterior single cell layer of endothelial cells (8Klyce S.D. Beuerman R.W. Kaufman H.E. Barron B.A. McDonald M.B. Waltman S.R. The Cornea. Churchill Livingstone, New York1988: 3-54Google Scholar). Reminiscent of enzyme-crystallin expression in the lens, the epithelial cells of the cornea also accumulate high concentrations of metabolic enzymes in a taxon-specific manner (9Cuthbertson R.A. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4004-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been estimated that aldehyde dehydrogenase class III comprises as much as 30-40% of the soluble protein of the cornea epithelium in mammals, an amount suggesting a structural role as well as a metabolic role (9Cuthbertson R.A.

Other previously described abundant cornea epithelium enzymes, which may be putative enzyme-crystallins, include α-enolase (human, mouse, and chicken), glutathione S-transferase (chicken), and peptidyl prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (cyclophilin; chicken) (9Cuthbertson R.A.

Here, we demonstrate that this protein is transketolase (TKT; EC 2.2.1.1; 14-17), 1The abbreviations used are: TKTtransketolaseHCPhuman cornea proteinMCPmouse cornea proteinoligooligonucleotidePBSphosphate-buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionPPpentose-phosphateRTreverse transcriptase. an enzyme in the pentose-phosphate (PP) pathway. The PP pathway produces pentoses and reducing agents in the form of NADPH (16Wood T. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Academic Press/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York1985Google Scholar). TKT has broad substrate specificity, transferring a ketol group to an aldehyde acceptor molecule, and requires Mg2+ and thiamine pyrophosphate for optimal enzymatic activity. TKT catalyzes several reactions within the nonoxidative branch of the PP pathway, and together with transaldolase serves as a reversible link between the PP and glycolytic pathways, allowing the cell to adapt to a variety of metabolic needs under changing environmental conditions. TKT is often used to assess thiamine status in man (18Bailey A.L. Finglas P.M. Wright A.J.A. Southon S. Br. J. Nutr. 1994; 72: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and alterations in TKT chemicophysical or kinetic properties have been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions including Wernicke-Korsakoff's Syndrome (19Blass J.P.

The present studies provide evidence that TKT expression in the mouse cornea epithelium is analogous to crystallin expression in the lens in that a soluble enzyme accumulates to a sufficient concentration to play a refractive role. TKT gene expression increases progressively through cornea maturation, exhibiting a burst of expression that correlates with eye opening. Our observations support the idea that the highly preferred expression of TKT in the corneal epithelium may result from inductive processes associated with environmental conditions, in contrast to the developmentally controlled tissue-preferred transcriptional mechanisms operative in the lens (27Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4277-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Piatigorsky J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The abundant mouse 65-68-kDa protein was subjected to trypsin digestion and peptide sequencing as described previously (9Cuthbertson R.A. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4004-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a new peptide was identified (MCP-2). A 3-week-old mouse cornea epithelial cell-enriched UniZap (Stratagene) cDNA expression library (oligo-dT primed) was screened using an oligonucleotide (oligo); 5ʹ-CTCCCCCACCACAGCAGCAGACACAGCCTCGCCGATGCCGCCCTCATAGTAGTGGTCCTCCACTGT-3ʹ) encoding MCP-2. The cDNA was subcloned (p71) into pBluescript (Stratagene), and sequenced by standard dideoxy methods. p71 and the published mouse TKT cDNA sequence (29; U05809) were used to design oligo primers for the isolation of additional cDNA clones via RT-PCR (Gene-Amp/RNA PCR kit, Perkin-Elmer) of total adult mouse cornea RNA. The PCR primers used and their positions (29Schimmer B.P. Tsao J. Czerwinski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4993-4998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) within TKT mRNA were as follows (see Fig. 1): 5ʹ primers spanning 482-511, 902-931, and 1502-1531; 3ʹ primers spanning 1610-1634, 1660-1684, 1684-1709, and 2028-2062. The cDNAs were subjected to electrophoretic separation, hybridization analyses using internal oligo probes, and cloned into pCRScript (Stratagene), and sequenced. Total RNA was prepared from the tissues of FVB/N mice using RNAzol (Tel-Test), and subjected to Northern blot analyses at 65°C using QuickHyb (Stratagene) and 2 x 106 cpm/ml of one of the following radiolabeled cDNA probes: mouse TKT (p71), chicken β-actin (Oncor), or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Clontech). Cornea epithelium was prepared by the Dispase method of Gipson and Grill (30Gipson I.K. Grill S.M. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 1982; 23: 269-273PubMed Google Scholar). A poly(A)+ RNA Northern blot was obtained from Clontech. rRNA on Northern blots was visualized following autoradiography as follows: 15 min wash in 5% acetic acid, 10 min staining in 0.04% methylene blue, 0.5 M NaOAc, pH 5.2, and destaining in H2O. Mouse eyes (1 day, 14 day, and 6 weeks) were excised, embedded in OCT compound, and quickly frozen on dry ice. The frozen tissue was sectioned (6 μm), placed on slides coated with 0.25% gelatin and 0.025% chromium potassium, allowed to attach at room temperature for 2 min and then in the cryostat for at least 10 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, rinsed three times with PBS, air-dried, and stored at -80°C until use. Mouse TKT probes were labeled by in vitro RNA transcription from linearized p71 using T7 (antisense probe) or Sp6 (sense probe) polymerase in the presence of [α-35S]UTP. The size of the probes was adjusted by treating cRNAs with 0.2 M sodium carbonate at pH 10.2. Prepared sections were brought to room temperature, hydrated for 2 min in PBS, treated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K in TE buffer for 10 min at 37°C, followed by incubation with 0.2% glycine in PBS. Sections were washed with PBS for 3 min, immersed in 0.1 M triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min, rinsed with 2 x SSPE, dehydrated with ethanol, and air dried. Radiolabeled sense or antisense TKT probes (0.2 μg/ml per kilobase pairs of probe) were applied in 60 μl of hybridization mixture containing 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) Ficoll 400, 0.02% (w/v) polyvinylpyrollidine, 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA. The mixture was heated at 80°C for 5 min and maintained at 50°C until use. Hybridization was carried out in a humid chamber at 42°C overnight using Parafilm coverslips. Sections were washed twice at 50°C in Solution A (2 x SSPE, 50% formamide, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol), treated at 37°C for 30 min with 20 μg/ml boiled RNase A in 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, washed twice in Solution A, washed twice at 50°C in Solution B (0.1 x SSPE, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol), dehydrated with ethanol, and air-dried. The slides were exposed to Kodak NTB-2 Emulsion, stored in the dark at 4°C for 3-10 days, the autoradiograms developed in Kodak 1/2 D-19 developer for 5 min, rinsed in H2O for 30 s, and fixed for 8 min. The sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were viewed and photographed under bright- and dark-field illumination using a Nikon Optiphot microscope. Soluble cell extracts were prepared from the tissues of perfused 6-week-old FVB/N mice: the tissues were homogenized in H2O containing protease inhibitors (130 μM bestatin, 50 μM chymostatin, 1 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin), the cell debris pelleted and discarded, the supernatant subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle, precipitated material discarded following centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant fraction saved. Total protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad Reagent. Direct TKT enzyme assays were carried out in vitro by colorimetric determination of 7-sedoheptulose phosphate production in soluble cell extracts (31Takeuchi T. Nishino K. Itokawa Y. Clin. Chem. 1984; 30: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An antibody directed against the mouse TKT peptide sequence NH4-GYHKPDQQKLQALKDTANECOOH (amino acids 3-20) was raised (BioSynthesis Inc.) in rabbits following an analysis of the antigenicity, hydrophobicity, and hydrophilicity profiles of the deduced mouse TKT amino acid sequence (29; GenBank U05809). A search of the protein data base did not detect significant sequence similarities with any other protein besides TKT. A positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reaction was obtained with the immunogen peptide (10 μg/ml) and a 1:100 dilution of serum taken from the first bleed of immunized rabbit 435. The serum of the fifth bleed of rabbit 435, taken 14 weeks after immunization, exhibited a single strongly cross-reacting band of the expected size on Western blots and was used for all subsequent studies. Soluble cell extracts (prepared above) were subjected to chemiluminescent Western blot analysis using a 1:10,000 dilution of the rabbit anti-TKT antiserum and a 1:50,000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham). Total proteins were stained for 5 min in 0.1% Amido Black, 10% acetic acid, 45% methanol, and destained in 2% acetic acid, 90% methanol following electrophoresis and transfer onto Duralon membrane (Stratagene). Both x-ray films and stained membranes were scanned by densitometry. Previous peptide analysis of the abundant mouse and human cornea 65-68-kDa protein identified an identical peptide sequence (ILATPPQEDAPSVDIANIR; see Fig. 1) in the two species denoted as MCP (mouse) and HCP (human) (9Cuthbertson R.A. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4004-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we report the sequence of an additional mouse peptide termed MCP-2: ILTVEDHYYEGGIGEAVSAAVVGEPGVTVT(Q/R) (see Fig. 1). A search of the SwissProt sequence data base for similarities with MCP/HCP detected a perfect match with both mouse (P40142) and human (P29401) transketolase (TKT; EC 2.2.1.1). The MCP-2 sequence was 100% identical with a region in mouse TKT (R at the last position), and matched the analogous region of human TKT at 29 of 31 positions. No other significant sequence similarities were detected, and thus these peptide sequences appeared to be specific for TKT. A 66-base pair oligo encoding an internal 22 amino acid stretch of MCP-2 was used to screen an adult mouse cornea epithelial cell-enriched cDNA library. One positive subclone (p71) was isolated and sequenced. p71 exhibited a perfect match (positions 1618-2062) with the mouse TKT cDNA sequence previously obtained from the Y1 adrenocortical tumor cell line (29; GenBank U05809). The only other significant sequence similarities detected were those with TKT cDNAs and genes isolated from a variety of other species (data not shown). p71 did contain the MCP-2-encoding region, but did not contain the MCP-encoding region. To verify that p71 did indeed represent expression of the TKT gene encoding MCP, a series of TKT oligo primers were used to generate additional cDNAs (PCR1-PCR8 in Fig. 1) from adult mouse cornea RNA via RT-PCR. In every case, the PCR-generated cDNAs matched the expected size upon electrophoresis (see Fig. 1 for schematic representation of results), exhibited the appropriate hybridization pattern using internal oligo probes (data not shown), and displayed a perfect match with the reported mouse Y1 cell line TKT cDNA sequence (data not shown). We thus concluded that the abundant 65-kDa protein observed in mouse and human corneas is TKT. Northern blot analyses were performed to determine the level of TKT gene expression in the cornea, relative to other tissues. As expected from TKT's role in a basic metabolic pathway the TKT gene was ubiquitously expressed (32Schimmer B.P. Robinson R. Tsao J. Watt V.M. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33Calingasan N.Y. Sheu K.-F.R. Baker H. Jung E.-H. Paoletti F. Gibson G.E. J.

The expected (29Schimmer B.P. Tsao J. Czerwinski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4993-4998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 33Calingasan N.Y. Sheu K.-F.R. Baker H.

Commun. 1992; 183: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) 2.1-kilobase mRNA was observed in all tissues examined, although at differing levels. Low levels of TKT mRNA were observed in heart and testis following an extended exposure of autoradiograms (data not shown). This represents the first reported survey of TKT gene expression in multiple tissues of the mouse. Northern blot analysis performed concurrently on 5 μg of total RNA (Fig. 2B) indicated that TKT mRNA was expressed at a 50-fold higher level in total adult mouse cornea than in lens, liver, and kidney, as determined by densitometric scanning (data not shown). The TKT gene has also been shown to be abundantly expressed in Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line mutants as a result of TKT gene amplification (29Schimmer B.P. Tsao J. Czerwinski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4993-4998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Hybridization analysis of genomic DNA isolated from adult mouse cornea and brain indicated that the TKT gene was present in the two tissues at equal copy number (data not shown). Thus, our observations indicate that the TKT gene is preferentially expressed in the adult mouse cornea as a result of transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation, rather than an increase in gene copy number. TKT expression in the maturing eye was examined in RNA samples isolated before and after eye-opening, which typically occurs at 12-13 days of age in the mouse. Early time points in development were studied using RNA isolated from 17-day embryonic (E17), newborn, and 15-day-old whole mouse eyes. Low and nearly equal TKT mRNA levels were observed in E17 and newborn whole eyes, with a 2-fold increase observed at 15-days old. These observations represent TKT gene expression occurring in the several different cell types present in the whole eye, so we next analyzed RNA isolated from corneas at different stages of maturation. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from 7-day, 15-day, and 8-week-old mouse corneas exhibited a progressive increase in steady state TKT mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). Low levels of TKT mRNA were observed in 7-day (before eye opening) samples and a prominent 15-fold increase was observed in 15-day (after eye opening) samples, as determined by densitometric scanning. At 8 weeks, 2-fold higher levels of TKT mRNA were observed as compared to 15-day levels. In 8-week RNA samples additional higher molecular weight hybridizing bands were occasionally observed. The possible origin of these bands, such as incomplete hnRNA processing or the use of additional initiation (36Jung E.-H. Sheu K.-F.R. Blass J.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: A838Google Scholar, 37Salamon C. Piatigorsky J. Sax C.M. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: S354Google Scholar) or poly(A) sites, is not yet known. Staining of this Northern blot with methylene blue confirmed that an equal amount of RNA was loaded in each lane (as determined by the intensity of the 18 S and 28 S rRNA bands; Fig. 3A). Control Northern blots were performed using β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes (Fig. 3B). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene expression did not increase during cornea maturation. β-Actin expression increased approximately 5-fold between 7 and 15 days, as might be expected given the proliferative burst of the stratifying epithelium during this time. This is much less than the 15-fold increase in TKT mRNA during the same time period. Also in contrast to TKT, a significant rise in β-actin mRNA was not observed between 15 days and 8 weeks. These observations indicate that a prominent specific increase in TKT expression correlates with eye opening. In situ hybridization analysis of adult mouse corneas was performed using the antisense TKT p71 radiolabeled probe to determine the relative levels of TKT expression in the epithelial, stromal, and endothelial layers of the cornea. TKT was expressed at low levels in all three layers of the newborn mouse cornea, as revealed by the weak and homogeneous in situ hybridization signal observed in a 7-day exposure to film (Fig. 4A). Low levels have also been observed in the adjacent limbus and conjunctiva (34Guo J. Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Yu F.X. Invest. Ophthal. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: S354Google Scholar). TKT mRNA levels were markedly and progressively increased in the epithelium of 14-day (Fig. 4B) and 6-week-old (Fig. 4C) mouse corneas, as revealed by the increased in situ hybridization signals observed in 3-day exposures to film. The endothelial layer also exhibited TKT expression, and significantly lower basal levels of TKT expression were observed in the stroma. Use of the sense p71 probe produced no detectable signal in any layer of the cornea in control experiments (data not shown). A noticeable dark “band” is observed within the label over the epithelial side of the 14-day cornea section (dark field; Fig. 4B). The dark band is an artifact, and should not be interpreted as Bowman's membrane. The bright signal on the apical side of the dark band represents radiolabeled probe trapped outside the cornea epithelium. This is supported by the appearance of a broad layer of dark grains outside the epithelium in bright field photos (Fig. 4b). In addition, the bright signal (dark field; Fig. 4B) on the apical side of the dark band is below the plane of focus (the sectioned tissue), and thus does not represent hybridizing mRNA within cornea cells. In contrast, the bright signal (dark field; Fig. 4B) on the epithelial-side of the dark band is in the plane of focus (the sectioned tissue), and represents hybridizing mRNA existing with cornea epithelial cells, just as the signal observed in stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells is also in the plane of focus. In order to confirm that a strong area of TKT hybridization does not occur in the stroma, Northern blot analysis was performed on RNA prepared from both whole cornea and the isolated cornea epithelium of 14-day-old mice and subjected to Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5). The level of TKT-hybridizing signal was quantitated by densitometry and expressed relative to the level of rRNA present in each sample (see figure legend). These results indicate that 75% of the hybridizing signal in whole cornea is accounted for by the epithelium, suggesting that an area of significant TKT expression does not occur in the stroma just beneath Bowman's membrane. Taken together, these findings indicate that TKT is abundantly expressed in the mature mouse cornea epithelium. Chemiluminescent Western blot analyses were performed to study TKT expression in the cornea at the protein level. Soluble cell extracts were prepared from the corneas of 7-day, 15-day, and 6-week-old mice, and non-corneal tissues of perfused 6-week-old mice. Perfused mice were used in order to accurately quantitate the relative levels of TKT activity, given the high level of TKT protein and enzyme activity observed in erythrocytes (38Heinrich P.C. Wiss O. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1971; 54: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Himmo S.D. Thomson M. Gubler C.J. Prep. Biochem. 1988; 18: 261-276PubMed Google Scholar, 40Takeuchi T.

The use of perfused non-corneal tissues was also important given the avascular nature of the cornea. An antiserum raised against deduced TKT amino acids 3-20 (29Schimmer B.P. Tsao J. Czerwinski W. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4993-4998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) produced a single strongly cross-reacting band of the expected size in cornea samples (Fig. 6A, lanes 1-3), whose intensity increased during development. Densitometric scanning indicated that the cross-reacting band observed in 15-day extracts was 8-fold more intense than that in 7-day extracts (data not shown). In contrast, only a weakly immunoreactive band was observed in lung and brain cell extracts (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). These findings are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated low levels and variable amounts of TKT protein in most mouse tissues (32Schimmer B.P. Robinson R. Tsao J. Watt V.M. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 41Watt V.M. Schimmer B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11365-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether TKT was expressed in the cornea at levels comparable to the crystallin proteins of the lens, Western blot analysis and Amido Black staining of electrophoretically separated soluble cornea proteins were performed in parallel (Fig. 6B). The TKT-immunoreactive band was aligned with one of the major soluble protein bands observed in total adult cornea cell extracts. Densitometric scanning of the Amido Black-stained proteins indicated that the presumptive TKT band constituted roughly 10% of the total stained proteins (data not shown). Given that sequencing of this band produced only peptides corresponding to TKT (our findings here and Ref. 9) it is reasonable to presume that this band is composed primarily, although probably not solely, of TKT. Thus, TKT may represent up to 10% of the total soluble protein of the cornea. Our observations suggest that TKT accumulates in the cornea to levels resembling that for individual crystallin proteins in the lens. We next assayed whether the abu"

The type I adenylyl cyclase (I-AC) is a neural-specific, Ca2+-stimulated enzyme that couples intracellular Ca2+ to cAMP increases. Since optimal cAMP levels may be crucial for some types of synaptic plasticity, mechanisms for inhibition of Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclases may also be important for neuroplasticity. Here we report that Ca2+ stimulation of I-AC is inhibited by activation of Gi-coupled somatostatin and dopamine D2L receptors. This inhibition is due primarily to Giα and not βγ subunits since coexpression of βγ-binding proteins with I-AC did not affect somatostatin inhibition. However, βγ released from Gs did inhibit I-AC, indicating that the enzyme can be inhibited by βγ in vivo. Interestingly, type VIII adenylyl cyclase (VIII-AC), another Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, was not inhibited by Gi-coupled receptors. These data indicate that I-AC and VIII-AC are differentially regulated by Gi-coupled receptors and provide distinct mechanisms for interactions between the Ca2+ and cAMP signal transduction systems. We propose that I-AC may be particularly important for synaptic plasticity that depends upon rapid and transient cAMP increases, whereas VIII-AC may contribute to transcriptional-dependent synaptic plasticity that is dependent upon prolonged, Ca2+-stimulated cAMP increases.

These results are consistent with our model that the conserved amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain have a direct role in double-stranded DNA binding and that they constitute a part of a gateway for homologous recognition. RecA protein is a key enzyme in homologous genetic recombination and recombinational repair of damaged DNA. RecA protein, which consists of 352 amino acid residues, promotes the formation of heteroduplex joints between single-stranded and double-stranded DNA by homologous pairing and strand exchange in vitro (1McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 2Shibata T. DasGupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In homologous pairing, RecA protein first binds to single-stranded DNA in the presence of ATP (“primary binding”; Ref. 3) and forms helical nucleoprotein filaments called “presynaptic filaments,” in which single-stranded DNA is extended to a length 1.5 times longer than the B form DNA (4Howard-Flanders P. West S.C. Stasiak A. Nature. 1984; 309: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 5Kahn R. Radding C.M. J. Biol.

Then, presynaptic filaments bind to double-stranded DNA (“secondary binding”) and form a three-component complex including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, and RecA protein (and ATP) without prior homologous alignment. The search for homology between single-stranded and double-stranded DNA occurs in this three-component complex (3Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5100-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Chow S.A. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5646-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Tsang S.S.

We had shown that a chimeric RecA protein of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, RecAc38, is defective in homologous pairing of single-stranded DNA with double-stranded DNA because of deficiencies in secondary binding of double-stranded DNA to the mutant protein-single-stranded DNA filaments but is proficient in promoting renaturation of complementary single-stranded DNA (10Kurumizaka H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3387-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These observations led us to propose a three-DNA strand binding site model in which each site plays a functionally distinct role, and the characteristics of RecAc38 are explained if we assume that RecAc38 has a deficiency in one of the two sites required for secondary DNA binding (10Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Ikeya T. Ogawa T. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3068-3075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kurumizaka H. Rao B.J. Ogawa T. Radding C.M. Shibata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3387-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). From observations on the interaction of RecA protein and chemically modified DNA, Takahashi and co-workers (12Wittung P. Norden B. Kim S.K. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5799-5803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that RecA protein has three DNA binding sites. Others have proposed two symmetric DNA binding sites on a helical RecA protein DNA filament (4Howard-Flanders P. West S.C. Stasiak A. Nature. 1984; 309: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). An x-ray crystallographic study and features of mutant RecA proteins suggest that the DNA binding sites are the regions from the 157th to 164th amino acid residues (called loop 1) and from the 195th to 209th amino acid residues (called loop 2), each of which forms a disordered loop (13 and references therein for mutations). This view was supported by photochemical cross-linking experiments (14Malkov V.V. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30230-30233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Morimatsu K. Horii T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An oligopeptide containing loop 2 was found to bind both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (16Gardner R.V. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, the oligopeptide was shown to promote homologous pairing of single-stranded DNA and negatively superhelical closed circular double-stranded DNA (form I DNA; Ref. 17). These observations further support the hypothesis that loop 2 is a DNA binding site critical for homologous pairing. Studies using electron microscopy and neutron scattering on presynaptic filaments have located single-stranded DNA inside RecA protein filaments (18Egelman E.H. Yu X. Science. 1989; 245: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Di Capua E. Schnarr M. Timmins P.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3287-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In secondary binding, double-stranded DNA outside presynaptic filaments has to find a “gateway” to contact single-stranded DNA directly and to search for homologous sequences. Following this model, the sites for secondary binding are not really “sites” but, rather, “paths.” Each strand of double-stranded DNA has multiple contact with amino acid residues along each path that begins at the gateways. By comparing a helical filament structure of presynaptic filaments obtained by the electron microscopic studies and a spiral structure of free or ADP-bound RecA protein obtained by an x-ray crystallographic analysis, one can assume that presynaptic filaments have a spiral structure similar (but extended) to that of free or ADP-bound RecA protein (20Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Stasiak A. Egelman E.H. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of RecA filaments, there is a cleft between adjacent RecA monomers, which connects the inside and outside of the RecA helical filaments (Fig. 1; see ref. 13). A domain consisting of amino acid residues 270-328 near the C terminus is located at the entrance of the cleft (Fig. 1). Recent photochemical cross-linking experiments suggested that a region (amino acid residues 233-243) facing the cleft and another region (residues 257-280) adjacent to and including a part of the C-terminal domain are directly involved in DNA binding (15Morimatsu K. Horii T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11996-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA can be located in this cleft without serious clashes with RecA monomers and can be apposed to the single-stranded DNA without any topological problems. 1A. Sarai and H. Kurumizaka, unpublished model building study. The epitope of an anti-RecA monoclonal IgG, ARM191, which inhibits the binding of double-stranded DNA to RecA protein without affecting single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the protein (23Makino O. Shibata Y. Maeda H. Shibata T. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15402-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was mapped in the C-terminal domain (24Ikeda M. Hamano K. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6291-6296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Few mutant RecA proteins with an amino acid substitution in the C-terminal domain have been characterized in vitro. Thus, considering the model-building study described above and the epitope of ARM191, we constructed by site-directed mutagenesis six mutant RecA proteins that have a single (or double, in one case) substitution for basic amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain, two of them at either of two well conserved basic amino acid residues (allowing substitution of Arg for Lys and vice versa) among bacterial RecA proteins and others at a nonconserved or less conserved Lys or Arg residue, as references (25Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Features of these mutant RecA proteins are consistent with the proposed gateway for double-stranded DNA described above. Negatively superhelical double-stranded DNA produced in vivo (form I DNA) and phage circular single-stranded DNA of Escherichia coli phage M13 (6407 bases), M13mp19 (7249 bases) and ϕX174am3 (5386 bases) were prepared as described (26Cunningham R.P.

Cell. 1981; 25: 507-516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Linear double-stranded DNA of M13Gori1 with termini homologous to M13 was formed by treatment with BamHI (see Ref. 28) and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs; conditions described in the manual). 35S-Labeled single-stranded DNA fragments were synthesized by Klenow fragment in vitro by the following method. An M13 primer (M4; purchased from Takara Shuzo Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) and M13mp19 circular single-stranded DNA were annealed at 1:1 (in DNA molecules), and the primer (1 μM) was extended by Klenow fragment (2 units/μl; purchased from Takara Shuzo Ltd.) at 37°C for 20 min in a reaction mixture (23 μl) containing 7 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 29 μM dATP, 29 μM dTTP, 1.5 μM dGTP, 20 μM 2,3′-dideoxy-GTP, and 0.87 μM [α-35S]dCTP (specific activity, 37 MBq/nmol). After 20 min, dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP (258 μM each) were added to complete the reaction, and the incubation was continued at 37°C for 20 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by heating at 68°C for 10 min, and free nucleotides were removed by ethanol precipitation twice. The DNA substrates synthesized were denatured by boiling for 10 min and were immediately frozen by dipping in liquid N2. The sizes of the 35S-labeled single-stranded DNA fragments ranged between 700 and 1000 bases, as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides were prepared as described (29Rao B.J. Chiu S.K. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 328-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Rao B.J.

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs; conditions described in the manual). The amounts of DNA and oligodeoxyribonucleotides were expressed in moles of nucleotide residues. A 2.5-kilobase pair Escherichia coli DNA fragment carrying the recA gene was cloned into a BamHI site of the pUC119 plasmid vector. The plasmid vector carrying the recA gene, pUC119-recA, was amplified in E. coli dut− ung− strain (CJ236) to isolate uracil-containing single-stranded DNA (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Primers that were used for the mutagenesis were: K280/282N primer, 5′-GAC CTG GGC GTA AAC GAG AAT CTG ATC GAG AAA GC-3′; K286N primer, 5′-G ATC GAG AAC GCA GGC GCG T-3′; K297N primer, 5′-A GGT GAG AAC ATC GGT CAG G-3′; K302N primer, 5′-GT CAG GGT AAC GCG AAT GCG-3′; K317N primer, 5′-A ACC GCG AAC GAG ATC GAG A-3′; and R324Q primer, 5′-C GAG AAG AAA GTA CAG GAG TTG CTG CTG AG-3′. Bold letters indicate the residues that were replaced for the mutagenesis. The primers, which were phosphorylated at the 5′-ends, were annealed to uracil-containing single-stranded pUC119-recA. The complementary strand of pUC119-recA was synthesized by using T4 DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Ltd.) and was ligated with E. coli DNA ligase at 25°C for 2 h in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mM ammonium acetate, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM NAD, and 0.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP. Then, double-stranded pUC119-recA was amplified in E. coli BMH71-18 (mutS), followed by amplification in E. coli MV1184. The plasmid DNAs carrying the mutant recA genes were isolated from the transformants and were sequenced to confirm the presence of a defined mutation and the absence of other mutations. E. coli RecA protein was extensively purified as described (27Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7557-7564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant recA genes were inserted into a multicopy plasmid (pKK223-3) and were expressed under the control of the tac promoter in a ΔrecA derivative of E. coli AB1157 in which an N-terminal region of the recA gene had been deleted. Mutant RecA proteins had single (or double, in one case) amino acid replacement: Lys286 by Asn (RecAK286N), Lys297 by Asn (RecAK297N), Lys302 by Asn (RecAK302N), Lys317 by Asn (RecAK317N), and both Lys280 and Lys282 by Asn-residues (RecAK280/282N). E. coli cells that had a plasmid for overexpression of a mutant recA gene were grown in 3 liters of L broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37°C. At the midlog phase of cell growth, the mutant recA gene was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, followed by incubation at 37°C for 4 h. Then, cells were collected and frozen by dipping in liquid N2. Subsequent procedures for purification of mutant RecA proteins were the same as those for wild-type RecA protein, except that gel filtration was omitted. All fractions that contained a mutant RecA protein were tested to confirm the absence of detectable endonuclease activity. The fractions of mutant RecA proteins (~5 μg) from the final chromatography were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 0.1% SDS followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. We found no detectable protein bands other than a band of RecA protein in the fractions used in this study. Thus, the purity of the mutant RecA protein preparations used in this study was 98-99% or more. The concentration of wild-type RecA protein was determined by the Folin phenol reagent method described by Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The value obtained by this method coincides (within 10%) with that determined by the absorbance at 277 nm using E277 nm1% = 6.33 (7Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Azhderian E. Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Flory J. Chase J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The concentrations of mutant RecA proteins were determined by the use of Coomassie Blue G-250 (a protein assay kit of Bio-Rad; Ref. 33) using wild-type RecA protein as a standard. The amounts of RecA protein are expressed as moles of 38-kDa polypeptide. From the 3-liter culture, we obtained 12-30 (average, 20) mg of mutant RecA protein. M13mp19 superhelical double-stranded DNA (20 μM) and single-stranded 35S-labeled DNA fragments (~1 μM) were incubated in a buffer containing 31 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 13 mM MgCl2, 1.3 mM ATP, 1.8 mM dithiothreitol and 88 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml at 37°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of RecA protein. After 10 min of the incubation, the reaction was terminated by chilling at 0°C, and RecA protein was removed from DNA by treatment with 0.5% SDS, 40 mM EDTA, and proteinase K (240 μg/ml), followed by incubation at 37°C for 10 min. The products of homologous pairing (D loops) were separated from unreacted DNA substrates by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel. The labeled single-stranded DNA fragments incorporated into D loops and those unreacted were quantitated with a BAS-2000 image analyzer (Fuji). Fractions (percentages) of 35S-labeled fragments incorporated into D loops were calculated. We compared this homologous paring assay using labeled single-stranded DNA fragments and double-stranded DNA with the conventional D loop filter assay (see Ref. 27; 34). In both assays, homologous pairing promoted by wild-type RecA protein showed similar kinetic parameters in relation to concentrations of RecA protein, time course, and the dissociation phase of D loops. 2T. Kashima and K. Kawasaki, unpublished observation. Although unlabeled template DNA, complementary to labeled single-stranded DNA fragments, remained in the preparation of the labeled fragments, we did not observe any products of the unlabeled template DNA. Thus, we concluded that the effect of the unlabeled template DNA on the assay of homologous pairing can be ignored. M13 single-stranded DNA (3.0 μM) was incubated with RecA protein at 37°C for 7 min in a buffer containing 31 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl2, 1.3 mM ATP, 1.8 mM dithiothreitol, 88 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 8.0 mM phosphocreatine and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase. Then, the MgCl2 concentration was increased to 13 mM, and the incubation was continued. Three min after the addition, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 4.0 μM M13Gori1 double-stranded 32P-labeled DNA that had been linearized by the treatment with BamHI (generating homologous termini). After 30 min of the incubation, the reaction was terminated by chilling at 0°C, and RecA protein was removed from DNA by the treatment with 1.1% sarkosyl and 12 mM EDTA at 0°C. The products of homologous pairing (joint molecules) were separated from unreacted DNA substrates by electrophoresis through a 0.9% agarose gel. The labeled joint molecules and the unreacted double-stranded DNA were analyzed with a BAS-2000 image analyzer. Fractions (percentages) of 32P-labeled joint molecules were calculated. M13 circular single-stranded DNA (10 μM) was incubated for 8 min with 5.0 μM RecA protein at 37°C in a buffer containing 33 mM PIPES-NaOH 3The abbreviations used are: PIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidSSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding proteinATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). (pH 7.0), 1.0 mM magnesium acetate, 2.0 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.2 mM ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 8.0 mM phosphocreatine and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase. After the concentration of Mg-acetate was increased to 15 mM and 0.10 μM of preannealed + 33-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide-− 33-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplex in which the plus strand was 32P-labeled and was added to initiate the reaction. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times and deproteinized by treatment with 0.5% SDS, 20 mM EDTA, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 37°C. Aliquots were subjected to electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions. A Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager was used to measure the release of the plus strand from the oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplex. 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid single-stranded DNA-binding protein adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). M13 circular single-stranded DNA (2.0 μM) was incubated for 8 min with 4.0 μM RecA protein at 37°C in the presence of a buffer containing 33 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.0 mM MgCl2, 2.0 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.2 mM ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 8.0 mM phosphocreatine and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase. After the concentration of MgCl2 was raised to 15 mM and the reaction mixture was incubated another 12 min, 0.045 μM proximal hairpin oligodeoxyribonucleotide labeled with 32P at 5′-termini was added to initiate the reaction. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times and deproteinized by treatment with 0.5% SDS, 20 mM EDTA, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 0.5% agarose. Hairpin-M13 homologous joint molecules were quantitated by means of a PhosphorImager. [14C]ATP (1.3 mM) was incubated with the indicated amounts of RecA protein and M13mp19 circular single-stranded DNA at 37°C for 45 min in a buffer containing 31 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 13 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM dithiothreitol and 88 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml. After the termination of the reaction by chilling at 0°C, unlabeled ATP, ADP, and AMP (final concentration, 1.5 mM each) were added to each sample, and the sample was subjected to thin layer chromatography as described (27Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7557-7564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of 14C-labeled ATP, ADP, and AMP were determined with a radio-TLC analyzer (Raytest RITA 68000) or a BAS-2000 image analyzer, and the amounts of ATP hydrolyzed by the reaction were calculated. When mutant RecA proteins were tested for competition with single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB; purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in the binding to single-stranded DNA, each mutant RecA protein was incubated with single-stranded DNA and 1.3 mM [14C]ATP for 2 min prior to the addition of SSB, followed by the incubation at 37°C for 28 min. The extent of intramolecular base pairing in single-stranded DNA was estimated from an enhancement of the fluorescence emitted from ethidium bromide on the intercalation of the dye into regions of secondary structure in the single-stranded DNA (10Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Ikeya T. Ogawa T. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3068-3075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M13mp19 circular single-stranded DNA (2.0 μM) and 60 nM ethidium bromide were dissolved in a buffer containing 31 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 13 mM MgCl2, 1.3 mM ATP, 1.8 mM dithiothreitol and 88 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml at 37°C. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.60 μM RecA protein in the presence of 4 mM phosphocreatine and 5 units of creatine phosphokinase/ml as an ATP-regenerating system. The fluorescence was recorded at 600 nm with the excitation at 530 nm. Ethidium bromide (60 nM) was present throughout the reaction, but this concentration of ethidium bromide was far below a level that causes a detectable effect on the activities of RecA protein (see Ref. 10). 4S. Ikawa, O. Makino, and T. Shibata, unpublished observation. Under these conditions, the enhancement of fluorescence is caused solely by the interaction of ethidium bromide with a double-stranded region, and the binding of RecA protein to double-stranded DNA per se did not cause a decrease in the fluorescence (see Ref. 10).4 32P-Labeled single-stranded 83-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (1.2 μM) and the indicated amounts of RecA protein were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 33 mM PIPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 13 mM magnesium acetate, 1.2 mM ATPγS, 2.0 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml at 37°C for 10 min. After the incubation, samples were diluted 10-fold with a dilution buffer containing 30 mM PIPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 15 mM magnesium acetate. 20-μl aliquots were subjected to gel electrophoresis in 0.55% agarose in the presence of 40 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.3) and 15 mM magnesium acetate. Material that was shifted from the position of free oligodeoxyribonucleotide was quantitated by use of a PhosphorImager. M13mp19 closed circular double-stranded 3H-labeled DNA (form I; 2.0 μM) and ϕX174 circular single-stranded DNA (2.0 μM) were incubated with the indicated amounts of RecA protein at 37°C in a buffer containing 31 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 13 mM MgCl2, 1.3 mM ATP, 1.8 mM dithiothreitol, 88 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 4 mM phosphocreatine and 5 units of creatine phosphokinase/ml. After 20 min of the incubation, the amount of 3H-labeled DNA integrated into coaggregates was determined by means of a centrifugation assay (9Tsang S.S. Chow S.A. Radding C.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3226-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Single-stranded 35S-labeled DNA fragments (~1 μM) and M13mp19 circular single-stranded DNA (5.0 μM) were incubated in a buffer containing 31 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 13 mM MgCl2, 2.6 mM ATP, 1.8 mM dithiothreitol, and 88 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml at 30°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of RecA protein. After 10 min of the incubation, the reaction was terminated by chilling at 0°C, and RecA protein was removed from DNA by treatment with 0.5% SDS, 40 mM EDTA, and proteinase K (240 μg/ml), followed by incubation at 30°C for 10 min. The products of annealing were separated by gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose, and the labeled single-stranded DNA fragments that were annealed with M13mp19 circular single-stranded DNA were quantitated with a BAS-2000 image analyzer. We introduced amino acid substitutions in the domain consisting of amino acid residues 270-328, a candidate for the gateway for secondary binding of double-stranded DNA to presynaptic filaments of RecA protein and single-stranded DNA. In this study, we looked at basic amino acid residues (Lys or Arg) that could directly interact with negatively charged sugar phosphate backbones of DNA. This domain contains two well conserved (among bacterial RecA proteins) basic amino acid residues (Lys286 and Lys302, allowing replacement by Arg), two less conserved ones (Lys297 and Arg324), and seven nonconserved ones (25Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We constructed by site-directed mutagenesis mutant RecA proteins that have single (or double, in one case) replacement of the basic amino acid residues by polar ones to minimize the change of hydrophilic environments caused by the replacements; i.e. RecAK286N, RecAK297N, RecAK302N, and RecAK317N have single substitution of Asn for Lys residues at positions 286, 297, 302, and 317, respectively. RecAR324Q has a substitution of the Gln for the Arg residue at position 324. RecAK280/282N has double substitution of Asn for two Lys residues at positions 280 and 282. The mutant recA genes were tested for UV s"
https://openalex.org/W1990286787,"Ferritin is an iron-binding protein composed of two subunits, H and L. Twenty-four of these subunits assemble to form apoferritins whose subunit composition varies in a characteristic way in different tissues. Using recombinant proteins, we have assessed the role of H and L subunits in mouse ferritin function and compared these to human ferritin subunits. We report that mouse ferritin subunits exhibit considerable functional similarity to their human counterparts, including a prominent role of the H subunit in the facilitation of rapid iron uptake, and a key role of amino acid residues Glu-62 and His-65 in this process. In addition, amino acid residues important to assembly of the protein are conserved between mouse and human, permitting the formation of fully functional hybrid proteins containing both mouse and human subunits. However, murine and human ferritin H subunits also evidenced substantial functional differences; murine ferritin H showed a consistent reduction in iron uptake activity relative to human ferritin H. Creation of chimeric human/mouse ferritin H subunits by “helix swapping” mapped the domain of the protein critical to this activity difference to the DE helix. These findings suggest a novel functional role for carboxyl-terminal domains of the ferritin H subunit. Ferritin is an iron-binding protein composed of two subunits, H and L.

These findings suggest a novel functional role for carboxyl-terminal domains of the ferritin H subunit. Ferritin is a protein which has as its principal function the intracellular storage of iron in a nontoxic and bioavailable form (see Refs. 1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar and 2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar for review). Ferritin is ubiquitously distributed in the animal and plant kingdoms and has recently been described in bacteria (3Hudson A.J. Andrews S.C. Hawkins C. Williams J.M. Izuhara M. Meldrum F.C. Mann S. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mammalian ferritin is composed of two subunits, termed H and L. Twenty-four of these subunits assemble to form the apoferritin protein. In mammals, ferritin is found in most tissues. However, the composition of ferritin varies in a consistent and tissue-specific way. For example, liver contains ferritin that is predominantly of the L subunit type, whereas heart contains ferritin rich in the H subunit. This biodistribution, as well as the evolutionary conservation of a dual subunit structure, supports the hypothesis that the H and L ferritin subunits may play different and complementary roles within the protein (4Levi S.

Mouse cells and mouse models have been widely used to study iron homeostasis in health and disease (e.g. Refs. 10Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabepppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell.

For the most part, however, biological inferences concerning ferritin function and iron metabolism in these models have been based on analogy to human ferritin. Indeed, substantial sequence similarity exists between mouse and human ferritin subunits; mouse L and human L exhibit 82β similarity (15Beaumont C. Dugast I. Renaudie F. Souroujon M. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7498-7504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas human and mouse ferritin H are 93β identical (16Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12638-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the hypothesis that mouse ferritin subunits are functionally equivalent to human ferritin subunits has not been experimentally tested. We provide here direct evidence that mouse and human ferritin subunits have similar properties, including a prominent role of the H subunit in the facilitation of rapid iron uptake, and a key role of amino acid residues Glu-62 and His-65 in this process. In addition, amino acid residues important to assembly of the protein are conserved, permitting the formation of fully functional mouse/human hybrid proteins. However, we also observed a significant functional difference between mouse and human ferritin H subunits, which we have mapped to a region of the protein not previously implicated in iron uptake activity. These findings may suggest a role of previously unsuspected domains of ferritin H in ferritin function. Monocistronic expression plasmids for mouse ferritin L, mouse ferritin H and human ferritin L were constructed by using polymerase chain reaction to modify the coding region of pMLF27 (gift of C.

Drysdale, Tufts University), respectively, to contain an NdeI restriction site at the initiator methionine and a BamHI site at the stop codon. These fragments were subcloned into the pET21C vector (Novagen) digested with NdeI and BamHI. The human ferritin H chain coding region was modified similarly following reverse transcription of human fibroblast mRNA from MRC-5 cells (gift of Dr. Helen Blau, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) with murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. pACYC-based expression plasmids were constructed by isolating the entire expression cassette of the four pET21 constructs using BspEI digestion, T4 DNA polymerase fill-in, and BglII digestion followed by ligation into the pACYC177 vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.) digested with BamHI and ScaI. Simultaneous expression of two subunits was achieved either by subcloning a second cDNA in tandem to the first (bicistronic expression system) or by co-expressing two separate cDNAs cloned in two separate vectors (dual vector expression system). 2P. Rucker, F. M. Torti, and S. V. Torti, manuscript in preparation. The mouse ferritin H double point mutant containing Glu-62 → Lys and His-65 → Gly amino acid substitutions was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of MFH cDNA with a 5ʹ primer (5ʹ-CAATCTCATGAGAAGAGGGAGGGTGCCG-3ʹ) causing a G → A transition at amino acid residue 62 and a C → G transversion and A → G transition at amino acid residue 65. This fragment was digested with BspHI and BsmI and ligated to a BsmI, partial BspHI restriction fragment of the mouse H pET21 construct. The cloning junctions of all 12 constructs, 100 nucleotides surrounding the mutated region of the double point mutant, and the entirety of the HFH, HFL, MFH, and MFL coding regions were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. murine ferritin H chain murine ferritin L chain human ferritin H chain human ferritin L chain polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A human/mouse hybrid ferritin H subunit containing human helices A-C and mouse helices DE was constructed by digesting human ferritin H cDNA with NdeI and BsmI and ligating to the BsmI/BamHI fragment of mouse ferritin H. The product was amplified using a 5ʹ primer containing an NdeI site and complementary to human ferritin H, and a 3ʹ primer containing a BamHI site and complementary to mouse ferritin H. A hybrid human A-D/mouse E subunit was constructed in the same way, except that digestion of human ferritin H cDNA was with NdeI and BstEII, and digestion of mouse ferritin H cDNA was with BstEII and BamHI. A hybrid subunit containing human helices A, B, C, and E and mouse helix D was constructed by subcloning a BstEII fragment of pET21c-HFH into a BstEII-digested human A-C/mouse DE construct. All constructs were verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. All plasmid constructs were expressed in the host strain BL21/DE3 (Novagen). Ferritin was purified following induction with 1.0 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma). Bacteria were pelleted; resuspended in buffer containing 10β sucrose, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Sigma); and sonicated. Sonication was repeated following resuspension of the pellet in the same buffer containing 0.2β Triton X-100 and 100 mM NaCl in place of sucrose. The supernatant was heated to 700C for 15 min, applied to a 10-40β sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 40C for 18 h. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, assayed for protein content using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), pooled as appropriate, dialyzed, and concentrated. In some cases, ferritin was purified as described previously (17Santambrogio P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Iron content of ferritins isolated from bacteria was low (<0.01 μg of iron/μg of protein) (18Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Subunit composition of multi-subunit proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE, staining with silver or Coomassie Blue, and scanning (PDI, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), using standard curves prepared by simultaneous electrophoresis and staining of known quantities of purified ferritin protein. Subunit composition was reproducible. For example, in seven independent colonies expressing murine ferritin H and murine ferritin L from a dual vector expression system, the H subunit represented 37 ± 2.8β (95β confidence interval) of the ferritin protein. For electrophoretically nonresolvable interspecies heteropolymers, Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies prepared against each subunit and adsorbed against heterologous ferritins was used to gauge subunit composition. Iron uptake was assayed by incubating 50 μg/ml protein in 0.1 M Hepes, pH 6.5, with 0.1 mM freshly prepared ferrous ammonium sulfate and measuring the change in absorbance at 310 nm for 3 min at 300C (17Santambrogio P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was no precipitation of protein under these conditions. Assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate and the results averaged. In some cases, measurements of iron uptake were performed on proteins that had been dialyzed against thioglycollic acid to remove ferritin-bound iron (19Sun S. Arosio P. Levi S. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9362-9369Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The function of ferritin is to store iron, and the protein actively facilitates the formation of a polynuclear iron core. In order to study the role of murine ferritin H and L subunits in this process, we cloned cDNA for murine ferritin H and murine ferritin L into separate bacterial expression vectors. Recombinant ferritin proteins composed of either 100β murine ferritin H or 100β murine ferritin L were then purified from bacteria transformed with these plasmids, and the initial rate of iron uptake in the purified proteins measured. For comparative purposes, human ferritin H and L were similarly prepared. As shown in Fig. 1, this analysis revealed that murine ferritin composed of the H subunit was much more active in iron uptake than L subunit ferritin. These results were qualitatively similar to those obtained using recombinant human ferritin subunits (Ref. 7 and Fig. 1), in which an enhanced activity of the H subunit when compared to the L subunit was also seen. Under these conditions, iron uptake was not observed in proteins composed solely of L chain ferritin; however, at higher protein concentrations, ferritin L homopolymers exhibited weak iron uptake activity (data not shown). Since residues Glu-62 and His-65 contribute substantially to the iron uptake of the human ferritin H subunit, we further tested the functional homology between human and murine ferritin H by creating a double point mutant of murine ferritin H, in which the Glu and His residues normally present at these positions were mutated to Lys and Gly. As seen in Fig. 1, when compared to the intact murine ferritin H subunit, this protein exhibited dramatically reduced activity, consistent with the behavior reported for a similar mutant in the human ferritin H subunit (20Lawson D.M.

However, despite these similarities between mouse and human ferritin H, the iron uptake activity of murine ferritin H was different from human ferritin H. Thus, in six independent experiments, murine ferritin H exhibited 60 ± 9β of human ferritin H activity (95β confidence intervals). Our initial experiments utilized murine and human homopolymers composed of a single subunit type in order to gauge the contribution of H and L subunits to iron uptake in mouse ferritin. However, ferritin exists in mammalian cells as a heteropolymer of H and L subunits, i.e. despite the ability of recombinant ferritin H and L to form homopolymers (21Levi S. Cesareni G. Arosio P.

Arosio P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5179-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), these are generally not seen in vivo. Rather, a restricted subset of heteropolymers is formed that is characteristic of a given tissue. We therefore wished to determine whether the difference in the activity of murine and human ferritin H would be maintained in these more biologically relevant proteins. In order to perform these experiments, we designed experimental conditions that would allow the isolation of ferritin containing two different subunits from a single bacterial cell. In one case, expression of two different ferritin subunits was obtained by using a bicistronic mRNA; in a second case, subunits of ferritin were cloned into two different expression plasmids, which were simultaneously expressed in the same bacterial host (dual vector system).2 In both cases, ferritin subunits expressed in bacteria assembled appropriately into 24 subunit proteins, as judged by their co-sedimentation on sucrose density gradients with native apoferritin (Fig. 5 and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, by combining these methods, both human and murine ferritins with a broad range of subunit composition were expressed in bacteria.Fig. 2Subunit analysis of human and mouse and ferritins. Ferritins were isolated from bacteria containing cDNA for one or two ferritin subunits and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (32Giulian G.G. Moss R.L. Greaser M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and silver staining. Subunit ratios were estimated by simultaneous electrophoresis and staining of known quantities of purified ferritin proteins. A, human ferritin proteins. Shown are proteins containing 100β human ferritin H chain (H), 69β human ferritin H + 31β human ferritin L chain, 43β human ferritin H chain + 57β human L chain, and 20β human H chain + 80β human L. B, mouse ferritin proteins.

Note that the relative migration of H and L subunits is inverted in mouse and human proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The availability of correctly assembled mouse and human ferritin proteins with a range of subunit compositions enabled us to test the dependence of initial rates of iron uptake on subunit composition, as well as to assess whether the difference in the iron uptake activity of murine and human ferritin H was preserved in ferritin H/L heteropolymers. As shown in Fig. 3, the highest rate of iron uptake in both cases was observed in H subunit homopolymers, and the lowest rate in L subunit homopolymers. In both mouse and human proteins, the rate of iron uptake in heteropolymers was proportional to H subunit content. Additionally, the relative decrement in murine ferritin H activity when compared to human ferritin H activity that was evident in homopolymers was completely preserved in heteropolymers. Thus, throughout a wide range of ferritin subunit compositions, human ferritin H was consistently more active than murine ferritin H (Fig. 3). In order to determine whether residues important to ferritin assembly are conserved in mouse and human ferritin subunits, we prepared four interspecies ferritin heteropolymers of varying composition: 90β HFH and 10β MFL; 14β HFH and 86β MFL; 48β MFH and 52β HFL; 4β MFH and 96β HFL (Fig. 4). In all cases, interspecies heteropolymers were found to assemble into multi-subunit proteins when assessed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 5). Thus, residues important for assembly and subunit interaction are conserved between these two species. The ability of intraspecies hybrid proteins to function in iron uptake was then assessed (Fig. 6). All proteins analyzed were functionally competent. As was the case for intraspecies heteropolymers, in interspecies heteropolymers, initial rates of iron uptake were proportional to H subunit composition. Fig. 6 compares initial rates of iron uptake in intraspecies and interspecies heteropolymers. For ferritins containing either mouse or human ferritin H, initial rates of iron uptake remained proportional to H subunit content, independent of the species of origin of the L chain. Thus, the rate of iron uptake in an interspecies protein containing 48β MFH/52β HFL was intermediate between mouse proteins containing 100β and 33β MFH; similarly, the rate of uptake of an interspecies protein containing 14β HFH was intermediate between human proteins containing 0 and 20β HFH. In two cases, it was possible to examine the functional equivalence of murine and human subunits by comparing pairs of inter- and intraspecies ferritin heteropolymers of similar composition. One pair, comprising proteins consisting of 76 or 86β mouse L, with the balance made up of either mouse or human ferritin H, respectively, showed an initial rate of iron uptake of 1.5 × 10-4∆A310 nm/s in a protein containing 24β mouse H, and a higher initial rate (2.3 × 10-4∆A310 nm/s) in a protein containing less (14β) human ferritin H subunit. Thus, the reduction in murine ferritin H activity relative to human ferritin H that was seen in interspecies heteropolymers (Fig. 3) was also preserved in intraspecies heteropolymers. In contrast, replacing the mouse ferritin L subunit with a human ferritin L subunit had little effect on initial rates of iron uptake; proteins consisting of 40 and 48β mouse H, with the balance made up of either mouse or human ferritin L, respectively, exhibited initial rates of iron uptake consistent with their H chain content (2.4 × 10-4 versus 3.3 × 10-4∆A310 nm/s). This suggests that the function of murine ferritin H can be equivalently expressed in the presence of murine or human ferritin L. As shown in Fig. 7, human and murine ferritin H differ in only 13 amino acid residues. Surprisingly, residues previously implicated in iron uptake (19Sun S. Arosio P. Levi S. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9362-9369Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Waldo G.S. Ling J. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. Science. 1993; 259: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) are not included in these differences. This suggested that the difference in rate of iron uptake between these two species mapped to another domain of the ferritin H protein. Studies of ferritin secondary structure have indicated that ferritin subunits comprise five helices, termed A-E, as diagrammed in Fig. 7. Inspection of the murine and human ferritin H sequences shown in Fig. 7 revealed that amino acid differences between these proteins localized primarily to the D and E helices. We therefore used helix swapping to test whether differences in this region of the protein were responsible for the difference in catalytic activity between mouse and human ferritin H. The mouse E helix was substituted for the human E helix to create a chimeric subunit containing helices A-D of human ferritin H and helix E of mouse ferritin H (Fig. 8B). As shown in Fig. 8A, this substitution did not appreciably affect the initial rate of iron uptake, and the homopolymer formed from the self assembly of the human H/mouse E chimeric subunit exhibited a very similar rate of iron uptake to a homopolymer of the unmodified human H subunit. However, when both the murine D and E helix were swapped for the human D and E helix in the human subunit, the initial rate of iron uptake was dramatically reduced. Substitution of the murine D helix for the human D helix was sufficient to partially but not completely effect this change (Fig. 8). Thus, residues responsible for the differences between mouse and human ferritin H map to the domain contained within the D and E helices.Fig. 8Effect of helix swapping on iron uptake activity. A, rates of iron uptake in proteins composed of 100β human ferritin H, 100β mouse ferritin H, 100β chimeric subunit containing helices A-C of human ferritin H and helices DE of murine ferritin H (HH/mDE), 100β chimeric subunit containing helices A-D of human ferritin H and helix E of murine ferritin H (HH/mE), and 100β chimeric subunit containing helices A, B, C, and E of human ferritin H and helix D of mouse ferritin H (HH/mD).

Iron regulates ferritin via a novel post-transcriptional mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar and 2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently become apparent that transcriptional control plays an important role in the regulation of ferritin synthesis, particularly in response to environmental cues such as cytokines (16Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12638-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wei Y. Miller S.C. Tsuji Y.

Interestingly, it is the ferritin H gene that is transcriptionally modulated. This differential transcriptional regulation of ferritin H in the absence of a change in ferritin L results in a change not only in the amount of ferritin, but in its subunit composition. To appreciate the biological implications of altered ferritin subunit composition, functional differences between H and L protein subunits must be understood. Although many studies of ferritin regulation have been performed in cells of murine origin, murine ferritin protein function has not been previously assessed. We therefore undertook to compare some of the properties of murine ferritin H and L subunits, and to compare them to their human counterparts. We observed that proteins composed of murine ferritin L subunits exhibited dramatically reduced rates of iron uptake when compared to H homopolymers. Additionally, studies of mouse and human heteropolymers expressed and assembled in bacteria (composed of either human H/human L subunits or mouse H/mouse L subunits) demonstrated that in both species, initial rates of iron uptake were proportional to H subunit content. In addition, isolation of a double point mutant of murine ferritin H indicated that residues Glu-62 and His-65 play a key role in mediating rapid iron uptake in murine as well as human ferritin H. These results suggest that there is an overall functional correspondence between human and mouse ferritin subunits. To address whether mouse and human ferritin subunits exhibited sufficient structural similarity to substitute for each other in the assembled apoprotein, we tested whether recombinant interspecies hybrid proteins could assemble and function catalytically in the uptake of iron. Interspecies proteins assembled in bacteria yielded proteins of similar size and shape to tissue apoferritin as judged by mobility on sucrose density gradients (Fig. 5). Re-assembly of ferritin has been previously achieved by utilizing renaturation of ferritins treated with strong denaturants (17Santambrogio P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Otsuka S. Listowsky I. Niitsu Y. Urushizaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6234-6237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as opposed to the strategy of co-expression described here. Although there are some discrepancies between our data and those obtained with renatured ferritins (e.g. iron uptake rates of human ferritins appeared to plateau at higher H subunit ratios than previously suggested; Ref. 17), the overall concordance of our results with those obtained using denaturants suggests that ferritin function is not appreciably affected by these harsher treatments. We further observed that, like ferritins formed from H and L subunits of the same species, intraspecies hybrid proteins exhibited rates of iron uptake completely consistent with their H subunit composition. These experiments demonstrate that amino acid contacts important for spontaneous assembly of subunits into the 24-subunit apoprotein are conserved between mice and humans, that mouse and human ferritin subunits can assemble and function as efficiently as two subunits from the same species, and that the role of the H subunit in iron uptake is preserved in interspecies hybrid proteins. Surprisingly, however, we observed throughout these experiments that mouse ferritin H exhibited a consistent reduction in activity relative to human ferritin H. This was observed in both homopolymers and heteropolymers. This was an unanticipated finding, based on the high degree of evolutionary conservation between mouse and human ferritin H, a conservation that includes residues involved in iron mineralization and oxidation (19Sun S. Arosio P. Levi S. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9362-9369Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Waldo G.S. Ling J. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. Science. 1993; 259: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These include tyrosyl residues, which have been implicated in initial events of iron oxidation (23Waldo G.S. Ling J. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. Science. 1993; 259: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); Glu-27, Glu-62, His-65, Glu-107, and Gln-141, which function as metal ligands in the ferroxidase center; as well as residues 61, 64, and 67, which have been reported to contribute to iron nucleation (20Lawson D.M. Treffry A. Artymiuk P.J. Harrison P.M. Yewdall S.J. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Levi S. Arosio P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 29Wade V.J. Levi S. Arosio P. Treffry A. Harrison P.M. Mann S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1443-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To identify domains responsible for the difference between the H subunits of human and mouse, we constructed a number of chimeric subunits in which helices of the mouse ferritin protein were swapped for their human counterparts. We observed that substitution of the mouse for the human DE helices conferred the catalytic properties of the mouse subunit upon the human ferritin H subunit. Since substitution of the E helix alone did not modulate the catalytic activity of the human ferritin H subunit, the three amino acid changes at the D helix (His-136 → Tyr, Asn-139 → Ser, and Ala-144 → Ser) may largely account for the difference in catalytic activity between mouse and human ferritin H. However, substitution of the mouse D helix for the human D helix did not yield a protein of complete equivalence to the mouse ferritin H subunit (Fig. 8), suggesting that alterations in the E helix may play a contributory role. Residues in the D helix contribute to hydrophilic channels of three-fold symmetry found in apoferritin, and a decrease in rate of iron uptake in point mutants in residues 131 or 134 of the D helix have previously been reported (30Treffry A. Harrison P.M. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, an alteration in residues that line the hydrophilic channel is unlikely to explain our results, since residues that line these channels, including Asp-131 and Glu-134, are conserved in mouse and human ferritin H. An alternative possibility is that conformational differences underlie the differences in catalytic activity between mouse and human ferritin H. For example, mutations in the loop that connects the D and E helix have been reported to alter the conformation of the ferritin protein (31Jappelli R. Luzzago A. Tataseo P. Pernice I. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), an effect that might in turn influence its iron uptake properties. However, we observed no gross differences in size and shape of mouse and human ferritin H homopolymers by either sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 5) or electron microscopy. 3P. Rucker, W. G. Jerome, F. M. Torti, and S. V. Torti, unpublished observations. In addition, those residues of the loop reported to be most crucial to maintenance of correct conformation (159-161; Ref. 31) do not differ in mouse and human ferritin H. Although we cannot exclude the existence of small but important conformational differences between mouse and human ferritin H, large conformational differences are unlikely to underlie the differences in catalytic activity between mouse and human ferritin H reported here. Further experiments, including the use of point mutants, will be required to precisely define the contribution of specific amino acid residues in the D and E helix to the function of the ferritin H subunit.

To study the mechanism of disulfide-induced enzyme inactivation, we examined the rate and extent of enzyme inactivation using wild-type human aldose reductase and mutants containing cysteine-to-serine substitutions at positions 80 (C80S), 298 (C298S), and 303 (C303S). The wild-type, C80S, and C303S enzymes lost >80% activity following incubation with GSSG, whereas the C298S mutant was not affected. Loss of activity correlated with enzyme thiolation. The binary enzyme-NADP+ complex was less susceptible to enzyme thiolation than the apoenzyme. These results suggest that thiolation of human aldose reductase occurs predominantly at Cys-298. Energy minimization of a hypothetical enzyme complex modified by glutathione at Cys-298 revealed that the glycyl carboxylate of glutathione may participate in a charged interaction with His-110 in a manner strikingly similar to that involving the carboxylate group of the potent aldose reductase inhibitor Zopolrestat. In contrast to what was observed with GSSG and cystine, cystamine inactivated the wild-type enzyme as well as all three cysteine mutants.

INTRODUCTIONAldose reductase (alditol:NADP oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.21) (ALR2) 1The abbreviations used are: ALR2aldose reductaseDTTdithiothreitolr.m.s.root mean square. catalyzes with a broad catalytic efficiency the NADPH-dependent reduction of aldo-sugars and a variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. This enzyme is the first in a pathway that results in the transformation of glucose to fructose using sorbitol as a metabolic intermediate. This so-called “polyol pathway” is not a “high flux” metabolic route except in hyperglycemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and galactosemia, where elevated concentrations of glucose and galactose, respectively, result in enhanced accumulation of their corresponding polyols in various tissues such as the eye lens (1Varma S.D.

Since these polyols do not readily permeate cell membranes, their intracellular accumulation is thought to create an osmotic imbalance, resulting ultimately in sugar cataract formation (3Kinoshita J.H.

Many studies indicate that Cys-298, an accessible residue located close to the active site, is a possible modulator of ALR2 susceptibility to inhibition. Carboxymethylation of ALR2 generates an enzyme form with differentially altered susceptibility to inhibition by Tolrestat (N-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)-6-methoxy-1-naphthalenyl]thioxomethyl]-N-methylglycine) and Sorbinil ((S)-6-fluorospiro[chroman-4,4′-imidazolidine]-2′,5′-dione), suggesting the existence of two distinct inhibitor-binding sites on ALR2 (14Liu S.-Q.

INTRODUCTIONAldose reductase (alditol:NADP oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.21) (ALR2) 1The abbreviations used are: ALR2aldose reductaseDTTdithiothreitolr.m.s.root mean square. catalyzes with a broad catalytic efficiency the NADPH-dependent reduction of aldo-sugars and a variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. This enzyme is the first in a pathway that results in the transformation of glucose to fructose using sorbitol as a metabolic intermediate. This so-called “polyol pathway” is not a “high flux” metabolic route except in hyperglycemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and galactosemia, where elevated concentrations of glucose and galactose, respectively, result in enhanced accumulation of their corresponding polyols in various tissues such as the eye lens (1Varma S.D.

Efflux of both cholesterol and phospholipid to the lipid-free plasma apoA-I was twice that of apoA-I-(−6-243). When apoA-I was incorporated into reconstituted high density lipoprotein, cholesterol efflux increased, phospholipid efflux decreased and the difference between plasma apoA-I and apoA-I-(−6-243) disappeared. Truncation of recombinant apoA-I to residues 222 (apoA-I-(−6-222)) and 210 (apoA-I-(−6-210)) resulted in a 70-95% decrease in their ability to promote the efflux of both intracellular and plasma membrane cholesterol. Further truncation to residues 150 (apoA-I-(−6-150)) and 135 (apoA-I-(−6-135)) fully restored the ability of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux. Phospholipid efflux closely paralleled the efflux of cholesterol. Interaction of 125I-labeled apoA-I with the cells was similar for apoA-I-(−6-243), apoA-I-(−6-222), and apoA-I-(−6-210), but slightly higher for apoA-I-(−6-150) and apoA-I-(−6-135). When complexed with phospholipid, all forms except apoA-I-(−6-210) formed discoidal reconstituted high density lipoprotein particles. When the same amounts of free or lipid-associated apoA-I were compared, association of apoA-I with phospholipid increased cholesterol efflux and decreased phospholipid efflux, and the difference in the ability of different mutants to promote cholesterol and phospholipid efflux disappeared. We conclude that the capacity of lipid-free apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux is related to its ability to mobilize cellular phospholipid, which apparently involves a region around residues 222-243.

Thus, apoA-I-containing lipoproteins are the most efficient initial acceptors of cellular cholesterol (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Forte T.M. McCall M.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and removal of these lipoproteins from the plasma greatly reduces the release of cholesterol from cells (4Fielding C.J. Moser K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10955-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of how apoA-I executes this function remains, however, unresolved. It has been demonstrated that short peptides mimicking the secondary structure of apoA-I are able, to a certain extent, to imitate its ability to facilitate removal of cellular cholesterol (5Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol.

Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7955-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting that a rather nonspecific mechanism, which relies mainly on the ability of apoA-I to bind lipids, appears to be involved. On the other hand, new evidence suggests that specific sequences of apoA-I are responsible for cholesterol efflux (8Banka C.L. Black A.S. Curtiss L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10288-10297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fielding P.E. Kawano M. Catapano A.L. Zoppo A. Marcovina S. Fielding C.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), pointing to the involvement of a more specific and possibly receptor-dependent mechanism.In our previous work using monoclonal antibodies against specific epitopes of apoA-I, we identified a sequence, apoA-I-(140-150), that was associated with the ability of apoA-I to promote efflux of intracellular cholesterol (10Sviridov D. Pyle L. Fidge N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to further investigate the involvement of various domains of apoA-I in cholesterol efflux, we used recombinant proapoA-I, either intact or truncated, in the lipid-free form or incorporated into reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL), to study the effect of the carboxyl-terminal domain truncations on the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid from cultured cells. While the proform of apoA-I is a minor component of circulating apoA-I, its known properties do not deviate strongly from mature apoA-I (11Sorci-Thomas M.G. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the biological principles underlying structure-function relationships between cholesterol efflux and proteins should be equally relevant for mature apoA-I and proapoA-I.DISCUSSIONThe present study continues our investigations into the identification of putative structural features of apolipoprotein A-I that determine its ability to promote efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid from cultured cells. In our previous work we demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies reacting with epitope within the region apoA-I-(140-150) specifically inhibited the ability of apoA-I-containing lipoproteins to promote efflux of intracellular but not plasma membrane cholesterol (10Sviridov D. Pyle L. Fidge N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For this study we have produced several versions of recombinant proapoA-I selectively truncated at loci suspected of involvement in cellular cholesterol efflux. The ability of these mutants, either in the lipid-free form or incorporated into rHDL, to mobilize cellular cholesterol and phospholipid were compared.At least two stages have been identified in the process of cholesterol efflux: transfer of cholesterol from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane and transfer from plasma membrane to the extracellular acceptor (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the first stage may be receptor-dependent (35Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the second stage mainly depends on the secondary structure of the apolipoproteins (36Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 66-141Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that varying degrees of truncation produced marked differences in the ability of lipid-free apoA-I to promote efflux of cellular cholesterol. In contrast to the selective inhibition of the efflux of intracellular cholesterol by monoclonal antibodies (10Sviridov D. Pyle L. Fidge N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), truncations of apoA-I exerted a similar effect on the efflux of both intracellular and plasma membrane cholesterol. The changes in cholesterol efflux resulting from truncation of apoA-I did not correlate with binding of apoA-I to cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that the removal of the varying proportion of the carboxyl terminus of apoA-I does not affect intracellular stage of cholesterol efflux, a stage that may depend on a specific interaction between apoA-I and cells. Instead, it appears to reflect changes in the ability of truncated forms of apoA-I to interact and form complexes with cholesterol and phospholipid, processes that are associated with the second stage of the efflux.It was suggested by Forte et al. (30Forte T.M. Goth-Goldstein R. Nordhausen R.W. McCall M.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 317-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Forte T.M. Bielicki J.K. Goth-Goldstein R. Selmek J. McCall M.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 148-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that association with phospholipid is a prerequisite for the ability of lipid-free apoA-I to facilitate cholesterol efflux. Several findings in this work support that hypothesis. First, the effect of truncations on cholesterol efflux paralleled their effect on the efflux of phospholipid. Second, differences in the ability of the various forms of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux disappeared when apoA-I was complexed with phospholipid prior to incubation with cells. The cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in the medium rose quickly during the first 1-3 h of incubation and remained constant thereafter. Taken together, these data suggest that any differences observed in the promotion of cholesterol efflux from HepG2 cells most likely reflect a difference in capacity to associate with cellular phospholipid and subsequently form the apoA-I/phospholipid complexes required for efflux of cholesterol.The data obtained with truncations that involved the last 21 amino acids suggest that this domain of apoA-I plays a crucial role in interaction with cellular lipids. This region includes a class Y amphipathic helix, which is suggested to bind phospholipid strongly and may play an important role in assembling apoA-I into lipid-containing complexes (37Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 103-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that truncation of apoA-I to residue 189 (38Holvoet P. Zhao Z. Vanloo B. Vos R. Deridder E. Dhoest A. Taveirne J. Brouwers P. Demarsin E. Engelborghs Y. Rosseneu M. Collen D. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13334-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), 192 (39Ji Y. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11290-11297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), or 212 (33Minnich A. Collet X. Roghani A. Cladaras C. Hamilton R.L. Fielding C.J. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16553-16560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) significantly diminished its ability to react with phospholipid. Truncation to residues 226, 217, and 201, which decreased the ability of apoA-I to associate with HDL in vivo, also produced a marked increase in the clearance of apoA-I (17Schmidt H.H.-J Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Ronan R. Wellmann A. Thomas F. Zech L.A. Brewer H.B. Hoeg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5469-5475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The important lipid binding properties of this region has been also demonstrated with other techniques; peptide consisting of residues apoA-I-(220-241), together with peptide apoA-I-(44-65), were the only fragments of apoA-I apparently able to bind phospholipid (40Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this work we have demonstrated that truncation to residue 222 caused a significant reduction in the ability of apoA-I to promote efflux of cellular lipids suggesting that the 223-243 region is most likely involved in the formation of apoA-I-lipid complex.Unexpectedly, truncation of apoA-I to residue 150 completely restored and even enhanced promotion of cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. At least three explanations can be offered for this finding. First, another cryptic lipid-binding domain exists in the center of the apoA-I, which is unmasked by truncation. The most likely candidates are a “hinge” region apoA-I-(87-142), which contains the only two remaining class Y amphipathic helices of apoA-I and which has a strong ability to bind lipids (37Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 103-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), or a region apoA-I-(44-65), which also shows a strong lipid-binding ability (40Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Second, this other domain is a primary lipid binding domain in full-length apoA-I, but is structurally compromised when the last 21 amino acids are truncated. Third, the lipid-binding properties of apoA-I do not depend on a specific sequence or a domain, but rather on the overall secondary structure of the whole protein which is affected when some parts of the protein are truncated. Evidence from the work with synthetic peptides suggests the existence of two lipid-binding domains in apoA-I and therefore favors the first possibility (40Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). ApoA-I with point mutations are currently being produced in order to distinguish between these possibilities.The recombinant proform of apoA-I was used in most experiments. While the properties of proapoA-I and mature apoA-I were almost identical when complexed to lipids (11Sorci-Thomas M.G. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Roghani A. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Westman J. Roobol C.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pyle L.E. Sawyer W.H. Fujiwara Y. Mitchell A. Fidge N.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12046-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the ability of lipid-free mature apoA-I to promote lipid efflux was different from that of proapoA-I. We evaluated the contribution of the propeptide moiety to the facilitation of lipid efflux and reasoned that this contribution would influence equally all the carboxyl-terminally truncated forms. It cannot be totally excluded, however, that some of the effects observed with lipid-free apoA-I may be due to changes in the interaction of the propeptide with the rest of the molecule. For example, the propeptide may interact with a site at the carboxyl terminus, which could explain how it decreases the lipid-binding ability of apoA-I. Truncation to residue 150 may have eliminated this site and therefore negated the effect of the propeptide. While this possibility cannot be excluded, it is, nevertheless, unlikely; the truncation restored the activity of the mutant to the level of full-length proapoA-I, not to the level of mature apoA-I as one would expect if the mutation negated the effect of the propeptide. Alternatively, the difference in the folding of the recombinant protein, compared with the native apoA-I rather than the presence of propeptide, may have contributed to the differences observed. When complexed with phospholipid, recombinant proapoA-I and mature plasma apoA-I were equally able to facilitate cholesterol and phospholipid efflux, a phenomenon also noticed by Westman et al. (13Westman J. Roobol C. Heymans C. Carlson L.A. Wulfert E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1993; 53: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).When various forms of apoA-I were incorporated into rHDL, all of them, except apoA-I-(−6-210), formed rHDL particles. Full-length apoA-I and apoA-I-(−6-222) formed mostly single-size populations, while apoA-I-(−6-150) and apoA-I-(−6-135) produced rather heterogeneous populations. All rHDL particles were of pre-β mobility. Analysis of cholesterol efflux in the presence of particles of different size should be interpreted with caution, because it has been suggested that efflux may be independently affected by the size and composition of the particles, as well as the properties of apoA-I. However, Davidson et al. (34Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) demonstrated that when discoidal rHDL particles are compared on the basis of their phospholipid content, other parameters such as their size, composition, and apoA-I conformation do not have a significant impact on the ability of these particles to promote cholesterol efflux. Consistent with this finding, efflux of both intracellular and plasma membrane cholesterol to rHDLs containing different mutated forms of apoA-I was similar, despite the differences in the size of the particles. However, when recalculated on a per particle basis, rHDL containing apoA-I-(−6-150) and apoA-I-(−6-135) were more active in promoting cholesterol efflux. The possible explanation for this is the presence of large rHDL particles, which on a per particle basis are better acceptors of cholesterol (34Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The presence of only low amounts of small particles in these preparations is unlikely to confound the findings related to cholesterol efflux, since these particles are poor cholesterol acceptors (34Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Another investigation outside the scope of this study was carried out to examine cholesterol efflux with different homogeneous subpopulations of the rHDL particles; these data will be reported elsewhere.2 A difference was expected in the intracellular cholesterol efflux between rHDL containing apoA-I-(−6-150) and apoA-I-(−6-135), a truncation eliminating a sequence that we previously suspected, from studies using monoclonal antibodies (10Sviridov D. Pyle L. Fidge N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), to be associated with the ability of apoA-I to promote intracellular cholesterol efflux. No difference was observed, however. We presume that removal of a significant portion of the apoA-I affects the structural properties of the remaining peptide constraining the specific structural feature(s) responsible for the intracellular cholesterol efflux. Alternately, sequences associated with the efflux of intracellular cholesterol to apoA-I/phospholipid complex are located at the amino-terminal part of apoA-I. INTRODUCTIONIt is currently accepted that apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) 1The abbreviations used are: apoA-Iapolipoprotein A-IERendoplasmic reticulumrHDLreconstituted high density lipoproteinPCphosphatidylcholinePMplasma membranePOPCpalmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine. -containing lipoproteins play a key role in the efflux of cellular cholesterol, the first step in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Forte T.M. McCall M.R. Curr. Opin.

Thus, apoA-I-containing lipoproteins are the most efficient initial acceptors of cellular cholesterol (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Forte T.M. McCall M.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and removal of these lipoproteins from the plasma greatly reduces the release of cholesterol from cells (4Fielding C.J. Moser K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10955-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of how apoA-I executes this function remains, however, unresolved. It has been demonstrated that short peptides mimicking the secondary structure of apoA-I are able, to a certain extent, to imitate its ability to facilitate removal of cellular cholesterol (5Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7955-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting that a rather nonspecific mechanism, which relies mainly on the ability of apoA-I to bind lipids, appears to be involved. On the other hand, new evidence suggests that specific sequences of apoA-I are responsible for cholesterol efflux (8Banka C.L. Black A.S. Curtiss L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10288-10297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fielding P.E. Kawano M. Catapano A.L. Zoppo A. Marcovina S. Fielding C.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), pointing to the involvement of a more specific and possibly receptor-dependent mechanism.In our previous work using monoclonal antibodies against specific epitopes of apoA-I, we identified a sequence, apoA-I-(140-150), that was associated with the ability of apoA-I to promote efflux of intracellular cholesterol (10Sviridov D. Pyle L. Fidge N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to further investigate the involvement of various domains of apoA-I in cholesterol efflux, we used recombinant proapoA-I, either intact or truncated, in the lipid-free form or incorporated into reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL), to study the effect of the carboxyl-terminal domain truncations on the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid from cultured cells. While the proform of apoA-I is a minor component of circulating apoA-I, its known properties do not deviate strongly from mature apoA-I (11Sorci-Thomas M.G. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using the reagent kit from Bio-Rad. The enzyme was assayed by modifications of the procedures used for assaying ExoI (2Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme activity was detected in colonies growing on agar plates with MUF-GlcNAc. Two quantitative enzyme assays were used when PNP-GlcNAc was the substrate, and a third, the Morgan-Elson colorimetric method, when the substrates were oligosaccharides containing terminal GlcNAc residues. The modifications of the assays were as follows. Cell extracts or protein fractions were incubated at 22°C for up to 40 min in 100-μl volumes containing the following: 1 mM PNP-GlcNAc, 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, and 400 mM NaCl. The reaction was quenched with 2 ml of 1.8 M Tris base, pH 11, and absorbance measured at 400 nm. Hydrolysis of PNP-GlcNAc was quantitated by continuously monitoring the rate of PNP formation at 400 nm. The temperature was maintained at 22°C with a Lauda circulator, and reactions were initiated by adding protein fractions or purified protein (μg) to 400 μl of the assay mixture described above. GlcNAc was determined by a modification of the Morgan-Elson assay (9Morgan W. Elson L. Biochem. J. 1934; 28: 988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, standard incubation mixtures contained the following (in 100 μl): 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7, 400 mM NaCl, 1-5 mM substrate, and 0.5 μg of enzyme. After incubating at 25°C for 1 to 16 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl 0.8 M sodium borate, pH 9.2, and the mixtures were heated for 12 min at 100°C. The samples were rapidly cooled, adjusted to 25°C, and treated with 0.55 ml of freshly prepared Ehrlich reagent (10 g of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 90 ml of glacial acetic acid and 10 ml of concentrated HCl diluted 1:10 with acetic acid before use). After 20 min at 37°C, absorbances were determined at 585 nm. Other substrates were assayed as follows. After 16 h of incubation of the enzyme with the compound Thr/Ser-Asn-GlcNAc-GlcNAc-(Man)9, the products were separated on a Dionex column and determined by Dr. Y. C. Lee. Following a 16-h incubation of the enzyme with 14C-labeled GlcNAc-O-Thr-Ser-Thr-Ser-Phe-Ser-Asp-Ser-Tyr, free 14C-GlcNAc was separated from the substrate using Sep-Pak column cartridges (Millipore/Waters Division) and quantified using liquid scintillation spectroscopy. A ClaI-restricted V. furnissii DNA bank was ligated into pBR322 and transformed into E. coli HB101 by the CaCl2 or electroporation procedures (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vols. 1-3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). Three thousand E. coli transformant colonies were screened for β-GlcNAcidase activity as described for ExoI (2Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The colonies expressing ExoII were distinguishable from those expressing ExoI by their relative intensities; ExoII colonies exhibited much less fluorescence when treated with MUF-GlcNAc. DNA was blotted from agarose gels onto nitrocellulose (Immobilon-NC transfer membranes) and probed as described (11Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21353) Google Scholar). In brief, DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to long wave UV light for 3 min. The probe was 32P-labeled by the random priming method (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization was performed at low stringency, in the presence of 60% formamide at 22°C. Following hybridization, the blot was twice washed extensively with 200 ml each of the following solutions: (i) 4 × SSC (see “Experimental Procedures”), 50 mM KPO4, and 0.5% SDS at 65°C; (ii) 1 × SSC, 12 mM KPO4, and 0.5% SDS at 65°C; (iii) 0.2 × SSC, 2.4 mM KPO4, and 0.1% SDS at 65°C; (iv) 0.1 × SSC, 1.2 mM KPO4, and 0.1% SDS at 22°C; (v) 0.005 × SSC at 22°C. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with monoclonal antibodies, 1E7D4 and 1E9H10, at a dilution of 1:10,000. The monoclonal antibodies were prepared against homogeneous ExoII. Bound antibody on the nitrocellulose membranes was detected with the luminescent ECL kit from Amersham, according to the manufacturer's directions. Sequencing of both strands of DNA was conducted by the dideoxy chain termination method of double- or single-strand template with a USB Sequenase 2 kit and [α-35S]dATP. For the rescue of single strand DNA, the 1.8-kb fragment containing the β-GlcNAcidase gene was excised from pXE18 by BamHI and KpnI digestion and ligated to pBluescript SK+/−. Single-stranded DNA was subsequently prepared and isolated using the phage VCSM13 as a helper vector and E. coli DH11S (4Lin J.J. Smith M. Jessee J. Bloom F. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 718-721PubMed Google Scholar). Template for double-stranded DNA sequencing (pXE18) was purified with a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit column and extracted twice with chloroform/phenol/isoamyl alcohol. Sequencing reactions were performed as recommended by U. S. Biochemical Corp. with minor modifications in the annealing step. Double-stranded DNA (5 μg) was denatured with 0.2 M NaOH and ethanol-precipitated. Double-stranded (denatured) or single-stranded (3 μg) DNA were mixed with 10 ng of primer and Sequenase buffer in a total volume of 10 ml. The mixture was warmed 5 min at 44°C, followed by a 20-min incubation at 37°C. Compressions were resolved by sequencing both with dGTP and dITP on the same gel. Analyses of DNA and amino acid sequences were conducted with the GCG sequence analysis package (Version 7, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The data bases used for nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities searches (using FASTA) were GenBank™ Release 79 and Swiss Protein Release 26. Predicted amino acid sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W version 1.5; similarities were shown by shading using BOXSHADE/DOS 2.7, kindly performed by Michael Cleveland. A 1-liter culture of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) (12Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar) harboring pXE28 was grown to late exponential phase (OD660 = 1.5) in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. (The enzyme was also purified by the same procedures using the transformant harboring pXE18, and gave the same results.) The cells were harvested and washed twice with Buffer C (0.5% NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer without NaCl (Buffer D), and passed three times through a French press at 0-5°C. All remaining steps were conducted in the cold. Streptomycin sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1.4%, and the mixture centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 2 h. Fifteen ml of a saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added dropwise with stirring to 10 ml of the streptomycin sulfate supernatant fraction. After 16 h, the 60% ammonium sulfate precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet dissolved in Buffer D and exhaustively dialyzed against the same buffer. The sample (about 9 ml) was transferred to a 30-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that had been equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with 36 ml of Buffer B, which eluted considerable inactive protein, and the column was then eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl linear gradient (80 ml) in Buffer B at a rate of 1 ml/5 min. ExoII activity was detected in the 0.15 to 0.2 M NaCl fractions, which were pooled. The active fractions displayed three widely separated protein bands on SDS-PAGE. The pooled active fractions (12 ml) from the previous step was concentrated to 1.7 ml in an Amicon 30 ultrafiltration apparatus, and transferred to a 1.8 × 85-cm Ultrogel ACA34 gel filtration column (a polyacrylamide/agarose, IBF Biotechnics, Savage, MD). The column was pre-equilibrated with Buffer D containing 0.1 M NaCl, and eluted with the same buffer/NaCl mixture. Fractions were collected at 0.7 min/ml. Activity was detected in fractions 37-45 (3 ml each), with the peak in fractions 40-42. The specific activity was constant across the peak, and the pooled fractions 37-39, 40-42, and 43-45 showed only one band on SDS-PAGE. A DEAE-HPLC column gave no additional purification, and was not incorporated into the purification procedure. The purified protein was stored at −80°C at concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml or less in Buffer D containing 0.1 M NaCl. The enzyme precipitated at higher concentrations. Under the conditions described here, the enzyme was stable for at least 1 year. The homogeneous recombinant protein was used to raise monoclonal antibodies in mice by a described injection schedule and procedure (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vols. 1-3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). Antibodies were detected by Western blotting of the recombinant protein. Two hybridomas were isolated, 1E9-H10 and 1E7-D4. They secreted specific antibodies of the IgG3 class. A V. furnissii ClaI genomic library was constructed in pBR322, and the colonies were screened for expression of β-GlcNAcidase with MUF-GlcNAc. Five of 3,000 colonies yielded positive results. Plasmid DNA from each of the positive colonies was subjected to restriction digestion and Southern blot analysis, using the V. furnissii periplasmic β-GlcNAcidase gene (exoI) as a probe (2Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Three of the clones were identical to exoI, but two clones were different. These harbored plasmids containing identical 10-kb inserts, designated pRE100. The gene, exoII, was subcloned in two steps from pRE100. Digestion of the 10-kb V. furnissii DNA fragment with SphI gave three fragments. One of these (2.8 kb) contained exoII, was gel-purified (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vols. 1-3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar), and ligated into the high copy number plasmid pVEX11, giving pXE28. The fragment was further subcloned by digestion with SalI, giving two smaller DNA fragments, of 1.8 and 1 kb, respectively. The 1.8-kb SphI/SalI fragment was blunt-ended and ligated in both orientations in the SmaI site of pVEX11. The transformants isolated from each of the plasmids (pXE18, pXE81) expressed active enzyme (data not shown), indicating that exoII in the 1.8-kb fragment carries its own promoter. Southern blots showed that the cloned gene is a component of the V. furnissii genome. Complete SphI digests of V. furnissii and E. coli HB101 chromosomal DNA were probed with the 1.8-kb DNA fragment from pXE18 (Fig. 1). Under highly stringent hybridization conditions, the probe hybridized only to a DNA fragment in the Vibrio digest. Furthermore, the V. furnissii DNA fragment containing exoII was the predicted size, 2.8 kb, for a SphI complete digest. To minimize protein degradation during the course of the purification, the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was chosen as a host for pXE28 and pXE18 because this strain is deficient in several proteases (5Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 61-63Google Scholar). Activity was observed in the soluble protein fraction of the BL21 transformants harboring pXE28 and pXE18, whereas no activity was present in cells transformed with the vector plasmid alone. The enzyme was purified in three steps from crude extracts of the transformant as shown in Table I, giving a 72-fold purification, and a total recovery of 80%.Table IPurification of ExoIIFractionTotal proteinSpecific activityPurification FactorYieldmgnmol/mg × min-fold%Crude extract11610.01100Ammonium sulfate10010.41.290DEAE-Sepharose9.510510.586Ultrogel ACA341.371671.680 Open table in a new tab Only one protein band was detected on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The apparent molecular mass of the protein is 36 kDa; this value agrees with the molecular mass calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence (see below). The continuous spectrophotmetric assay was used for kinetic studies involving PNP-β-GlcNAc, except for the pH studies, where the discontinuous method was used. The enzyme exhibited a fairly sharp peak of activity at pH 7.0 both in Hepes and McIlvaine buffer. There was only slight activity at pH 6.0 and 8.0. The optimal temperature was 45°C, and about half of the maximal activity was observed at 25°C, the temperature used for growth of V. furnissii and for the routine enzyme assays. Increasing the ionic strength had a small stimulatory effect on the activity. The optimum NaCl concentration was 0.4-0.7 M, and in this range, the enzyme was about 70% more active than in the absence of NaCl. There was no apparent divalent ion requirement, and 0.04 M EDTA did not inhibit the activity. The enzyme exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent kinetic constants with PNP-β-GlcNAc, calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 3A), were: Km, 440 μM; Vmax, 1.1 μmol/min × mg protein at 22°C. Given sufficient time, the rate of the reaction decreases, and this was first observed in the continuous spectrophotometric assay. Several possibilities were tested, and it appeared that we were observing product inhibition. Indeed, GlcNAc inhibits the β-GlcNAcidase. A Dixon plot is shown in Fig. 3B and suggests that GlcNAc is a noncompetitive inhibitor of ExoII, with an apparent Ki of 210 μM. The cloned enzyme is an exo-β-GlcNAcidase and hydrolyzes PNP-β-GlcNAc and MUF-β-GlcNAc. The substrate specificity of the enzyme, however, shows that it is not a classical β-GlcNAcidase but is unique. Unlike most β-GlcNAcidases, the enzyme had only a slight, albeit detectable effect with PNP-β-GalNAc. Under standard assay conditions (1 μg of pure enzyme in 400 μl of buffer containing 0.66 mM substrate), PNP-β-GlcNAc was hydrolyzed at a rate of 356 pmol/min, whereas PNP-β-GalNAc was hydrolyzed at a rate of 10 pmol/min, or a ratio of about 36-fold in favor of PNP-β-GlcNAc. It was possible that the GalNAc derivative might be contaminated with small amounts of PNP-β-GlcNAc. Therefore, the following mixture (440 μl) was incubated at 22°C: 330 μM PNP-β-GalNAc, 5 μg of enzyme, 10 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0. After 16 h, 9% of the substrate was cleaved. This value far exceeded the quantity of PNP-β-GlcNAc that could be a contaminant (based on chromatography of the derivatives). The enzyme was tested for its ability to hydrolyze a variety of p-nitrophenyl D-glycopyranosides, including β-GlcNAc, β-Glc, β-Gal, and β-cellobioside. The following glycosides of β-GlcNAc were also assayed: phenyl, benzyl, methyl, and 6-aminohexyl. Only PNP-β-GalNAc was slowly hydrolyzed, as described above. Negative results were also obtained with O- and N-linked glycopeptides (all β), GlcNAc-Asn, (Man)9-GlcNAc-(β,1-4)-GlcNAc- Asn-Ser/Thr and [14C]GlcNAc-O-Thr-Ser-Thr-Ser-Phe-Ser-Asp-Ser-Tyr. In the case of the labeled O-linked [14C]GlcNAc, the sensitivity of the assay would have detected a trace of hydrolysis. In view of the chitinolytic properties of V. furnissii, the most important set of derivatives tested for enzyme specificity were the chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)n, n = 2-6, and these were studied extensively. For example, each of the oligosaccharides (1 mM) was incubated at 37°C with 3.4 μg of ExoII in 100 μl of 10 mM phosphate or Hepes buffer, pH 7.0. After 16 h, there was no detectable GlcNAc (by the Morgan-Elson reaction) in any of the incubation mixtures. In addition, recovery experiments with GlcNAc added to the incubation mixtures showed no detectable loss of the monosaccharide. Given the sensitivity of the assay, the quantity of enzyme used, and its specific activity with PNP-β-GlcNAc, we conclude that if ExoII hydrolyzes (GlcNAc)n, the rate must be less than 1.5 pmol/min ×μg ExoII, or, less than 0.15% of the rate observed with PNP-β-GlcNAc. We especially wish to emphasize the lack of activity with the disaccharide, (GlcNAc)2, since the cloning experiments were aimed at isolating the gene that encodes the cytoplasmic chitobiase expressed by V. furnissii (13Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, GlcNAc is a very effective (apparent noncompetitive) inhibitor of the enzyme with Ki = 210 μM, significantly less than the Km for PNP-β-GlcNAc, 440 μM. Other potential inhibitors (none of which were hydrolyzed) were also screened because they might shed light on the unexpected specificity of the enzyme. The continuous assay was used with PNP-β-GlcNAc as the substrate (Table II).Table II.Inhibition studiesGlycoseAglycon group of glycosidesKiInhibitionμM%Derivatives of N-acetylglucosamine1.

Open table in a new tab The most effective inhibitor in this screen was PUGNAC (for structure, see “Experimental Procedures”), a GlcNAc derivative, which was also found to be the most effective inhibitor of a recently reported rat spleen cytosolic β-GlcNAcidase (14Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table II shows that other GlcNAc derivatives also inhibited ExoII, and that the degree of inhibition was variable, depending on the nature of the aglycon group of the glycosides. Interestingly, there was low but definite inhibition by PNP-α-GlcNAc. Anomeric specificity, at least for binding by the enzyme, is therefore not absolute. GlcNAc-Asn is a potent inhibitor, as effective as GlcNAc itself. GlcNAc-Asn is the covalent link between the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and the protein backbone, but whether the observed inhibition is or is not physiologically significant is not known. In contrast to GlcNAc, which virtually abolishes enzyme activity when tested at 5 mM concentration, chitin oligosaccharides, such as (GlcNAc)2 and (GlcNAc)4, showed low to no activity. A variety of p-nitrophenyl glycosides, such as the galactosyl derivative, were inactive as inhibitors. However, arbutin and coniferin were inhibitors. This finding is of considerable interest because of the gene sequence and its similarity to certain aryl β-glucosidases discussed below. The cloned β-GlcNAcidase is a V. furnissii gene (Fig. 1). Extensive experiments were conducted in attempts to determine whether the gene was expressed in this organism, and if so, where it was localized in subcellular fractions. The enzymatic activity of ExoII could not be used as the method of assay because V. furnissii expresses at least two other β-GlcNAcidases that hydrolyze PNP-β-GlcNAc, ExoI (membrane-bound, periplasm), and the cytoplasmic chitobiase (13Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell fractions were therefore probed by Western blots of SDS-PAGE gels, using monoclonal antibodies raised against the pure recombinant ExoII. It is important to emphasize that the antibody probes were specific, and no cross-reactive antigen was detected in control blots, such as crude extracts of E. coli harboring the vector, or with the other hexosaminidases from V. furnissii described in the a"

A comparison of the purified enzyme's action pattern on Vt in vivo and in vitro confirmed its role in Vt processing. Protease-deficient yolk (day 0 postovulation) contained peptides of Mr 35,500, 37,000, 39,000, and 41,000, which were absent from yolk with protease activity.

Acidification of purified proprotease converted it to three peptides of approximately Mr 29,000 with cysteine protease activity. This conversion also required participation of a cysteine protease. Activated proprotease had the same pH activity profile, susceptibility to inhibitors, and cathepsin classification (L) as the protease.

However, the mechanisms regulating yolk protease activation and how the timing of activation is coordinated with embryo development are important questions that remain to be answered. Previous work demonstrated that Vt utilization in Blattella germanica eggs is initiated at days 3-4 postovulation by proteolytic processing to a distinct set of peptides, which are then accessed by the embryo during development (9Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 15: 119-135Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Storella J.R. Kunkel J.G. Am. Zool. 1979; 19: 999Google Scholar, 16Purcell J.P. Kunkel J.G. Nordin J.H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 8: 39-55Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similar processing events are characteristic of Vt utilization in other insect species also (see Ref. 9, and references therein). Assays of B. germanica yolk with synthetic substrates revealed that protease activity, first detectable at days 2-3 postovulation, increased in specific activity through day 5, suggesting it could be important in Vt processing (9Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 15: 119-135Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Greater than 90% of this proteolytic activity was inhibitable by cysteine protease inhibitors (9Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 15: 119-135Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that this class of proteases play a major role in the processing event. These assays identified both cathepsin L- and B-like activities (17Liu X. Nordin J.H. Giorgi F. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (Abstr. 672): 1374Google Scholar), the former constituting more than 85% of the total. The finding that the yolk of certain B. germanica translocation heterozygotes with defective embryo development and Vt processing lack yolk protease activity also implicates them (9Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 15: 119-135Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Purcell J.P. Quinn T.M. Kunkel J.G. Nordin J.H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 9: 237-250Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yolk granules prepared from eggs 4-6 days postovulation accumulate high concentrations of the dye acridine orange, a probe for vesicle acidity, while those from eggs at days 0-3 do not (19Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Hagedorn H.H. Hildebrand J.G. Kidwell M.G. Law J.H. Molecular Insect Science. Plenum, New York1990: 341Google Scholar, 20Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 18: 177-192Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The acidification was determined to be the result of proton translocation, suggesting that a vacuolar ATPase was involved (20Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 18: 177-192Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The temporal association of Vt processing with granule acidification suggested that acidification was part of the mechanism controlling protease activation. Other experiments showed that when the yolk of freshly ovulated eggs (which contains no detectable protease activity) was acidified in vitro, Vt processing occurred (20Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 18: 177-192Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These facts led us to speculate that the B. germanica Vt-processing protease is stored either as an acid-activated mature enzyme or, more likely, as a proprotein that is converted to a mature, catalytically active form; in either case, the population of catalytically active molecules would be controlled in vivo by granule acidification. As part of the overall project aimed at understanding how the Vt-processing event is controlled, the major B. germanica yolk (Vt processing) protease was purified and partially characterized. The storage (precursor) form of this enzyme was also identified, purified, and its activated form compared with the processing protease. Proprotease activation was also examined in the context of possible regulation in vivo, by acidification. A preliminary report of some of this work has been published (17Liu X. Nordin J.H. Giorgi F. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (Abstr. 672): 1374Google Scholar). Special chemicals and reagents and their suppliers were as follows. Z-Phe-Arg-NMec, goat anti-rabbit antibody-HRP conjugates, rabbit anti-ubiquitin, bovine ubiquitin, ovalbumin, Ponceau S, streptavidin-HRP, the Mono Q HR 5/5 FPLC column, and activated Sepharose 4B (6-aminohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-Sepharose conjugate) were from Sigma. The Pro-Blue staining kit was from Integrated Separation Systems (Natick, MA). Extracti-Gel D detergent removing gel was from Pierce. Z-Arg-Arg-NMec and Z-Gly-Phe glycinal semicarbazone were from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Biotinyl-Phe-Ala-CHN2, Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2, and Z-Phe-Tyr(O-But)-CHN2 were from Biosyn Ltd. (Belfast, Northern Ireland). Endo H, Pefabloc SC, and leupeptin (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Arg-al) were from Boehringer Mannheim. The Glyco Track™ detection kit for glycoproteins was from Oxford GlycoSystems Inc. (Rosedale, NY). Renaissance chemiluminescence detection kit was from DuPont NEN. Microcon and Centriprep tubes and YM-10 membranes were from Amicon Inc. (Beverly, MA). Precoated TLC sheets (silica gel 60 F254, thickness 0.2 mm) were from EM Sciences (Gibbstown, NJ). Palladium black was from Aldrich. B. germanica, from Carolina Biological Supply Co. (Burlington, NC), were reared in the laboratory at 300C (21Kunkel J.G. J. Insect Physiol. 1966; 12: 227-235Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Oothecae (egg cases) were collected daily. Day zero postovulation is the first 24 h following oothecal extrusion. Manduca sexta larval muscle extract was a kind gift from Dr. Lawrence Schwartz (Department of Biology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst). Protein concentration measurements (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) used an ovalbumin standard. Protease assays were conducted as described (9Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 15: 119-135Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using two broad-spectrum substrates: Z-LNE and azoalbumin. Z-Phe-Arg-NMec (hydrolyzed preferentially by cathepsins L, but slowly by cathepsins B) and Z-Arg-Arg-NMec (hydrolyzed by cathepsins B only; Ref. 23) were also used. With Z-LNE, 1 unit of enzymatic activity caused an increase in absorbance of 1.0/min at 326 nm; and with azoalbumin, an increase in absorbance of 1.0/h at 366 nm. With AMC, 1 unit released 1 pmol of AMC/s from Z-Phe-Arg-NMec or Z-Arg-Arg-NMec (determined by a standard curve). AMC formation was measured at 20-s intervals by fluorescence spectrophotometry at 370 nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission). A modification of the procedure of Rich et al. (24Rich D.H. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was employed at room temperature. Z-Gly-Phe-glycinal semicarbazone (48 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 10% (w/w) formic acid in tetrahydrofuran. Palladium black (48 mg), in 1 ml of water, was added, and the deblocking reaction was monitored by TLC (24Rich D.H. Brown M.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After 30 min, the suspension was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated at 200C and lyophilized, affording a syrup (56 mg) of Gly-Phe glycinal semicarbazone. Activated Sepharose 4B was equilibrated overnight in 1 mM HCl at 40C and then washed in a column (0.8 cm diameter; bed volume 3 ml) with 60 ml of 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.0. Gly-Phe-glycinal semicarbazone (56 mg), in 5 ml of methanol, was diluted with 3 ml of 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.0. The mixture was combined with the activated Sepharose in a small tube and incubated overnight on a nutator at 200C, transferred back to the column, and washed with 100 ml of 50% aqueous methanol and 100 ml of water. It was agitated again for 4 h in 10 ml of 0.13 M ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.0 at 200C and then washed with 100 ml of water containing 0.1% azide, prior to storage at 40C. Seventy oothecae (approximately 2.1 g; day 6 for protease, day 0 for proprotease,) stored up to 3 weeks at -200C, were thawed in a 12-ml centrifuge tube, suspended in 6.2 ml of ice-cold CBS (10 mM citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA; protease) or HBS (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA; proprotease). Buffers at neutral pH were required for proprotease purification to preclude protease activation. Oothecae were squashed against the tube's wall with a spatula and removed. The yolk extract was centrifuged at 6,600 × g for 2 min. A floating lipid layer was discarded, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Protease activity was stable at pH 5.3 for at least 1 week at 40C but decreased rapidly at pH 7.0. Although thiol reagents stimulated activity about 20% during assay, they increased the rate of deactivation during storage. Crude Vt was precipitated from ruptured oothecae in water, egg cases were separated, and Vt was removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g. Crude Vt was dissolved in HBS. All purification steps were carried out at 40C unless noted. The initial step, Sephacryl S-300 HR column chromatography, was employed to purify protease, proprotease, and protease-free Vt. Clarified supernatant (6 ml) containing about 450 mg of protein (day 6) or 1000 mg of protein (day 0) was chromatographed on a Sephacryl column (91 × 2.6 cm diameter) equilibrated in, and then eluted with CBS (protease) or HBS (proprotease and Vt), respectively, using a peristaltic pump at 3 ml/min. Fractions (8 ml) from Sephacryl chromatography were assayed for protease activity with Z-LNE, for protein content, and for absorbance at 280 nm. Active fractions were combined and concentrated using an Amicon filtration unit and a YM 10 membrane. At this stage, the enzyme retained full activity after 48 h at 40C and pH 5.3. Chilled Sepharose-Gly-Phe-Glycinal semicarbazone (3 ml) was equilibrated in CBS, combined with protease ultrafiltration retentate (6 ml, 24 mg of protein) and incubated overnight to assure maximum sample absorption. The mixture was then poured into a 0.8-cm diameter column and washed with 10 ml of modified CBS fortified to 0.5 M in NaCl followed by 10 ml of CBS. Approximately 84% of the enzyme units (Z-LNE) were retained by the support. Column contents were incubated overnight in CBS containing 4 mM HgCl2 at 40C to dissociate the enzyme, which was then eluted with this buffer at room temperature. One aliquot of each fraction was assayed for protein content. A second was incubated in 0.125 M acetate buffer, pH 4.2, containing 40 mMβ-MSH (final concentrations) for 10 min at room temperature to reactivate the enzyme, which was assayed with Z-LNE. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated with a centriprep tube (Mr 10,000 cutoff) and stored at 40C in CBS containing 4 mM Hg2+. Following Sephacryl chromatography, 30 μl of each fraction were acidified as described above for 30 min to activate the putative proenzyme. Control aliquots were incubated in HBS containing β-MSH. Fractions containing acid-activable protease were pooled. The active pool from the previous step (100 ml, 10 mg of protein) was chromatographed on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column, equilibrated with HBS, using a Pharmacia model LCC-500 FPLC system at room temperature. A segmented elution gradient (maximum NaCl concentration 1 M) was programmed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fractions of 1.9 ml were assayed with Z-Phe-Arg-NMec before and after acid activation, and for protein content. The Mono Q pool (13 ml, 0.5 mg of protein) which was approximately 0.25 M in NaCl, was chromatographed on a phenyl Sepharose CL-4B column (0.8 cm diameter, 2 ml bed volume) in HBS containing 0.25 M NaCl. The column was given washes (2 ml each) of HBS containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.05 M NaCl, respectively. Proprotease was eluted using a step gradient with 1 ml each of 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. The column was then washed with 5 ml of water. Fractions (0.8 ml) were assayed for acid-activable protease, conductivity, and protein content. Stability of proprotease in 1% SDS at pH 7.5 permitted preparative SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Prep Cell, model 491) to be used as an alternative last step. The separation gel (1 × 2.8 cm diameter) was composed of 5% acrylamide in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, containing 2.65% cross-linker. The sample buffer was 20 mM phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.13% SDS, 33% glycerol, and 0.08 mg/ml bromphenol blue. The electrode buffers were 6.7 mM phosphate, pH 7.5 (lower chamber), and 6.7 mM phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.067% SDS (upper chamber). Samples (2-5 mg of protein) were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer and electrophoresed at 30 mA and 110 V with an elution rate at 1 ml/min, and fractions of 3.2 ml were collected. Protease generated from acidification of proprotease was always stabilized in either 0.25 M acetate buffer, pH 4.2, or 0.25 M citrate buffer, pH 5.3, each containing 40 mMβ-MSH and used directly in experiments, avoiding prolonged storage. The most purified preparations of protease and proprotease were used in all subsequent studies. To determine the enzyme's pH optimum, 0.25 M citrate buffer was used between pH 1.5 and 6.5, and 0.25 M Tris from pH 7.0 to 9.0. Protease was reactivated (specific activity 342 units (Z-LNE)/mg of protein) and 0.02 μg of protein was assayed in 1 ml of each buffer containing 0.05% Brij 35 and 5 μM Z-Phe-Arg-NMec. Activated proprotease (0.25 μg of protein) was assayed in the same manner. Yolk extract, purified proprotease, or protease were incubated individually with the inhibitors listed in Table I in CBS for 15 min at 300C. Proprotease, 10 μl (11 μg of protein) was activated for 1 h prior to treatment and assay for residual activity. Control preincubations lacked inhibitor. To differentiate cathepsins B and L, the protease's reactivity with Z-Arg-Arg-NMec and stability in 3 M urea (23Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar) were determined.Table I.Comparative effects of selected inhibitors on the enzymatic activities of yolk protease and activated proproteaseInhibitorProtease classConcentrationActivity remaining (%)Crude ExtractPurified proteaseActivated proproteaseNone100a,Crude extract was assayed at pH 3.7 with azoalbulmin.bCrude extract was assayed at pH 4.2 with CBZ-Lys-p-nitrophenyl ester.100100AprotininSerine10 μM100aCrude extract was assayed at pH 3.7 with azoalbulmin.10598EDTAMetallo1 mM100bCrude extract was assayed at pH 4.2 with CBZ-Lys-p-nitrophenyl ester.10090PepstatinAspartic3.5 μg/ml95bCrude extract was assayed at pH 4.2 with CBZ-Lys-p-nitrophenyl ester.8283Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideSerine/papain1 mM94cPurified protease and activated proprotease were assayed at pH 5.5 with CBZ-Phe-Arg-NMec.8268Pefabloc SCSerine0.5 mg/ml81cPurified protease and activated proprotease were assayed at pH 5.5 with CBZ-Phe-Arg-NMec.7871Soybean trypsin inhibitorSerine100 μg/ml85bCrude extract was assayed at pH 4.2 with CBZ-Lys-p-nitrophenyl ester.8687TPCKChymotrypsin100 μM23.5cPurified protease and activated proprotease were assayed at pH 5.5 with CBZ-Phe-Arg-NMec.110.66TLCKSer or Cys100 μM0.43cPurified protease and activated proprotease were assayed at pH 5.5 with CBZ-Phe-Arg-NMec.7.80.08E-64Cysteine5 μM14bCrude extract was assayed at pH 4.2 with CBZ-Lys-p-nitrophenyl ester.00.5LeupeptinSer or Cys25 μg/ml4aCrude extract was assayed at pH 3.7 with azoalbulmin.00.5AntipainSer or Cys100 μM2.5cPurified protease and activated proprotease were assayed at pH 5.5 with CBZ-Phe-Arg-NMec.03.9HgCl2Cysteine200 μM0.98aCrude extract was assayed at pH 3.7 with azoalbulmin.NANAZ-Phe-Ala-CHN2Cathepsin B and L10 μM11aCrude extract was assayed at pH 3.7 with azoalbulmin.0.950.35Z-Phe-Tyr(O-but)-CHN2Cathepsin L10 μM22aCrude extract was assayed at pH 3.7 with azoalbulmin.8.50.37a Crude extract was assayed at pH 3.7 with azoalbulmin.b Crude extract was assayed at pH 4.2 with CBZ-Lys-p-nitrophenyl ester.c Purified protease and activated proprotease were assayed at pH 5.5 with CBZ-Phe-Arg-NMec. Open table in a new tab Lipid-free yolk extract was prepared in HBS at various times following oothecal extrusion. One aliquot was assayed for protease with Z-LNE and for protein concentration. A second was combined with an equal volume of HBS containing a mixture of 8 mM Pefabloc SC, 2 mM pepstatin, and 40 μM E-64, and its peptide composition analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 10%, 15%, and 20% polyacrylamide gels. Ten μl of the Hg2+ form of the protease was reactivated (specific activity 212 units of Z-LNE/mg) and mixed with 10 μl of CBS, pH 5.3, and incubated under toluene vapors with 300 μg of protease-free Vt at 300C. Five-μl aliquots were withdrawn periodically and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Hg2+ protease, incubated with β-MSH-free CBS, pH 5.3, prior to addition of protease-free Vt, served as a control. SDS-PAGE was conducted by a modification (25Thomas J.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) of the Laemmli method (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) at 75 mA/gel as described previously (16Purcell J.P. Kunkel J.G. Nordin J.H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 8: 39-55Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE was run at 200 V by a modification (Sigma bulletin no. MKR-137) of Bryan's procedure (27Bryan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Staining with silver or colloidal Coomassie Blue (Pro-Blue) reagents was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. The procedure of Burnette (28Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar) was used as described (16Purcell J.P. Kunkel J.G. Nordin J.H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 8: 39-55Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using Ponceau S to locate peptides. To detect biotinylated peptides, membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with streptavidin-HRP. Membranes were then incubated with shaking for 1 min in Luminol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to x-ray film in the dark room, generally for 15 s to 2 min. Peptides were labeled with the active site probe biotinyl-Phe-Ala-CHN2, using a method modified from Cullen et al. (29Cullen B.M. Halliday I.M. Kay G. Nelson J. Walker B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sample (25-250 μg of protein) was combined with 40 μl of 100 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.2, containing 10 mMβ-MSH, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Brij 35. Biotinylated probe (5 μl, 6 mM in methanol) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 40C overnight. The reaction was stopped by heating 10 min in a boiling water bath with an equal volume of sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). To distinguish between specific and nonspecific labeling, samples were first preincubated for 10 min at 300C with 100 μM E-64. Biotinylation of covalently bound sugars was done before and after endo H treatment. Following SDS-PAGE and electroblotting on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, oligosaccharides were visualized using the Glyco Track™ system following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified protease, proprotease, or Vt (5 μl, 15 μg of protein in HBS, containing 40 mMβ-MSH) were each combined with 5 μl of 100 μM E-64 in 0.25 M citrate buffer, pH 5.5, and incubated at 40C overnight to preclude proteolysis. Mixtures were added to 5 μl of 1% aqueous SDS and heated 5 min in a boiling water bath. SDS was sequestered by adding 5 μl of 0.5 M citrate buffer, pH 5.5 containing 14% Triton X-100. Five milliunits of endo H (30Trimble R.B. Maley F. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were added, and the tubes were incubated at 370C overnight under toluene vapors. Buffer was substituted for endo H in controls. Reactions were stopped by heating in a boiling water bath with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In vivo, the course of proprotease activation was monitored in yolk extracts from eggs at days 0-6 postovulation prepared in HBS. Samples were incubated with biotinyl-Phe-Ala-CHN2 with, or without, prior treatment with E-64, as described above. Analysis of peptides was conducted using SDS-PAGE and electroblotting. In vitro, proprotease (4 μl, 15 μg of protein) was mixed with 4 μl of 0.25 M citrate buffer, pH 5.3, or with 4 μl of HBS, pH 7.5 (control). The same amount of proprotease in HBS, pH 7.5, was also incubated individually with 2 μl of E-64 (40 μM), Pefabloc SC (4 mg/ml), pepstatin (14 μg/ml), or EDTA (4 mM) at room temperature for 1 h before addition of 2 μl of 0.5 M citrate buffer, pH 5.3. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 300C for an additional 12 h and then heated in a boiling water bath for 1 min with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. Aliquots of purified proprotease (1.1 μg of protein) and purified protease (1.7 ng of protein) were brought to 100 μl with 0.25 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Aliquots of 10 μl were withdrawn every 20 min and assayed with Z-Phe-Arg-NMec. Controls contained water substituted for proprotease or protease. Purified proprotease (1.1 μg of protein) was diluted 10-, 102-, or 104-fold in activation buffer to give total volumes of 0.01, 0.1, and 10 ml, respectively. Aliquots of 0.5, 5, and 500 μl (55 ng of proprotease each) were then removed at intervals of 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min and adjusted to 500 μl with 0.25 M citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 40 mMβ-MSH. (The uniform final volume equalized the possible effect of activation buffer on the protease assay.) This solution was assayed for protease activity with Z-Phe-Arg-NMec. Tests of the crude extract with inhibitors at concentrations effective with the various protease classes (31Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar) showed that the predominant activity is a cathepsin L-like cysteine protease (Table I). Sephacryl S-300 chromatography of the extract afforded a good separation of protease from processed Vt polypeptides (Fig. 1). Three non-protein peaks (fractions 59-65, 75-81, and 84-96) were not investigated further. The pool of fractions 36-58, enriched about 20-fold from the crude extract, was active with Z-Phe-Arg-NMec but not Z-Arg-Arg-NMec, also indicative of cathepsins L. This three-step procedure gave a 300-fold purification of the protease, which could be stored as the Hg2+ form for up to 1 month at pH 5.3 and 40C. Reactivated protease was stable in CBS, pH 5.0, at 40C for at least 12 h. Fig. 2 summarizes the course of purification. Processed Vt peptides (Mr 53,000, 43,000, and 20,000) are major contaminants in crude preparations (lane 1), but the putative protease is evident at Mr 29,000 in the Sephacryl S-300 pool (lane 2) and the purified enzyme (lane 3) contained three peptides of approximately Mr 29,000 (± 2 kDa). Biotinylated enzyme contained three peptides of approximately Mr 29,000 (Fig. 3) with no other probe-sensitive component evident. However, preinc"
https://openalex.org/W2016640457,"The Bacillus subtilis dinR gene encodes a 23-kDa protein that shares about 34% homology with the Escherichia coli LexA protein. We have purified the dinR gene product to near homogeneity, and we describe its activities. The purified DinR protein binds specifically to the promoter regions of three B. subtilis SOS genes: dinB, dinC, and recA. Electrophoretic mobility of DinR-promoter complexes in each case is identical to that of promoters bound by the B. subtilis SOS repressor (Lovett, et al., (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 6842-6849). Analysis of hydroxyl radical footprints of DinR bound to the dinC promoter indicates that DinR interacts with one side of the DNA providing access to the consensus operator site (5′-GAACN4GTTC-3′) within two adjacent major grooves. Consistent with its proposed role as a transcriptional repressor, purified DinR displaces B. subtilis RNA polymerase from the recA promoter and represses transcription of the recA gene in vitro. We also show that purified DinR protein undergoes general base-catalyzed autodigestion as well as RecA-mediated cleavage at the peptide bond between Ala-91 and Gly-92. Corresponding to its cleavage by activated RecA following DNA damage, the level of DinR is significantly reduced in RecA+ B. subtilis cells following exposure to mitomycin C. Thus, the DinR protein is structurally and functionally analogous to the E. coli LexA protein, and accordingly, we propose renaming the protein B. subtilis LexA. The Bacillus subtilis dinR gene encodes a 23-kDa protein that shares about 34% homology with the Escherichia coli LexA protein. We have purified the dinR gene product to near homogeneity, and we describe its activities. The purified DinR protein binds specifically to the promoter regions of three B. subtilis SOS genes: dinB, dinC, and recA. Electrophoretic mobility of DinR-promoter complexes in each case is identical to that of promoters bound by the B. subtilis SOS repressor (Lovett, et al., (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 6842-6849). Analysis of hydroxyl radical footprints of DinR bound to the dinC promoter indicates that DinR interacts with one side of the DNA providing access to the consensus operator site (5′-GAACN4GTTC-3′) within two adjacent major grooves. Consistent with its proposed role as a transcriptional repressor, purified DinR displaces B. subtilis RNA polymerase from the recA promoter and represses transcription of the recA gene in vitro. We also show that purified DinR protein undergoes general base-catalyzed autodigestion as well as RecA-mediated cleavage at the peptide bond between Ala-91 and Gly-92. Corresponding to its cleavage by activated RecA following DNA damage, the level of DinR is significantly reduced in RecA+ B. subtilis cells following exposure to mitomycin C. Thus, the DinR protein is structurally and functionally analogous to the E. coli LexA protein, and accordingly, we propose renaming the protein B. subtilis LexA. The SOS regulatory system, as characterized in the bacterium Escherichia coli, comprises a set of DNA repair and cellular survival genes that are coordinately induced by DNA damage (1Little J.W. Mount D.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 11-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 2Walker G.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 60-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 407-522Google Scholar). The expression of these DNA damage-inducible (din) genes, or SOS genes, is controlled by two proteins (which are themselves products of SOS genes): the LexA protein, which represses SOS gene expression, and the RecA protein, which is activated by a metabolic signal to cause the proteolytic inactivation of LexA. LexA binds to the operator sequences of SOS genes and inhibits their transcription in vitro (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 407-522Google Scholar, 4Brent R. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4204-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 5Little J.W. Mount D.W. Yanisch-Perron C.R. Proc.

Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 376-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), quantitative footprinting studies of LexA binding to the recA operator (7Hurstel S. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Kim B. Little J.W. Science. 1992; 255: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and a comparison of the upstream sequences of the known SOS genes (2Walker G.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 60-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has led to the identification of the so-called SOS box, CTGTN8ACAG, which appears to be the principal recognition site for a LexA dimer. Induction of the SOS genes following DNA damage occurs when RecA, activated by an inducing signal, promotes the proteolytic destruction of LexA. Corresponding to the requirement for an activating signal, RecA is activated for repressor (LexA and certain phage repressors) cleavage in vitro when it binds single-stranded DNA and nucleoside triphosphate to form a ternary complex (9Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. Nature. 1980; 283: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Little J.W. Edmiston S.H. Pacelli L.Z. Mount D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There is strong evidence that for certain DNA damaging treatments, the inducing signal is single-stranded DNA exposed by either the processing or replication of damaged DNA (12Karu A.E. Belk E.D. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1982; 185: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Sassanfar M. Roberts J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). RecA-mediated cleavage of the 22.3 kDa LexA protein occurs at a single site between Ala-84 and Gly-85 (14Horii T. Ogawa T. Nakatani T. Hase T. Matsubara H. Ogawa H. Cell. 1981; 27: 515-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This site is part of a flexible hinge region that separates two functional domains (15Little J.W. Hill S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the amino-terminal domain that binds to the SOS operator and the carboxyl-terminal domain that is involved in dimerization (16Schnarr M. Pouyet J. Granger-Schnarr M. Daune M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2812-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Hurstel S. Granger-Schnarr M. Daune M. Schnarr M. EMBO J. 1988; 5: 793-798Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A significant feature of the cleavage reaction promoted by RecA derives from the observation that LexA, in the absence of RecA, undergoes autodigestion at alkaline pH at the same Ala-Gly bond that is cleaved in the RecA-promoted reaction (18Little J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Thus, contrary to early descriptions of RecA as a highly specific protease, RecA functions as a coprotease to facilitate the cleavage catalyzed by repressor functional groups. Kinetic analysis of the autodigestion reaction indicates that repressor cleavage is intramolecular and involves the deprotonation of an amino acid residue with a pKa of 9.8 (19Slilaty S.N. Rupley J.A. Little J.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6866-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A model for the cleavage mechanism, similar to that for serine proteases, has been proposed in which Ser-119 is activated as a nucleophile by Lys-156 (20Slilaty S.N. Little J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3987-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Lin L.L. Little J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Roland K.L. Little J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12828-12835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterium Bacillus subtilis responds to agents that damage DNA or block DNA replication by inducing an SOS-like system (23Yasbin R.E. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1977; 153: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Love P.E. Yasbin R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 910-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and several components of the B. subtilis SOS-like regulon have been identified. The B. subtilis RecA protein, which cross-reacts strongly with E. coli RecA antibody, is induced by mitomycin C, UV radiation, and nalidixic acid (25Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lovett Jr., C.M. Love P.E. Yasbin R.E. Roberts J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis RecA promotes the cleavage of E. coli LexA repressor in vitro (25Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (27Wojciechowski M.F. Peterson K.R. Love P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6475-6483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lovett Jr., C.M. O'Gara T.M. Woodruff J.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4914-4923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A set of B. subtilis din genes was identified whose induction by DNA damaging treatments is blocked in recA mutants (29Love P.E. Lyle M.J. Yasbin R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6201-6205Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Inspection of the DNA sequences upstream of the B. subtilis din genes revealed a consensus sequence, 5′-GAACN4GTTC-3′, overlapping the dinA, dinB, dinC, and recA promoters (30Cheo D.L. Bayles K.W. Yasbin R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1696-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence was proposed as a possible binding site for the B. subtilis SOS repressor and has since been found overlapping the promoters of the recM13, dnaX (31Alonso J.C. Shirahige K. Ogasawara N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6771-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and dinR (32Raymond-Denise A. Guillen N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7084-7091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genes. Using the din promoter regions to search for the putative SOS repressor, a 23-kDa DNA binding protein was purified that binds specifically to the consensus site and whose binding activity was destroyed by activated B. subtilis RecA protein in vivo and in vitro (33Lovett Jr., C.M. Cho K.C. O'Gara T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B. subtilis dinR gene encodes a 22.8-kDa polypeptide having 34% identity and 47% similarity with the E. coli LexA protein (32Raymond-Denise A. Guillen N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7084-7091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been considered the likely candidate for the B. subtilis lexA analogue. We report here the cloning, overexpression, and purification of the DinR protein, and we show that it has all of the activities of E. coli LexA in vitro: specific binding to din promoters and inhibition of RNA polymerase binding and transcription, autodigestion at high pH, and RecA-mediated cleavage. We also show that the dinR gene codes for the protein previously identified as the SOS repressor (33Lovett Jr., C.M. Cho K.C. O'Gara T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pET21a and BL21(DE3) E. coli cells were purchased from Novagen. The B. subtilis RecA (25Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) protein was purified as described previously. Polyclonal B. subtilis DinR antiserum was prepared by the subcutaneous injection of New Zealand White rabbits with DinR protein of greater than 95% purity. Initially 100 μg of DinR protein suspended in 1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant was injected, and two boosters of 100 μg of DinR suspended in 1 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant were injected at 3-week intervals. The antiserum was collected 10 days after the third injection. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Milligen Cyclone Plus DNA synthesizer. Restriction enzymes, DNA-modifying enzymes, and Taq polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. and Promega and used as recommended by the manufacturers. Affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate and heparin-agarose were purchased from Bio-Rad. Mitomycin C was purchased from Sigma. Nitrocellulose filters were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. RNA polymerase was provided by Leendert Hamoen (University of Groningen). The dinR deletion strain 8G5 (pLGW3) was provided by Bert Jan Hajema (University of Groningen).

Radiolabeled nucleotides were from DuPont NEN. Amino acid analyses were performed by Carol Gross (University of Kentucky). adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiophosphate) isopropylthio-β- galactoside fast performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The lysates used in this study were prepared from bacterial strains grown in LB medium at 37°C and harvested in late log phase (A600 = 0.8). Pelleted cells were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA) per liter of bacterial culture. After addition of lysozyme to 0.2 mg/ml, cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, sonicated for 1 min, and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was either used for mobility shift assays or Western analysis as described below. The coding portion of dinR was amplified from YB886 (34Yasbin R.E. Fields P.I. Anderson B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) chromosomal DNA using a 5′-primer modified such that an NdeI restriction site was introduced at the initial ATG codon (GAGGTGCGACATATGACGAAGCTATC); the 3′-primer (CCCAAAAGTCAGGTCGACCCTG) corresponded to a site downstream of the structural gene (+715) modified to contain a SalI restriction site. After digestion with NdeI and SalI, the polymerase chain reaction product was ligated in NdeI-SalI-digested pET21a, and the ligation mixture was used to transform DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA obtained from DH5α transformants was then transformed into competent BL21(DE3) cells. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing pET21a-dinR was grown in 1 liter of LB broth containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) with shaking until A600 = 0.6. The culture was then induced with 10 ml of IPTG (100 mM) and grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, 5000 × g for 20 min, and then resuspended in 5 ml of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mM EDTA. Cells were lysed with lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) by incubation on ice for 30 min followed by a 15-min incubation at 37°C. After 3 × of freeze-thawing and sonication, debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was used for further purification. The supernatant (0.5-2 ml) was filtered and applied to a 5 ml-heparin-agarose column, equilibrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, and subjected to FPLC chromatography. Following elution with a 40-ml linear NaCl gradient (10 mM to 1 M), fractions containing DinR protein were pooled, concentrated 10-fold by centrifugation in a Centricon 10 unit (Amicon), and diluted to the original volume in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl; concentration and dilution was then repeated twice. A sample was then applied to a Mono S column and chromatographed as described for the heparin-agarose column, and fractions containing DinR were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl and then concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon 10 unit. DNA probes corresponding to the dinC (−30 to +69), dinB (−155 to +70), and recA (−77 to +170) promoter regions were prepared as described previously (33Lovett Jr., C.M. Cho K.C. O'Gara T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crude extract or purified fractions were incubated with one of the radiolabeled DNA fragments for 30 min at 25°C in the following incubation buffer (2Walker G.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 60-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): 12 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 4 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. This incubation mixture (10 μl) was loaded on a 4% (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 80:1) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was begun immediately. The buffer within the gel and the running buffer were both 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 250 mM glycine, and 1 mM EDTA. Samples were electrophoresed at 25 mA, and the dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. B. subtilis strains were treated with 1.0 μg/ml mitomycin C, and cell samples were analyzed by immunoblot transfer as described previously (19Slilaty S.N. Rupley J.A. Little J.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6866-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes containing electrophoretically transferred proteins were incubated with B. subtilis DinR antiserum (diluted 1:1000), followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:3000) essentially as described previously (21Lin L.L. Little J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). DNA containing the dinC promoter region was obtained by EcoRI-ClaI digestion of cesium chloride-purified pPL603-din17 DNA. The 199-base pair dinC fragment (−130 to +69) thus released was then gel purified and radiolabeled at either restriction site. DNase footprinting experiments were performed using reagents from the Promega core footprinting kit as per manufacturer instructions. Samples (50 μl) for hydroxyl radical footprinting were incubated as described for mobility shift assays, without glycerol in the binding buffer, followed by addition of 6 μl of a freshly made mixture of (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O) (0.93 μM), EDTA (1.9 mM), H2O2 (1.1%), and sodium ascorbate (37 mM). After incubation for an empirically determined time period, reactions were stopped by the addition of 44 μl of stop solution (0.7 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, yeast tRNA (0.14 mg/ml), 73 mM thiourea). Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, and resuspension in 4 μl of loading buffer (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.W. Moore D.D Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 12.4.5Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% acrylamide-urea gel and autoradiography. In vitro transcription was analyzed using the “run-off” assay as described (36Moran C.P. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 276-277Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 40 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), and indicated amounts of B. subtilis RNA polymerase, restriction-digested plasmid DNA, and DinR protein. After incubation at 37°C for 15 min, a nucleotide mixture containing [α-32P]CTP was added to give final concentrations of 0.1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM GTP, and 0.1 mM UTP. After incubation at 37°C for 1 min, heparin (0.025%) was added, and the reaction solution was incubated for an additional 10 min before adding CTP (0.1 mM). Reaction was incubated at 37°C for 10 min after CTP addition and then stopped by the addition of stop solution (0.05% bromphenol blue and 0.05% xylene blue in formamide). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 9% acrylamide-urea gel and autoradiography. Template DNA was a HindIII-ClaI fragment from plasmid pBT61 containing the recA promoter region and ending at +292 of the recA structural gene; the recA run-off transcript was identified by comparison with ethidium bromide-stained molecular weight markers (not shown) run alongside the transcription reactions. Reaction mixtures, typically containing 10 μM DinR in 100 mM boric acid buffer adjusted to the appropriate pH, were incubated at 37°C. After selected times, aliquots of the reaction were removed, added to 6 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer to stop the reaction, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (13%). After staining gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the cleavage activity was analyzed by scanning uncleaved DinR and cleavage fragments using an Alpha Innotech IS-1000 digital imaging system. Cleavage of DinR by B. subtilis RecA protein was assayed as described previously (25Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 60 mM NaCl, 30 mM MgCl2, and indicated amounts of RecA, DinR, nucleoside triphosphate, and ϕx174 single-stranded DNA. The reactions were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (13%) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we produced the dinR gene with unique NdeI and SalI sites located at the beginning and end of the structural gene, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). We inserted the promoterless NdeI/SalI-ended dinR gene in plasmid pET21a such that dinR expression is controlled by bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals. The T7 promoter also contains the lac operator to minimize expression in the absence of an inducer. After transfer to an E. coli host containing a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase, under the control of lacUV5 promoter, the DinR protein was induced by IPTG to comprise more than 40% of the total cellular protein (Fig. 1). We found that the DinR protein binds tightly to heparin-agarose, which is commercially available as prepacked columns from Bio-Rad or Pharmacia, either of which can be used with an FPLC system. Crude extract from lysed cells was applied directly to a heparin-agarose column and eluted with an NaCl gradient. As illustrated in Fig. 1, DinR protein is purified to near homogeneity by heparin-agarose chromatography, eluting at about 250 mM NaCl. Subsequent chromatography on either Mono S or Superose 12 FPLC columns does not provide any further purification as judged by the specific activity of the protein (DNA binding activity per total protein). Fig. 1 shows that DinR migrates in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel with an apparent Mr of about 27,000; however, amino acid analysis of the purified protein indicates an Mr of 22,823, consistent with the primary structure predicted from the DNA sequence (32Raymond-Denise A. Guillen N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7084-7091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the Mr determined by SDS-PAGE for B. subtilis RecA is also significantly larger than the actual size (25Lovett Jr., C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This behavior is not observed for the E. coli RecA and LexA proteins that are about the same size as the corresponding B. subtilis proteins. The putative SOS repressor, previously purified by affinity chromatography, binds specifically to the SOS boxes (GAACN4GTTC) of the B. subtilis dinA, dinB, dinC, and recA genes (33Lovett Jr., C.M. Cho K.C. O'Gara T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conducted mobility shift assays with purified DinR protein and the promoter regions of B. subtilis dinB, dinC, and recA genes. Fig. 2A shows that the DinR protein retards the mobility of DNA fragments containing recA (−77 to +34), dinB (−155 to +70), and dinC (−130 to +69) promoter regions. To determine if additional cellular proteins (not present in the E. coli strain from which DinR was purified) might be involved in din promoter binding in B. subtilis, we ran samples containing purified DinR alongside samples containing crude extract from YB1015 (recA4) B. subtilis cells (it was previously shown that the putative SOS repressor produces mobility shifts with din promoters that are identical to those produced by these crude extracts (33Lovett Jr., C.M. Cho K.C. O'Gara T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In every case, DinR causes mobility shifts that are visually indistinguishable from those produced by crude extract. By contrast, a B. subtilis strain, 8G5(pLGW3), in which the dinR gene has been deleted, does not cause a detectable shift (Fig. 2B). The mobility shifts caused by DinR with each of the din promoters are abolished by the addition of excess unlabeled DNA containing any of the other din promoters. Fig. 2A shows mobility shift assays using the radiolabeled recA promoter fragment and subsaturating amounts of DinR. In the presence of a 20-fold molar excess of either dinB or dinC promoter DNA, the recA promoter fragment shift is not detectable; however, a 20-fold molar excess of the recA promoter region lacking the SOS box has no inhibitory effect. The dinC promoter contains two SOS boxes that results in two shifted bands at sub-saturating concentrations of either crude extract or purified repressor (33Lovett Jr., C.M. Cho K.C. O'Gara T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that purified DinR causes two distinct bands at subsaturating concentrations that are visually indistinguishible from those produced by B. subtilis crude extract or repressor that has been affinity purified from B. subtilis; at higher concentrations of DinR, only the larger complex is formed. We conducted DNase and hydroxyl radical footprinting analyses on the binding of DinR to the dinC operator (Fig. 3). The DNase results show protection of the two consensus sequences as well as hypersensitivity to DNase digestion at sites flanking these sequences. Hydroxyl radical footprinting indicates specific contacts along the DNA backbone; all of the sites protected by hydroxyl radical coincide with the DNase footprints. To determine where DinR interacts with the DNA closely enough to preclude penetration by hydroxyl radicals, we mapped graphically the protected DNA sites on a DNA model using SYBYL software (Tripos Associates Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstation. The modeling results indicate that all of the protected sites are on one face of the helix as shown for one of the two dinC boxes in Fig. 4. Inspection of the protected face reveals that the base pairs corresponding to the entire consensus site are accessible in two adjacent major grooves of the DNA. To confirm that DinR protein acts as a transcriptional repressor we tested the ability of DinR to prevent binding of B. subtilis RNA polymerase to din promoters and inhibit their transcription in vitro. Fig. 5A shows a mobility shift assay using the recA promoter fragment and B. subtilis RNA polymerase in the absence and presence of DinR protein. The addition of RNA polymerase holoenzyme retards significantly the mobility of the recA promoter fragment. When a subsaturating amount of DinR is included, the amount of RNA polymerase bound to the DNA is reduced, and a shift corresponding to the DinR-DNA complex appears. Thus, DinR inhibits the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter. The fact that no other shifts are visible indicates that the two proteins do not bind simultaneously to the promoter fragment. Consistent with its ability to inhibit binding of RNA polymerase to the recA promoter, DinR protein inhibits the in vitro transcription of DNA from the recA promoter (Fig. 5B). Although the degree of sequence homology is limited, the LexA catalytic residues (Ser-119 and Lys-156) are conserved in DinR (Ser-127 and Lys-165), suggesting that the cleavage mechanism has been conserved. We conducted autodigestion assays with DinR over a range of pH values essentially as described by Little (18Little J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows typical autodigestion assays in which DinR was incubated at 37°C. The reaction is first order in repressor concentration, and the apparent rate constants are independent of initial repressor concentration. Amino acid sequence analyses of the cleaved protein fragments revealed the cleavage site to be the specific peptide bond between Ala-91 and Gly-92 (corresponding to the LexA site between Ala-84 and Gly-85). Fig. 7 shows the pH dependence of the autodigestion reaction. As with E. coli LexA, the pH dependence suggests that the deprotonation of a single ionizable group is required for activity. Fitting the data to the equation for a single ionizable base gives values for the rate constant and the pKa of the basic catalytic group, Thus, DinR autodigestion appears to depend on a general base with a pKa of about 10.3, and the reaction has a kmax of 1.8 × 10−4 s−1. The corresponding values for LexA at 37°C are 9.8 and 2.5 × 10−3 s−1, respectively (19Slilaty S.N. Rupley J.A. Little J.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6866-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the pKa for λ repressor autodigestion is also 9.8, while the rate is 40-fold slower than for LexA (19Slilaty S.N. Rupley J.A. Little J.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6866-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although we have not made direct comparisons of LexA and DinR autodigestion reactions under identical conditions, the 10-fold slower rate and the difference in pKa values seem significant. According to the E. coli model, RecA protein, when activated by an inducing signal, promotes the cleavage of LexA repressor at physiological pH. There is evidence that in both E. coli and B. subtilis, the inducing si"

Such cross-linking caused the 70-kDa fragment to become associated irreversibly to cell layers and was greater in cells treated with lysophosphatidic acid, an enhancer of fibronectin assembly and strong modulator of cell shape. Cross-linking of the 70-kDa fragment with factor XIIIa was to molecules that migrated in discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels at the top of the 3.3% stacking gel and near the top of the separating gel. Estimated sizes of these large apparent molecular mass molecules (LAMMs) were ≫3 MDa and ~3 MDa. The label in 70-kDa fragment conjugated with 125I-sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)-1,3′-dithiopropionate was associated with ≫3-MDa LAMMs without reduction and with ~3-MDa LAMMs after reduction and transfer of the cleavable label. The LAMMs were expressed on monolayer cells shortly after adherence, required both 1% Triton X-100 and 2 M urea for efficient extraction, and were susceptible to digestion with trypsin but not to cathepsin D digestion. Complexes of 125I-70-kDa fragment and LAMMs were also susceptible to limited acid digestion and Glu-C protease digestion but were not cleaved by chondroitin lyase or heparitinase. Neither the uncleaved complexes nor the cleavage products were immunoprecipitated with anti-fibronectin antibodies directed toward epitopes outside the 70-kDa region.

INTRODUCTIONFibronectin is a major extracellular protein that is necessary for normal embryogenesis (1George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin exists as a soluble protomer at near micromolar concentrations in blood plasma and other body fluids and in an insoluble multimeric form in extracellular matrix (2Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 3Mosher, D. F., (ed) (1989) Fibronectin, Academic Press, San Diego.Google Scholar). Insoluble tissue fibronectin has several likely biological functions, including promotion of cellular migration during embryogenesis and wound healing (4Colvin R.B. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 213-254Google Scholar, 5Gailit J. Clark R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 6Thiery J.-P. Duband J.-L. Dufour S. Savagner P. Imhof B.A. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 181-212Google Scholar). During gastrulation of Xenopus laevis, polarized fibronectin fibrils are thought to guide migrating mesoderm to its target region (7Winklbauer R. Nagel M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 573-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Local perturbation of the fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix of Xenopus gastrulae correlates with localized randomization of left-right asymmetries later in development (8Yost H.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Since fibronectin is primarily functional in its insolubilized state, the polymerization of fibronectin has importance similar to that of the fibrinogen-to-fibrin conversion. There is no evidence that a modifying proteolytic event, as with the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin monomer, triggers polymerization of fibronectin. Unlike collagens and laminins (9Yurchenco P.D. O'Rear J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), plasma fibronectin does not self-polymerize in physiologically relevant solutions. Strategies that have worked to induce self-polymerization of plasma fibronectin reproducibly include incubation with denaturants (10Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduction of disulfides (11Williams E.C. Janmey P.A. Johnson R.B. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5911-5914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sakai K. Fujii T. Hayashi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), incubation with peptides based on a specific sequence of fibronectin (13Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and exposure to shear forces at air-liquid or liquid-solid interfaces (14Ejim O.S. Blunn G.W. Brown R.A. Biomaterials. 1993; 14: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Brown R.A. Blunn G.W. Ejim O.S. Biomaterials. 1994; 15: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There is little passive accumulation of fibronectin in pre-existing extracellular matrix (16Barry E.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10464-10469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rather, assembly of fibronectin requires cells and takes place at specialized sites on cell surfaces (18Peters D.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding to these sites is mediated by the N-terminal modules of fibronectin, especially modules I-1 through I-5 (19Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Quade B.J. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19602-19609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of cells synthesize and secrete forms of fibronectin that are spliced differently from the plasma form, but all have the N-terminal modules. These cellular isoforms have a greater tendency for self-polymerization than plasma fibronectin (2Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Cultured fibroblasts, however, direct assembly of both plasma fibronectin (present in serum-containing culture medium) and fibroblast-derived, alternatively spliced fibronectin (17Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Allio A.E. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 135: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Peters D.M. Portz L.M. Fullenwider J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, the rules for assembly seem the same for both plasma and cellular fibronectin. Reagents that block assembly of fibronectin in cell culture also block assembly of fibronectin in the blastula (24Darribère T. Guida K. Larjava H. Johnson K.E. Yamada K.M. Thiery J.-P. Boucaut J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Darribère T. Koteliansky V.E. Chernousov M.A. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Thiery J.-P. Boucaut J.-C. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cultured cells and granulation tissue of healing wounds have co-linear transmembranous associations of fibronectin-containing extracellular matrix fibers and bundles of actin microfilaments localized at dense submembranous plaques (26Singer I.I. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 139-162Google Scholar). Somehow, therefore, the intracellular cytoskeleton determines the pattern of assembly of extracellular matrix and/or the extracellular matrix determines the pattern of assembly of intracellular cytoskeleton.We had studied previously the effects of activated factor XIII (factor XIIIa, plasma transglutaminase) on the incorporation of fibronectin and its N-terminal fragments into extracellular matrix by cultured fibroblasts (16Barry E.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10464-10469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Barry E.L.R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4179-4185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When factor XIIIa was included in the binding medium, accumulation of 125I-fibronectin in the deoxycholate-insoluble matrix was increased in the form of cross-linked nonreducible high molecular weight aggregates. Factor XIIIa also cross-linked 125I-labeled 27- and 70-kDa N-terminal fragments into high molecular weight aggregates that could not be extracted from cell layers with deoxycholate. The characteristics of the cross-linked partners were similar to those reported when bound 27-kDa fragment was cross-linked with the membrane-impermeable reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (28Limper A.H. Quade B.J. LaChance R.M. Birkenmeier T.M. Rangwala T.S. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9697-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or cellular fibronectin was derivatized, bound to cells, and cross-linked with photoactivable agents (29Perkins M.E. Ji T.H. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1979; 16: 941-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These previous cross-linking studies are clouded by several unknowns: presence of pre-existing matrix, long incubation times, and, when photoactivable cross-linkers were not used, possibility of cross-linking of receptors to other molecules or to multiple labeled ligand during the exposure to cross-linkers. Another shortcoming inherent to this analytical approach is the absence of an unequivocal way to distinguish between cross-linking events with cell surface molecules critical for fibrillogenesis (“productive”) and events that are specific yet irrelevant to matrix assembly (“nonproductive”). We reasoned that we could deal with these problems using cells stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), 1The abbreviations used are: LPAlysophosphatidic acidLAMMslarge apparent molecular mass moleculesPAGEpolyacrylamide gelsSASDsulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)-1,3′-dithiopropionateFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. a specific up-regulator of fibronectin binding and assembly (30Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because fibronectin binding is as responsive to stimulation by LPA when cells spread shortly after dense seeding as when cells become confluent days after sparse seeding, we could compare cross-linking in monolayers of cells with little or no matrix shortly after seeding and abundant matrix upon reaching confluence. Furthermore, the addition and withdrawal of LPA cycles cells so rapidly between assembly-competent and assembly-deficient phenotypes (30Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that one would expect minimal changes in the composition of molecules on the surface of cells and in the extracellular matrix. Thus, binding to molecules not at assembly sites, i.e. to molecules at sites irrelevant to and nonproductive of assembly, should be the same in control and LPA-treated cultures, and a comparison of the cross-linked complexes following the binding in the absence and presence of LPA should identify the labile receptor molecules.RESULTSThe purpose of the present studies was to characterize the cell surface molecules responsible for binding and assembly of fibronectin. Fibronectin matrix assembly is highly regulated, such that addition or withdrawal of LPA rapidly causes a 2-4-fold stimulation or less, respectively, of the binding of fibronectin or the 70-kDa fragment to cell layers of MG63 osteosarcoma cells or human foreskin fibroblasts (30Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Checovich W.J. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the 70-kDa fragment is to a single class of binding sites on unstimulated and LPA-stimulated cells, with increases of both avidity and number of binding sites upon stimulation (30Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C inhibitors, in contrast, cause a 5-10-fold decrease in binding (42Somers C.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22277-22280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies of cells treated to be assembly-competent or assembly-deficient, therefore, will yield information about the molecules that comprise the labile binding sites. The N-terminal 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin binds reversibly to cells in monolayer culture with the same avidity as the initial reversible binding of intact fibronectin (20McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The fragment consists of an N-terminal domain of 27 kDa and a 40-kDa gelatin-binding domain (2Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 3Mosher, D. F., (ed) (1989) Fibronectin, Academic Press, San Diego.Google Scholar). Near the N terminus is a glutamine residue that is attacked by factor XIIIa (43McDonagh R.P. McDonagh J. Petersen T.E. Thøgersen H.C. Skorstengaard K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 127: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The five type I modules of the 27-kDa domain are most important for binding (19Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Quade B.J. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19602-19609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the adjacent gelatin-binding domain does not bind specifically to cell layers (44Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F.J. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the gelatin-binding domain must contribute to the binding, because the whole 70-kDa fragment has approximately 10-fold higher avidity for the binding site (Kd is 3 nM on LPA-treated cells (30Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)) than the isolated 27-kDa domain (20McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 44Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F.J. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our cross-linking studies, therefore, were done with the 70-kDa fragment used at concentrations in which binding sites would be 5-20% saturated with ligand.Fig. 1 shows PhosphorImager scans of discontinuous SDS gels of 125I-70-kDa fragment bound to MG63 osteosarcoma cells for 60 min, cross-linked with factor XIIIa for 5 min, and reduced prior to electrophoresis. The fragment was cross-linked into complexes that migrated at the top of separating gel or failed to enter the stacking gel. In this and other experiments, there was diffuse radioactivity below the top of the running gel and in the stacking gel of lanes containing the cross-linked samples. Cross-linking into both types of complexes was enhanced 3-4-fold in cell layers treated with LPA and diminished in cell layers incubated with unlabeled 70-kDa fragment or H7 kinase inhibitor. In control studies, no cross-linking was seen if thrombin-activated factor XIII or Ca2+ was omitted from the 5-min cross-linking step (data not shown). Similar cross-linking profiles were observed with NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (data not shown) and human foreskin fibroblasts (see below).After factor XIIIa cross-linking, approximately 60% of bound 70-kDa fragment was associated irreversibly with cell layers and not released back to the medium during a 6-h chase (Fig. 2A). Without cross-linking, most of the bound 70-kDa fragment re-appeared in the medium in the same period of time (Fig. 2A). To characterize the cross-linked complex, solubility in Triton and urea was examined. Cross-linked 70-kDa fragment at the tops of the stacking gel or the separating gel could not be extracted with either 1% Triton X-100 or 2 M urea. The combination of 1% Triton X-100 and 2 M urea extracted the bands almost completely (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Association of 125I-70-kDa fragment of fibronectin with osteosarcoma cells after cross-linking. Cells were incubated for 60 min with 125I-70-kDa fragment and 200 nM LPA, washed, and cross-linked with factor XIIIa, 10 μg/ml, for 5 min. A, cell layers with (XL) or without (No XL) factor XIIIa cross-linking were incubated for 6 h with Tyrode's buffer containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine albumin. At the designated time points, small portions of medium were sampled to quantify dissociation of specifically bound 70-kDa fragment. Each point represents the average of duplicate values that varied <5%. B, the factor XIIIa cross-linked cell layers were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 or 2 M urea or 1% Triton X-100 plus 2 M urea for 10 min. The remaining pellets were extracted with 2% SDS.

At the highest concentration of unlabeled 70-kDa fragment, binding and cross-linking were 18-20% of control. Cross-linking was also inhibited by monodansylcadaverine, which competes for protein-protein cross-linking and incorporates into factor XIIIa-reactive glutamines (Fig. 4). Quantification with a PhosphorImager indicated that the radioactivity missing from the top could be accounted for by radioactivity at the position of the monomer. Cross-linking to form the labeled band at the top of the separating gel, however, was not inhibited at the same rate as cross-linking to form the labeled band at the top of the stacking gel.Fig. 3Dose responses of inhibition of binding and factor XIIIa-mediated cross-linking of 125I-70-kDa fragment by unlabeled fragment. Foreskin fibroblasts were incubated 60 min with 125I-70-kDa fragment and LPA followed by a wash and 5-min incubation with factor XIIIa. Cell layers were extracted with 2% SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Variable amounts of unlabeled 70-kDa fragment were present in the 60-min incubation. Binding of labeled fragment (70-kDa) and amounts of cross-linked fragment at the top of the stacker (Top) and near the top of the separating gel (Int) were quantified by phosphorimaging and expressed as % of values determined when no unlabeled fragment was present.

Osteosarcoma cells were incubated with 125I-70-kDa fragment and LPA for 60 min followed by a wash and 5-min incubation with factor XIIIa except that variable amounts of dansylcadaverine were present during the 5-min incubation with factor XIIIa. Actual counts from PhosphorImager scans are plotted versus dansylcadaverine concentration. Radioactivity lost from the top of the stacking gel (Top) and from near the top of the separating gel (Int) was found at the position of the monomer (70-kDa). The reaction schemes show how incorporation of dansylcadaverine (CadD) into a reactive glutamine (Q) of protein P1 competes for ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine (EK) cross-links between proteins P1 and P2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to study the influence of preformed fibronectin-containing extracellular matrix, osteosarcoma cells and foreskin fibroblasts were studied shortly after plating on vitronectin-coated plates or at confluence without or with LPA stimulation. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated scant organized fibronectin in freshly seeded cells (see Fig. 8B) and copious fibronectin matrices in confluent cultures (data not shown). Under all conditions, >60% of 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment or fibronectin remained insoluble in 1% Triton X-100 when cell layers were extracted after cross-linking; the Triton-insoluble fractions are shown in Fig. 5. Treatment with LPA resulted in increased cross-linking of the 70-kDa fragment to both cell types under both culture conditions (Fig. 5A). Similarly, 125I-fibronectin was cross-linked to bands at the top of the stacker and at the top of the separating gel in all four types of samples (Fig. 5B). The major difference in cross-linking patterns was a band somewhat larger than monomeric fibronectin (300 kDa) that was seen when the 70-kDa fragment was cross-linked. This band was most prominent in extracts of foreskin fibroblasts after 3 days in culture. Occasionally, several bands with sizes less than 200 kDa were observed, but this was not a reproducible finding.Fig. 8Localization of bound 70-kDa fragment and pre-existing fibronectin on cell surface. MG63 cells were cultured for 4 h on a vitronectin-coated coverslip and then incubated for 1 h with FITC-70-kDa fragment, 13 μg/ml, and 200 nM LPA in Tyrode's solution containing 0.2% albumin. The coverslip was washed, and cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Fibronectin was stained with IST-2 followed by rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG.

Cell layers were studied 4 h after dense seeding in vitronectin-coated wells in the absence of serum or 3 days after sparse seeding and culture in fetal bovine serum until confluent. Layers were incubated for 60 min with labeled protein without (−) or with (+) 200 nM LPA, washed, and cross-linked with factor XIIIa, 10 μg/ml, for 5 min. Cell layers were first extracted by 1% Triton X-100, and the Triton-insoluble materials were collected with 2% SDS sample buffer and analyzed.

Cellular targets of the cross-linking, however, potentially could be cross-linked to one another or to other molecules as well as to the labeled ligand during the exposure to factor XIIIa. Such cross-linking could account for the extraordinarily large apparent size of the complexes. Therefore, we compared results obtained with factor XIIIa with those obtained with SASD, a heterobifunctional, iodinatable, cleavable, photoreactive cross-linking agent that has been proven useful in a variety of situations, such as identification of the receptor for interleukin-3 (35Sorensen P. Farber N.M. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9094-9097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The advantages of SASD are that the only cross-linking events should be between the ligand and the molecules that bind the ligand and that the label is in part transferred (trans-labeling) to the binding molecules after reduction.125I-SASD·;70-kDa fragment was bound to confluent fibroblasts, and cross-linking was initiated by photolysis. With increasing time of irradiation, photoaffinity labeling was initially to the band at the top of the separating gel and, later, at the top of stacking gel when products were analyzed under nonreducing condition (Fig. 6). In control experiments, no high molecular weight complexes were generated if fibronectin or 70-kDa fragment labeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method was treated by photolysis in solution or bound to cell surface (data not shown). Cross-linked 125I-SASD-ligand was not solubilized with 1% Triton (data not shown). Upon reduction, part of the radioactive signal was transferred to the molecules that migrated near the top of the separating gel, with an apparent size similar to that obtained with factor XIIIa-mediated cross-linking of 70-kDa fragment. The major difference between factor XIIIa- and SASD-mediated cross-linking was the persistence of label at the top of the stacking gel in the factor XIIIa cross-linked samples after reduction. In order to learn whether this was an artifact of factor XIIIa cross-linking of the cellular targets to each other or other large molecules, the cell surface molecules were first exposed to factor XIIIa and then probed with 125I-SASD·;70-kDa fragment (Fig. 7). Upon reduction, the radioactive signal present at the top of the stacker became diminished, and increased label was detected at the top of the separating gel and at the position of the 70-kDa fragment, just as in the sample generated without the pretreatment with factor XIIIa. This observation suggests that the redistribution of the label upon reduction of the samples probably represents the dissociation of multiple 70-kDa fragments from the targets. The cell surface molecules to which 125I-70-kDa fragment cross-linked after specific binding to assembly sites, therefore, have an extraordinary Large Apparent Molecular Mass, which, in the absence of further characterization, we shall refer to as “LAMMs.”Fig. 6Cross-linking with a bifunctional photoactivable reagent, 125I-SASD·;70-kDa. Confluent human foreskin fibroblasts were incubated for 1 h with 125I-SASD·;70-kDa fragment and 200 nM LPA in Tyrode's buffer containing 0.2% albumin. After washing, cells were photolyzed for increasing amounts of time (0-10 min) and then extracted with SDS sample buffer. Cell lysates were analyzed on a 3.3/8% SDS-PAGE with or without reduction followed by scanning of radioactive bands. The 70-kDa fragment in some lanes ran off the gel. Phosphorimaging quantitation of the 10-min photolysis showed that the radioactive signal at the top of the gel decreased from 35,000 to 11,000, while signal from the interface band increased from 9,000 to 22,000 upon reduction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Photoaffinity labeling of factor XIIIa cross-linked cell surface molecules with 125I-SASD·;70-kDa fragment.

We report the properties of the respective permeases that complemented E. coli Glc− Man− mutants. Although the V. furnissii Glc-specific permease (55,941 Da) shares 38% identity with E. coli IIGlc (ptsG), it is 67% identical to MalX of the E. coli maltose operon (Reidl, J., and Boos, W. (1991) J. Bacteriol. 173, 4862-4876). An adjacent open reading frame encodes a protein with 52% identity to E. coli MalY. Glc phosphorylation requires only V. furnissii MalX and the accessory phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system proteins. The V. furnissii equivalent of IIGlc was not found in the 25,000 transformants screened. The GlcNAc/Glc-specific permease (52,894 Da) shares 47% identity with the N-terminal, hydrophobic domain of E. coli IINag, but is unique among IINag proteins in that it lacks the C-terminal domain and thus requires IIIGlc for sugar fermentation in vivo and phosphorylation in vitro. While there are similarities between the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system of V. furnissii and enteric bacteria, the differences may be important for survival of V. furnissii in the marine environment."

https://openalex.org/W2004233245,"The 141-residue ArsC arsenate reductase of plasmid R773 has an essential cysteine residue, Cys-12. The pKa of Cys-12 was determined to be 6.4, compared with a pKa of 8.3 for free cysteine. The possibility of the formation of an ion pair between Cys-12 and a basic residue was investigated. Enzymatic activity was rapidly inactivated by the histidine-modifying reagent diethylpyrocarbonate. The codons for the two histidine residues in ArsC, His-8 and His-88, were changed by site-directed mutagenesis. Cells expressing arsCH88R, arsCH88S, arsCH88W, or arsCH88V genes retained arsenate resistance, and the purified proteins had wild type level of reductase activity. Cells expressing arsCH8P, arsCH8S, arsCH8G, or arsCH8R genes were each sensitive to arsenate, and the purified H8P, H8G, and H8R proteins each lacked enzymatic activity. Using the single histidine proteins it was shown that both histidines react with diethylpyrocarbonate but that only reaction with His-8 resulted in inactivation. The pKa value of Cys-12 was determined to be 6.3 in the H8R enzyme and 8.3 in the H8G enzyme. These results indicate that His-8 is essential for catalytic activity and that a positively charged residue is required at position 8 to lower the pKa of the cysteine thiolate at position 12.

Arsenical resistance (ars) operons of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria confer resistance to the toxic oxyanions arsenite (As(III)), antimonite (Sb(III)), and arsenate (As(V)) (1Dey, S., Rosen, B.

Resistance to arsenate in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms requires the product of the arsC gene, an arsenate reductase that generates arsenite, the substrate of the resistance pump (4Ji G.

The reaction catalyzed by the ArsC enzyme of plasmid R773 requires reduced glutathione and glutaredoxin, suggesting that reduction involves sulfhydryl chemistry. Recently Cys-12 was shown to be essential for catalytic activity of enzyme (7Liu J. Gladysheva T.B. Lee L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13476-13572Google Scholar). The pKa value of free cysteine in solution is 8.3, considerably higher than pH optimum of the ArsC-catalyzed reaction, which is in the range of 6.3 to 6.6 (6Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7287-7293Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The pKa value of cysteine residues in the active site of a number of enzymes have been shown to be lowered by the formation of an ion pair with a proximate basic residue (8Polgár L.

For that reason the role of histidine residues was investigated. diethylpyrocarbonate 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. ArsC has only two histidine residues, His-8 and His-88. The codons for these two residues were individually changed by site-directed mutagenesis. The phenotype of cells expressing arsCH88X mutants (where X can be one of several substitutions) was indistinguishable from wild type, and the corresponding purified gene products each had wild type ArsC properties. Cells expressing arsCH8X mutants lost arsenate resistance, and the purified gene products were each catalytically inactive. When the ArsC enzymes were reacted with DEPC, there was a correlation between the rate of DEPC inactivation and formation of N-carbethoxylated His-8. The pKa of Cys-12 thiolate was nearly 2 units lower in the wild type enzyme than in a H8G enzyme. These results indicate that His-8 is an essential residue of the reductase, with one critical function being to lower the pKa of Cys-12.

Mutations in the sequence of the arsC gene were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites™ in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). The arsC gene inserted into the multiple cloning site of pALTER-1 vector (Promega) was used as the template (7Liu J. Gladysheva T.B. Lee L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13476-13572Google Scholar). Degenerate oligonucleotides were used to introduce mutations in the codons for His-8 and His-88. The identity of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing of each mutant gene (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (52237) Google Scholar). Single-stranded plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAGEN DNA purification system (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Sequencing was performed by using the internal DNA labeling (Cy5™-dATP labeling mix) with the T7 DNA polymerase Cy5™ AutoRead™ Sequencing kit and an ALF-express DNA Sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc). To construct the double mutants arsCH8R/C106S and arsCH88R/C12S, plasmids containing the arsCH8R, arsCC12S, arsCH88R, or arsCC106S genes were individually digested with restriction enzymes AlwNI and Eco47III. The fragments containing the two desired mutations were ligated together and transformed into E. coli strain JM109, with selection for ampicillin resistance. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of each entire mutated arsC gene. ArsC enzymes were purified and reductase activity assayed as described previously (6Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7287-7293Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). ArsC concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 3960 M−1 cm−1 (7Liu J. Gladysheva T.B. Lee L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13476-13572Google Scholar), by a micromodification of the method of Lowry et al. (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or using a Coomassie protein assay (Bio-Rad). Prior to use diethylpyrocarbonate was diluted with anhydrous ethanol and kept under nitrogen. The concentration of DEPC was determined spectrophotometrically with 10 mM imidazole using a molar extinction coefficient of 3200 M−1 cm−1 (16Melchior Jr., W.B. Fahrney D. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 17Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol was removed from the protein prior to reaction with DEPC with a Sephadex G-25 spin column (18Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding varying concentrations of DEPC to the enzyme under nitrogen in a buffer consisting of 50 mM MOPS/MES, pH 6.5, or 10 mM sodium or potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, as noted, at 25°C. At intervals portions of 10-20 μl were removed and diluted into 1 ml of the arsenate reductase assay buffer for estimation of enzymatic activity. The rate of inactivation as a function of pH was fit to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Enzfitter (Elsevier-BIOSOFT, Cambridge, UK). To reverse DEPC inactivation DEPC-inactivated ArsC (50 μM) was rapidly diluted 2-fold with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 M hydroxylamine. After incubation at 25°C for the indicated times, excess reagents were removed with a spin column, and enzymatic activity was assayed. As a control unmodified ArsC was given the same treatment. The number of N-carbethoxyhistidine residues formed during the reaction with DEPC was determined by difference spectroscopy at 240 nm. Tyrosine modification was estimated from the decrease in absorbance at 278-280 nm in the presence and absence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (19Bredderman P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 61: 298-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The number of cysteine residues in ArsC was estimated from the reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (DTNB) in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride using molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 M−1 cm−1 (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20862) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol was removed from the enzyme with a Sephadex G-25 spin column before reaction of ArsC with DTNB. Varying amounts of a stock solution of 1 mM DTNB in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was added to 1 ml of the same buffer at 25°C containing 50 μM ArsC, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured as a function of time. Samples of 10-20 μl were removed at intervals for determination of residual reductase activity. pH titrations were conducted in a buffer containing 1 mM each of sodium citrate, sodium borate, and sodium phosphate adjusted to the indicated pH values with NaOH or HCl. The reported pH values were determined at the end of the reaction. The rate of inactivation as a function of pH was fit to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Enzfitter. Since the thiolate anion has greater absorbance at 240 nm than the unionized thiol group, difference spectroscopy can be used to measure the thiolate concentration as a function of pH (21Nelson J.W. Creightow T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 22Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The pKa was determined from the absorption of ArsC (1-2 mg/ml) in a buffer containing 1 mM each of sodium citrate, sodium borate, and sodium phosphate adjusted to the indicated pH values with NaOH or HCl. Since the C12S ArsC lacks the thiolate of interest, the pKa of Cys-12 could be determined from the difference in absorbance at 240 nm between this protein and ArsC proteins containing Cys-12, fitting the data to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Enzfitter. All restriction enzymes and nucleic acid modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. The Altered Sites™ in vitro Mutagenesis System was obtained from Promega. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Macromolecular Core Facility of Wayne State University, School of Medicine. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Reductase activity was rapidly inactivated by treatment with DEPC, with t1/2 = 3.5 min (Fig. 1). Inactivation was a pseudo-first order process with respect to DEPC. At 20 mM sodium arsenate gave substantial protection, increasing t1/2 to 20 min. Phosphate, a weak competitive inhibitor, gave slight protection at 50 mM (t1/2 = 5.5 min). DEPC is known to modify histidine residues in proteins. His-8 and His-88 was individually changed to several different residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Cells of E. coli strain AW10 bearing the mutated arsC genes on one plasmid and wild type arsA and arsB genes on a compatible plasmid were examined for arsenate resistance (Fig. 2). AW10 (Δars::cam) is sensitive to 0.1 mM sodium arsenate (12Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the wild type arsC gene in trans with the arsA and arsB genes are resistant to at least 10 mM sodium arsenate (shown only to 1.5 mM in Fig. 2), but cells bearing only arsC gene or only arsA and arsB genes are sensitive to 0.1 mM sodium arsenate (7Liu J. Gladysheva T.B. Lee L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13476-13572Google Scholar). Cells bearing the arsCH8S, arsCH8P, arsCH8G, or arsCH8R genes with arsA and arsB genes in trans were sensitive to arsenate (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cells expressing arsC genes with mutations in the codon for His-88 were as resistant to arsenate as the wild type (Fig. 2B). Two double mutants were constructed by combining individual mutations by molecular cloning: arsCH8R/C106S and arsCC12S/H88R. Cells bearing either double mutant were sensitive to 0.1 mM sodium arsenate (data not shown). The steady state level of expression of the altered ArsC proteins was approximately the same as a wild type ArsC protein, as was determined by Western blot analysis using ArsC-specific antibody (data not shown). No differences were observed in the mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis between wild type and any of the altered ArsC proteins. The purification procedure produced about the same amount of each mutant protein at the same level of purity as wild type ArsC (data not shown). The elution from a molecular sieve column and circular dichroism spectra were essentially identical for all of the altered proteins (data not shown). Although local changes in structure cannot be excluded, there do not appear to be gross alterations in tertiary structure of the ArsC enzymes used in this study. Purified H88W, H88S, H88V, and H88R enzymes each had nearly the same specific activity and pH dependence of arsenate reductase activity as wild type enzyme (data not shown). In contrast, no measurable activity was found for the H8P, H8G, H8R, H8R/C106S, and C12S/H88R enzymes, even at a protein concentration 100-fold greater than wild type. The assay is not sufficiently sensitive to detect activity less than 10−3 that of the wild type, so the possibility that these enzymes have very low turnover rates cannot be excluded. These results are consistent with the phenotypic properties of the mutants (Fig. 2) and suggest that His-88 in ArsC protein is not involved in reduction. On the other hand, His-8 appears to be required for activity. Since H88R exhibited wild type ArsC properties, this protein was used for further characterization of the reaction with DEPC. The slopes of the lines from the concentration dependence of DEPC inactivation as a function of time (Fig. 3A) were used to determine values for the pseudo-first order rate constants of the inactivation, kobs, as described (23Cardemil E. Eyzaguirre J. Chemical Modification of Enzymes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 25Google Scholar). A linear relationship of kobs with DEPC concentration was observed (Fig. 3B). The pH-dependent increase of kobs at 1 mM of DEPC over the pH range from 5.5 to 8.2 was determined (Fig. 3C). The experimental values fit a theoretical curve calculated for pKa of 7.0. The data indicate that the unprotonated form of an ionizable group reacts with DEPC to inactivate the enzyme. The values of kobs were independent of the buffer concentration over a range of 5 mM to 0.1 M sodium or potassium phosphate at pH 6.5, demonstrating that the observed pKa was not due to titration of buffer components. While a pKa of 7.0 is about 1 pH unit higher than that of free histidine in solution, it most likely reflects the ionization of the imidazolium group of His-8, as the data below indicate. Binding of diethylpyrocarbonate with ArsC was monitored spectrophotometrically. The differences in absorbance between unmodified and DEPC-treated ArsCs was determined over the range of 200 to 300 nm. The peak of absorbance at about 240 nm was used to calculate the concentration of N-carbethoxylated histidine residues (Fig. 4A). For the wild type enzyme two phases were observed (Fig. 4A). In the fast phase of formation of N-carbethoxylated histidine reductase activity was not greatly affected. In the slow phase activity was lost (Fig. 4B). In completely inactivated ArsC 1.9 histidine residues were modified. Modification of tyrosine residues was detected spectrophotometrically from the difference spectra in the range of 278 to 283 nm, and no loss of tyrosine was observed (data not shown). Similarly, the two cysteine residues were unmodified, as determined by titration with DTNB (data not shown). Thus, under these experimental conditions no cysteine or tyrosine residues were modified. These results indicate that both histidine residues, His-8 and His-88, are modified by DEPC. To determine which histidine residue reacted in the fast phase and which in the slow phase, the time courses of modification were measured in single histidine proteins. The H8R-substituted ArsC, which is inactive and has only His-88, reacted rapidly with DEPC (Fig. 4A). The active H88R enzyme, with only His-8, lost activity at the same rate as the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4B), and His-8 was N-carbethoxylated slowly (Fig. 4A). Preincubation with the substrate arsenate protected H88R from inactivation by DEPC (data not shown). In contrast, the product, arsenite, had little effect. These results suggest that modification of His-8 leads to loss of reductase activity. The reductase activity of H88R reacted with a 10-fold excess of DEPC could be fully restored by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine for 2 h (Table II). During the same period the disappearance of a single N-carbethoxylated histidine was observed (data not shown). When the enzyme was incubated with a 100-fold excess of DEPC, it was completely inactivated, and only partial restoration of activity by hydroxylamine with time was observed (Table II). Restoration of activity eliminates possible modification of the lysines and the N terminus of the enzyme in DEPC inactivation, since modification of amino groups are not readily reversed with hydroxylamine. These results are consistent with modification of His-8 being solely responsible for inactivation of reductase activity by diethylpyrocarbonate.Table II.Hydroxylamine reactivation of DEPC-inactivated H88RIncubation time with 0.5 M NH2OHResidual activitya0.03 mM H88R was inactivated with either 0.3 or 3 mM DEPC for 25 min prior to treatment with hydroxylamine. At the indicated times portions of 50 μl of the reaction mixture were passed through a Sephadex G-25 spin column, and reductase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”0.3 mM DEPC3 mM DEPCh%021<10.530131601929823326531a 0.03 mM H88R was inactivated with either 0.3 or 3 mM DEPC for 25 min prior to treatment with hydroxylamine. At the indicated times portions of 50 μl of the reaction mixture were passed through a Sephadex G-25 spin column, and reductase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The rate of inactivation of the C106S enzyme, which has only Cys-12, by DTNB was measured (Fig. 5A). The dependence of kobs on the concentration of DTNB was linear (Fig. 5B). The pH-dependent increase of kobs at 25 μM DTNB indicates a group with a pKa of 6.5 is involved in the reaction (Fig. 5C). DTNB is specific for cysteine thiolates. Since the only thiol present in C106S is Cys-12, that thiolate has a pKa of 6.5. The pKa of Cys-12 could also be determined from the absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm. In these experiments the difference in absorbance between the fully reduced enzymes and the C12S enzyme, which lacks Cys-12, yields the specific absorbance of the Cys-12 thiolate. From the pH dependence of absorbance at 240 nm, the pKa values of Cys-12 in wild type ArsC by this assay were calculated to be 6.4 (Fig. 6). The same pKa for Cys-12 was found in the H8R enzyme, where a positive charge is maintained at residue 8. In contrast, the pKa of Cys-12 in the H8G enzyme, where the positive charge at position 8 is lost, was 8.3. The pKa of His-8 in the H88R C12S enzyme was decreased only 0.4 pH units compared with the H88R enzyme, from 7.0 to 6.6 (data not shown). While reciprocal changes in the pKa values of His-8 and Cys-12 would be expected if those two residues formed a charge pair in a closed system, in the enzyme the ionization of the imidazolium group of His-8 could be affected by other acidic residues. The 141-residue ArsC enzyme reduces arsenate (As(V)) to arsenite (As(III)), the substrate of the ATP-coupled Ars pump that extrudes arsenite from cells of E. coli (6Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7287-7293Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Coupling of the reductase to the pump expands the range of resistance to include both the oxidized and reduced oxyanions of arsenic. ArsC has a single essential cysteine residue, Cys-12 (7Liu J. Gladysheva T.B. Lee L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13476-13572Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that reductase activity was inactivated by diethylpyrocarbonate, a histidine modifying reagent. ArsC has just two histidine residues, His-8 and His-88. By site-directed mutagenesis using degenerate oligonucleotides, mutations were introduced into the codons for His-8 and His-88. Cells expressing four different mutations in the codon for His-88 were each arsenate-resistant, and the purified substituted His-88 ArsC enzymes had wild type catalytic activity. Thus His-88 is unrelated to catalysis. Cells bearing four different arsC genes with mutations in the codon for His-8 were each arsenate-sensitive. Three of the gene products were purified and shown to be catalytically inactive. The kinetics of DEPC modification indicated that both histidine residues were modified. Through the use of altered proteins having only His-8 or His-88, it was shown that His-88 reacted rapidly with DEPC. His-8 reacted more slowly but with complete loss of activity. The activity of the DEPC-modified enzyme could be restored by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine, and spectroscopic determination of N-carbethoxyhistidine residues demonstrated regeneration of His-8 by treatment with hydroxylamine. The substrate arsenate protected His-8 from DEPC modification, suggesting that it is in or near the active site. Since the source of reducing equivalents for arsenate reduction are glutathione and the thiol carrier glutaredoxin (6Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7287-7293Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), it is reasonable that a cysteine residue would be involved in catalysis, and Cys-12 has previously been identified as an active site residue (7Liu J. Gladysheva T.B. Lee L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13476-13572Google Scholar). What is the relationship between His-8 and Cys-12? The reductase has a pH optimum of about 6.5, considerably lower than the pKa of 8.3 for free cysteine. Other proteins with active site cysteine thiolates have acidic pH optimum, and in such proteins there is a basic residue near the cysteine that forms a stable ion pair with it (8Polgár L. Mechanisms of Protease Action. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 1-223Google Scholar, 9Lo Bello M. Parker M.W. Desideri A. Polticelli F. Falconi M. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Federici G. Ricci G. J.

Therefore the possibility of His-8 and Cys-12 forming a thiolate-imidazolium charge pair was investigated. The pKa of Cys-12 was found to be approximately 6.5, the same as the pH optimum of the reductase reaction. When another basic residue, arginine, was substituted for His-8, the pKa remained the same. Although catalytic activity is not maintained in the H8R enzyme, charge pairing is. When a neutral residue, glycine, was substituted for His-8, the pKa of Cys-12 increased to 8.3. These results are consistent with His-8 and Cys-12 forming a charge pair that lowers the pKa of the cysteine thiolate. This increases the nucleophilicity of Cys-12 at the pH optimum of the enzyme."

The process involves multiple signal transduction systems. One of the important signals and intermediates in this pathway is the disaccharide N,N′-diacetylchitobiose or (GlcNAc)2. 2The abbreviations used are: (GlcNAc)nchitin oligosaccharides, in which the GlcNAc residues are β,1-4-linked, and n = 2-6, as specifiedPNPp-nitrophenolPNP-GlcNActhe PNP β-glycoside of N-acetylglucosamineTCBN,N′-diacetyl-thiochitobioseMe-TCBmethyl β-N,N′-diacetylthiochitobioseASWartificial sea waterβ-GlcNAcidaseβ-N-acetylglucosaminidase. V. furnissii and a mutant unable to transport GlcNAc grow on (GlcNAc)2 as the sole source of carbon (3Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is not surprising, since the disaccharide is the product of hydrolysis of chitin by all reported bacterial chitinases (5Flach J. Pilet P.-E. Jollès P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, (GlcNAc)2 (and GlcNAc) are formed in the periplasmic space of V. furnissii by the hydrolysis of higher chitin oligosaccharides. Finally, the disaccharide is the most potent inducer of a number of the proteins involved in chitin catabolism in this organism, one of which is a cytoplasmic “chitobiase” that hydrolyzes the di- to the monosaccharide (3Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).These observations suggested that V. furnissii expresses a disaccharide transport system, and the present studies provide evidence for such a permease and for a separate export system.DISCUSSIONThe enormous turnover of chitin in marine waters is an essential component of the carbon and nitrogen cycles and appears to be catalyzed primarily by bacteria. Since chitinolytic bacteria first hydrolyze chitin to the disaccharide (GlcNAc)2, the catabolism of the latter compound plays a pivotal role in maintaining marine (and probably terrestrial) ecosystems. V. furnissii catabolizes (GlcNAc)2 very rapidly (3Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expresses many β-GlcNAcidases (24Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Chitlaru E. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33414-33424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, a definitive study of (GlcNAc)2 transport required the use of suitable non-metabolizable analogues of the disaccharide.Thioglycosides are generally resistant to hydrolysis by glycosidases, and N,N′-diacetyl-thiochitobiose (TCB) and its methyl β-glycoside (Me-TCB) are excellent analogues of (GlcNAc)2. They act as chemoattractants for the (GlcNAc)2 chemotaxis system, and as gratuitous inducers of β-GlcNAcidases in V. furnissii. The latter activity suggests that the analogues are transported by these cells and bind to regulatory proteins, such as repressors, that normally recognize (GlcNAc)2. This paper reports the properties of the transport systems.The schematic shown in Fig. 8 summarizes our transport results. There are two distinguishable systems in V. furnissii, one for the uptake and the other for the efflux of [3H]Me-TCB.A (GlcNAc)2-inducible, specific transport system catalyzes the uptake of the disaccharide analogue, with an apparent Km≤ 1 μM, and the analogue accumulates unchanged in the cell. With the exception of cellobiose, the uptake system is inhibited only by chitin oligosaccharides, possibly only by (GlcNAc)2 itself. However, cellobiose does not induce the transporter. The accumulation gradient (Me-TCB concentration inside/outside) can reach values as high as 1,000. Neither Na+ nor K+ affected the initial rate of transport.While the accumulation ratio of [3H]Me-TCB reaches extraordinary levels, this is true only because the analogue cannot be hydrolyzed by the cytoplasmic β-GlcNAcidase. Normally, one would expect to find very low steady state levels of (GlcNAc)2 in the cell. From this point of view, the results in Fig. 1 may give an erroneous picture of the efficiency of the analogues as inducers compared to the natural inducer, (GlcNAc)2, since the intracellular steady state level of the latter during induction is probably much lower than that of the analogues.Bacterial transport systems in common bacteria, such as E. coli, can be classified into four major groups. (a) One is facilitated diffusion, which occurs for glycerol, but apparently not for other solutes. Facilitated diffusion systems are bidirectional and do not require metabolic energy. (b) Another group consists of symport (co-transport) or antiport (counter-transport) systems, where the permease translocates one solute down its electrochemical gradient (e.g. H+ or Na+) and utilizes this energy to transport a second solute against its gradient. The lactose, melibiose, and most amino acid permeases are examples of this type. The H+/Na+ antiport system functions to pump Na+ out of the cell. These transporters are generally bidirectional, and metabolic energy is required to maintain the electrochemical gradient of the requisite ion, such as H+ or Na+. (c) Group translocation is a another transport system, the most common system being the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. In this case, the sugar is phosphorylated as it is translocated, energy is required (PEP), and since the membrane is impermeable to the sugar-P, it accumulates in the cell. Examples of the PTS in V. furnissii are described in accompanying papers (22Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33468-33475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33457-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). (d) Unidirectional, ATP-dependent permeases appear to be the systems most relevant to the (GlcNAc)2 permease described here. These transporters generally have low Km values for their substrates, do not require cotransported ions, and frequently have periplasmic solute binding proteins as components of the process. The binding constants of solutes to their periplasmic binding proteins is generally very high, and it is these complexes that are recognized by the membrane permeases.The maltose/maltodextrin transport system (19Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is an example of the ATP-dependent uniport system. It involves at least five gene products, one of which is the periplasmic maltose binding protein. As is often the case for periplasmic solute binding proteins, the maltose-binding protein serves two roles, one in transport, and the other as a chemoreceptor for chemotaxis to the solute. The Km for maltose uptake in this system is 1 μM.We know little about the Me-TCB efflux system, except that it is Na+-dependent. Some possibilities are: (a) antiport or symport through the uptake system, (b) a different transporter involving Na+ cotransport, or conceivably (c) efflux via a nonspecific system, such as the ATP-dependent ABC exporters of bacterial cells that have been implicated in drug resistance (21Grinius L.L. Goldberg E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29998-30004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, it seems unlikely that (GlcNAc)2 would be exported from wild type V. furnissii because it would probably be degraded (1Yu C. Lee A.M. Bassler B.L. Roseman S. J. Biol.

One of the important signals and intermediates in this pathway is the disaccharide N,N′-diacetylchitobiose or (GlcNAc)2. 2The abbreviations used are: (GlcNAc)nchitin oligosaccharides, in which the GlcNAc residues are β,1-4-linked, and n = 2-6, as specifiedPNPp-nitrophenolPNP-GlcNActhe PNP β-glycoside of N-acetylglucosamineTCBN,N′-diacetyl-thiochitobioseMe-TCBmethyl β-N,N′-diacetylthiochitobioseASWartificial sea waterβ-GlcNAcidaseβ-N-acetylglucosaminidase. chitin oligosaccharides, in which the GlcNAc residues are β,1-4-linked, and n = 2-6, as specified p-nitrophenol the PNP β-glycoside of N-acetylglucosamine N,N′-diacetyl-thiochitobiose methyl β-N,N′-diacetylthiochitobiose artificial sea water β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. V. furnissii and a mutant unable to transport GlcNAc grow on (GlcNAc)2 as the sole source of carbon (3Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is not surprising, since the disaccharide is the product of hydrolysis of chitin by all reported bacterial chitinases (5Flach J. Pilet P.-E. Jollès P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, (GlcNAc)2 (and GlcNAc) are formed in the periplasmic space of V. furnissii by the hydrolysis of higher chitin oligosaccharides. Finally, the disaccharide is the most potent inducer of a number of the proteins involved in chitin catabolism in this organism, one of which is a cytoplasmic “chitobiase” that hydrolyzes the di- to the monosaccharide (3Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that V. furnissii expresses a disaccharide transport system, and the present studies provide evidence for such a permease and for a separate export system. DISCUSSIONThe enormous turnover of chitin in marine waters is an essential component of the carbon and nitrogen cycles and appears to be catalyzed primarily by bacteria. Since chitinolytic bacteria first hydrolyze chitin to the disaccharide (GlcNAc)2, the catabolism of the latter compound plays a pivotal role in maintaining marine (and probably terrestrial) ecosystems. V. furnissii catabolizes (GlcNAc)2 very rapidly (3Bassler B.L. Yu C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expresses many β-GlcNAcidases (24Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33414-33424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, a definitive study of (GlcNAc)2 transport required the use of suitable non-metabolizable analogues of the disaccharide.Thioglycosides are generally resistant to hydrolysis by glycosidases, and N,N′-diacetyl-thiochitobiose (TCB) and its methyl β-glycoside (Me-TCB) are excellent analogues of (GlcNAc)2. They act as chemoattractants for the (GlcNAc)2 chemotaxis system, and as gratuitous inducers of β-GlcNAcidases in V. furnissii. The latter activity suggests that the analogues are transported by these cells and bind to regulatory proteins, such as repressors, that normally recognize (GlcNAc)2. This paper reports the properties of the transport systems.The schematic shown in Fig. 8 summarizes our transport results. There are two distinguishable systems in V. furnissii, one for the uptake and the other for the efflux of [3H]Me-TCB.A (GlcNAc)2-inducible, specific transport system catalyzes the uptake of the disaccharide analogue, with an apparent Km≤ 1 μM, and the analogue accumulates unchanged in the cell. With the exception of cellobiose, the uptake system is inhibited only by chitin oligosaccharides, possibly only by (GlcNAc)2 itself. However, cellobiose does not induce the transporter. The accumulation gradient (Me-TCB concentration inside/outside) can reach values as high as 1,000. Neither Na+ nor K+ affected the initial rate of transport.While the accumulation ratio of [3H]Me-TCB reaches extraordinary levels, this is true only because the analogue cannot be hydrolyzed by the cytoplasmic β-GlcNAcidase. Normally, one would expect to find very low steady state levels of (GlcNAc)2 in the cell. From this point of view, the results in Fig. 1 may give an erroneous picture of the efficiency of the analogues as inducers compared to the natural inducer, (GlcNAc)2, since the intracellular steady state level of the latter during induction is probably much lower than that of the analogues.Bacterial transport systems in common bacteria, such as E. coli, can be classified into four major groups. (a) One is facilitated diffusion, which occurs for glycerol, but apparently not for other solutes. Facilitated diffusion systems are bidirectional and do not require metabolic energy. (b) Another group consists of symport (co-transport) or antiport (counter-transport) systems, where the permease translocates one solute down its electrochemical gradient (e.g. H+ or Na+) and utilizes this energy to transport a second solute against its gradient. The lactose, melibiose, and most amino acid permeases are examples of this type. The H+/Na+ antiport system functions to pump Na+ out of the cell. These transporters are generally bidirectional, and metabolic energy is required to maintain the electrochemical gradient of the requisite ion, such as H+ or Na+. (c) Group translocation is a another transport system, the most common system being the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. In this case, the sugar is phosphorylated as it is translocated, energy is required (PEP), and since the membrane is impermeable to the sugar-P, it accumulates in the cell. Examples of the PTS in V. furnissii are described in accompanying papers (22Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33468-33475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33457-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). (d) Unidirectional, ATP-dependent permeases appear to be the systems most relevant to the (GlcNAc)2 permease described here. These transporters generally have low Km values for their substrates, do not require cotransported ions, and frequently have periplasmic solute binding proteins as components of the process. The binding constants of solutes to their periplasmic binding proteins is generally very high, and it is these complexes that are recognized by the membrane permeases.The maltose/maltodextrin transport system (19Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is an example of the ATP-dependent uniport system. It involves at least five gene products, one of which is the periplasmic maltose binding protein. As is often the case for periplasmic solute binding proteins, the maltose-binding protein serves two roles, one in transport, and the other as a chemoreceptor for chemotaxis to the solute. The Km for maltose uptake in this system is 1 μM.We know little about the Me-TCB efflux system, except that it is Na+-dependent. Some possibilities are: (a) antiport or symport through the uptake system, (b) a different transporter involving Na+ cotransport, or conceivably (c) efflux via a nonspecific system, such as the ATP-dependent ABC exporters of bacterial cells that have been implicated in drug resistance (21Grinius L.L. Goldberg E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29998-30004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, it seems unlikely that (GlcNAc)2 would be exported from wild type V. furnissii because it would probably be degraded (1Yu C. Lee A.M. Bassler B.L. Roseman S. J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONBacteria of the genus Pseudomonas are able to grow in many different chemically defined media containing a wide number of carbon sources (1Dagley S. Essays Biochem. 1975; 11: 81-138PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ratledge, C., (ed) (1994) Biochemistry of Microbial Degration, Kluwer Academic Publishers, London.Google Scholar). This catabolic versatility is specially interesting in strains belonging to the species Pseudomonas putida, which can grow in media which are, or may be, toxic for other microbes (2Ratledge, C., (ed) (1994) Biochemistry of Microbial Degration, Kluwer Academic Publishers, London.Google Scholar, 3Fernndez-Valverde M. Reglero A. Martnez-Blanco H. Luengo J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some years ago, we showed that P. putida U could be cultured in minimal medium containing phenylacetic acid (PA) 1The abbreviations used are: PAphenylacetic acidACVSδ-(L-α-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetasePCLphenylacetyl-CoA ligaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s) as the sole carbon source (4Martnez-Blanco H.

This enzyme, which had never been reported to be involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds, seemed to be functionally similar to a protein that participates in a very different route, the biosynthetic pathway of benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), in several fungi (see Fig. 1) (5Abraham E.P.

We were therefore prompted to characterize the enzyme phenylacetyl-CoA ligase (PA-CoA ligase, PCL) which activates phenylacetic acid (the side chain precursor of benzylpenicillin) to phenylacetyl-CoA in both low producer and in industrial strains of P. chrysogenum. This protein has never been purified, and its gene sequence remains unknown. The absence (or undetectable levels) of PCL activity in cell-free extracts of P. chrysogenum suggested that this enzyme activity could be a true limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway of benzylpenicillin. To confirm this hypothesis, we changed our research strategy; we now selected different microbes as a function of their capacity to grow in minimal medium containing PA as the sole carbon source (4Martnez-Blanco H.

These results open interesting possibilities, since it could be speculated that if PCL is indeed a rate-limiting step, the cloning and expression of the pcl gene (isolated from P. putida U) in P. chrysogenum could contribute to enhancing the production of benzylpenicillin in this fungus. In the present work we studied this gene from P. putida as well as its expression in Escherichia coli and in P. chrysogenum in order to establish (i) the sequence of the gene and protein, (ii) the characteristics of the different recombinant PCLs, and (iii) the effect of overexpression on the biosynthesis of benzylpenicillin in the fungus. INTRODUCTIONBacteria of the genus Pseudomonas are able to grow in many different chemically defined media containing a wide number of carbon sources (1Dagley S. Essays Biochem. 1975; 11: 81-138PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ratledge, C., (ed) (1994) Biochemistry of Microbial Degration, Kluwer Academic Publishers, London.Google Scholar). This catabolic versatility is specially interesting in strains belonging to the species Pseudomonas putida, which can grow in media which are, or may be, toxic for other microbes (2Ratledge, C., (ed) (1994) Biochemistry of Microbial Degration, Kluwer Academic Publishers, London.Google Scholar, 3Fernndez-Valverde M. Reglero A. Martnez-Blanco H. Luengo J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some years ago, we showed that P. putida U could be cultured in minimal medium containing phenylacetic acid (PA) 1The abbreviations used are: PAphenylacetic acidACVSδ-(L-α-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetasePCLphenylacetyl-CoA ligaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s) as the sole carbon source (4Martnez-Blanco H.

This enzyme, which had never been reported to be involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds, seemed to be functionally similar to a protein that participates in a very different route, the biosynthetic pathway of benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), in several fungi (see Fig. 1) (5Abraham E.P.

It has been reported that neither the number of copies of these genes nor the quantities of these enzymes are rate-limiting for penicillin biosynthesis in the different strains studied (14Barredo J.L. Diez B. Alvarez E. Martin J.F. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Smith D.J. Bull J.H. Edwards J. Turner G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We were therefore prompted to characterize the enzyme phenylacetyl-CoA ligase (PA-CoA ligase, PCL) which activates phenylacetic acid (the side chain precursor of benzylpenicillin) to phenylacetyl-CoA in both low producer and in industrial strains of P. chrysogenum. This protein has never been purified, and its gene sequence remains unknown. The absence (or undetectable levels) of PCL activity in cell-free extracts of P. chrysogenum suggested that this enzyme activity could be a true limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway of benzylpenicillin. To confirm this hypothesis, we changed our research strategy; we now selected different microbes as a function of their capacity to grow in minimal medium containing PA as the sole carbon source (4Martnez-Blanco H. Reglero A. Rodrguez-Aparicio L.B. Luengo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7084-7090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, we identified a bacterial strain (P. putida U) which, as indicated above, catalyzes the first step of the PA catabolic pathway by activation of PA to PA-CoA (4Martnez-Blanco H.

To determine how various steroids interact in their potentiation of calcium channels, the action of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> analogues and testosterone with calcium channels in the rat osteoblast-like cell line ROS 17/2.8 was investigated. Bath additions of both 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub> and testosterone at doses below <i>K</i>1/2 (the dose causing 50% left shift in the current-voltage relationship) are additive in their ability to potentiate calcium channels. When 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub> and testosterone are added together at concentrations that would cause a maximal shift in the current-voltage relationship by each agent alone (<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>), the effect of these steroids is not additive. Taken together these data suggest one population of calcium channels is activated by 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub> or testosterone. The shift in the current-voltage relationship caused by 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub> is reduced by 1β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1β,25-D<sub>3</sub>), an agent which is thought to act specifically on the plasma membrane receptor for 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub>, but the potentiation caused by testosterone is not blocked by 1β,25-D<sub>3</sub>. However, 24,25-D<sub>3</sub> inhibits the left shift in the peak current-voltage relationship mediated by either 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub> and testosterone. This result implies that 1) 1β,25-D<sub>3</sub> directly displaces 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub> but not testosterone from its plasma membrane receptor, and 2) the rapid (in seconds) stimulatory effects of 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub> and testosterone on calcium channels are mediated by separate plasma membrane receptors for testosterone and 1α,25-D<sub>3</sub>, which are blocked by another receptor for 24,25-D<sub>3</sub>. The interaction of these three receptors with L-type calcium channels is pertussis toxin-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1653501030,"Pre-mRNA splicing takes place on a large ribonucleoprotein particle, the spliceosome which contains the five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the mRNA splicing factors, Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21, are necessary for addition of the U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA in an early step of spliceosome assembly.

INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing is a dynamic process involving a complex array of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 1Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar and 2Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar). These interactions take place on a large, multi-protein RNA complex called the spliceosome. Assembly of the spliceosome occurs by ordered association of five snRNPs 1The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionPASprotein A-SepharosePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. with the pre-mRNA substrate. Initially, the U1 snRNP associates with the pre-mRNA, followed by the U2 snRNP and finally the U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP. The two trans-esterification reactions leading to intron removal and exon ligation are thought to be catalyzed by the RNA components of the spliceosome (reviewed in Ref. 3). The spliceosomal proteins are thought to facilitate modulation and stabilization of RNA structures critical for the splicing reaction.A large number of proteins required for pre-mRNA splicing have been identified in yeast (4Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 5Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 79-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins can be found stably associated with specific snRNPs. Others are components of spliceosome complexes. Yet another class of splicing proteins acts transiently to facilitate spliceosome formation.The initial step in spliceosome assembly is the stable association of the U1 snRNP with the pre-mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 2). This step requires sequence elements in the pre-mRNA at the 5′ splice site and the branch point. Pre-spliceosome formation occurs when the U2 snRNP adds to the U1·pre-mRNA complex. U2 binding also requires sequences in the branch point pairing region of the pre-mRNA. These sequences become paired to the complementary branch point region of the U2 snRNA (2Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar). The branch point region of U2 is situated between two highly conserved secondary structural elements (6Guthrie C. Patterson B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 387-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). One of these is the 5′ stem-loop structure and the other is a set of stem-loops with pseudoknot characteristics (7Ares Jr., M. Igel A.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2132-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Miraglia L. Seiwert S. Igel A.H. Ares M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7061-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). U2 cold-sensitive mutations and revertants in this pseudoknot-like region have suggested potential structural transitions that may be important for U2 snRNP activities, including pre-spliceosome formation (9Zavanelli M.I. Ares M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2521-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Zavanelli M.I. Britton J.S. Igel A.H. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Four proteins known to be required for stable association of the U2 snRNP with the pre-mRNA are Prp5, Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 (reviewed in Ref. 11). Prp5 is a member of the DEAD family of putative RNA helicases (12Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4236-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and Prp9 and Prp11 contain amino acid homology to the TFIIIA type zinc finger RNA binding domains (13Legrain P. Choulika A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2775-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Chang T.-W. Clark M.W. Lustig A.J. Cusick M.E. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2379-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Prp21 is a member of a family of proteins related in sequence to the Drosophila gene, suppressor of white apricot (15Chou T.-B. Zachar Z. Bingham P.M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The finding that mutant alleles of the PRP5, PRP9, PRP11, and PRP21 genes show synthetic lethal genetic interactions suggested a tightly coupled role for the corresponding proteins in splicing (16Ruby S.W. Cheng T.-W. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Wells S.E. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). That these proteins also interact genetically with the cold-sensitive U2 mutations described above suggested that changes in the structure of the U2 snRNA may be critical to the activities of Prp5, Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 (16Ruby S.W. Cheng T.-W. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Wells S.E. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pre-spliceosome formation requires ATP hydrolysis. Because Prp5 is an RNA-dependent ATPase (18O'Day C.L. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that Prp5 is responsible, at least in part, for the ATP dependence of pre-spliceosome formation. Could such an ATP-dependent reaction by Prp5 be coupled to U2 snRNA structural changes and the activity of Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21? To better understand these genetic interactions, we have purified the Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 proteins using recombinant Escherichia coli expression systems. Purification of these proteins has allowed us to investigate their biochemical characteristics and their interactions with Prp5 and the U2 snRNP.DISCUSSIONThere are several lines of evidence to suggest that Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 interact with each other to form a protein complex. First, SF3A, the mammalian splicing factor consisting of the Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 homologs (SAP61, SAP62, and SAP114, respectively) (28Bennett M. Reed R. Science. 1993; 262: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Brosi R. Groning K. Behrens S.-E. Luhrmann R. Kramer A.

Hauri H.-P. Kramer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17640-17646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, far Western type experiments testing SAP61 and SAP62 with SAP114 showed a direct interaction between these components of SF3A (28Bennett M. Reed R. Science. 1993; 262: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Chiara M.D. Champion-Arnaud P. Buvoli M. Nadel-Ginard B. Reed R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Second, genetic analysis of yeast strains carrying any two of the temperature-sensitive mutations of the prp9-1, prp11-1, or prp21-1 alleles exhibited a synthetic lethal phenotype, suggesting a tightly coupled role for these proteins (16Ruby S.W. Cheng T.-W. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Wells S.E. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, two-hybrid experiments performed with the coding regions of Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 revealed that these proteins interact in vivo in a manner consistent with the formation of a Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 complex (22McPheeters D.S.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Although these lines of evidence are compelling, there had been no biochemical investigation of the yeast Prp9·Prp11· Prp21 complex. We have presented here direct physical evidence for the yeast Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 complex and have begun to characterize the biochemistry of this complex in vitro. First, we demonstrated a direct interaction between Prp11 and Prp9 and Prp21 by demonstrating that the entire complex is inactivated by heat in prp11-1 or prp21-1 extracts. All three proteins must be added to regain activity. The formation of a Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 complex in the absence of any other yeast proteins was studied by analyzing proteins made in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system. Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 formed in vitro is highly stable even at salt concentrations greater than 0.5 M NaCl. Interestingly, Legrain and colleagues (23Legrain P. Chapon C. Galisson F. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated formation of a Prp9 homodimer using the yeast two-hybrid assay system. We were unable to detect homodimers of either Prp9, Prp11, or Prp21 in our in vitro experimental system. It is possible that observation of homodimer formation by Prp9 requires an additional factor(s) not present in our in vitro system.Previous genetic experiments also demonstrated synthetic lethal interactions of prp9-1, prp11-1, and prp21-1 with prp5-1 mutants (16Ruby S.W. Cheng T.-W. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Wells S.E. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect a direct interaction between Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 and Prp5, so we investigated the possibility that the observed genetic interaction between these proteins was mediated through a functional interaction. In the accompanying paper (18O'Day C.L. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Prp5 mediated an ATP-dependent structural change in the U2 snRNP, leading to exposure of its branch point region. We hypothesized that this exposure of the branch point region facilitated interaction of the U2 snRNP with the complementary region of the pre-mRNA. In this paper, we demonstrated that Prp9·Prp11· Prp21 is necessary for stabilization of a U2 structure that Prp5 can utilize as a substrate.Based on differences in RNaseH sensitivity of U2 RNA in mutant extracts, we propose a model in Fig. 7 for changes in U2 snRNP conformation in the activation of the U2 snRNP during spliceosome assembly. This model describes two “open” (RNaseH-accessible) states. These two states are differentiated by whether or not they require ATP to form and by their ability to assemble into a pre-spliceosome. In the absence of ATP, there are two (or more) conformational states that are in dynamic equilibrium. The open form of the equilibrium is inactive in pre-spliceosome assembly. In the absence of Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 (e.g. in a heat-treated prp9-1 extract), this equilibrium favors the inactive, open state. Addition of Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 in the absence of ATP favors a shift to the closed state. In the presence of ATP and PRP5 this closed complex is transformed to an active open state poised for interaction with the branch point sequence of the pre-mRNA.Ares and colleagues (9Zavanelli M.I. Ares M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2521-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Zavanelli M.I. Britton J.S. Igel A.H. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have shown that in the U2 cold-sensitive mutants G53A and C62U, the U2 snRNA favors an altered secondary structure or misfolded form that is in equilibrium with competent snRNP (9Zavanelli M.I. Ares M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2521-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Zavanelli M.I. Britton J.S. Igel A.H. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These mutants are synthetically lethal with prp5-1, prp9-1, prp11-1, and prp21-1 (16Ruby S.W. Cheng T.-W. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Wells S.E. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our investigation of the U2 snRNP in these mutant extracts indicated that virtually all of the snRNP was in an open conformation even in the absence of ATP. Thus the synthetic lethality could be explained by the lack of a significant population of Prp9·Prp11·Prp21-associated U2 snRNP for Prp5 to activate. The G53A and C62U mutations affect the equilibrium between different forms of the stem II structure of U2 RNA. It is not clear how different forms of this structure could affect the accessibility of the branch point interaction sequence; however, recent work by Yan and Ares (34Yan D. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has identified U2 mutants very close to the branch point pairing sequence that interact synergistically with mutants in PRP5, PRP9, PRP11, and PRP21. The mutants are changes in U40, C41, U45, C46, and U47 just downstream from the branch point interaction sequence between residues 34 and 39. How changes in the 40-47 region affect U2 function is not clear, but one possibility is that the mutants enhance pairing with a sequence in U2 between 25 and 30. Such a helical interaction might prevent the pairing between U2 and the intron. It will be very interesting to find out how mutants in the 40-47 region score in the RNase H assay.Other members of the DEAD family of RNA helicases show characteristic low binding affinities for their RNA substrates (35Goss D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Abramson R.D. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6016-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanism for specific RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding by these proteins is not well understood, a possible mechanism could be the use of auxiliary proteins to facilitate activity and/or specificity. In the case of eIF-4A, eIF-4B is necessary to stimulate helicase activity (37Ray B.K. Lawson T.G. Kramer J.C. Cladaras M.H. Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Merrick W.C. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7651-7658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF-4B contains an RNP motif suggestive of an RNA binding function (38Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Davies M.V. Kelleher K. Kaufman R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible role for eIF-4B may be to stabilize or enhance RNA structures suitable for use as substrate by eIF-4A. Analogously, it has been shown that Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 binds to the U2 snRNP (27Abovich N. Legrain P. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6417-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the RNaseH inaccessible (“closed”) form of the U2 snRNP that is a substrate for Prp5 (this work). The availability of purified Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 protein complex should greatly facilitate investigation of potential Prp5 RNA helicase activity in vitro.A Role for Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 after Pre-spliceosome AssemblyWe have described convincing evidence that Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 associates with U2 and ultimately with the pre-spliceosome. Identifying possible roles of these proteins later in the spliceosome assembly pathway has been more difficult. Using a highly sensitive snRNA immunoprecipitation protocol based on the U6 knock out/reconstitution system (19Arenas J.E. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6771-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we have detected the presence of Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 in U6 snRNA containing spliceosomal complexes. Although we only directly detected co-immunoprecipitation of U6 with antibodies to Prp11 and Prp21, we favor the hypothesis that interactions detected with any one of the components of Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 represent the presence of the complex. This is because Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 is a highly stable complex under the in vitro conditions of the splicing assay. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the complex is disrupted during spliceosome assembly. A diagram of the spliceosome assembly pathway is shown in Fig. 7B. We found that Prp21 could be identified as an integral component of an A1 complex. In earlier experiments (18O'Day C.L. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) we did not detect a decrease in the U6-containing complexes in a Prp21 immune depletion experiment. This was probably because only part of complex A1 is depleted in these experiments, and the fraction that is in that form may depend on the experimental conditions. We were unable to detect Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 in the other U6-containing complexes, A2-1 and A2-2. It seems unlikely that Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 leaves the complex and returns at the later A1 stage, so we attribute the failure to deplete to conformational differences in these complexes leading to destabilization of Prp9·Prp11·Prp21 or to conformational differences that lead to inaccessibility of the epitope for immunoprecipitation. INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing is a dynamic process involving a complex array of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 1Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar and 2Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar). These interactions take place on a large, multi-protein RNA complex called the spliceosome. Assembly of the spliceosome occurs by ordered association of five snRNPs 1The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionPASprotein A-SepharosePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. with the pre-mRNA substrate. Initially, the U1 snRNP associates with the pre-mRNA, followed by the U2 snRNP and finally the U4/U6·U5 tri-snRNP. The two trans-esterification reactions leading to intron removal and exon ligation are thought to be catalyzed by the RNA components of the spliceosome (reviewed in Ref. 3). The spliceosomal proteins are thought to facilitate modulation and stabilization of RNA structures critical for the splicing reaction.A large number of proteins required for pre-mRNA splicing have been identified in yeast (4Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 5Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 79-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins can be found stably associated with specific snRNPs. Others are components of spliceosome complexes. Yet another class of splicing proteins acts transiently to facilitate spliceosome formation.The initial step in spliceosome assembly is the stable association of the U1 snRNP with the pre-mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 2). This step requires sequence elements in the pre-mRNA at the 5′ splice site and the branch point. Pre-spliceosome formation occurs when the U2 snRNP adds to the U1·pre-mRNA complex. U2 binding also requires sequences in the branch point pairing region of the pre-mRNA. These sequences become paired to the complementary branch point region of the U2 snRNA (2Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar). The branch point region of U2 is situated between two highly conserved secondary structural elements (6Guthrie C. Patterson B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 387-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). One of these is the 5′ stem-loop structure and the other is a set of stem-loops with pseudoknot characteristics (7Ares Jr., M. Igel A.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2132-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Miraglia L. Seiwert S. Igel A.H. Ares M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7061-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). U2 cold-sensitive mutations and revertants in this pseudoknot-like region have suggested potential structural transitions that may be important for U2 snRNP activities, including pre-spliceosome formation (9Zavanelli M.I. Ares M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2521-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Zavanelli M.I. Britton J.S. Igel A.H. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Four proteins known to be required for stable association of the U2 snRNP with the pre-mRNA are Prp5, Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 (reviewed in Ref. 11). Prp5 is a member of the DEAD family of putative RNA helicases (12Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4236-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and Prp9 and Prp11 contain amino acid homology to the TFIIIA type zinc finger RNA binding domains (13Legrain P. Choulika A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2775-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Chang T.-W. Clark M.W. Lustig A.J. Cusick M.E. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2379-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Prp21 is a member of a family of proteins related in sequence to the Drosophila gene, suppressor of white apricot (15Chou T.-B. Zachar Z. Bingham P.M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The finding that mutant alleles of the PRP5, PRP9, PRP11, and PRP21 genes show synthetic lethal genetic interactions suggested a tightly coupled role for the corresponding proteins in splicing (16Ruby S.W. Cheng T.-W. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Wells S.E. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). That these proteins also interact genetically with the cold-sensitive U2 mutations described above suggested that changes in the structure of the U2 snRNA may be critical to the activities of Prp5, Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 (16Ruby S.W. Cheng T.-W. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Wells S.E. Ares M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6337-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pre-spliceosome formation requires ATP hydrolysis. Because Prp5 is an RNA-dependent ATPase (18O'Day C.L. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that Prp5 is responsible, at least in part, for the ATP dependence of pre-spliceosome formation. Could such an ATP-dependent reaction by Prp5 be coupled to U2 snRNA structural changes and the activity of Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21? To better understand these genetic interactions, we have purified the Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 proteins using recombinant Escherichia coli expression systems. Purification of these proteins has allowed us to investigate their biochemical characteristics and their interactions with Prp5 and the U2 snRNP. Eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing is a dynamic process involving a complex array of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 1Green M.R. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2085126450,"Many short-lived mRNAs contain AU-rich instability elements within their 3'-untranslated region. Cellular factors that bind to these elements are thought to play a role in the regulation of mRNA degradation. In the accompanying paper (Chagnovich, D., and Cohn, S. L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33580-33586) we characterized the binding activity of a 40-kDa protein (p40) that interacts with high specificity with at least two AU-rich elements located within the 3'-untranslated region of N-myc. p40 activity correlates with N-myc mRNA stability in subclones of the NBL-W neuroblastoma cells line (W-N and W-S). In an effort to determine the identity of p40 we performed immunoblotting studies, immunoprecipitation experiments, and RNA gel mobility shift assays using antibodies that are directed against known RNA-binding proteins. In this paper we demonstrate that in W-N and W-S cells, p40 activity parallels the expression of embryonic letal abnormal vision (ELAV)-like proteins, and that antibodies directed against this family of RNA-binding proteins recognize p40. We also show that purified ELAV-like proteins (HuD and Hel-N1) bind with high specificity to the same N-myc 3'-untranslated region sequences as p40. Our data indicate that p40 is a member of the ELAV-like family, and suggest that this family of RNA-binding proteins may regulate N-myc mRNA turnover."

Jackson-Grusby L. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1481-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Emmons S. Phan H. Calley J. Chen W. James B. Manseau L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2482-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In particular, the D. melanogaster capu gene products regulate cytoskeletal architecture and the establishment of primary egg polarity (7Emmons S. Phan H. Calley J. Chen W. James B. Manseau L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2482-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Manseau L. Calley J. Phan H. Development. 1996; 122: 2109-2116PubMed Google Scholar). Capu genetically interacts with profilin, an actin-associated protein (9Manseau L. Calley J. Phan H. Development. 1996; 122: 2109-2116PubMed Google Scholar), whereas diaphanous functions primarily during cytokinesis (6Castrillon D. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, genetic analysis of the murine ld phenotype showed that the vertebrate Ld gene products regulate signals that control distal limb outgrowth and patterning (10Chan D.C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Leder P. Development. 1995; 121: 3151-3162PubMed Google Scholar, 11Haramis A.G. Brown J.M. Zeller R. Development. 1995; 121: 4237-4245PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about their molecular functions, but comparison of different Ld family members shows they share two structurally and probably functionally conserved domains. First, a part of their carboxyl-terminal domains is highly conserved (6Castrillon D. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Emmons S. Phan H. Calley J. Chen W. James B. Manseau L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2482-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and disruption of this domain in several of the murine ld and D. melanogaster capu alleles causes the phenotypic alterations observed in mutant embryos (7Emmons S. Phan H. Calley J. Chen W. James B. Manseau L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2482-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Maas R.L. Zeller R. Woychik R.P. Vogt T.F. Leder P. Nature. 1991; 346: 853-855Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Second, all family members contain a proline-rich domain separating the conserved carboxyl- from the amino-terminal domain. Proline-rich domains function either as molecular hinges or interact with proteins encoding SH3 or WW domains (13Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 14Sudol M. Chen H.I. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed, in vitro binding studies using the proline-rich domain of murine Ld proteins (formins; 3) revealed specific binding to the c-Abl SH3 domain (13Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) and several novel WW domains (16Chan D. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the genetic interaction of Capu and profilin seems to be mediated by the direct binding of profilin to the proline-rich domain of the Capu protein (9Manseau L. Calley J. Phan H. Development. 1996; 122: 2109-2116PubMed Google Scholar). Our study focuses on the interactions of vertebrate Ld proteins with SH3 domain containing proteins, the identification of possible in vivo partners and the cellular compartments where interactions occur. SH3 domain containing proteins are of particular interest, because they are known to participate in signal transduction pathways and/or associate with the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Refs. 17Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar and 18Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D.. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). These pathways and structures are impaired by mutations affecting Ld family members (6Castrillon D. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Emmons S. Phan H. Calley J. Chen W. James B. Manseau L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2482-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Chan D.C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Leder P. Development. 1995; 121: 3151-3162PubMed Google Scholar, 11Haramis A.G. Brown J.M. Zeller R. Development. 1995; 121: 4237-4245PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial in vitro binding assays establish that the chicken and murine Ld proteins interact best with SH3 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases (c-Src and c-Fyn) and they possess a much lower affinity to other types of SH3 domains tested. We show that interaction of Ld with c-Src proteins is mediated by the proline-rich domain of Ld and the SH3 domain of Src. Studies using transfected cells show that Ld-c-Src protein complexes form in intact cells. Immunolocalization and biochemical fractionation studies were performed to establish in which cellular compartment the two proteins interact. These studies show that chicken embryonic and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts contain non-nuclear Ld proteins, a fraction of which co-localizes with c-Src proteins at plasma and perinuclear membranes. Our studies establish that Ld proteins can interact with membrane-associated Src family kinases in vivo and propose direct molecular links of Ld proteins with signal transduction pathways. The Ld proteins (murine isoform I and chicken isoform IV; 3, 5) were labeled by in vitro translation using the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using [35S]methionine (Amersham). The Abl-SH3 construct was made by polymerase chain reaction amplifying its SH3 domain from a mouse Abl-SH3 construct (oligos and cDNA provided by A. Musacchio). This polymerase chain reaction product was ligated in-frame into pGEX2T (Pharmacia). All other GST-SH3 fusions are described elsewhere (19 to 22). The recombinant fusion proteins were produced in bacteria and purified as described (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Antisera against different Src domains were used as described (22Fumagalli S. Totti N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). One monoclonal antibody recognizes amino acids 2-17 of the Src protein (α2-17; 22), whereas the other recognizes its SH3 domain (αSH3, mAb 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyCHAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. 327; 24). A polyclonal antiserum recognizing the carboxyl-terminal tail was also used (αKin, antiserum cst.1; 25). The Ld proteins were detected using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against its highly conserved carboxyl-terminal domain (5Trumpp A. Blundell P.A. de la Pompa J.L. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ld antibodies were affinity-purified using bacterially expressed fusion proteins encoding either the chicken or murine carboxyl-terminal domains. monoclonal antibody 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. A standard in vitro binding assay was used (e.g. Ref. 22) to study the interactions of Ld proteins with different GST-SH3 fusion proteins: 5-10 μg of GST-SH3 fusion protein was bound to 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (packed volume, Sigma). After washing in IPP 150 (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium azide), the complexes were resuspended in 1 ml of IPP buffer and equal amounts of in vitro translated Ld proteins or native protein extracts were added. Binding was performed at 4°C for 2-3 h. Complexes were washed 3 times with IPP 150 buffer and then analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) was used for washing under high stringency conditions. A protein A tag containing four z-domains (26Nilsson B. Moks T. Jansson B. Abrahamsen L. Elmblad A. Holmgren E. Henrichson C. Jones T.A. Uhlen M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) was inserted close to the amino terminus of the chicken Ld isoform IV and several deletions were generated using convenient restriction enzymes (see Fig. 2A). Protein A-tagged proteins were detected by rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (27Grandi P. Doye V. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) in combination with enhanced chemiluminescense (ECL, Amersham). The constructs were expressed in quail QT6 cells and native protein extracts were used for in vitro interaction assays. Chicken c-Src proteins were expressed using a pSG5-derived vector (20Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas Ld proteins were expressed using the Rc/CMV vector (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected after reaching about 80% confluency. The Ld and/or Src expression constructs (or vector for controls; 10 μg of DNA per 10-cm dish) were transfected using the calcium phosphate technique (28Graham F.L. van der Erb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). The medium was changed 16 h later and cells were harvested 2-3 days following transfection. Native cell extracts were prepared as described (29Smith S.E. Papavassiliou A.G. Bohmann D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1581-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Src antibodies were coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) in IPP 150 buffer following standard protocols (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Following two washes in IPP buffer, beads were resuspended in 1 ml of IPP buffer and normalized amounts (about 600 μg) of native protein extract were added. Immunocomplexes were allowed to form for 3-4 h at 4°C. Complexes were washed three times with IPP 150 and analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed as described (5Trumpp A. Blundell P.A. de la Pompa J.L. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using ECL detection. Cells were harvested by scraping them into phosphate-buffered saline. All solutions contained protease inhibitors. Following centrifugation, cell pellets were equilibrated in hypotonic buffer (1 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Subsequently cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B) and nuclei pelleted by centrifugation. The initial supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate membranes (pellet) and cytosolic fractions (supernatant). In parallel, the initial nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Cu1 buffer (20 mM HEPES 7.9, 0.3 M sucrose, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA) and nuclei were enriched further by pelleting through a cushion of Cu2 buffer (as Cu1 buffer, but containing 0.9 M sucrose, 5,000 × g for 15 min). The second nuclear pellet was washed twice in TESM-CHAPS (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2, 2% CHAPS) to remove associated perinuclear material and nuclear envelopes. 2C. Dickson, personal communication. Nuclear proteins were extracted by incubation in 5 volumes of NE buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 100 μM EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitors) for 10 min. Protein extracts were normalized by silver staining and equal amounts analyzed by immunoblotting and ECL. The quality of fractionation was assessed using tubulin (α-tubulin; Sigma) and c-Jun (α-Jun; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as marker proteins for cytosolic and nuclear fractions, respectively. Chicken embryonic fibroblasts, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and NIH-3T3 cells expressing the wild-type chicken c-Src protein (31Erpel T. Alonso G. Roche S. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16807-16812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were plated on gelatinized coverslips, grown overnight, and fixed in 1% (or 4%) paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Ld proteins were detected using affinity-purified polyclonal Ld antibodies (FP1; recognizing all known Ld protein isoforms, 5) and rhodamine-coupled secondary antibodies (goat α-rabbit; Cappel). c-Src proteins were detected using monoclonal αSH3 (mAb 327, Ref. 24) antibodies and fluorescein-coupled secondary antibodies (goat α-mouse, Jackson Immuno Research). Antibody incubations, washes, and detection were performed as described previously by Trumpp et al. (5Trumpp A. Blundell P.A. de la Pompa J.L. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Results were analyzed either by conventional immunofluorescence or optical sections taken from a confocal laser microscope. Alignment of the chicken and murine proline-rich Ld domains (3Woychik R.P. Maas R.L. Zeller R. Vogt T.F. Leder P. Nature. 1990; 346: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Trumpp A. Blundell P.A. de la Pompa J.L. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) reveals that the non-proline residues important for mediating interaction with the c-Abl SH3 domain (13; underlined in Fig. 1A) are not well conserved. Therefore, possible interactions of both chicken and murine Ld proteins with different types of SH3 domains were compared using an in vitro interaction assay (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, Ld proteins of both species bind equally well to SH3 domains of c-Fyn (Fig. 1B, lane 3) and c-Src (Fig. 1B, lane 8). Both Ld proteins also interact with the SH3 domain of c-Abl (Fig. 1B, lane 1). However, this interaction and binding to the SH3 domains of PLCγ (Fig. 1B, lane 5) and p85 (regulatory subunit of the PI-3 kinase; Fig. 1B, lane 6) is much weaker than binding to Src family kinases. Furthermore, no binding to the SH3 domains of n-Src (Fig. 1B, lane 7; containing a 6-amino acid insert in comparison to c-Src; 32), Csk (Fig. 1B, lane 2), and GAP (GTPase activating protein; Fig. 1B, lane 4) is observed. These results show that Ld proteins interact preferentially with SH3 domains of Src family kinases (c-Fyn and c-Src). The high affinity of the Ld-Src SH3 domain interaction is supported by the stability of the protein complexes under high stringency conditions (see “Experimental Procedures,” data not shown). Fig. 1C shows that this interaction depends on amino acids of the hydrophobic patch of the SH3 domain, which are essential for binding to specific ligands (20Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mutating two of these essential amino acids individually (W118A, tryptophane at position 118 changed to alanine; P133L, proline at position 133 changed to leucine; constructs generated by Erpel et al. (20Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)) results in an almost complete loss of binding to Ld proteins (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). Taken together, the results shown in Fig. 1 establish that murine and chicken Ld proteins possess an apparently identical binding specificity for SH3 domains and bind best to SH3 domains of Src family kinases. Furthermore, comparative in vitro binding studies showed that Ld proteins bind c-Src SH3 domains with higher affinity than a WW module (derived from human YAP65 (33Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14733-14741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), data not shown). Several proline-rich consensus binding sites that mediate in vitro interactions with Src family SH3 domains have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 34), but none of them is present in the proline-rich Ld domains (data not shown). Furthermore, Ld proteins of both species contain two additional short proline-rich peptides located outside their proline-rich domains (3Woychik R.P. Maas R.L. Zeller R. Vogt T.F. Leder P. Nature. 1990; 346: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Trumpp A. Blundell P.A. de la Pompa J.L. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, a series of deletions of the chicken Ld protein isoform IV were generated (Fig. 2A) to establish the importance of the proline-rich domain in interactions with SH3 domains. The recombinant Ld proteins were expressed in cultured cells (Fig. 2B, panel input) and assayed in vitro for interaction with the c-Src SH3 domain (Fig. 2B, panels GST-Src SH3). Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig. 2A, construct 2) does not affect interaction with SH3 domains (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2). However, deletion of the proline-rich domain results in complete loss of binding (Fig. 2B, lanes 3). These results show that the proline-rich Ld domain is essential for binding to SH3 domains. Transfected COS cells expressing chicken Ld and/or c-Src proteins were used to study the formation of Ld-Src complexes in vivo (Fig. 3). Native protein extracts were prepared 2 days after transfection and normalized for their protein content. c-Src proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibodies raised against different domains and associated Ld proteins were detected by immunoblotting using Ld antibodies (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The specificity of the c-Src-immunoprecipitation was controlled by competition with the peptide used to raise the α2-17 antisera (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1-3 and 4-6). It is important to note that COS cells already express c-Src proteins, whereas they do not express detectable levels of Ld proteins (Ref. 35, and data not shown). Indeed, antibodies raised against the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of c-Src proteins both immunoprecipitate Ld-Src protein complexes from transfected cells (Fig. 3, lanes 1-3 and 10-12). Note that significantly more Ld-Src protein complexes are immunoprecipitated after increasing c-Src protein levels by co-transfection (compare Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 10 to lanes 2 and 11). Most importantly, antibodies recognizing an epitope of the c-Src SH3 domain (αSH3, mAb 327) fail to co-precipitate Ld proteins (Fig. 3, lanes 7-9), despite the fact that native Src proteins are well precipitated (e.g. Ref. 22 and data not shown). These results indicate that Ld proteins and anti-SH3 antibodies compete for binding to the SH3 domain. These results independently suggest that the SH3 domain mediates complexing of Ld and Src proteins in intact cells. Overexpression of Ld proteins in cultured cells causes abundant accumulation in both nucleus and cytoplasm, 3J. L. de la Pompa and R. Zeller, unpublished observations. indicating that c-Src proteins could complex wit h non-nuclear Ld proteins in transfected COS cells (Fig. 3). Therefore, it was important to determine if the subcellular distributions of the predominantly nucleoplasmic Ld (5Trumpp A. Blundell P.A. de la Pompa J.L. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and c-Src proteins show any overlap in fibroblasts. It is well established that c-Src proteins localize predominantly to plasma and perinuclear membranes (endosomes) in cultured fibroblasts (36Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 37Redmond T. Brott B.K. Jove R. Welsh M.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3(9): 567-576Google Scholar, 38David-Pfeuty T. Nouvian-Dooghe Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3097-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify cellular compartments containing both Ld and Src proteins, both immunolocalization and biochemical fractionation studies were performed (Fig. 4). Analysis of primary chicken embryonic fibroblasts by immunofluorescense (using affinity purified Ld antibodies) revealed the presence of non-nuclear Ld antigens in addition to the previously documented nucleoplasmic localization (Fig. 4A). Non-nuclear Ld proteins were also observed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 4B), where they seem mostly to be associated to cell membranes (arrowheads, Fig. 4B). The presence of membrane-associated Ld proteins was confirmed by biochemical fractionation of cultured cells (Fig. 4G). These results indicated that such non-nuclear Ld proteins could associate with membrane-bound c-Src proteins. Because endogenous c-Src proteins are not easily detected in fibroblasts, c-Src expressing NIH3T3 cells (Ref. 31 and Fig. 4C; see also Refs. 36Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 37Redmond T. Brott B.K. Jove R. Welsh M.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3(9): 567-576Google Scholar, 38David-Pfeuty T. Nouvian-Dooghe Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3097-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were used to co-localize c-Src and Ld proteins in optical sections by confocal laser microscopy (Fig. 4, D-F). Ld proteins were detected using affinity-purified antibodies recognizing all known Ld protein isoforms (αFP1; 5) and c-Src proteins were detected using monclonal antibodies (mAb 327; 24). These studies show that a fraction of Ld (Fig. 4D) and c-Src proteins (Fig. 4E) co-localize to perinuclear (Fig. 4F, black arrowhead) and plasma membranes (Fig. 4F, white arrowheads). The overlap is partial, because c-Src proteins are more widely distributed in plasma and perinuclear membranes than Ld proteins (compare Fig. 4, D-E, and overlap in F). The previously unnoted association (4de la Pompa J.L. James D. Zeller R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Trumpp A. Blundell P.A. de la Pompa J.L. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) of a fraction of Ld proteins with membranes was confirmed by biochemical fractionation of NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4G; for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Fractionation showed that Ld proteins (180 kDa, 5) are most abundant in the nuclear fraction, but are also detected in membrane fractions. This was never observed for other nuclear proteins such as the c-Jun transcription factor (Fig. 4G). As expected, c-Src proteins are most abundant in the membrane fraction, whereas the nuclear signal is most likely due to residual contamination by perinuclear proteins (see “Experimental Procedures” and data not shown). These studies establish that a fraction of non-nuclear Ld proteins is associated to plasma and perinuclear membranes and co-localizes with c-Src proteins in fibroblasts. Most proteins interacting with Src family kinases are substrates for phosphorylation at tyrosine residues (reviewed in Refs. 17Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar and 39Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Possible tyrosine phosphorylation of Ld proteins bound to Src kinases was assayed in vitro by kinase assays and antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting using either Src-Ld complexes from transfected cells (see above) or purified Ld and Src proteins in vitro (data not shown). However, no evidence for phosphorylation of Ld proteins at tyrosine residues has been obtained (in agreement with Ref. 35, and data not shown), indicating that Ld proteins are most likely not substrates for Src tyrosine kinases (see also “Discussion”). Genetic analysis of several Ld gene family members in different species has led to the proposal that the encoded proteins function in the establishment of cell and embryonic polarity by regulating either cytoskeletal architecture and/or cell to cell signaling during morphogenesis (for details see Introduction). The vertebrate Ld proteins are predominantly nuclear proteins expressed in a variety of different cell types during embryogenesis (4de la Pompa J.L. James D. Zeller R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Trumpp A. Blundell P.A. de la Pompa J.L. Zeller R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, these studies provided no insights into their molecular function and possible interactions with other proteins. The first evidence for interactions with other proteins was provided by Ren et al. (13Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). These authors established that a 33-amino acid peptide derived from the proline-rich domain of Ld proteins binds to the c-Abl SH3 domain in vitro. Recently, Chan et al. (16Chan D. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) isolated several SH3 and WW domains which bind in vitro to the proline-rich domain of murine formins. These studies suggested that the proline-rich domain of vertebrate Ld proteins acted as a protein-protein interaction domain, but did not provide evidence for these interactions occurring in vivo. Our studies establish that vertebrate Ld proteins possess high affinity to SH3 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases and show that Ld and c-Src proteins interact in cultured cells. Most intriguingly, this interaction seems to occur between a fraction of non-nuclear Ld proteins co-localizing with membrane-associated c-Src proteins in fibroblasts. These results indicate that subcellular localization of Ld proteins determines interaction with Src family kinases in vivo. Previous studies of the murine Ld gene products identified several formin isoforms created by alternative splicing of their amino-terminal domains (3Woychik R.P. Maas R.L. Zeller R. Vogt T.F. Leder P. Nature. 1990; 346: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is possible that only particular Ld isoforms localize to cell membranes and interact with Src family tyrosine kinases in fibroblasts. The studies by Chan et al. (16Chan D. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) led to the proposal that SH3 domains and WW modules could compete for binding to the same proline-rich Ld domain. Such competitive binding could mediate different functions of Ld proteins during developmental processes (reviewed by Ref. 15). Alternatively, our studies suggest that differential subcellular localization of Ld proteins (or of particular protein isoforms) could determine or be a consequence of interactions with alternative protein partners. c-Src proteins are inserted into membranes by myristoylation and localize predominantly to plasma and perinuclear membranes (endosomes and secretory vesicles) (Refs. 36Kaplan K.B.

Most membrane-associated c-Src proteins are inactive, whereas activated Src tyrosine kinases translocate to focal adhesions and phosphorylate adhesion plaque proteins (41Liebl E.C. Martin G.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2417-2428PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Owada M.K. Yano J. J. Biol.

Interestingly, Ld proteins associate with c-Src proteins at plasma and perinuclear membranes, but no co-localization at focal adhesions has been observed. 4R. Zeller, unpublished observations. Furthermore, association with c-Src proteins does not result in detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Ld proteins (see also Ref. 35). Interestingly, YAP65, a proline-rich protein binding to the Yes tyrosine kinase via its SH3 domain, is also not a tyrosine kinase substrate (43Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that not all proteins interacting with Src family kinases are subject to tyrosine phosphorylation and suggest a different functional relevance of their interaction with Src tyrosine kinases. Experimental evidence suggests that proteins binding to kinases via SH3 domains can also regulate their subcellular localization, activate or repress kinase activity (as shown for the Sin protein; 44), or affect phosphorylation of substrates by competitive binding (reviewed in Refs. 17Brown M.T.

Therefore, it is possible that Ld proteins exert some of their functions by altering subcellular localization and/or activity of Src family kinases and possibly other components of signal transduction cascades. Taken together, our studies provide strong evidence for direct molecular interactions of Ld proteins with membrane-associated Src tyrosine kinases in fibroblasts, but the functional relevance of this interaction remains unclear. A combination of genetic and biochemical studies will be necessary to identify the proteins relevant during embryonic pattern formation. However, recent genetic and embryological analysis of ld mutant mouse embryos provides independent evidence for direct interactions of Ld proteins with signaling cascades (10Chan D.C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Leder P. Development. 1995; 121: 3151-3162PubMed Google Scholar, 11Haramis A.G. Brown J.M. Zeller R. Development. 1995; 121: 4237-4245PubMed Google Scholar). These studies show that establishment of the fibroblast growth factor-4/SHH signaling feedback loop is disrupted in limb buds of ld mutant embryos. Interestingly, it has been shown that the c-Src kinase associates with fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 and that this association triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of Src substrates (46Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, constitutive activation of Src family kinases in embryos lacking a functional Csk gene causes severe alterations of embryogenesis (47Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 48Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These studies show that tight regulation of Src family kinases is essential for normal progression of development. Therefore, it is possible that molecular interaction of Ld proteins with Src family kinases directly links Ld gene products to the embryonic signaling cascades disrupted in ld mutant limb buds (10Chan D.C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Leder P. Development. 1995; 121: 3151-3162PubMed Google Scholar, 11Haramis A.G. Brown J.M. Zeller R. Development. 1995; 121: 4237-4245PubMed Google Scholar).

INTRODUCTIONThe accompanying paper (1Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33457-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) discusses the relationships between the chitin catabolic cascade and the glucose and N-acetylglucosamine transporters/chemoreceptors in the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii. The relevant proteins are the sugar-specific Enzyme II complexes of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS). 1The abbreviations used are: PTSphosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase systemkbkilobase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s). In Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Glc and GlcNAc are also substrates of the mannose complex, IIMan (2Curtis S.J. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jones-Mortimer M.C. Kornberg H.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 117: 369-376PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, in screening V. furnissii genomic libraries in E. coli, a V. furnissii IIMan equivalent was detected because it conferred a Glc+ phenotype to E. coli ptsG ptsM mutants. We report here that V. furnissii ptsM differs from its E. coli homolog in the number of polypeptides required for its function, the gene order, and in its substrate specificity.The cloned V. furnissii DNA fragment contained two additional open reading frames. The deduced amino acid sequences of these open reading frames indicate that one encodes a GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase, and the other a Fru-1,6-diP aldolase.DISCUSSIONWe have proposed that (a) chemotaxis to Glc and trehalose may be the mechanism by which marine (and terrestrial?) bacteria locate chitin-producing organisms (13Yu C. Bassler B.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24276-24286Google Scholar), and (b) chemotaxis to and transport of GlcNAc are essential for functioning of the chitin catabolic cascade in V. furnissii (9Yu C. Lee A. Bassler B.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24260-24267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An accompanying paper (1Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33457-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) describes the cloning and characterization of a Glc and a GlcNAc transporter from this organism. Both are PTS sugars in V. furnissii, and the respective Enzyme II complexes serve as the sugar receptors in both chemotaxis and uptake. However, bacteria often use more than one system for chemotaxis/transport to a given sugar. The IIMan complex of E. coli, for example, recognizes both Glc and GlcNAc. To more fully understand the physiology of V. furnissii therefore required an extensive search for alternative chemotaxis/transporters for Glc and GlcNAc. The strategy that we followed was to screen libraries of V. furnissii DNA in E. coli Glc− mutants, since Glc is transported by the largest number of systems (both PTS and non-PTS transporters) in the enteric bacteria. We report here that such screenings led to the molecular cloning of the V. furnissii ptsM complex.The Enzyme II complexes of the PTS comprise from one to as many as four individually coded polypeptide chains (for reviews, see Refs. 25Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar and 26Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 534-594Crossref Google Scholar). The most complex are the B. subtilis fructose or levulose (27Martin-Verstraete I. Debarbouille A.K. Rapoport G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and Klebsiella pneumoniae Sor (L-sorbose) Enzyme II complexes (28Wohrl B.M. Lengeler J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Wehmeier U.F. Nobelmann B. Lengeler J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7784-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which consist of four proteins each. The sequences of these proteins are similar to the three proteins of the E. coli IIMan complex. The latter is encoded by three adjacent genes (4Williams N. Fox D.K. Shea C. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Erni B. Zanolari B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15495-15503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) designated manX (encodes IIIMan, also called IIABMan), manY (encodes IIPMan), and manZ (encodes IIBMan). 2As noted earlier in this paper, the gene designations are based on the recommendations of B. Bachmann (18Bachmann B.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 130-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PTS nomenclature system is described in recent reviews (25Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 26Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 534-594Crossref Google Scholar). An alternative has been proposed for both the genetic and protein nomenclatures (26Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 534-594Crossref Google Scholar, 30Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the designation III is supplanted by IIA, and the nomenclature is based on similarity of the functional domains of the PTS permeases. In the latter system, the proteins encoded by the three E. coli ptsM genes were designated as follows: manX, IIAB; manY, IIC; manZ, IID. The protein IIPMan (and also possibly IIBMan) is required for phage λ DNA penetration of the E. coli inner membrane (4Williams N. Fox D.K. Shea C. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the V. furnissii homolog does not permit penetration of the cytoplasmic membrane by phage λ DNA.E. coli IIMan transfers the phosphoryl group from phospho-HPr to Man, Glc, 2-deoxyglucose, Fru, GlcNAc, GlcNH2, and other sugars, concomitant with their translocation (25Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 29Wehmeier U.F. Nobelmann B. Lengeler J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7784-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By sharp contrast, the V. furnissii IIMan complex apparently phosphorylates only Man and Glc.Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned V. furnissii DNA revealed six closely linked open reading frames (Fig. 3). The first four showed identity with the subunits of the E. coli Man permease. The other two encoded proteins similar to GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase and fructose 1,6-bisP aldolase.Four separate proteins were encoded by the first four open reading frames in the plasmid p3H1S. All four proteins were required for sugar phosphorylation, and they functioned, both in vivo and in vitro, with E. coli phospho-HPr as the phosphoryl donor. By marked contrast, individual subunits of the V. furnissii permease were unable to substitute for their E. coli IIMan homologs, i.e. a functional IIMan complex was observed only when the transformants expressed the three E. coli or the four V. furnissii proteins. Apparently there is insufficient homology between the V. furnissii and E. coli permeases to allow inter-subunit complementation. It is, however, important to note that the V. furnissii proteins formed functional IIMan complexes when transcribed from different plasmids. From this it appears that the integral membrane components of the V. furnissii IIMan complex properly fold and recognize one another after being separately expressed. It will be interesting to determine whether this association takes place before or after insertion into the membrane.Enzyme II complexes comprise three functional domains: a hydrophilic domain, which possesses the first phosphorylation site and accepts the phosphoryl group from HPr; a second hydrophilic domain containing another phosphorylation site; and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, which binds and transports the sugar. The domains may be in a single or in separate proteins. In the E. coli IIMan complex, there are two transmembrane domains, IIBMan and IIPMan, and a hydrophilic subunit, IIIMan. IIIMan consists of two functional subdomains linked by an Ala-Pro-rich hinge peptide; each subdomain contains a phosphorylation site (16Erni B. Zanolari B. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5238-5247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the phosphotransfer reactions, IIIMan is phosphorylated at residue His-10 by phospho-HPr. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to His-175, in the second functional domain of IIIMan (16Erni B. Zanolari B. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5238-5247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, transfer of the phosphoryl group to the sugar then requires the two membrane proteins, IIPMan and IIBMan (4Williams N. Fox D.K. Shea C. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Mao Q. Schunk T. Flukiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5258-5265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The two subdomains of IIIMan are complementary when separated in vitro by protease digestion, or in vivo by molecular genetic techniques (16Erni B. Zanolari B. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5238-5247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Stolz et al. (31Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded from a study of IIIMan point mutants that His-86 is required for phosphotransfer between His-10 and His-175 and that His-86 can substitute for His-10 provided that it is on the same IIIMan polypeptide as His-175.The deduced amino acid sequences of the V. furnissii IIMan complex shared identity with the four subunits of B. subtilis Enzyme IILev (from 25.7% to 26.1% identity) and K. pneumoniae Enzyme IISor (from 19% to 36.6% identity). But the greatest identity was with E. coli Enzyme IIMan (Fig. 6). We have designated the V. furnissii proteins ManW (15.9 kDa, 30% identity with the N-terminal domain of E. coli IIIMan), ManX (17.2 kDa, 37% identity with the C-terminal domain of E. coli IIIMan), ManY (27 kDa, 28% identity with E. coli IIPMan), and ManZ (31.7 kDa, 31% identity with E. coli IIBMan).The two phosphorylation sites in E. coli IIIMan (ManX) are conserved in the V. furnissii proteins, with the homolog of E. coli His-10 located in V. furnissii ManW and the homolog of E. coli His-175 located in V. furnissii ManX. As expected, the Ala-Pro-rich motif that links the functional domains of E. coli IIIMan (ManX) is not present in the V. furnissii permease. Perhaps more interestingly, there is no His residue corresponding to His-86 of E. coli IIIMan in V. furnissii ManW. Thus, when the two subdomains of E. coli IIIMan are separated, His-86 appears to be unnecessary for phosphoryl transfer.Our data therefore suggest that the single gene, manX, which encodes IIIMan in E. coli, is a fusion product of two genes, manX and manW. Alternatively, the reverse could have occurred, separating one gene into two genes in V. furnissii. This separation also occurs in the B. subtilis lev (27Martin-Verstraete I. Debarbouille A.K. Rapoport G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and K. pneumoniae sor (29Wehmeier U.F. Nobelmann B. Lengeler J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7784-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) equivalents of E. coli manX. However, in lev and sor, the genes encoding each of the III-like protein domains are adjacent to one another, unlike the separation observed in the V. furnissii man complex.The DNA fragment p3H1S contains two open reading frames besides manXYZW, but neither is essential for Man phosphorylation by the PTS. One open reading frame, designated manD, encodes a protein with identity to the E. coli enzyme, GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase (33Peri K.G. Goldie H. Waygood E.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The enzymes required for GlcNAc catabolism in E. coli are encoded by the nag operon; nagA encodes GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase. The deacetylase is the first enzyme in the GlcNAc dissimilation pathway after the sugar enters the cell as GlcNAc-6-P via the PTS (34Roseman S. Fed. Proc. 1959; 18: 984-987PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that V. furnissii ManD is functional in E. coli since it complements nagA mutants. The reason for linkage of manD with the man operon is unclear, however, since the V. furnissii nag operon also encodes a GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase (see accompanying article; Ref. 1). The deduced sequences of the two V. furnissii deacetylases are only 29% identical (data not shown). One possibility for the linkage of manD with ptsM in V. furnissii is that the true substrate of the deacetylase is N-acetylmannosamine-6-P. N-Acetylmannosamine is a substrate of E. coli ptsM (35Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and linking it with a deacetylase would convert external ManNAc to internal mannosamine-6-P. There are, of course, other deacetylases for derivatives of GlcNAc, such as the NodB proteins and chitin deacetylases. However, the identity/similarity of these sequences to ManD is relatively small (data not shown).Another open reading frame (manF) linked with manXYZW and manD potentially encodes a protein that is similar to several bacterial aldolases. ManF is not required for mannose uptake. Further analysis, such as transcriptional mapping in wild-type V. furnissii, is required to conclusively demonstrate the co-expression of manXYZW, manD, and manF.In sum, the V. furnissii ptsM operon has been identified. While it is similar to E. coli ptsM, it exhibits interesting and potentially important differences that may reflect different physiological roles in the two organisms. For example, in E. coli, ptsM is an alternate path for GlcNAc uptake but apparently not in V. furnissii. These results explain our previous observation that a mutation in nagE (which encodes the membrane receptor, IINag) prevents V. furnissii from taking up or exhibiting chemotaxis to GlcNAc (9Yu C. Lee A. Bassler B.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24260-24267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the complexity of the chitin catabolic cascade in this Vibrio (9Yu C.

Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be essential that GlcNAc uptake and phosphorylation be limited to a single permease that is maintained under stringent control.

However, bacteria often use more than one system for chemotaxis/transport to a given sugar. The IIMan complex of E. coli, for example, recognizes both Glc and GlcNAc. To more fully understand the physiology of V. furnissii therefore required an extensive search for alternative chemotaxis/transporters for Glc and GlcNAc. The strategy that we followed was to screen libraries of V. furnissii DNA in E. coli Glc− mutants, since Glc is transported by the largest number of systems (both PTS and non-PTS transporters) in the enteric bacteria. We report here that such screenings led to the molecular cloning of the V. furnissii ptsM complex.The Enzyme II complexes of the PTS comprise from one to as many as four individually coded polypeptide chains (for reviews, see Refs. 25Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar and 26Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7784-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which consist of four proteins each. The sequences of these proteins are similar to the three proteins of the E. coli IIMan complex. The latter is encoded by three adjacent genes (4Williams N. Fox D.K. Shea C. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Erni B.

Chem. 1985; 260: 15495-15503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) designated manX (encodes IIIMan, also called IIABMan), manY (encodes IIPMan), and manZ (encodes IIBMan). 2As noted earlier in this paper, the gene designations are based on the recommendations of B. Bachmann (18Bachmann B.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 130-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PTS nomenclature system is described in recent reviews (25Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 26Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 534-594Crossref Google Scholar). An alternative has been proposed for both the genetic and protein nomenclatures (26Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 534-594Crossref Google Scholar, 30Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the designation III is supplanted by IIA, and the nomenclature is based on similarity of the functional domains of the PTS permeases. In the latter system, the proteins encoded by the three E. coli ptsM genes were designated as follows: manX, IIAB; manY, IIC; manZ, IID. The protein IIPMan (and also possibly IIBMan) is required for phage λ DNA penetration of the E. coli inner membrane (4Williams N. Fox D.K. Shea C. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the V. furnissii homolog does not permit penetration of the cytoplasmic membrane by phage λ DNA.E. coli IIMan transfers the phosphoryl group from phospho-HPr to Man, Glc, 2-deoxyglucose, Fru, GlcNAc, GlcNH2, and other sugars, concomitant with their translocation (25Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 29Wehmeier U.F. Nobelmann B. Lengeler J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7784-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By sharp contrast, the V. furnissii IIMan complex apparently phosphorylates only Man and Glc.Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned V. furnissii DNA revealed six closely linked open reading frames (Fig. 3). The first four showed identity with the subunits of the E. coli Man permease. The other two encoded proteins similar to GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase and fructose 1,6-bisP aldolase.Four separate proteins were encoded by the first four open reading frames in the plasmid p3H1S. All four proteins were required for sugar phosphorylation, and they functioned, both in vivo and in vitro, with E. coli phospho-HPr as the phosphoryl donor. By marked contrast, individual subunits of the V. furnissii permease were unable to substitute for their E. coli IIMan homologs, i.e. a functional IIMan complex was observed only when the transformants expressed the three E. coli or the four V. furnissii proteins. Apparently there is insufficient homology between the V. furnissii and E. coli permeases to allow inter-subunit complementation. It is, however, important to note that the V. furnissii proteins formed functional IIMan complexes when transcribed from different plasmids. From this it appears that the integral membrane components of the V. furnissii IIMan complex properly fold and recognize one another after being separately expressed. It will be interesting to determine whether this association takes place before or after insertion into the membrane.Enzyme II complexes comprise three functional domains: a hydrophilic domain, which possesses the first phosphorylation site and accepts the phosphoryl group from HPr; a second hydrophilic domain containing another phosphorylation site; and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, which binds and transports the sugar. The domains may be in a single or in separate proteins. In the E. coli IIMan complex, there are two transmembrane domains, IIBMan and IIPMan, and a hydrophilic subunit, IIIMan. IIIMan consists of two functional subdomains linked by an Ala-Pro-rich hinge peptide; each subdomain contains a phosphorylation site (16Erni B. Zanolari B. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5238-5247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the phosphotransfer reactions, IIIMan is phosphorylated at residue His-10 by phospho-HPr. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to His-175, in the second functional domain of IIIMan (16Erni B. Zanolari B. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5238-5247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, transfer of the phosphoryl group to the sugar then requires the two membrane proteins, IIPMan and IIBMan (4Williams N. Fox D.K. Shea C. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Mao Q. Schunk T. Flukiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5258-5265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The two subdomains of IIIMan are complementary when separated in vitro by protease digestion, or in vivo by molecular genetic techniques (16Erni B. Zanolari B. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5238-5247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Stolz et al. (31Stolz B. Huber M. Markovic-Housley Z. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27094-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded from a study of IIIMan point mutants that His-86 is required for phosphotransfer between His-10 and His-175 and that His-86 can substitute for His-10 provided that it is on the same IIIMan polypeptide as His-175.The deduced amino acid sequences of the V. furnissii IIMan complex shared identity with the four subunits of B. subtilis Enzyme IILev (from 25.7% to 26.1% identity) and K. pneumoniae Enzyme IISor (from 19% to 36.6% identity). But the greatest identity was with E. coli Enzyme IIMan (Fig. 6). We have designated the V. furnissii proteins ManW (15.9 kDa, 30% identity with the N-terminal domain of E. coli IIIMan), ManX (17.2 kDa, 37% identity with the C-terminal domain of E. coli IIIMan), ManY (27 kDa, 28% identity with E. coli IIPMan), and ManZ (31.7 kDa, 31% identity with E. coli IIBMan).The two phosphorylation sites in E. coli IIIMan (ManX) are conserved in the V. furnissii proteins, with the homolog of E. coli His-10 located in V. furnissii ManW and the homolog of E. coli His-175 located in V. furnissii ManX. As expected, the Ala-Pro-rich motif that links the functional domains of E. coli IIIMan (ManX) is not present in the V. furnissii permease. Perhaps more interestingly, there is no His residue corresponding to His-86 of E. coli IIIMan in V. furnissii ManW. Thus, when the two subdomains of E. coli IIIMan are separated, His-86 appears to be unnecessary for phosphoryl transfer.Our data therefore suggest that the single gene, manX, which encodes IIIMan in E. coli, is a fusion product of two genes, manX and manW. Alternatively, the reverse could have occurred, separating one gene into two genes in V. furnissii. This separation also occurs in the B. subtilis lev (27Martin-Verstraete I. Debarbouille A.K. Rapoport G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and K. pneumoniae sor (29Wehmeier U.F. Nobelmann B. Lengeler J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7784-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) equivalents of E. coli manX. However, in lev and sor, the genes encoding each of the III-like protein domains are adjacent to one another, unlike the separation observed in the V. furnissii man complex.The DNA fragment p3H1S contains two open reading frames besides manXYZW, but neither is essential for Man phosphorylation by the PTS. One open reading frame, designated manD, encodes a protein with identity to the E. coli enzyme, GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase (33Peri K.G. Goldie H. Waygood E.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The enzymes required for GlcNAc catabolism in E. coli are encoded by the nag operon; nagA encodes GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase. The deacetylase is the first enzyme in the GlcNAc dissimilation pathway after the sugar enters the cell as GlcNAc-6-P via the PTS (34Roseman S. Fed. Proc. 1959; 18: 984-987PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that V. furnissii ManD is functional in E. coli since it complements nagA mutants. The reason for linkage of manD with the man operon is unclear, however, since the V. furnissii nag operon also encodes a GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase (see accompanying article; Ref. 1). The deduced sequences of the two V. furnissii deacetylases are only 29% identical (data not shown). One possibility for the linkage of manD with ptsM in V. furnissii is that the true substrate of the deacetylase is N-acetylmannosamine-6-P. N-Acetylmannosamine is a substrate of E. coli ptsM (35Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and linking it with a deacetylase would convert external ManNAc to internal mannosamine-6-P. There are, of course, other deacetylases for derivatives of GlcNAc, such as the NodB proteins and chitin deacetylases. However, the identity/similarity of these sequences to ManD is relatively small (data not shown).Another open reading frame (manF) linked with manXYZW and manD potentially encodes a protein that is similar to several bacterial aldolases. ManF is not required for mannose uptake. Further analysis, such as transcriptional mapping in wild-type V. furnissii, is required to conclusively demonstrate the co-expression of manXYZW, manD, and manF.In sum, the V. furnissii ptsM operon has been identified. While it is similar to E. coli ptsM, it exhibits interesting and potentially important differences that may reflect different physiological roles in the two organisms. For example, in E. coli, ptsM is an alternate path for GlcNAc uptake but apparently not in V. furnissii. These results explain our previous observation that a mutation in nagE (which encodes the membrane receptor, IINag) prevents V. furnissii from taking up or exhibiting chemotaxis to GlcNAc (9Yu C. Lee A. Bassler B.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24260-24267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the complexity of the chitin catabolic cascade in this Vibrio (9Yu C.

Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be essential that GlcNAc uptake and phosphorylation be limited to a single permease that is maintained under stringent control. We have proposed that (a) chemotaxis to Glc and trehalose may be the mechanism by which marine (and terrestrial?) bacteria locate chitin-producing organisms (13Yu C. Bassler B.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24276-24286Google Scholar), and (b) chemotaxis to and transport of GlcNAc are essential for functioning of the chitin catabolic cascade in V. furnissii (9Yu C. Lee A. Bassler B.L.

https://openalex.org/W1993174943,"The dual specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatase rVH6 belongs to a subfamily of enzymes that have in vivo and in vitro catalytic activity against mitogen-activated protein kinases. A method was developed for the expression and efficient purification of recombinant rVH6 in quantities sufficient for physical and kinetic characterization of the enzyme. Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry verified the mass of purified rVH6 to be 43,500 ± 150, and NH2-terminal sequence analysis confirmed the predicted amino acid sequence. Kinetic characterization of full-length rVH6 identified the critical ionizations involved in the kcat/Km parameter (apparent pKa values 5.1 and 6.6) and revealed a pH-independent kcat value of 0.014 s−1. In an attempt to define the essential catalytic core of this enzyme, amino acids 134-381 of rVH6 were expressed, purified, and characterized enzymatically. Kinetic analysis revealed that the truncated enzyme exhibited a turnover value similar to that of the full-length enzyme (kcat = 0.017 s−1), with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Secondary structure prediction and molecular modeling of rVH6 based on the x-ray structure of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase, VHR, further supported the assignment of residues 134-381 to the core catalytic domain of rVH6.

Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in proteins regulates many cellular functions, including cell growth and proliferation, cell cycle progression, and receptor-mediated responses to external stimuli (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). The extent of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation within the cell is regulated by the coordinated activity of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases (PTPases) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPasesprotein-tyrosine phosphatasesdsPTPasesdual specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatasepNPPp-nitrophenyl phosphateβ-MEβ-mercaptoethanolGSTglutathione S-transferaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMKPsMAPK phosphatasesCDcatalytic domain. (reviewed in Ref. 2). The vaccinia virus protein, VH1, was identified as the first member of a growing subclass of PTPases, called dual specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatases (dsPTPases), which possess phosphatase activity directed against both phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) and phosphoserine (Ser(P)) containing peptides (3Guan K.L. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Additional dsPTPases have been identified based on their sequence similarity to VH1 and their ability to hydrolyze Tyr(P), Ser(P), and Thr(P) phosphate monoesters (reviewed in Ref. 4). DsPTPases contain an extended PTPase active site signature sequence, VXVHCXXGXXRS(X)5AY(L/I)M, which includes the catalytic cysteine that is essential for the formation of the phosphoenzyme reaction intermediate (5Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Outside of the conserved active site, dsPTPases share little sequence identity with other members of the PTPase family. Recent elucidation of the crystal structure of the human dsPTPase, VHR, has revealed that VHR is composed of structural elements shared by the catalytic domains of other PTPases (6Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This finding, along with the well established catalytic mechanism of VHR (7Denu J.M.

DsPTPases have been shown to play key roles in several cellular signaling processes. The cell cycle regulator p80cdc25 has been shown to dephosphorylate both Tyr(P)15 and Thr(P)14 in p34cdc2 of fission yeast, thereby activating the maturation promoting factor complex and allowing the cell to enter into mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 8). Other dsPTPases, including CL100 (MKP-1), PAC-1, HVH2 (MKP-2), B23 (hVH3), hVH5, and rVH6 (MKP-3) 2CL100 is also known as MAP kinase phosphatase 1 or MKP-1 (4Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Several laboratories have identified mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) as substrates for these enzymes (4Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Previously, a novel dsPTPase was isolated and cloned from a rat hippocampus brain library, termed rVH6 (rat VH1-like phosphatase 6) (14Mourey R.J. Vega Q.C. Campbell J.S. Wenderoth M.P. Hauschka S.D. Krebs E.G. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3795-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RVH6 was shown to exhibit phosphatase activity in vitro against MAPK, contain an NH2-terminal extension (~133 amino acids), and was the first dsPTPase to be localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, it has proven to be very difficult to express and purify the entire coding sequence of several dsPTPases that contain extensive NH2- or COOH-terminal extensions (i.e. B23(hYH3); Ref. 12), including rVH6. In this study, we outline a method for expression and purification of recombinant full-length rVH6 that may be applicable to other dsPTPases. Availability of the purified protein has enabled us to physically and kinetically characterize the enzyme and define the residues that comprise the catalytic core of rVH6. This paper indicates that there are specific functional roles for individual structural domains of rVH6 that are generally applicable to other MAPK phosphatases. The coding sequence of rVH6 was isolated as described previously (14Mourey R.J. Vega Q.C. Campbell J.S. Wenderoth M.P. Hauschka S.D. Krebs E.G. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3795-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RVH6 coding sequence, modified to encode a carboxyl-terminal polyhistidine tag, was ligated into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of pT7-7 vector. pT7-7rVH6(His)6 was used to transform BL21/DE3 (Novagen) Escherichia coli by standard methods. Single colonies were selected and grown in 50 ml of 2 × YT medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) overnight with shaking at 37°C. The 50-ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of 2 × YT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37°C until the absorbance at 600 nm was between 0.4 and 0.8. Following the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mM, the culture was incubated at room temperature (22°C) with shaking for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g, and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mMβ-ME) per liter of culture and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell press at 1200 lbs/in2. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant decanted into a 50-ml conical tube, to which was added 1 ml of 50% Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) slurry for every 5 ml of supernatant. The supernatant was incubated batchwise with the Ni-NTA-agarose at 4°C for 1 h. Following the incubation, the supernatant/agarose mixture was poured into a 100-ml column and washed with 20 bed volumes of lysis buffer, followed by 20 bed volumes of wash buffer (400 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 10 mM imidazole, 10 mMβ-ME, 10% glycerol, final pH 6.0). The enzyme was eluted from the column with a 100-ml 0-0.5 M imidazole gradient in wash buffer. Fractions containing enzymatic activity against p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) were pooled and concentrated with a Centriprep-30 filtration unit (Amicon), applied onto a Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column (2.5 × 100 cm), and eluted with 200 ml of buffer containing 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mMβ-ME, 1 mM EDTA. Fractions exhibiting phosphatase activity were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing a single protein band corresponding to the size of rVH6, as determined by Coomassie staining, were pooled and stored at 4°C. The mass of the pure protein was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopy on a VESTEC-2000 instrument. The amino acid sequence of the NH2 terminus of the enzyme was analyzed by an Applied Biosystems 473A sequenator at the University of Michigan Protein Core Facility. The catalytic domain of rVH6, comprised of amino acids 134-381, was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The 700-base pair insert was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the rVH6 coding sequence (14Mourey R.J. Vega Q.C. Campbell J.S. Wenderoth M.P. Hauschka S.D. Krebs E.G. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3795-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with 5′ primer 5′-CTTGGGATCCGGTGGCTTCAGTAAGTT-3′ and 3′ primer 5′-CTTGGAATTCTCACGTAGATTGCAGGG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-KText (15Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) expression vector to produce pGEX-rVH6-CD (Catalytic Domain). pGEX-rVH6-CD was used to transform BL21/DE3 E. coli, and the cells were grown and induced as described for full-length rVH6. The harvested bacterial pellets were resuspended in 17 ml of modified lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mMβ-ME, 0.8 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone/liter of culture, and the cells lysed by passage through a French press. The lysed cell suspension was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. For every 10 ml of clarified supernatant, 3 ml of 50% glutathione-agarose (in phosphate-buffered saline) was added and the suspension rotated at 4°C for 1 h. The agarose was washed in batch four times with 25 ml of lysis buffer. GST-rVH6-CD was eluted from the agarose by incubation in 20 ml of modified lysis buffer containing 20 mM glutathione for 30 min at 4°C. The sample was supplemented with 1 M Tris, pH 7.4, 80 mM EDTA, 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of 150 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 8 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-ME. The eluant was assayed for phosphatase activity as described below. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining were used to confirm the purity of the fusion protein.using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). In Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, C is the pH-independent value of either kcat or kcat/Km; H is the proton concentration; Ka, Kb, and Kc are the ionization constants of the residues involved in the enzymatic reaction; and S is substrate concentration.(Eq. 1) (Eq. 2) The assays were performed as described previously for human dsPTPase VHR (16Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Artificial PTPase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate was used for all assays. The final concentration of enzyme in the reactions ranged between 0.53 and 2.4 μM. Initial velocities were fitted directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) using the nonlinear least squares program KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). Data analysis and construction of a pH profile curve for the kinetic parameter kcat/Km (Equation 3) (17Rife J.E. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2328-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were performed (Eq. 3) (Eq. 4) Experimental procedures for rapid reaction assays were performed as described previously (5Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), using a Hi-Tech SP-61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Salisbury, UK). Oxyanions vanadate, tungstate, and phosphate were tested to verify their ability to inhibit rVH6 phosphatase activity. The concentration of each inhibitor was held constant while the substrate concentration was varied to allow for the calculation of Ki, using KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). Reverse phase HPLC was employed for the separation and quantitation of the substrates and products from an rVH6-catalyzed reaction with a diphosphorylated MAP kinase peptide, as described previously by Denu et al. (18Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence corresponded to the putative activation sites on MAP(177-189) kinase (DHTGFLpTEpYVATR). A continuous spectrophotometric assay previously described by Zheng et al. (19Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16116-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to follow the dephosphorylation of the Tyr(P) residue in the diphosphorylated peptide by taking advantage of the difference in absorbance at 282 nm between Tyr(P) and Tyr. The difference in absorbance can be used to follow the complete time course of the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of Tyr(P) in the peptide. Initial concentrations of peptide ranged between 100 and 500 μM, and the final enzyme concentration in the reactions was 7.2 μM. The data were directly fit to Equation 3, and an initial rate (kcat/Km) was calculated. RVH6 primary sequence was aligned with dsPTPases CL100 and PAC-1, and subsequent secondary structure predictions were performed as described (20Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A model of rVH6 was constructed, using the crystal structure backbone of VHR (amino acids 11-185) (6Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) as a template. VHR amino acid residues were mutated to generate the rVH6 structure using graphics program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Small insertions and deletions in the backbone of the model were modified using the lego-loop option of O. The model was placed in a box of 900 water molecules and subjected to energy minimization and simulated molecular dynamics using XPLOR (22Brunger T.A. XPLOR Manual: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1993Google Scholar). Recombinant histidine-tagged rVH6 (rVH6(His)6) was expressed and purified, with approximately 17 mg of pure enzyme recovered from 4 liters of bacterial culture (Table I). The protein eluted at 250 mM imidazole from the Ni-NTA agarose and was >70% pure, as shown by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1, lane 2). Subsequent purification by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration led to >98% pure enzyme (Fig. 1, lane 3). An apparent decline in specific enzyme activity following G-75 Sephadex purification was attributed to the removal of bacterial contaminants capable of pNPP hydrolysis, and this loss was consistently observed with each preparation of the protein. Purified rVH6(His)6 could be stored for several weeks at 4°C in the presence of 10 mMβ-ME and 250 mM NaCl with no loss of activity.Table I.Purification table of rVH6StepVolumeProteinTotal proteinActivityaThis is a typical preparation from 4 liters of bacterial culture, as described under “Materials and Methods.” One milliunit is 1 nmol of pNP formed per min at 30°C.Total unitsSpecific activitymlmg/mlmgmilliunits/mlmilliunitsmilliunits/mgFrench press655.05328.399643020Ni-NTA-agarose421.3857.936152030Sephadex G-75141.2417.32231020a This is a typical preparation from 4 liters of bacterial culture, as described under “Materials and Methods.” One milliunit is 1 nmol of pNP formed per min at 30°C. Open table in a new tab SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of rVH6 indicated an apparent mass of ~43 kDa (Fig. 1). This was consistent with the elution time estimated for the protein when subjected to size exclusion chromatography (not shown). Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry confirmed the molecular mass of the enzyme to be 43,500 ± 150, which agreed with the predicted mass of ~42,315 Da for a 381-amino acid protein. Amino-terminal sequencing verified that the expressed protein starts with the predicted amino acid sequence Met-Ile-Asp-Thr-Leu-Arg. The values for kcat and kcat/Km were determined as a function of pH with pNPP as substrate. The kcat/Km parameter for rVH6 decreased with a slope of +2 below pH 6.6 (Fig. 2), indicating that two ionizable groups (pKa values of 5.1 and 6.6 ± 0.22) must be unprotonated for catalysis. The kcat/Km pH profile for VHR (16Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) has been included for comparison to show that rVH6 displayed a distinct rate profile, particularly on the basic limb of the curve. The kcat/Km parameter for rVH6 displayed a two-ionization curve, which is in contrast to the three ionizations observed for VHR (Fig. 2). RVH6 lacks a critical third ionization that is present in the curve exhibited by VHR (pKa = 5.7), which must be protonated for catalysis. The kcat parameter of rVH6 displayed less than 2-fold difference over a pH range of 5.4 to 9.0 (Fig. 3). Again, the kcat value for VHR has been included for comparison (16Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), to show the extreme differences in the kcat parameter between the two enzymes. RVH6 displayed a linear, pH-independent profile, with an average kcat value of 0.01 ± 0.0005 s−1, in contrast to the pH-dependent bell-shaped profile exhibited by VHR. It has been previously demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a substrate for rVH6 in vitro (14Mourey R.J. Vega Q.C. Campbell J.S. Wenderoth M.P. Hauschka S.D. Krebs E.G.

Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We tested the dual-specific catalytic nature of rVH6, against the diphosphorylated MAP(177-189) kinase peptide, DHTGFLpTEpYVATR (18Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Tyr(P) by full-length rVH6 could be followed using a continuous spectrophotometric assay, as described under “Materials and Methods.” By varying the peptide concentration in each reaction, an initial rate of Tyr(P) dephosphorylation (kcat/Km) of 5.97 ± 0.1 M−1 s−1 was calculated (Equation 3). The Tyr(P) residue in the peptide is approximately a 3.5-fold better substrate for rVH6 than pNPP; however, due to the extremely slow reactivity of rVH6 and the inability to saturate the enzyme with peptide, we were unable to calculate the kinetic parameters kcat and Km for rVH6 with this substrate. To visualize and quantitate dephosphorylation of the Thr(P) residue of the peptide, we employed an HPLC-based assay (18Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) which allowed us to monitor all possible phosphorylation states of the peptide occurring in the reaction. As evidenced from the HPLC elution profiles (Fig. 5), Tyr(P) was rapidly hydrolyzed from the diphosphorylated (Thr(P)/Tyr(P)) peptide (~35% within 60 min), whereas no Thr(P) dephosphorylation was observed in significant amounts from the monophosphorylated (Thr(P)) peptide after 23 h (Fig. 5). rVH6 was rapidly reacted with pNPP in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer, and the appearance of product, p-nitrophenol, was followed at 405 nm. The kinetic traces displayed no discernible biphasic characteristics (i.e. no burst of p-nitrophenol formation); however, linear rates were observed that were consistent with steady-state kcat values. At pH 7 and 30°C, the linear rate of 0.2 min−1 (average of seven traces) was obtained when 11.3 μM rVH6 was rapidly mixed with 10 mM pNPP. Steady-state initial velocities were 0.3 min−1 under identical conditions. Inhibition constants, Ki, were calculated for three known phosphatase inhibitors, phosphate, tungstate, and vanadate. The Ki values for phosphate, tungstate, and vanadate for rVH6 were 50 mM, 29 μM and 41 μM, respectively, when pNPP was used as substrate. Both phosphate and tungstate exhibited competitive inhibition, whereas vanadate displayed uncompetitive inhibition, when the data were fitted by KinetAsyst. Vanadate is a potent inhibitor of PTPases and has been shown to covalently bind to the catalytic cysteine of the Yersinia phosphatase (7Denu J.M. Lohse D.J. Vijayalakshmi V. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Vanadate forms a complex with the active site cysteine which adopts a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry that mimics the catalytic transition state of the enzyme-substrate complex. Formation of a covalent adduct between VO4 and rVH6 is consistent with the observed pattern of inhibition. The amino terminus of rVH6, as well as other MAPK phosphatases, contains an extended amino acid sequence, with regions that are homologous to the dsPTPase, p80cdc25, termed cdc25 homology 2 (CH2) regions. While the CH2 regions in p80cdc25 flank the active site of the enzyme, these regions in rVH6, CL100, and PAC-1 are located amino-terminal to the catalytic core sequence (Fig. 4, shown in green and blue). The functional role of the CH2 regions in p80cdc25 and the dsPTPases is unknown. In an effort to determine the necessity of these residues in enzyme catalysis, we removed the first 133 amino acids of rVH6, which contain the CH2 regions, and expressed the proposed catalytic domain (CD) (amino acids 134-381) as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-rVH6-CD). Kinetic experiments were conducted with the truncated version of rVH6. Full-length rVH6 and rVH6-CD had nearly identical kcat, Km, and kcat/Km kinetic parameters at both pH 7 and 8 (Table II). rVH6-CD catalytic activity directed against diphosphorylated MAP(177-189) kinase peptide (DHTGFLpTEpYVATR) was comparable with that observed with full-length rVH6, with the truncated protein preferentially dephosphorylating Tyr(P) (data not shown). Mourey et al. (14Mourey R.J. Vega Q.C. Campbell J.S. Wenderoth M.P. Hauschka S.D. Krebs E.G. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Our experiments with the catalytic domain of rVH6 showed levels of ERK1 inactivation that were comparable with those reported for the full-length protein (not shown, (14Mourey R.J. Vega Q.C.

Open table in a new tab To test the proposal that amino acids 134-381 form the catalytic core of rVH6, we constructed a structural model (Fig. 6) of rVH6, based on the x-ray crystallographic model of the dual specificity phosphatase VHR (6Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). RVH6 shares 30% sequence identity with VHR within the catalytic domain, and it has been demonstrated that the structure of VHR defines a minimal structural requirement for a PTPase domain (6Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). When the rVH6 and VHR primary sequences were compared, the secondary structural elements predicted for rVH6 aligned with the corresponding structural features of VHR (20Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of the helix between β3 and β4 in the VHR structure (α3 of VHR) (Fig. 6). This helix, along with three residues adjacent to it, resulted in a gap in the rVH6-VHR sequence alignment. Therefore, those seven residues were deleted, and the gap was closed using the lego-loop option in O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

The results indicate that CytR binds specifically to multiple sites at deoP2, including both the well recognized CytR site flanked by CRP1 and CRP2 and also sites coincident with CRP1 and CRP2. Binding to these multiple sites yields both cooperative and competitive interactions between CytR and CRP. Based on these findings we propose that CytR functions as a differential modulator of CRP1 versus CRP2-mediated activation. Additional high affinity specific sites are located at deoP1 and near the middle of the 600-base pair sequence separating P1 and P2.

Cephamycin C is a naturally modified cephalosporin antibiotic produced by at least 26 different actinomycetes (particularly species of Streptomyces and Nocardia) (1Martín J.F. Schaal K.P. Pulverer G. The Actinomycetes. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart1981: 417-434Google Scholar) that contains a methoxyl group as a substituent at carbon 7 of the cephem nucleus. The presence of a C-7 methoxyl group makes cephamycins resistant to the inactivation by microbial β-lactamases. The cephamycin C biosynthetic pathway starts with the condensation of three amino acids (L-α-aminoadipic acid, L-cysteine, and L-valine) to form the δ-(L-α-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) 1The abbreviations used are: ACVα-aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valineCPCcephalosporin CFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; dansyl, 5-methylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. tripeptide, the reaction being catalyzed by a large multienzyme peptide synthetase (ACV synthetase) (2Coque J.J.R. Martín J.F. Calzada J.G. Liras P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The characteristic cephem nucleus of cephamycin is synthesized from ACV by the consecutive action of (i) isopenicillin N synthase; (ii) isopenicillin N epimerase, (iii) deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (expandase), and (iv) deacetoxycephalosporin C hydroxylase (for reviews, see Refs. 3Demain A.L.

After formation of the cephem nucleus, a group of cephem-modifying enzymes (encoded by the “late” genes of the cephamycin pathway) are involved in the C-3′ carbamoylation (6Coque J.J.R. Pérez-Llarena F.J. Enguita F.J. Fuente J.L. Martín J.F. Liras P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and C-7 methoxylation (7Coque J.J.R. Enguita F.J. Martín J.F. Liras P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to form cephamycin C. These enzymatic activities are particularly important because they are responsible for the introduction of chemical substituents into the cephem ring, which modify the pharmacological characteristics of the final antibiotic. All the genes required for cephamycin biosynthesis are located in a single cluster in Nocardia lactamdurans (8Coque J.J.R. Liras P. Martín J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and in Streptomyces clavuligerus. 2F. J. Pérez-Llarena, J. F. Martín, and P.

Synthesis of the methoxyl group is catalyzed, during cephamycin C biosynthesis, by a two-protein (P7 and P8) system, encoded by the genes cmcI and cmcJ of the cephamycin C biosynthetic cluster (7Coque J.J.R. Enguita F.J. Martín J.F. Liras P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The methoxylation reaction takes place in two steps. First, the C-7 of the cephem ring is hydroxylated by an α-ketoglutarate- and NADH-dependent hydroxylase, and after this process the hydroxyl group is methylated by a methyltransferase using S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor (9Hood J.D.

Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group at C-7 derives from molecular oxygen (12O'Sullivan J. Applin R.T. Stevens C.M. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1979; 179: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence homologies, one of the components, P7 (encoded by cmcI), appears to have catalytic centers for the two enzymatic activities described above, and the other component, P8 (encoded by cmcJ), may act as a helper protein involved in the physical translocation of the substrate from one catalytic center to another (7Coque J.J.R. Enguita F.J. Martín J.F. Liras P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The characterization of two-component or multienzyme complexes involved in antibiotic biosynthesis opens new perspectives to understand channeling of substrates through the multistep biosynthetic pathways of antibiotics. Knowledge of the molecular mechanism of the methoxylation reaction would facilitate the application of this enzymatic process for the design and synthesis of new β-lactamase-resistant 7-methoxycephalosporins. In this report, we describe the characterization of the N. lactamdurans methoxylation system and provide evidence of the interaction of its protein components by chemical cross-linking and immunoaffinity chromatography; a quantitation of the interaction has been made by fluorescence spectroscopy studies. To prepare constructions for expression in Escherichia coli, the open reading frames cmcI and cmcJ were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using as template plasmid pUL54 (containing a 3.6-kilobase pair BamHI fragment of N. lactamdurans cloned into the pIJ2921) and the following synthetic oligonucleotides as primers: Oi, 5′-ATGACTGACACCACCCGCCA-3′ and Oii, 3′-CAGCCGTGGCTTCCGCTTCGAATTTT-5′, for the cmcI gene; and Oiii, 5′-GTGCCGACCGTGTCGAGTCC-3′ and Oiv, 3′-CGGGAAGGTGCTTACTTTCGAATTTT-5′, for the cmcJ gene. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were as follows: denaturation 96°C, 30 s; annealing 62°C, 30 s; and extension 76°C, 90 s. The corresponding amplified DNA fragments were purified by agarose electrophoresis, digested with HindIII, and cloned into the restriction sites XmnI and HindIII of pMAL-c2 (an expression vector which allows synthesis in E. coli of foreign peptides by fusing them to a maltose-binding protein) (New England Biolabs) (13Guan C.D. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The maltose-binding protein fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on an amylose matrix (BioLabs), and the P7 and P8 peptides were excised from the maltose-binding protein by digestion with factor Xa protease, as described by Maina et al. (14Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea III A.G. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Di Guan D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The P7 and P8 proteins purified from E. coli were used in all experiments on protein interaction studies, except in the co-purification of the P7·P8 complex from extracts of N. lactamdurans or S. clavuligerus (see below). The purified P7 and P8 proteins obtained by expression in Streptomyces lividans (15Enguita F.J. de la Fuente J.L. Martín J.F. Liras P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 137: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were used for immunization of New Zealand rabbits, by intradermal injection, using the protocol described by Dunbar and Schwoebel (16Dunbar B.S. Schwoebel E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For the primary immunization, 500 μl of protein solution in 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.5 (containing approximately 0.5 mg of the protein of interest) were emulsified with the same volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. This immunization process was repeated every 2 weeks until a total of 2.5 mg of each protein were injected into the rabbits. For the secondary immunizations, the incomplete Freund's adjuvant was employed. After the immunization was completed, blood serum was collected by centrifugation, and immunoglobulin G was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and FPLC affinity chromatography using a protein A-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described by Harlow and Lane (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antibody titers were assayed in small blood samples by immunoblotting. Linkage of the corresponding anti-P7 and anti-P8 antibodies to an activated CNBr-agarose matrix was performed using the commercial Aminolink Plus kit (Pierce Chemical). Two ml of the resin slurry equilibrated with linkage buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mM NaCl) were mixed with the same volume of purified IgG solution at 2.5 mg/ml and incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. The resin was then washed with 10 ml of linkage buffer, treated with a volume of the same buffer containing 100 mM sodium cyanoborohydride as a reductant, and incubated for 4 h at 4°C with gentle rocking. This reduction process of the free binding sites was repeated twice, and finally, the column was washed with five volumes of 1 M NaCl. The eluants of all the steps of the process were collected to monitor the amount of protein ligated to the resin. After it was prepared, the immunoaffinity resin was loaded into small columns and washed with five volumes of 1 M NaCl, to eliminate nonspecific binding to the resin. The columns were stored at 4°C in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer containing 1 mM sodium azide. For purification of P7 or P8, cell-free extracts from N. lactamdurans or S. clavuligerus (2-5 mg/ml of protein in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6), clarified previously by centrifugation at 15000 × g for 30 min, were applied to the affinity columns equilibrated in the same buffer. After loading the extracts, the columns were washed with 1.5 M NaCl solution, and the proteins retained were eluted with 100 mM glycine/HCl buffer, pH 2.8, collecting 1-ml fractions. The fractions were immediately neutralized by adding 100 μl of 1 M Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.9, to avoid denaturation of the proteins and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE of proteins was performed as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar) using a continuous buffer system (50 mM Tris, 150 mM glycine). After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore) with a semidry electroblotting system (LKB), using a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 100 mM glycine, and 20% methanol, at a constant current of 0.8 mA/cm2. The membranes were then saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking and treated with the corresponding antibodies (sera dilution 1/10000) in a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 300 mM NaCl, for 3 h at room temperature with rocking. The membranes were then washed for 15 min with 1 M NaCl and treated with a commercial mouse anti-IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega) in the same buffer for 1 h. After another membrane wash with 1 M NaCl for 15 min, the immunoreactive bands were developed with a commercial stabilized substrate solution for alkaline phosphatase (Promega), at room temperature until color appeared. Cross-linking of the P7 and P8 proteins were performed as described by Eisenstein and Shachman (19Eisenstein E. Shachman H.K. Creighton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, UK1990: 135-176Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Purified P7 and P8 proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration in a 50 mM TES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 M urea. Renaturation of the proteins was started by rapid dilution (20-fold) in the same buffer without urea followed by incubation at 30°C in a water bath for 2 h. Periodically, 150-μl aliquots were taken from the samples, and the cross-linking reaction started by adding glutaraldehyde (final concentration 14 mM), and 50 mM borate buffer, pH 8.9. The cross-linking reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 s, and then the reaction was stopped by adding sodium borohydride (final concentration 10 mM). Cross-linking of the samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. P7 and P8 proteins were labeled with dansyl chloride for fluorescence spectroscopy studies. For this purpose, 150 μg of each purified protein in 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.5 (final concentration 100 μg of protein/ml), was treated with 10 μl of a 100 mM dansyl chloride ethanolic solution, and the reaction mixture incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The excess fluorophore was eliminated by serial extractions with ethyl acetate. The dansyl derivatives of both proteins were purified by FPLC gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia), to eliminate the traces of free fluorophore present in the protein solution. The proteins were eluted with a 100 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.5. Dansylated P7 and P8 proteins showed 7-cephem hydroxylase and methyltransferase activities (up to 90% of the nondansylated proteins) suggesting that dansylation does not alter the structure of these proteins. Fluorescence determinations of the dansylated P7 and P8 proteins were performed with a SLM Aminco 48000 spectrofluorimeter. The protein samples in 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, were gently stirred at 30°C, and excited with a 325-nm light in a quartz cuvette and the emission spectra recorded (scan speed 1 nm/s and bandwidth 5 nm). All studies were made using steady state fluorescence conditions; the fluorescence contribution of the solvent was subtracted. Kinetic studies for determination of the affinity constants were carried out as described by Otto-Bruc et al. (20Otto-Bruc A. Antonny B. Vuong T.M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8636-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For Kd determination, a constant amount of each dansylated protein was treated with increasing concentrations of ligand, the mixture incubated for 5 min at 30°C to reach equilibrium, and the emission spectrum was monitored. Assuming a simple association model between proteins P7 and P8 the equilibrium constant for the protein-binding process is expressed as Kd = [P7P8]/[P7] × [P8]. This constant may be expressed with a double-reciprocal plot equation as a function of the modification of the fluorescence intensities of the first protein P7, induced by the presence of increasing amounts of P8: ΔF is the increase of P7 fluorescence originated by a specific concentration of P8, and ΔFtot the maximum increase of P7 fluorescence induced by a saturation concentration of P8 (21Kyte J. Mechanism in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing, New York1995: 145-189Google Scholar) corrected by taking into account the fluorescence modifications induced by the solvent and the added P8 protein alone. To elucidate possible interactions between the methoxylation components, in vitro binding studies were performed using the previously purified P7 and P8 proteins. Equimolecular amounts (2.0 mM) of each protein were mixed together in 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 M urea as a denaturing agent. The protein renaturation was started by rapid dilution (20-fold) followed by incubation of the solution at 30°C for 2 h. After this time, the reaction mixture was analyzed by FPLC gel filtration on a Superose 12 column. Results (Fig. 1) showed that co-renaturation of the P7 and P8 polypeptides resulted in the formation of a protein complex (peak C) with a molecular mass of 59 kDa, which corresponds to the approximate sum of the molecular mass of P7 and P8 (27 and 32 kDa, respectively). Addition of detergents, such as SDS, to the renaturation mixture inhibited the protein complex formation, even at low concentrations (0.01%). The size of the oligomers and the possible formation of higher molecular weight assemblies of the oligomers (unable to enter into the gel filtration matrix) was tested by glutaraldehyde cross-linking of the polypeptides in the assembled protein complex. Equal amounts of each protein were mixed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and after formation of the complex the assembled proteins were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. Samples were taken at different incubation times and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Results (Fig. 2) showed the presence of a single heterodimer form that reacted with antibodies against each protein. This heterodimer was efficiently formed when the oligomers were co-renatured together, but it was assembled only in small amounts (data not shown) when the experiment was carried out using the native (nondenatured) proteins. These results indicate that the formation of the complex is dependent upon the renaturation degree of the two components, and the complex appears to have a 1:1 stoichiometry, as revealed by the molecular weight of the heterodimer. Upon prolonged incubation of pure preparations of either P7 or P8 (separately) with the cross-linking agent (under renaturing conditions) no cross-linked dimer of either P7 or P8 was observed, suggesting that each protein does not associate with itself in a multimer form (data not shown). The presence of the P7·P8 complex in cell-free extracts from the cephamycin C-producing actinomycetes (as the result of in vivo cotranslation of the cmcI and cmcJ genes from a polycistronic mRNA) 3F.

Immunochromatography was used to determine if the complex was really formed in vivo. An affinity column containing anti-P7 antibodies linked to the matrix was used to test whether P7 alone, or the P7·P8 complex, was purified from extracts of the cephamycin C producing microorganisms, N. lactamdurans and S. clavuligerus. Extracts from 48-h cultures of each microorganism were filtered through the column, and the proteins retained by the antibodies were eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To avoid artifacts, the possible nonspecific binding of the protein P8 to the immunoaffinity column was tested. No retention of the P8 protein by the anti-P7 antibodies in the column was observed. SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions eluted from the anti-P7 antibody column (Fig. 3) revealed the presence of two proteins of 27 and 32 kDa, respectively. These polypeptides were characterized as P7 and P8 by immunoblotting with the corresponding antibodies. These results showed that both proteins were able to co-purify in the conditions where only purification of P7 was expected, suggesting that P7 and P8 are present as a complex in the extracts. However, the interaction between both subunits appears to be weak, since when stronger washing conditions for the antibody column (2 M NaCl instead 1.5 M NaCl) were used, the P8 protein was unable to co-purify with P7. The same results were obtained when S. clavuligerus cell-free extracts were filtered through the anti-P7 antibody column, indicating the formation of the P7·P8 protein complex in this microorganism. Once P7·P8 interaction was established, it was of interest to carry out quantitative studies of the interaction. The fluorescence spectra of a constant amount of dansyl-P7, were recorded in response to different concentrations of the second component P8 (Fig. 4). The maximum emission intensity (at 492 nm) for dansyl-P7 was enhanced in the presence of increasing amounts of P8. In addition, a blue shift in the wavelength for the fluorescence emission maximum was observed, in response to different concentrations of P8 (Fig. 4). This blue shift in the fluorophore emission indicates a conformational change of dansyl-P7 in response to the interaction with P8, which allows the dansyl-group of the fluorophore to be more accessible to the solvent. When a control protein such as bovine serum albumin was added in the same amounts, no fluorescence changes were observed in the dansyl-P7 spectra. A double reciprocal plot of the fluorescence increase of dansyl-P7 in response to increasing concentrations of P8 (Fig. 4B) showed that the dissociation constant of the P7·P8 complex was 47 μM. The same approach was used to determine the binding affinities of the reaction substrates and cofactors for the two components of the methoxylation system, in an attempt to understand the global reaction mechanism. The fluorescence spectra of dansyl derivatives of P7 and P8 were analyzed in the presence of the reaction cofactors (α-ketoglutarate, NADH) and substrates (CPC, S-adenosylmethionine) (7Coque J.J.R. Enguita F.J. Martín J.F. Liras P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Xiao X. Wolfe S. Demain A. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), using each monomer alone or the two-component (heterodimer) system. The dansyl derivatives of the separate P7 monomer, showed very small affinity for the substrates of CPC and S-adenosylmethionine. However, significant changes in the fluorescence spectra of dansyl-P7 were observed in the presence of increasing amounts of NADH (Fig. 5) or α-ketoglutarate (not shown). These changes resulted in a blue shift of its fluorescence emission spectrum, proportional to the NADH or α-ketoglutarate concentration with an estimated Kd value for NADH of 0.293 μM. The P7·P8 complex was able to interact strongly with the substrates S-adenosylmethionine and CPC, differently from that which occurred with the separate P7 or P8 component. This interaction produced an intense blue shift in the fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 6). The calculated Kd values were 0.073 μM for S-adenosylmethionine and 0.995 μM for CPC. In summary, the integrity of the protein P7·P8 complex appeared to be a decisive factor for the recognition of the substrate and cofactors by the polypeptidic chains. Interaction between proteins in biosynthetic pathways is a subject of great interest. Metabolic channeling mechanisms in which there is a transfer of reaction products between active centers may result from enzyme-enzyme interaction so that the intermediates are not released into the cytoplasm and cannot be used by enzymes outside the channel (22Cascante M. Sorribas A. Canela E.I. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Antibiotics and other secondary metabolites are synthesized by multistep pathways that are encoded by clustered sets of genes (23Martín J.F. Liras P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 173-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The diversity of amino acid and peptide modifying enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of β-lactams and other secondary metabolites is extraordinary (24Martín J.F. Liras P. Rehm H.-J. Reed G. Biotechnology. A Comprehensive Treatise. Vol. 1. Verlag Chemie GmbH, Germany1981: 211-233Google Scholar, 25Martín J.F. Beaubien M.P. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology.

Introduction of a methoxyl (-OCH3) group converts cephalosporins into the β-lactamase-resistant cephamycins (4Martín J.F. Liras P. Adv. Biochem. Eng.-Biotechnol. 1989; 39: 153-187PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies on the characterization of cmcI and cmcJ genes from N. lactamdurans and their expression in S. lividans (7Coque J.J.R. Enguita F.J. Martín J.F. Liras P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that formation of the two enzymatic activities involved in the C-7 methoxylation of the cephem nucleus was dependent upon the co-expression of the two genes in the same vector. Expression of the cmcI gene alone resulted in a residual 7-cephem-hydroxylase activity, but it was impossible to detect any 7-hydroxycephem methyltransferase activity. All these data suggested that the methoxylating system consists of two proteins (P7 and P8) and that an interaction occurs between the two components. Protein affinity chromatography coupled to immunodetection of component polypeptides in the assembled complex and protein cross-linking with glutaraldehyde are well known tools to study protein-protein interactions (27Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using co-renaturation and glutaraldehyde-cross-linking of P7 and P8, we have observed that a heterodimer of these two polypeptides is formed with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Formation of the protein complex was dependent upon renaturing both components together. It is likely that the in vivo assembly of the complex occurs simultaneously with folding of the nascent P7 and P8 proteins, since both polypeptides are co-translated from a single transcript.3 The P7-P8 heterodimer co-purifies as a complex as determined by immunoaffinity chromatography. The same results were obtained using extracts of N. lactamdurans or S. clavuligerus, suggesting that interaction of the two proteins of the methoxylation complex occurs in different cephamycin producers. Methoxylation systems occur in many other actinomycetes (1Martín J.F. Schaal K.P. Pulverer G. The Actinomycetes. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart1981: 417-434Google Scholar), and all of them may contain similar two-protein systems, although there is no firm evidence at this time in other actinomycetes to support this hypothesis. When the association between the monomers is weak, one of the best techniques to study protein-protein interaction is fluorescence spectroscopy, because it is sensitive and nondestructive for proteins (28Klebe C. Nishimoto T. Wittinghofer F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11923-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Pol E. Olsson S.-L. Estrada S. Prasthoffer T.W. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Studies involving protein fluorescence may be performed using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. However, this method is only suitable for a minor number of proteins which contain few tryptophan residues. In our case, the presence of several tryptophans in the P7 and P8 proteins prevented the use of this approach. Instead proteins P7 and P8 were dansylated with dansyl chloride, and the dansyl group was used as a fluorophore. Fluorescence spectroscopy studies confirmed that P8 interacts with P7. A blue shift was also observed in the fluorescence spectra of dansyl-P7 in response to increasing concentrations of NADH and α-ketoglutarate. The P7 component appears therefore to catalyze electron transfer from α-ketoglutarate (oxidized to succinate and CO2) and/or NADH to reduce the molecular oxygen used in the hydroxylation. This result explains the residual 7-cephem-hydroxylase activity observed in the S. lividans transformants expressing the separate cmcI gene (7Coque J.J.R. Enguita F.J. Martín J.F. Liras P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting observation was obtained when the effect of the substrates on the behavior of the P7·P8 protein complex was analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The P7·P8 complex showed a strong interaction with S-adenosylmethionine and CPC which was not observed with the separate P7 or P8 components. These results suggest that interaction of the P7 and P8 proteins is required to obtain the proper configuration of the enzyme for efficient recognition of both substrates. Although there is firm support for the interaction of P7 and P8, the exact role of these two proteins in the reactions involved in the introduction of the methoxyl group is still unclear. Efficient hydroxylation at C7 and transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine require both P7 and P8, although P7 alone shows weak C7 hydroxylase activity (7Coque J.J.R. Enguita F.J. Martín J.F. Liras P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein P7 contains domains that correspond to conserved sequences in cholesterol 7α-monooxygenases and to the active center of O-methyltransferases by comparison with the crystal structure of catechol-O-methyltransferase. Protein P8 may act as a coupling protein for efficient hydroxylation at C7 in a form similar to that of the two-component system of the Pseudomonas putida p-hydroxyphenylacetate-3-hydroxylase (30Arunachalam U. Massey V. Vaidyanathan C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25848-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two- and three-component hydroxylase systems are known to be involved in the oxygenation of sulfobenzoate (31Locher H.H. Leisinger T. Cook A.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and dibenzofuran (32Bünz P.V. Cook A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6467-6475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that similar systems occur among the widely distributed mono- and dioxygenases existing in nature. We thank T. Vigal and the L.T.I. for help with the fluorescence spectroscopy studies, and M. Corrales, B. Martín, and R. Barrientos for excellent technical assistance."

INTRODUCTIONThe bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) 1The abbreviations used are: PTSphosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase systemPEPphosphoenolpyruvateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. comprises at least two dozen cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. Among the diverse functions governed by the PTS is the translocation of PTS sugars across the cell membrane concomitant with their phosphorylation, and regulation of the expression of several non-PTS sugar operons (for reviews see Refs. 1Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2993-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Escherichia coli, the phosphoryltransfer sequence for transport via the glucose-specific system is as follows: PEP → Enzyme I(His191) → HPr(His15) → IIIGlc(His90) → IIGlc(Cys421) → glucose.While this system has been extensively studied since discovery of the PTS (7Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), many important questions remain to be answered. For example, the complete, balanced equations are written as second order reactions, assuming binary complexes as the transition state intermediates, i.e. phospho-A + B = [A·phospho·B] = A + phospho-B. It is possible, however, that transient ternary, or possibly even quaternary complexes are formed during the reactions. Furthermore, the mechanisms of phosphoryltransfer are unknown, as are the rate-limiting steps during the transfer from PEP to glucose, the rates in the reverse direction and the equilibrium constants for each step in the pathway.As a first approach to answering these questions, this paper describes a rapid quench method for determining the apparent rate and equilibrium constants of the phosphoryltransfer reactions. The protein pair HPr and IIIGlc was selected for initial studies for several reasons. First, phospho-HPr is a central branch point in phosphoryltransfer by the PTS, but it is very labile (8Waygood E.B. Erickson E. El-Kabbani O.A.L. Delbaere L.T.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6938-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the technical problems encountered in working with this phosphoprotein had to be solved to collect meaningful data. Second, IIIGlc is a critical signal transducing protein in bacterial metabolism. It interacts with at least 10 other proteins, some by phosphoryltransfer reactions, and others by non-covalent binding (6Roseman S. Meadow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2993-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the latter are involved in regulating gene expression, which depends on the ratio of IIIGlc to phospho-IIIGlc. Third, important active site mutants of IIIGlc are available for comparative studies. Finally, in the only study on the phosphoryltransfer between HPr and IIIGlc (9Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14526-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the technology available at the time gave only an estimate of the apparent Keq.E. coli IIIGlc, also designated IIAGlc, 2The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system, or PTS, comprises a group of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins with diverse functions in the bacterial cell (see Refs. 1Meadow N.D.

The two proposed systems of nomenclature of the PTS have been reviewed (6Roseman S. Meadow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2993-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the general proteins of the system (not sugar-specific) are Enzyme I and HPr. The sugar-specific Enzyme II complexes comprise from one to as many as four (five?) separately encoded polypeptides, some or all of which are integral and peripheral membrane proteins. The proposed systems of nomenclature for the Enzyme II complexes are based on either the number of separate proteins in the complex, or, alternatively, on the function of the protein or protein domain in the phosphoryltransfer sequence. In the case of the E. coli glucose permease, the Enzyme II complex is designated IIIGlc/IIGlc or IIIGlc/IIBGlc in the first system, and IIAGlc/IICBGlc in the second. is an 18.1-kDa protein containing two histidine residues, His75 and His90, in the active site. His90 accepts the phosphoryl group from phospho-HPr, but His75 is conserved in many III or IIA type proteins (see Refs. 1Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Roseman S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2993-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for reviews). The physiological significance of the His residues was tested by substituting glutamine for each His, giving the mutant proteins H75QIIIGlc and H90QIIIGlc, respectively (10Presper K.A. Wong C.-Y. Liu L. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4052-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mutants exhibited some unexpected physiological and biochemical properties. For example, H75QIIIGlc accepted the phosphoryl group from phospho-HPr, but was apparently not a phosphoryl donor to glucose (or methyl α-glucoside) via IIGlc. It appeared possible that clarification of this apparent anomaly might be obtained by kinetic analysis of the phosphoryltransfer reactions and a detailed structural study of the proteins; the structures are presented in the accompanying paper (11Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Remington S.J. Murphy K.P. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33446-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).We report here the apparent equilibrium constants (Keq), the forward (k1), and the reverse (k−1) rate constants for the transfer of the phosphoryl group between phospho-HPr and IIIGlc, and between phospho-HPr and the mutant H75QIIIGlc.These results, along with the structural information, suggest a mechanism for the phosphoryltransfer reaction (see accompanying paper; Ref. 11).DISCUSSIONThe following reactions were studied by the methods described above:Apparent rate constants were found to be: wild type IIIGlc, k1 = 6.1 × 107M−1 s−1, k−1 = 4.7 × 107; H75QIIIGlc, k1 = 2.8 × 105M−1 s−1, k−1 = 2.3 × 105.Rapid quench measurements and their interpretations are subject to many kinds of error, and a major effort was undertaken to validate the methods, and therefore the rate constants. We have established the following points. (a) The derived k values are independent of the rate of flow (or mixing) under the conditions used here. (b) The reactions were quenched in less than 5-6 ms. (c) Recoveries of protein and phosphorylprotein were excellent. (d) Good agreement of the rate constants was obtained in independent experiments using different initial protein concentrations. (e) Hand-mixed samples, where they could be used, gave excellent agreement with those mixed by the rapid quench method. (f) Good agreement in k1 and k−1 values were obtained, independent of which starting protein pair was used, phospho-HPr and III, or phospho-III and HPr.Finally, the rate constants were used to calculate the apparent equilibrium constants (ratios of k1 to k−1) and compared to Keq measured directly from hand-mixed samples. With wild type IIIGlc, the results were: k1/k−1 = Keq = 1.4 ± 0.5; hand-mixed Keq = 1.1 ± 0.1. With the mutant H75QIIIGlc, they were: k1/k−1 = Keq = 1.2 ± 0.4; hand-mixed Keq = 1.5 ± 0.3. Thus, there was an excellent correlation between the calculated and measured equilibrium constants, which represents another criterion for the validity of the rate constants.We have previously estimated Keq for Reaction RI (wild type protein) at about 0.1 (9Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14526-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3The methodology was insufficient for accurate measurement of Keq. For example, [32P]phospho-HPr and IIIGlc were incubated and transferred to a gel filtration column (at atmospheric pressure), and the proteins were separated and counted. During partial separation of the proteins on the column, it is likely that the equilibrium was perturbed. But the correct Keq values for both Reactions RI and RII are in the range 1-1.5, and the standard free energy changes, ΔG°, are close to 0.The experiments reported here were conducted at pH 6.5. However, a few experiments (not shown) indicated that the same Keq values were obtained at pH 7.5. This was expected since a H+ is not required to balance the reaction. (pH 6.5 was selected because it is optimal for Enzyme I, and rapid quench studies with this enzyme are now in progress.)Two other important points emerge from the data. The k1 and k−1 of Reaction RI (wild type IIIGlc) are only 2-3-fold less than the maximum possible, or diffusion-controlled rate (24Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1985: 123-125Google Scholar).

INTRODUCTIONThe bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) 1The abbreviations used are: PTSphosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase systemPEPphosphoenolpyruvateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. comprises at least two dozen cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. Among the diverse functions governed by the PTS is the translocation of PTS sugars across the cell membrane concomitant with their phosphorylation, and regulation of the expression of several non-PTS sugar operons (for reviews see Refs. 1Meadow N.D.

Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), many important questions remain to be answered. For example, the complete, balanced equations are written as second order reactions, assuming binary complexes as the transition state intermediates, i.e. phospho-A + B = [A·phospho·B] = A + phospho-B. It is possible, however, that transient ternary, or possibly even quaternary complexes are formed during the reactions. Furthermore, the mechanisms of phosphoryltransfer are unknown, as are the rate-limiting steps during the transfer from PEP to glucose, the rates in the reverse direction and the equilibrium constants for each step in the pathway.As a first approach to answering these questions, this paper describes a rapid quench method for determining the apparent rate and equilibrium constants of the phosphoryltransfer reactions. The protein pair HPr and IIIGlc was selected for initial studies for several reasons. First, phospho-HPr is a central branch point in phosphoryltransfer by the PTS, but it is very labile (8Waygood E.B. Erickson E. El-Kabbani O.A.L. Delbaere L.T.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6938-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the technical problems encountered in working with this phosphoprotein had to be solved to collect meaningful data. Second, IIIGlc is a critical signal transducing protein in bacterial metabolism. It interacts with at least 10 other proteins, some by phosphoryltransfer reactions, and others by non-covalent binding (6Roseman S. Meadow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2993-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the latter are involved in regulating gene expression, which depends on the ratio of IIIGlc to phospho-IIIGlc. Third, important active site mutants of IIIGlc are available for comparative studies. Finally, in the only study on the phosphoryltransfer between HPr and IIIGlc (9Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14526-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the technology available at the time gave only an estimate of the apparent Keq.E. coli IIIGlc, also designated IIAGlc, 2The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system, or PTS, comprises a group of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins with diverse functions in the bacterial cell (see Refs. 1Meadow N.D.

The two proposed systems of nomenclature of the PTS have been reviewed (6Roseman S. Meadow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2993-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the general proteins of the system (not sugar-specific) are Enzyme I and HPr. The sugar-specific Enzyme II complexes comprise from one to as many as four (five?) separately encoded polypeptides, some or all of which are integral and peripheral membrane proteins. The proposed systems of nomenclature for the Enzyme II complexes are based on either the number of separate proteins in the complex, or, alternatively, on the function of the protein or protein domain in the phosphoryltransfer sequence. In the case of the E. coli glucose permease, the Enzyme II complex is designated IIIGlc/IIGlc or IIIGlc/IIBGlc in the first system, and IIAGlc/IICBGlc in the second. is an 18.1-kDa protein containing two histidine residues, His75 and His90, in the active site. His90 accepts the phosphoryl group from phospho-HPr, but His75 is conserved in many III or IIA type proteins (see Refs. 1Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Roseman S.

The physiological significance of the His residues was tested by substituting glutamine for each His, giving the mutant proteins H75QIIIGlc and H90QIIIGlc, respectively (10Presper K.A. Wong C.-Y.

The mutants exhibited some unexpected physiological and biochemical properties. For example, H75QIIIGlc accepted the phosphoryl group from phospho-HPr, but was apparently not a phosphoryl donor to glucose (or methyl α-glucoside) via IIGlc. It appeared possible that clarification of this apparent anomaly might be obtained by kinetic analysis of the phosphoryltransfer reactions and a detailed structural study of the proteins; the structures are presented in the accompanying paper (11Pelton J.G.

We report here the apparent equilibrium constants (Keq), the forward (k1), and the reverse (k−1) rate constants for the transfer of the phosphoryl group between phospho-HPr and IIIGlc, and between phospho-HPr and the mutant H75QIIIGlc. These results, along with the structural information, suggest a mechanism for the phosphoryltransfer reaction (see accompanying paper; Ref. 11). DISCUSSIONThe following reactions were studied by the methods described above:Apparent rate constants were found to be: wild type IIIGlc, k1 = 6.1 × 107M−1 s−1, k−1 = 4.7 × 107; H75QIIIGlc, k1 = 2.8 × 105M−1 s−1, k−1 = 2.3 × 105.Rapid quench measurements and their interpretations are subject to many kinds of error, and a major effort was undertaken to validate the methods, and therefore the rate constants. We have established the following points. (a) The derived k values are independent of the rate of flow (or mixing) under the conditions used here. (b) The reactions were quenched in less than 5-6 ms. (c) Recoveries of protein and phosphorylprotein were excellent. (d) Good agreement of the rate constants was obtained in independent experiments using different initial protein concentrations. (e) Hand-mixed samples, where they could be used, gave excellent agreement with those mixed by the rapid quench method. (f) Good agreement in k1 and k−1 values were obtained, independent of which starting protein pair was used, phospho-HPr and III, or phospho-III and HPr.Finally, the rate constants were used to calculate the apparent equilibrium constants (ratios of k1 to k−1) and compared to Keq measured directly from hand-mixed samples. With wild type IIIGlc, the results were: k1/k−1 = Keq = 1.4 ± 0.5; hand-mixed Keq = 1.1 ± 0.1. With the mutant H75QIIIGlc, they were: k1/k−1 = Keq = 1.2 ± 0.4; hand-mixed Keq = 1.5 ± 0.3. Thus, there was an excellent correlation between the calculated and measured equilibrium constants, which represents another criterion for the validity of the rate constants.We have previously estimated Keq for Reaction RI (wild type protein) at about 0.1 (9Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14526-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3The methodology was insufficient for accurate measurement of Keq. For example, [32P]phospho-HPr and IIIGlc were incubated and transferred to a gel filtration column (at atmospheric pressure), and the proteins were separated and counted. During partial separation of the proteins on the column, it is likely that the equilibrium was perturbed. But the correct Keq values for both Reactions RI and RII are in the range 1-1.5, and the standard free energy changes, ΔG°, are close to 0.The experiments reported here were conducted at pH 6.5. However, a few experiments (not shown) indicated that the same Keq values were obtained at pH 7.5. This was expected since a H+ is not required to balance the reaction. (pH 6.5 was selected because it is optimal for Enzyme I, and rapid quench studies with this enzyme are now in progress.)Two other important points emerge from the data. The k1 and k−1 of Reaction RI (wild type IIIGlc) are only 2-3-fold less than the maximum possible, or diffusion-controlled rate (24Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1985: 123-125Google Scholar). When the mutant, H75QIIIGlc, is substituted for the wild type protein, the rate constants decrease by more than 200-fold, and both rate constants are equally affected.The accompanying paper (11Pelton J.G.

https://openalex.org/W1964600660,"We present a detailed analysis of the antigenic and immunogenic properties of a series of very stable peptidomimetics of a model hexapeptide corresponding to the C-terminal residues 130-135 of histone H3. Five pseudopeptide analogues of the natural sequence IRGERA were synthesized by systematically replacing, in each analogue, one peptide bond at a time by a reduced peptide bond Ψ(CH2-NH). Three important features of the resulting analogues were examined. First, the analogues were tested in a biosensor system for their ability to bind monoclonal antibodies generated against the parent natural peptide, and their kinetic rate constants were measured. The results show that reduced peptide bond analogues can very efficiently mimic the parent peptide. The position of reduced bonds which were deleterious for the binding was found to depend on the antibody tested, and one monoclonal antibody recognized all five analogues. The equilibrium affinity constant toward reduced peptide bond analogues of four antibodies of IgG1 isotype induced against the parent hexapeptide was higher (up to 670 times) with certain analogues than toward the homologous peptide. Second, immunogenic properties of the five analogues were studied, and it was found that polyclonal antibodies induced against analogues in which Ψ(CH2-NH) bonds were introduced between residues 130-131, 131-132, and 132-133 (R1-R2, R2-R3, and R3-R4) cross-reacted strongly with the cognate protein H3. Third, we tested the protease resistance of analogues. Altogether, the results provide a strong support for the potent applicability of reduced peptide bond pseudopeptides as components of synthetic vaccines and open a new field for the development of immunomodulatory agents. We present a detailed analysis of the antigenic and immunogenic properties of a series of very stable peptidomimetics of a model hexapeptide corresponding to the C-terminal residues 130-135 of histone H3. Five pseudopeptide analogues of the natural sequence IRGERA were synthesized by systematically replacing, in each analogue, one peptide bond at a time by a reduced peptide bond Ψ(CH2-NH). Three important features of the resulting analogues were examined. First, the analogues were tested in a biosensor system for their ability to bind monoclonal antibodies generated against the parent natural peptide, and their kinetic rate constants were measured. The results show that reduced peptide bond analogues can very efficiently mimic the parent peptide. The position of reduced bonds which were deleterious for the binding was found to depend on the antibody tested, and one monoclonal antibody recognized all five analogues.

Third, we tested the protease resistance of analogues. Altogether, the results provide a strong support for the potent applicability of reduced peptide bond pseudopeptides as components of synthetic vaccines and open a new field for the development of immunomodulatory agents. Potential applications of peptidomimetics cover many aspects of basic immunology including synthetic vaccines, immunodiagnostics, and the development of new generations of immunomodulators. The possibility of controlling B and T cell recognition has been recently explored by using pseudopeptides, i.e. peptide analogues in which the peptide bond, but not the residue itself, has been changed. We have shown that a retro-inverso peptide (also called all-D-retro peptide) analogue, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of histone H3, can mimic the antigenic and immunogenic properties of the parent peptide (1Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Benkirane N. Guichard G.

Antibodies of most isotypes raised against the D-enantiomer of this peptide recognized the retro (all-L-retro) analogue but not the parent peptide nor the retro-inverso peptide. Retro-inverso peptides were also found to serve as targets for antibodies produced by lupus mice and by patients with rheumatic autoimmune diseases (3Briand J.-P. Guichard G. Dumortier H. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20686-20691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently, retro-inverso peptide analogues of the immunodominant epitope 141-159 of the VP1 protein of two variants of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 1The abbreviations used are: FMDVfoot-and-mouth disease virusELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAbovine serum albuminSPDPN-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionateMPLAmono-phosphoryl lipid AmAbmonoclonal antibodyMHCmajor histocompatibility complexHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. were shown to induce longer lasting and higher antibody titers in immunized animals than did the corresponding L-peptide (4Muller S. Guichard G. Benkirane N. Brown F. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide encompasses both a B- and T-epitope. Finally, Jameson et al. (5Jameson B.A. McDonnell J.M. Marini J.C. Korngold R. Nature. 1994; 368: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showed that a cyclic retro-inverso analogue of a region of the CD4 receptor of murine T cells was able to inhibit experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.

Sequence identification of a large number of peptides naturally associated with MHC molecules, as well as peptide-binding investigations, have allowed determination of allelespecific peptide motifs for several dozen MHC molecules. Extensive studies have involved amino acid substitutions, i.e. modifications which alter only the side chain, to better approach both the requirement for anchor residues and the importance of non-anchor residues that can make contact with the MHC groove. All of this information (e.g. see Ref. 6Rammensee H.-G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar for a review) helped in the design of antigen analogues containing subtle changes whose properties are to be recognized by both antigen-presenting cells and T cell receptors and to induce signal transduction in such a way that either T cell activation or, on the contrary, T cell down-regulation will take place (7Sloan-Lancaster J. Allen P.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Jameson S.C. Bevan M.J.

Pharmacologically, further studies including backbone modifications of the natural sequence are required to optimize potency of such ligands of the immune cell receptors leading to peptidomimetics with increased stability. In this context of immunological drug design, we have recently examined the ability of reduced peptide bond pseudopeptide analogues (which contain a CH2-NH bond instead of the CO-NH peptide bond) to bind a murine class I molecule, Kd. Eight pseudopeptide analogues of the antigenic nonapeptide 252-260 derived from Plasmodium berghei were synthesized by systematically replacing one peptide bond at a time by a reduced peptide bond. We have found that the five analogues containing a reduced bond between P1-P2, P2-P3, P4-P5, P5-P6, and P6-P7 could efficiently mimic the parent peptide in binding to a recombinant single chain SC-Kd molecule, while the introduction of the reduced bond between P3-P4, P7-P8, and P8-P9 was deleterious for SC-Kd binding (10Guichard G. Calbo S. Muller S. Kourilsky P. Briand J.-P. Abastado J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26057-26059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results illustrate the potential usefulness of such peptide analogues for the development of stable immunomodulators and peptide-based cytotoxic T lymphocyte vaccines. To further explore the possibility of using reduced-peptide bond peptidomimetics in vaccinology, it was important to study both antigenic and immunogenic properties of such analogues. In particular, it was necessary to demonstrate that reduced peptide bond peptide analogues can elicit specific antibodies and that generated antibodies can cross-react with the cognate protein. In the present work, we have analyzed the antigenic and immunogenic properties of a series of analogues of model peptide of sequence IRGERA corresponding to the COOH-terminal residues 130-135 of histone H3. Pseudopeptide analogues, whose chemical synthesis has been described elsewhere (11Guichard G. Benkirane N. Graff R. Muller S. Briand J.-P. Pept. Res. 1994; 7: 308-321PubMed Google Scholar), were obtained by systematically replacing, in each analogue, one peptide bond at a time by a reduced peptide bond. Three important features were analyzed in this study. First, the different analogues were tested in a biosensor system for their ability to bind monoclonal antibodies generated against the parent peptide, and both their kinetic rate and equilibrium affinity constants were measured. Second, their immunogenicity was investigated. Finally, their resistance to trypsin was evaluated using calibrated enzymatic nylon spheres. Their antigenic and immunogenic properties, associated with their remarkable high resistance to proteolytic digestion, are fundamental characteristics that should favor the use of reduced peptide bond pseudopeptides for vaccination, immunomodulation, and peptide drug delivery. Table I shows the sequences of five analogues of parent peptide IRGERA with the abbreviated names used in the text. The synthesis, purification, and analysis of these analogues have been described in detail elsewhere (11Guichard G. Benkirane N. Graff R. Muller S. Briand J.-P. Pept. Res. 1994; 7: 308-321PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reduced peptide bond was formed by reductive amination of N-butoxycarbonyl-protected α-amino aldehydes in the presence of NaBH3CN. Fragment condensation and stepwise elongation of the peptide chains using benzotriazolyl N-oxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate as a coupling agent led to the fully protected nonapeptides. After HF cleavage and MPLC purification on a C18 column, the final products were identified by 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy. Their purity was ≥95%. In addition, two truncated peptides were synthesized. They correspond to sequences IRG and GERA. All peptides contain a CGG arm at their N-terminal end to allow selective conjugation of the peptides to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and to enhance accessibility of peptides bound to a carrier. Peptides were coupled to BSA by means of N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) as described previously (12Muller S. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Plaué S. Synthetic Polypeptides as Antigens. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 45-130Google Scholar), and the yield of coupling was obtained by determining spectrophotometrically the release of 2-thiopyridone from SPDP-derivatized BSA on interaction with cysteine-containing peptides (12Muller S. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Plaué S. Synthetic Polypeptides as Antigens.

The generation and some characteristics of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the parent peptide (CGG)IRGERA have also been described (1Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). mAbs in culture medium were precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation. After extensive dialysis, the samples were dissolved and made up to their original volume in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Their purity was checked by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. When required, antibodies were further purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. The antibody concentration was determined by optical density measurement at 280 nm using an absorption coefficient of 1.4. The protein concentration was also determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Mouse antisera to the parent peptide and reduced peptide bond pseudopeptide analogues were obtained from BALB/c mice immunized with small unilamellar liposome-associated peptides following the procedure described previously (13Benkirane N.

Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Schuber F. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Liposomes contained monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant. The injections were given at intervals of 3 weeks. Blood was withdrawn from the retroorbital venus plexus 5 days after each injection. Bleedings were then repeated at 30-day intervals over a period of several months after the last injection. As a control, a preliminary bleeding of each mouse was performed before the first injection. The direct ELISA procedure and inhibition of direct ELISA experiments used to measure the binding of antibodies from rabbit and mouse sera was as described previously (13Benkirane N. Friede M. Guichard G. Briand J.-P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 35: 26279-26285Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Relative affinity of mAbs with peptide analogues was determined using biosensor technology. The procedure used for equilibrium affinity measurements in the BIAcore™ (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) has been described previously (2Benkirane N. Guichard G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This system allows the measurement of molecular interaction in real time and without labeling of the reactants. Both the general procedure used to measure the antibody kinetic constants and the theory of kinetic measurements using the BIAcore biosensor system have been recently described in a review article from this laboratory (15Saunal H. Karlsson R. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Johnstone A.P. Turner M.W. Immunochemistry 2. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1996Google Scholar). Resistance of the parent peptide and five peptide analogues to trypsin was tested as described previously (1Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) using the proteolytic enzyme immobilized on 3.2-mm diameter nylon spheres (16Michalon P. Couturier R. Bender K. Hecker H. Marion C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the enzymatic spheres was equivalent to 18.5 nmol of p-toluenesulfonyl-L-arginine methyl ester hydrolyzed per min per nylon sphere. Protease digestion was initiated by immersing 15 enzymatic spheres into 1 ml of a peptide solution (150 μg/ml) maintained at 25°C under constant agitation. The digestion was performed in Hepes-buffered saline at pH 7.4 for 5-240 min. The reaction was stopped by removing the enzymatic spheres. Peptide cleavage was evaluated immunochemically in the BIAcore by measuring the capacity of the remaining peptide to compete with the binding of mAb 4×11 (4 μg/ml) to the parent peptide immobilized on the dextran matrix. The maximum inhibitory capacity (100% inhibition) was established individually for each peptide analogue in the absence of trypsin. Alternatively, peptide cleavage was monitored by HPLC. Analytical HPLCs were run on a Beckman instrument (Gagny, France) with a Nucleosil C18 column 5 μm (3.9 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient of (A) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and (B) acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The peptide solutions were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC (linear gradient, 1-21% B, 20 min). Sensitivity of peptides to trypsin was evaluated by calculating the area of the peak corresponding to the intact peptide remaining after incubating each analogue with enzymatic beads. We have shown previously that, using BSA-conjugated peptides as antigen for coating ELISA plates, antibodies from several antisera raised against the parent peptide IRGERA and histone H3 reacted almost equally well with the parent peptide and with peptide analogues IΨR, RΨG, and GΨE containing reduced peptide bonds between residues 130-131 (R1-R2), 131-132 (R2-R3), and 132-133 (R3-R4), respectively (11Guichard G. Benkirane N. Graff R. Muller S. Briand J.-P. Pept. Res. 1994; 7: 308-321PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, anti-peptide and anti-H3 antibodies reacted very slightly or not at all with analogues EΨR and RΨA containing reduced peptide bonds between residues 133-134 (R4-R5) and 134-135 (R5-R6), respectively. The same results were obtained with mouse antibodies raised against the parent peptide coupled to small unilamellar liposomes containing MPLA (not shown). To further analyze the antigenic properties of five reduced peptide bond analogues, we performed in the present study a competitive ELISA test in which peptide analogues were used as free inhibitors. In Table II, we show that, as found in the direct ELISA format, the parent peptide and analogues IΨR, RΨG, and GΨE are the only peptides able to significantly inhibit the ELISA reaction between the parent peptide and antibodies raised against the parent peptide and the cognate protein H3, while the analogues EΨR and RΨA failed to inhibit or inhibited poorly the antibody binding. From these data, we could thus confirm our preliminary observations showing that the replacement by a reduced bond of the natural peptide bond between residues R4-R5 and R5-R6 in analogues EΨR and RΨA significantly affects their recognition by rabbit and mouse polyclonal antibodies, while antibody binding was not or only slightly affected by the introduction of a reduced bond between residues R1-R2, R2-R3, and R3-R4.Table IIRecognition in competitive ELISA of IRGERA and IRGERA analogues by rabbit antibodies induced against the parent peptide IRGERA and the cognate protein histone H3Peptides used as inhibitors (10 μM)Inhibition of the binding between IRGERA and antibodies induced against:Parent peptide IRGERAProtein H3MELGIZTRI%Parent peptide(CGG)IRGERA80.673.689.5Analogues(CGG)IΨR77.876.689.1(CGG)RΨG88.975.391.7(CGG)GΨE92.542.085.9(CGG)EΨR036.30(CGG)RΨA029.410.4Truncated peptides(CGG)IRG93.376.282.0(CGG)ERA77.575.076.2Parent peptide without CGG armIRGERA78.883.888.3 Open table in a new tab The fact that the replacement of a peptide bond by a reduced peptide bond in analogues IΨR, RΨG, and GΨE has apparently very little effect on the reactivity of both rabbit and mouse polyclonal antibodies in direct and inhibition ELISA format may, however, appear somewhat dubious. We may indeed argue that this lack of effect is apparent only because in fact antisera studied contain very few antibodies reacting with the N-terminal domain IRG of the sequence IRGERA. We thus tested in inhibition assays the ability of the antisera MEL, GIZ, and TRI to react with two shorter peptides, namely peptides IRG and GERA, and found that in their free form both peptides could inhibit the recognition of polyclonal antibodies to the parent peptide IRGERA (Table II). The argument is thus not valid since antibodies reacting with the N-terminal part of the IRGERA peptide are present in the antisera. Moreover, because a peptide similar to the parent peptide except that it contained no CGG arm showed the same ability to inhibit the binding (Table II), the observed inhibition with truncated peptides could not be ascribable to the CGG arm itself. This fact could also be deduced by the lack of inhibition found with analogues EΨR and RΨA, which both contain a CGG arm. Four mAbs called 4×8, 4×10, 4×11, and 4×12 induced against the parent peptide (CGG)IRGERA were tested with peptide analogues. All mAbs but 4×12 have been described previously (2Benkirane N. Guichard G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All four mAbs belong to the IgG1 subclass. Two additional mAbs were tested, namely mAb 13×18 (IgG2a) generated against a retro-inverso (all-D retro) analogue and mAb 12×10 (IgG1) generated against a retro (all-L retro) analogue (2Benkirane N.

We determined the kinetic rate and equilibrium affinity constants of these six mAbs for the five immobilized peptide analogues and the parent peptide. As shown in Table III, both mAbs 4×8 and 4×10 reacted with the parent peptide and peptide analogues IΨR, RΨG, and GΨE. Very interestingly, mAb 4×8 had a higher equilibrium affinity value Ka for the GΨE analogue and mAb 4×10 had a higher Ka for the IΨR analogue compared with their respective Ka values for the parent peptide. In the case of mAb 4×8, this was mainly due to a higher association constant (ka), while in the case of mAb 4×10, this was due to both a slightly higher ka and a slightly lower dissociation constant (kd).Table III.Kinetic rate constants and equilibrium affinity constants of mAbs 4×8, 4×10, 4×11, 4×12, 13×18, and 12×10 induced against IRGERA and IRGERA analoguesmAbsaRI, retro-inverso peptide; R, retro-peptide.Antigenka (x10−3)bAssociation (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants are the mean values obtained in at least two independent experiments.kd (x105)bAssociation (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants are the mean values obtained in at least two independent experiments.Ka (x10−6)M−1s−1s−1M−14×8 (IgG1) (anti-parent peptide)Parent13 ± 0.215 ± 0.280IΨR162 ± 0.6166 ± 0.198RΨG222 ± 0.5163 ± 0.2136GΨE430 ± 0.561 ± 0.2707EΨRnbcnb, no binding.RΨAnb4×10 (IgG1) (anti-parent peptide)Parent181 ± 0.8180 ± 0.4101IΨR428 ± 0.653 ± 0.2800RΨG113 ± 0.6169 ± 0.467GΨE23 ± 0.9172 ± 0.414EΨRnbRΨAnb4×11 (IgG1) (anti-parent peptide)Parent3 ± 0.2100 ± 0.33IΨR2600 ± 0.3129 ± 0.32020RΨG530 ± 0.550 ± 0.21060GΨE540 ± 0.638 ± 0.21420EΨR212 ± 0.382 ± 0.3250RΨA120 ± 0.463 ± 0.21904×12 (IgG1) (anti-parent peptide)Parent142 ± 0.5210 ± 0.468IΨRnbRΨGnbGΨEnbEΨR52 ± 0.618 ± 0.4293RΨA1425 ± 0.566 ± 0.2217013×18 (IgG2a) (anti-RI peptide)RI830 ± 0.752 ± 0.21596IΨR143 ± 0.365 ± 0.2220RΨG62 ± 0.233 ± 0.3180GΨE33 ± 0.176 ± 0.243EΨR235 ± 0.5130 ± 0.218RΨA16 ± 0.5120 ± 0.41312×10 (IgG1) (anti-R peptide)R328 ± 0.724 ± 0.21170IΨRnbRΨGnbGΨEnbEΨRnbRΨAnba RI, retro-inverso peptide; R, retro-peptide.b Association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants are the mean values obtained in at least two independent experiments.c nb, no binding. Open table in a new tab mAb 4×11 recognized all five analogues. Still much more striking than the heterospecificity observed with mAbs 4×8 and 4×10, mAb 4×11 showed a much higher affinity for analogues IΨR, RΨG, and GΨE than for the parent peptide (Ka values increased 673, 353, and 473 times, respectively). mAb 4×11 also cross-reacted with analogues EΨR and RΨA with Ka values increased 83 and 63 times, respectively, compared with the Ka value for the parent peptide. Dissociation rate constants of mAb 4×11 with respect to all analogues were relatively similar (38-129 105 s−1). On the other hand, the increased affinities for reduced peptide bond analogues were mainly due to higher ka values (increased 40-867 times). Finally, mAb 4×12 also showed an interesting reactivity pattern. It did not react with peptide analogues IΨR, RΨG, and GΨE, whereas it bound both peptide analogues EΨR and RΨA. Again, mAb 4×12 was found to better react with the latter analogues than with the parent peptide. The Ka values of mAb 4×12 for analogues EΨR and RΨA were increased 4 and 32 times with respect to the Ka value for the parent peptide. The association rate constant of mAb 4×12 for analogue RΨA was increased 10 times. mAb 13×18 (generated against the retro-inverso peptide) was introduced in this study because we found previously that it reacted equally well with the retro-inverso analogue and the parent IRGERA peptide (2Benkirane N. Guichard G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present study, mAb 13×18 was found to react, although less well than with the parent peptide, with all five reduced peptide bond analogues. mAb 13×18 was found more sensitive to changes occurring in the last C-terminal residues of the peptide (analogues EΨR and RΨA). mAb 12×10 (anti-retro peptide) was introduced as a negative control in the present study. As expected, it did not react with any of the reduced peptide bond analogues. This mAb was shown previously (2Benkirane N. Guichard G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11921-11926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to be unable to bind the parent peptide IRGERA; it recognized only the homologous retro peptide and the all-D analogue. Groups of four BALB/c mice were injected with the various peptide analogues as well as with the parent peptide after conjugation to liposomes containing MPLA. All five peptide analogues induced an antibody response in immunized mice. An IgG response could be generally demonstrated by ELISA from bleeding three onward and, depending on the peptide used as immunogen, antibody activity decreased from bleeding six to seven (i.e. 107 and 133 days after the last injection) (Fig. 1). In all mice, the pattern of antibody production was very similar in terms of appearance and duration of antibody response. As can be seen in Fig. 1, cross-reaction between analogues IΨR, RΨG, GΨE, and the parent peptide was found. Sometimes (see Fig. 1A, for example), cross-reacting antibodies appeared somewhat later than antibodies reacting with the homologous peptide analogue. It must be noted that, in mice immunized with analogue IΨR (Fig. 1B), a higher antibody reaction was measured with analogues RΨG and GΨE than with the homologous peptide IΨR. Antisera directed to peptide analogues IΨR, RΨG, and GΨE (Fig. 1, B-D) reacted strongly with the cognate protein H3. In contrast, antibodies induced against analogues EΨR and RΨA (Fig. 1, E and F) recognized only the respective homologous peptides and did not react at all with heterologous peptides, nor with histone H3. We have tested the resistance of peptide analogues to trypsin whose primary specificity is based upon positively charged lysine and arginine side chains. We used the enzyme covalently immobilized on nylon spheres and measured the residual capacity of proteolyzed peptides to compete with the parent peptide for the binding of mAb 4×11 in the BIAcore (1Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.-P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). mAb 4×11 was selected in this experiment because it reacts with all five intact reduced peptide bond peptide analogues (Table III). As shown in Fig. 2A, the parent peptide was rapidly digested under these conditions. Half of its antigenic activity was lost after 7 min and <10% activity remained after only 20 min. In contrast, after 4 h, only a slight loss of activity was observed; 71-97% of the initial antigenic activity remained upon incubation of the five reduced peptide bond peptide analogues with proteolytic beads.

To identify sperm-specific plasma membrane proteins, an antiserum to sperm plasma membranes was produced in female guinea pigs. The screening of a testis cDNA expression library with this antiserum resulted in the isolation of two clones encoding a predicted protein containing two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular proline-rich domain. The predicted protein (named sperad) is closely related to a large family (biliary glycoproteins) of putative cell adhesion molecules. Sperad is first expressed by the haploid spermatid and is localized to the plasma membrane overlying the acrosome, supportive of a role in cell adhesion/signaling. However, sperad expression in Sf9 cells does not result in Sf9 cell aggregation or in sperm adhesion to the infected insect cells, suggesting that sperad is involved in heterotypic interactions. The open reading frame of the two cDNA clones predicts proteins of either 32.2 or 33.3 kDa. Antibody produced to sperad recognizes three sperm plasma membrane proteins on immunoblots (Mr 55,000, 36,000, and 28,000), but the lower molecular weight proteins are degradation products; deglycosylation confirmed that the Mr 55,000 sperm plasma membrane represents the full-length protein encoded by the clone. Induction of the acrosome reaction does not appear to alter the molecular weight of sperad but does result in its loss from the sperm cells. Thus, sperad is likely involved in heterotypic interactions prior to interaction of spermatozoa with the egg plasma membrane.

Induction of the acrosome reaction does not appear to alter the molecular weight of sperad but does result in its loss from the sperm cells. Thus, sperad is likely involved in heterotypic interactions prior to interaction of spermatozoa with the egg plasma membrane. Mammalian spermatozoa undergo many changes as they move through the male and female reproductive tracts, ultimately delivering their haploid genome to the egg. As spermatozoa traverse the epididymis, they become progressively motile and capable of binding to the egg zona pellucida (1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Coincidentally, various secreted epididymal proteins bind to spermatozoa followed by a complement of accessory gland-derived proteins (2Eddy E.A. O'Brian D.A. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 29-77Google Scholar). In the female reproductive tract, several interactions between the spermatozoon and its environment are also evident, including: 1) oviductal epithelial cell binding, 2) development of the competence to fertilize an egg, known as capacitation, 3) induction of an exocytotic event known as the acrosome reaction, 4) hyperactivation of motility, 5) cumulus mass and zona pellucida binding and penetration, and 6) egg plasma membrane binding and fusion. Many of these interactions appear to show relative or absolute species specificity, suggesting sperm-specific adhesion and signaling molecules. Antibodies can serve as powerful reagents for the identification of sperm-specific proteins. Auto- and allo-antisera, as well as monoclonal antibodies, have been raised against sperm cells from several species, and these antisera often recognize proteins that appear to participate in sperm and egg interactions (3Yanagimachi R. Okada A. Tung K.S. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 24: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Tung K.S. Okada A. Yanagimachi R. Biol.

Some of these antigens, such as rabbit sperm autoantigen, hyaluronidase, and fertilin, have been characterized at the molecular level (6Richardson R.T. Yamasaki N. O'Rand M.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 688-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Lathrop W.F. Carmichael E.P. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. J.

Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). To identify novel sperm-specific membrane proteins, we produced antiserum to guinea pig sperm membranes in female guinea pigs based on the hypothesis that only male-specific proteins would stimulate an immune response. The antiserum was then used to identify cDNA clones from an enriched spermatogenic cell cDNA expression library. Using this approach, we isolated a cDNA clone that predicted a novel glycoprotein related to a family of cell adhesion molecules originally found in the liver (9Thompson J.A. Tumour Biol. 1995; 16: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The protein (named sperad), first expressed by the haploid spermatid, was localized to the periacrosomal plasma membrane of mature spermatozoa, suggesting a role in cell-cell interaction. Although many members of this large family display homotypic adhesion properties, the expression of sperad in Sf9 cells did not result in cell aggregation. Therefore, sperad is likely to function in heterotypic cell interactions. Since the glycoprotein also contains a proline-rich intracellular domain, a feature different from other members of this family, unique intracellular signaling may also represent a function of this plasma membrane protein. Guinea pig caudal epididymal spermatozoa were washed in a solution containing 4 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 μM EGTA, pH 7.4, as described by Hardy et al. (10Hardy D.M. Huang Jr., T.T. Driscoll W.J. Tung K.K. Wild G.C. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 38: 423-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were allowed to acrosome react in 4 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4, containing 20 μg/ml A23187 for 10 min at 37°C; a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM leupeptin, and 10 μM E-64) was then added. The cells were cooled on ice (5 min) and centrifuged at 400 × g, 5 min, 4°C. The supernatant solution was recovered, and the sperm pellet was washed in 10 volumes of the buffer containing protease inhibitors, centrifuged at 400 × g, 5 min, and the solution pooled with the first supernatant solution. The combined solution was centrifuged at 12,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C to remove cell debris, and the resulting supernatant fraction further centrifuged at 100,000 × g, 1.5 h, 4°C to recover membrane vesicles. This membrane pellet was washed twice with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, and stored in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, at −20°C. A second membrane fraction was prepared by resuspending the 400 × g pellet of acrosome reacted spermatozoa in 5 volumes of buffer containing protease inhibitors, followed by cavitation of the suspension at 700 p.s.i., 20 min, 2-4°C. The cavitate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C to remove cell debris. This pellet was washed, centrifuged again, and the two supernatant fractions combined. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 260,000 × g, 45 min, 4°C to recover the membrane material. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM benzamidine, 10% sucrose, overlaid on a 30/40% sucrose step gradient in the same buffer, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C. The membranes at the 10/30% interface were collected, washed with the high salt buffer, and stored as described above. Antisera were produced by intradermal immunization of female guinea pigs with 700 μg of sperm membrane protein in Freund's complete adjuvant. The animals were boosted once (intramuscular) with 550 μg of sperm membrane protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. In each case, 90% of the immunogen was derived from membranes isolated from the acrosome reaction supernatant solution. Antisera specific for sperad were produced against protein expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) using the pRSET vector (InVitrogen). Two constructs were expressed, representing the mature protein (Ala37-Val330) and the immunoglobulin domains (Ala37-Asn255). The expressed proteins were isolated from bacterial lysates by Ni2+- iminodiacetic acid affinity chromatography and preparative electrophoresis. Rabbits were immunized and boosted once with 100 μg of protein/animal. Total RNA was prepared using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with oligo(dT)-cellulose (12Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 139-142Crossref Google Scholar). An enriched spermatogenic cell population was prepared according to Arboleda and Gerton (13Arboleda C.E. Gerton G.L. Dev. Biol. 1988; 125: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA from this material was used to synthesize a cDNA library in λZAPII according to the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene). Fusion protein expression was induced with 10 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside saturated nitrocellulose filters. The filters were rinsed with TBST 1The abbreviations used are: TBSTTris-buffered saline with Tween 20PBSphosphate-buffered salinekbkilobase(s). (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 0.05% NaN3 twice, and nonspecific protein binding sites blocked by overnight incubation in TBST containing 0.05% NaN3+ 5% nonfat milk. The filters were rinsed with TBST (two 1-liter washes), and probed with 1:5000 sperm membrane antiserum diluted in TBST (2 h). Following washing with TBST (four 1-liter washes), the filters were incubated with 1:5000 horseradish peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG (Zymed) in TBST (1 h). The filters were then washed with TBST (two 1-liter washes) and peroxidase activity detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Phage clones were rescued as pBluescript plasmids and sequenced. Identified partial length clone inserts were random-primed labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used to reprobe the library to identify complete clones. Plaque hybridization was at 42°C overnight, followed by washing in 0.1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS, 0.1% Na4P2O7 (1 liter at 23°C, three 1-liter washes at 65°C). (1 × SSC is 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate.) Full-length clones were sequenced on both strands, and sequences were analyzed using DNASTAR software. Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 phosphate-buffered saline kilobase(s). Total RNA (25 μg) from various guinea pig tissues and an enriched spermatogenic cell fraction was electrophoresed through 1% formaldehyde agarose gels and blotted overnight to nylon membranes (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.50Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled polymerase chain reaction product (950 base pairs corresponding to nucleotides C259-C1210) as described above for library screening. Blots were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (10 min), and 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (two 20-min washes) at 65°C. Spermatozoa, washed as described above, were further washed with 0.1 M NaPi, pH 7.2. The sperm pellet was fixed in 10 volumes of 0.1 M NaPi, pH 7.2 containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde (30 min, 23°C). The fixation was quenched with 0.05 volumes of 1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (1 h). The fixed spermatozoa were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS, spotted onto slides, air dried, and rinsed briefly in water. Spermatozoa were permeabilized in Dulbecco's PBS, 10% normal goat serum, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100 (10 min, 23°C). Slides were then washed in 500 ml of Dulbecco's PBS (10 min). Following permeabilization, nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked with Dulbecco's PBS, 10% normal goat serum, 1 mM EDTA (20 min). The slides were then incubated with anti-sperad (Ala37-Val330) or preimmune serum, 1:500 in blocking solution (2 h). After washing as above, the slides were incubated in the dark with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution (1 h). Following washing, the slides were mounted in Fluoromount G (Fisher). Spermatozoa were fixed as for indirect immunofluorescence. The fixed sperm pellet was processed for frozen sectioning as described by Tokuyasu (15Tokuyasu K.T. J. Microsc. 1986; 143: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Sections were treated as for indirect immunofluorescence with the following changes. The antibody incubation times were reduced to 30 min using a 1:200 dilution of primary antibody, and a 1:100 dilution of 10 nm gold conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used for detection. Paraffin-embedded sections of guinea pig testis (Novagen) were dewaxed, rehydrated, and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/Dulbecco's PBS (30 min). After rinsing with PBS, endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol (30 min). The sections were washed with PBS, then permeabilized, and blocked as described for indirect immunofluorescence. The primary antibody incubation was as above using a 1:4000 dilution. Bound antibody was detected with the Vectastain Elite ABC kit and diaminobenzidine substrate (Vector). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Protein concentration was measured with bicinchoninic acid (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (16Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Denatured samples (1% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol, 100°C for 5 min) were diluted 10-fold into 50 mM NaPi, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, and deglycosylated using N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) at 20 units/mg protein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done according to the method of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Electrophoretically separated samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting (50 V, 1 h) (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with primary antibody in TBST (1 h). After washing with TBST (four changes over 30 min), the blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed with TBST (two changes over 30 min), and bound secondary antibody detected with enhanced chemiluminescence. Several proteins of isolated guinea pig sperm membranes were detected with the antisera produced in female guinea pigs (Fig. 1). The membrane proteins ranged in size from Mr 28,000 to Mr 120,000. No guinea pig sperm membrane proteins were detected with the preimmune serum. That the identified proteins were components of the membrane fraction was also indicated by the absence of detectable immunoreactive components in the soluble fraction released during the acrosome reaction. Some of these proteins were glycoproteins as determined by enzymatic deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F. Treatment with N-glycosidase F did not change the number of immunoreactive proteins, indicating that N-linked oligosaccharides were not solely responsible for the antigenicity. An enriched spermatogenic cell cDNA expression library prepared from four animals was screened with the antiserum to identify clones encoding the sperm membrane proteins. Five clones were detected, four of which represented the same novel transcript. Subsequent screening with this cDNA insert identified two closely related full-length cDNAs of 1.51 and 1.56 kb (Fig. 2). The clones were full-length as suggested by three observations. First, the predicted initiating methionine represented a strong Kozak consensus sequence (19Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Second, an apparent signal peptide followed the predicted start methionine (20von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Finally, all three reading frames 5′ to the predicted initiating methionine contained a stop codon, demonstrating that no longer open reading frame was present. Each clone encoded a protein consisting of a putative signal peptide, two immunoglobulin-like domains (one variable and one constant based on conserved sequence characteristics), a transmembrane segment, and a repetitive, proline-rich domain (Fig. 4B) (21Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). The predicted mature proteins had a calculated molecular mass of 32.2 or 33.3 kDa in the absence of glycosylation. Both clones contained three conserved potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the immunoglobulin domains with an additional site in the 1.51-kb clone. It is likely, therefore, that the repetitive proline-rich domain is within the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell.Fig. 4A, sequence alignment of sperad with selected biliary glycoproteins. The deduced amino acid sequence of sperad is compared to the sequences of human, rat, and mouse biliary glycoproteins. Residues common to two of four sequences are shaded. The numbers on the left side indicate the initial amino acid position of the sequence presented. The arrowheads indicate the conserved splice sites of the biliary glycoprotein family. The sequences were aligned using the DNASTAR MegAlign program (Clustal algorithm, PAM 250 weight table). GenBank™ accession numbers for the sequences are: human (Hs BGP I), J03858; rat (Rn C-CAM), J04963; mouse (Mm Bgp H), X67283. B, schematic representation of sperad domain structure (ellipse, immunoglobulin-like domain; box, transmembrane segment; coil, proline-rich region).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several nucleotide differences were spread throughout the sequences. Thus, the two sequences may represent either alleles of the same gene or two closely related genes with the same expression pattern. It is unlikely that the two sequences are splice variants of one gene based on the conserved gene structure of homologous proteins (see below). That the cDNAs were expressed only in the testis was determined by Northern blot analysis of various guinea pig tissues and an enriched spermatogenic cell sample (Fig. 3). The samples were probed with a polymerase chain reaction product (950 base pairs) corresponding to the coding sequence of the mature protein. A signal of approximately 1.8 kb was detected in the testis and spermatogenic cell RNA samples. No signal was detected in brain, heart, kidney, liver, ovary, or spleen. The broad hybridizing band suggested the presence of each of the two similar mRNA species within a single testis. Using oligonucleotide primers, which flanked the proline-rich repeat region, each cDNA was detected in a single testis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). Comparison of the clones to the GenBank™ data base indicated that they were novel transcripts related to the biliary glycoprotein family of cell adhesion molecules. The sequence similarity to the biliary glycoproteins was highest in the signal peptide, and gradually decreased through the immunoglobulin domains until the sequences completely diverged carboxyl-terminal to the transmembrane segment (Fig. 4A). This site of sequence divergence corresponded to the end of an exon in the conserved biliary glycoprotein gene structure of rat, mouse, and human (22Cheung P.H. Culic O. Qiu Y. Earley K. Thompson N. Hixson D.C. Lin S.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23McCuaig K. Rosenberg M. Nedellec P. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Barnett T.R. Drake L. Pickle II, W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At the nucleotide level, additional sequence similarity between the 3′-untranslated region of the guinea pig clones (nucleotides 1182-1407 of the 1.56-kb clone) and the biliary glycoprotein intracellular domain encoding exons 7-9 was detected. This sequence was not translated in the encoded guinea pig proteins, since the sperm membrane antiserum recognized the proline-rich region expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in bacteria (data not shown). In addition, it is unlikely that a protein containing these biliary glycoprotein intracellular domain exon sequences is produced in guinea pig based on two observations. First, the guinea pig sequence contained a single nucleotide insertion (nucleotide 1228 of the 1.56-kb clone), which would produce a frameshift in the potential biliary glycoprotein reading frame. Second, a nucleotide substitution (nucleotide 1280 of the 1.56-kb clone) produces an in-frame stop codon in the potential biliary glycoprotein reading frame. These changes are probably the result of the elimination of this nucleotide sequence from the protein coding sequence in the guinea pig. The biliary glycoproteins are members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, a subdivision of the immunoglobulin superfamily (9Thompson J.A. Tumour Biol. 1995; 16: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These glycoproteins are widely distributed in epithelial, endothelial, and myeloid lineage cells with high levels of expression found in the liver, intestine, and granulocytes (25Prall F. Nollau P. Neumaier M. Haubeck H.D. Drzeniek Z. Helmchen U. Loning T. Wagener C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The predicted domain organization of the biliary glycoproteins has been determined in mouse, rat, and human from cloning of the corresponding mRNAs (26Turbide C. Rojas M. Stanners C.P. Beauchemin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hinoda Y. Neumaier M. Hefta S.A. Drzeniek Z. Wagener C. Shively L. Hefta L.J. Shively J.E. Paxton R.J. Proc. Natl.

In each case, these glycoproteins possess a signal peptide, an immunoglobulin V-like N-domain, a variable number of immunoglobulin C2-like domains (0-3), a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular domain. Each of the immunoglobulin type domains corresponds to a single exon while the intracellular domain of the biliary glycoproteins is encoded by three exons in the conserved gene structure. Several forms of biliary glycoproteins are produced in all three species. This variation arises as the result of alternative splicing of the exons encoding the C2-like immunoglobulin domains and the intracellular domain producing a variable number of C2-like domains, and either a short (approximately 10 amino acids) or long (approximately 73 amino acids) intracellular domain. The function of the biliary glycoproteins has been addressed in expression studies, where it has been concluded that they act as cell adhesion proteins, at least in vitro (26Turbide C. Rojas M. Stanners C.P. Beauchemin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millirons P. Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24303-24310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these glycoproteins have been suggested to principally mediate homotypic adhesion, heterotypic adhesion to other members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family has been observed (30Rojas M. Fuks A. Stanners C.P. Cell Growth Diff. 1990; 1: 527-533PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brummendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 108-963Google Scholar). Characterization of the adhesive activity of biliary glycoproteins has shown dependence on both calcium and physiological temperatures; the immunoglobulin variable type domain at the N terminus appears to be the functional binding domain (29Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millirons P. Lin S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24303-24310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Teixeira A.M. Fawcett J. Simmons D.L. Watt S.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the homology of the guinea pig protein to these cell adhesion molecules and its specific cellular location (see below), we have designated it sperad. The intracellular domain of sperad is proline-rich containing an extended region where every third amino acid is a proline residue. This proline-rich motif is predicted to form a polyproline II helix consisting of three residues per turn (33Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The majority of this region comprises the short repetitive sequence PPQPEQ. This would result in one side of the three-sided polyproline II helix possessing a negative charge approximately every 19 Å along the helix axis at physiological pH. Polyproline II helices are known to mediate low affinity (micromolar) binding interactions between proteins (33Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). In many cases, the binding of polyproline II helices involves the SH3 or WWP domains that are often found in signal-transducing proteins (34Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 35Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the case of sperad, its facile extraction with detergent suggests that it does not interact with cytoskeletal components, and no binding protein has yet been identified. To identify which sperm membrane protein was represented by sperad, we generated a specific polyclonal antibody to a hexahistidine-tagged protein representing the mature sperad protein expressed in bacteria (anti-sperad: Ala37-Val370). Immunoblots of guinea pig sperm membranes using this antiserum identified three proteins of Mr 55,000, 36,000, and 28,000 (Fig. 5). This electrophoretic profile was constant throughout the epididymis as well as through in vitro capacitation and the acrosome reaction. All three of these proteins corresponded to proteins detected with the sperm membrane antiserum as determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-sperad, and subsequent detection of these proteins on immunoblots with the sperm membrane antiserum. We also generated a separate polyclonal antibody to a protein representing the two immunoglobulin domains of sperad expressed in bacteria (anti-sperad ECD: Ala37-Asn255). This antiserum also recognized the same set of proteins. In addition, antibody microaffinity purified from the guinea pig sperm membrane antiserum with the Mr 55,000 sperm membrane protein also recognized all three proteins. The sperm membrane antiserum recognized only the full-length protein and not the truncated immunoglobulin domain protein expressed by bacteria. Thus, based on these observations, the Mr 36,000 and 28,000 proteins probably represent degradation products of the Mr 55,000 protein. Deglycosylation of the Mr 55,000 protein with N-glycosidase F resulted in a shift to Mr 44,000 (Fig. 5). The mobilities of the Mr 36,000 and 28,000 components were not affected by N-glycosidase F, suggesting that they do not contain N-linked oligosaccharides. When the full-length clone (Ala37-Val330) was expressed in bacteria, the isolated fusion protein had a Mr = 44,000 rather than the calculated 32,000. The agreement between the size of the protein expressed in bacteria and the size of the deglycosylated Mr 55,000 membrane protein confirmed that the clones were complete. Indirect immunofluorescence of fixed, permeabilized guinea pig spermatozoa with anti-sperad localized the protein specifically over the acrosome (Fig. 6). No signal was obtained with acrosome intact spermatozoa using preimmune serum, or using the specific antiserum without a permeabilization step. The predominant epitope recognized by the anti-sperad antibody is the proline-rich repeat as determined by immunoblotting of sperad protein fragments expressed in bacteria (data not shown). Therefore, the inability to detect sperad without permeabilization was further evidence that the proline-rich region was intracellular. Following the ionophore induced acrosome reaction, little or no immunofluorescence remained associated with the sperm cells. The acrosomal location of sperad suggested that it was associated either with the plasma membrane or the outer acrosomal membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy of caudal epididymal spermatozoa with the anti-sperad antibody demonstrated labeling of the periacrosomal plasma membrane (Fig. 7). There was no difference in labeling pattern between the regions of the membrane involved or not involved in sperm-sperm association. No specific labeling of any other subcellular structure was observed. The preimmune serum did not detectably bind to any structure. The localization together with the electrophoretic mobility of sperad suggest that it may represent the previously described sperm antigens AH-30 and/or PM 52/35 (36Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Dev. Biol. 1983; 98: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37Westbrook-Case V.A. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The finding that sperad was related to cell adhesion molecules, which are primarily homotypic, and its localization to the anterior head plasma membrane of spermatozoa led to the hypothesis that sperad had a role in sperm-sperm association. Sperad was expressed in Sf9 cells to assay for homotypic cell adhesion. Approximately 70-80% of the insect cells expressed sperad as determined by immunofluorescence. The expressed protein was glycosylated, Mr 52,000/50,000 doublet, and immunoreactivity was associated with the plasma membrane suggesting sperad was exposed on the cell surface. No aggregation of these cells was seen in either the absence or presence of calcium. The overexpressing Sf9 cells also did not aggregate with guinea pig spermatozoa. These observations suggest that a role for sperad in sperm-sperm association is unlikely. To further investigate potential sites of sperad adhesion, we examined the developmental stage of sperad expression during spermatogenesis. With testicular cross-sections, anti-sperad immunoreactivity was detected only in developing sperm cells near or in the seminiferous tubule lumen (Fig. 8). Some seminiferous tubules were not stained at all, probably because of asynchronous development. This pattern of immunoreactivity suggested that sperad expression was limited to late spermatid and mature sperm cells. Therefore, it is unlikely that sperad is important in adhesion to the seminiferous epithelium. What is the function of sperad in spermatozoa? A role for sperad in mature guinea pig spermatozoa is inferred, since it is specifically expressed only late in spermatogenesis and on mature sperm cells. This post-meiotic expression pattern is shared by many other sperm proteins involved in interaction of the mature spermatozoon with the reproductive system (38Anakwe O.O. Sharma S. Hardy D.M. Gerton G.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 29: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 39Phelps B.M. Myles D.G. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Cowan A.E. Myles D.G. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, the similarity to other cell adhesion proteins strongly suggests that sperad is involved in the binding of spermatozoa to another cell. Since sperad is lost during the acrosome reaction, a role in mediating adhesion at the egg plasma membrane is excluded. In addition to this interaction, spermatozoa interact with other reproductive tract components such as epithelial cells of the epididymis, uterus, and oviduct, as well as the cumulus oophorus and zona pellucida associated with the egg.

INTRODUCTIONThe Uvr(A)BC endonuclease from Escherichia coli consists of an ensemble of the uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC gene products. They act in a sequential manner to produce dual incision of damaged DNA strand at the fourth (fifth) phosphodiester bond 3′ and the eighth phosphodiester bond 5′ to the damaged site, respectively (1Grossman L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lin J.-J. Sancar A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Van Houten B. Microbiol.

In the damage recognition and incision steps, an intricate ATP hydrolysis-coupled process is employed rather than direct damage binding-incision utilized by most of the damage-specific repair enzymes (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lin J.-J. Sancar A. Mol.

In particular, a DNA helix-tracking activity of UvrA2B1 complex is engaged in search and/or prepriming of damage by Uvr(A)BC (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Such DNA helix-tracking activity generates domains of positive and negative supercoils ahead and behind moving complex, respectively (7Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Wu H.-Y. Shyy S. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The differential accumulation of either positive or negative supercoils, which can be achieved in the presence of “anchoring” entities (9Wang J.C. Lynch A.S. Curr. Opinion Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Wang, J. C., (1992) Transcriptional Regulation, (McNight, S. L., Yamamoto, K. R., eds), Vol. 2, pp. 1253‒1269, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar), could potentially affect the tracking activity of the UvrA2B1 complex and, hence, influence the DNA repair process. In the cell, the topoisomerase activities are involved in preventing such accumulation and maintaining the proper level of DNA superhelicity (8Wu H.-Y. Shyy S. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 11Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 879-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 12Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

It was found that topo I and gyrase mutations as well as gyrase inhibitors (novobiocin and nalidixic acid) increase sensitivity of E. coli cells to the killing effects of UV irradiation, affect to different degrees the amount of UV-stimulated repair synthesis, and inhibit recovery of UV-irradiated nonreplicative λ phage (14Crumplin G.C.

However, the effect of damaged DNA topological state on and involvement of topoisomerases in NER in E. coli have received so far very limited biochemical characterization (19Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 218Google Scholar, 20Munn M. Rupp D. J. Biol.

In this report, we addressed this question using the in vitro system including Uvr proteins and topoisomerases. This topodynamic (23Kozyavkin S. Slesarev A.I. Malkhosyan S.R. Panyutin I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24Kovalsky O.I. Kozyavkin S.A. Slesarev A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2801-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) system allows for the differential regulation of the uvDNA topological state. It was found that highly positively supercoiled uvDNA generated by UvrA2B1 helix-tracking activity in the presence of only E. coli topo I is not incised by Uvr(A)BC, whereas it is efficiently incised by Micrococcus luteus UV endo. The addition to this reaction mixture of enzymatic activities removing positive supercoils (E. coli gyrase or eukaryotic topo I) results in restoration of the incision of uvDNA by Uvr(A)BC. The inability of Uvr(A)BC to incise highly positively supercoiled uvDNA is due to the inhibition of UvrAB-dependent incision intermediates associated with the DNA substrate conformational change (25Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8557-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The results are discussed in terms of the influence of DNA topology on the process of Uvr(A)BC damage recognition and incision as well as in terms of the applicability of this in vitro topodynamic system for study of the topological aspect of NER and its interaction with other DNA topology-involved cellular processes.DISCUSSIONNER of damaged DNA can be accomplished in vitro by six highly purified E. coli proteins. The three components of Uvr(A)BC acting in a sequential and coordinated manner initiate repair by carrying out dual incision of the damaged strand. The incision step is a complex ATP-dependent process involving structural changes of protein and nucleoprotein intermediates. The combined action of UvrD (helicase II) and DNA polymerase I in the presence of dNTPs results in a displacement of postincision Uvr protein-incised fragment complex(es) and resynthesis of DNA. DNA ligase completes the repair by restoring the integrity of DNA (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lin J.-J. Sancar A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This in vitro system neither requires any of the known E. coli topoisomerases nor takes into account a potential influence of the DNA topology on NER process. However, the reconstituted NER system underrates the dynamic nature of DNA in vivo with respect to its topology. In particular, translocation-involved cellular processes, notably transcription and replication, generate domains of negative and positive supercoiling behind and ahead of a translocating complex (8Wu H.-Y. Shyy S. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 9Wang J.C. Lynch A.S. Curr. Opinion Genet.

R., eds), Vol. 2, pp. 1253‒1269, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar, 13Liu L.F. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Although this differential supercoiling may not be persistent in an in vitro reconstituted system, the large protein-, nucleoprotein-, and membrane-involved in vivo macromolecular assemblies are able to function as “anchoring” structures preventing or slowing down the fusion of opposite supercoils (9Wang J.C. Lynch A.S. Curr. Opinion Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Wang, J. C., (1992) Transcriptional Regulation, (McNight, S. L., Yamamoto, K. R., eds), Vol. 2, pp. 1253‒1269, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). Given that the incision step of Uvr(A)BC-dependent NER utilizes DNA helix-tracking activity and proceeds through DNA conformational changes resulting in DNA unwinding (25Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8557-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to expect that NER can be influenced by the topological waves of opposite supercoiling. This reasoning is strengthened by the phenomenon of transcription-coupled repair (37Melon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1981; 342: 95-98Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 38Selby C.P. Sancar A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 317-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription and repair macromolecular assemblies seem to be in a physical association during this process. 4It was shown that the β-subunit of the E. coli RNA polymerase and UvrA protein can be reversibly cross-linked in vivo (C.-L. Lin, O. I. Kovalsky, and L. Grossman, manuscript in preparation). Furthermore, the Uvr(A)BC complex seems to preferentially operate downstream of the transcription machinery (39Ahn B. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21453-21461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 40Ahn B. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21462-21470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), that is, in the region of potential positive supercoiling. In supporting this suggestion, we found that highly positively supercoiled DNA, generated under conditions of supercoiling assay (7Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), is resistant to the incision by Uvr(A)BC. Such DNA is refractory to two of the UvrAB-dependent functions thought to be associated with the formation of obligatory intermediates in the Uvr(A)BC-catalyzed incision (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): (i) the robust stimulation of the UvrA2B1-associated ATPase is not observed and (ii) no stable damage-dependent nucleoprotein complexes are formed. It was found earlier that these obligatory intermediates are associated with the DNA conformational changes resulting in the decrease of a number of helical turns in a ccDNA (25Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8557-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Such a decrease should be compensated by an increase in the number of superhelical turns in order to maintain a constant linking number of ccDNA (32Wang J. Peck L.J. Becherer K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 85-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cases of positively supercoiled DNA, this compensation would result in an unfavorable free energy change (41Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Cozarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 185-215Google Scholar). The energy input produced by the UvrAB-associated ATPase, which probably provides for power stroke during the above conformational change (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may not be sufficient to overcome that unfavorable free energy change. As a result, obligatory intermediates in this process are unable to form on highly positively supercoiled DNA. In cases of highly negatively supercoiled DNA, produced when gyrase substitutes for E. coli topo I in the supercoiling assay, a decrease in the number of helical turns should be energetically favorable (41Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Cozarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 185-215Google Scholar). Hence, the formation of intermediates in question should be facilitated. Consistently, this DNA was found to be efficiently incised by Uvr(A)BC.It was shown that in the absence of UvrB, UvrA protein recognizes damage by random diffusion mechanism, and its binding does not result in a significant DNA unwinding (25Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8557-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, the UvrA protein was able to recognize and bind damaged sites on highly positively supercoiled uvDNA. This further supports the earlier observations that affinity of UvrA for damage does not correlate with the efficiency of incision (42Bertrand-Burggraf E. Selby C.P. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 43Snowden A. Van Houten B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and that UvrAB complex provides for a more productive DNA-binding intermediate (39Ahn B. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21453-21461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 40Ahn B. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21462-21470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Notably, M. luteus UV endo which by analogy with T4 phage UV endonuclease seems to directly recognize cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and does not induce extensive DNA unwinding (28Grafstrom R.H. Park L. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13465-13474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikava K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) efficiently incised uvDNA regardless of its topological state.The problem of incising highly positively supercoiled uvDNA by Uvr(A)BC is reminiscent of transcription and replication encountering accumulated positive supercoils (45Gartenberger M.R.

E. coli possesses two major topoisomerases responsible for maintaining adequate superhelical stress: topo I removes negative supercoils whereas gyrase introduces negative supercoils. The presence of both activities in the supercoiling assay abolished accumulation of highly positively supercoiled uvDNA and restored incision by Uvr(A)BC. The eukaryotic (calf thymus) topo I, capable of removing positive supercoils, was able to substitute for gyrase in restoring Uvr(A)BC incision. Hence, the restoration of incision seems to take place namely due to prevention of the accumulation of positive supercoils. In support of the existence of similar topological problems in vivo, both E. coli gyrase and topo I are recruited in a damage-dependent manner (among other NER-related and seemingly unrelated proteins) to the inner membrane of the UV-irradiated cells as a part of SOS response. 5C.-L. Lin, O. I. Kovalsky, and L. Grossman, manuscript in preparation. These topoisomerases may be required to regulate DNA topology for optimum repair in such membrane-attached configuration.The topodynamic in vitro system described in this report may be a prototype for studying different aspects of the interrelation of NER and DNA topology. By using specific ccDNA templates, different combinations of topoisomerases, and other macromolecular entities in the system, it is feasible to gain insights into the interaction of NER and other DNA topology-involved cellular processes. INTRODUCTIONThe Uvr(A)BC endonuclease from Escherichia coli consists of an ensemble of the uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC gene products. They act in a sequential manner to produce dual incision of damaged DNA strand at the fourth (fifth) phosphodiester bond 3′ and the eighth phosphodiester bond 5′ to the damaged site, respectively (1Grossman L.

In the damage recognition and incision steps, an intricate ATP hydrolysis-coupled process is employed rather than direct damage binding-incision utilized by most of the damage-specific repair enzymes (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lin J.-J. Sancar A. Mol.

In particular, a DNA helix-tracking activity of UvrA2B1 complex is engaged in search and/or prepriming of damage by Uvr(A)BC (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Such DNA helix-tracking activity generates domains of positive and negative supercoils ahead and behind moving complex, respectively (7Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Wu H.-Y. Shyy S. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The differential accumulation of either positive or negative supercoils, which can be achieved in the presence of “anchoring” entities (9Wang J.C. Lynch A.S. Curr. Opinion Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Wang, J. C., (1992) Transcriptional Regulation, (McNight, S. L., Yamamoto, K. R., eds), Vol. 2, pp. 1253‒1269, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar), could potentially affect the tracking activity of the UvrA2B1 complex and, hence, influence the DNA repair process. In the cell, the topoisomerase activities are involved in preventing such accumulation and maintaining the proper level of DNA superhelicity (8Wu H.-Y. Shyy S. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 11Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 879-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 12Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

It was found that topo I and gyrase mutations as well as gyrase inhibitors (novobiocin and nalidixic acid) increase sensitivity of E. coli cells to the killing effects of UV irradiation, affect to different degrees the amount of UV-stimulated repair synthesis, and inhibit recovery of UV-irradiated nonreplicative λ phage (14Crumplin G.C.

However, the effect of damaged DNA topological state on and involvement of topoisomerases in NER in E. coli have received so far very limited biochemical characterization (19Friedberg E.C.

In this report, we addressed this question using the in vitro system including Uvr proteins and topoisomerases. This topodynamic (23Kozyavkin S. Slesarev A.I. Malkhosyan S.R. Panyutin I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24Kovalsky O.I. Kozyavkin S.A. Slesarev A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2801-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) system allows for the differential regulation of the uvDNA topological state. It was found that highly positively supercoiled uvDNA generated by UvrA2B1 helix-tracking activity in the presence of only E. coli topo I is not incised by Uvr(A)BC, whereas it is efficiently incised by Micrococcus luteus UV endo. The addition to this reaction mixture of enzymatic activities removing positive supercoils (E. coli gyrase or eukaryotic topo I) results in restoration of the incision of uvDNA by Uvr(A)BC. The inability of Uvr(A)BC to incise highly positively supercoiled uvDNA is due to the inhibition of UvrAB-dependent incision intermediates associated with the DNA substrate conformational change (25Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8557-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The results are discussed in terms of the influence of DNA topology on the process of Uvr(A)BC damage recognition and incision as well as in terms of the applicability of this in vitro topodynamic system for study of the topological aspect of NER and its interaction with other DNA topology-involved cellular processes."

It has been shown that cells carrying such hybrid ATPases have an unusual energy-coupling phenotype. Although they are able to grow on minimal succinate medium, and therefore carry a functional ATP synthase, they are defective in the ability to grow anaerobically, indicating some defect in ATP-driven proton pumping (Scarpetta, M., Hawthorne, C. A., and Brusilow, W. S. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18567-18572). In this study, chimeric beta subunits were constructed consisting of the E. coli or the B. megaterium beta subunit carrying the C-terminal 18% of the other's beta subunit. The phenotypes of an E. coli beta mutant complemented with these chimeric subunits showed that the energy-coupling defect was located in this C-terminal region. The E. coli beta subunit carrying the B. megaterium C-terminal region displayed the energy-coupling defect, while the B. megaterium beta subunit carrying the E. coli C-terminal region did not. In ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching assays, membranes isolated from cells displaying the energy-coupling defect also pumped protons less well than membranes isolated from cells that were able to grow anaerobically. These results demonstrate that the C terminus of the beta subunit is involved in the conformational coupling pathway, which, through the polypeptide backbone of the beta subunit, physically links ATP synthesis or hydrolysis to the energy of proton translocation."
