https://openalex.org/W2042662552,"CSF-1 is a hemopoietic growth factor that specifically causes the proliferation and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytic cells. Receptors for CSF-1 occur exclusively on cells of the mononuclear phagocytic series (precursor leads to monoblast leads to promonocyte leads to monocyte leads to macrophage). Studies of the actions of CSF-1 on freshly explanted macrophages have been complicated by contamination of the primary cell isolates with CSF-1-producing cells and by the heterogeneity of the proliferative responses of individual macrophages. A method is described for the production of a highly purified and homogeneous population of adherent bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) that are devoid of CSF-1-producing cells. The method may also be used to obtain nonadherent precursors of the mononuclear phagocytic series. Studies of CSF-1 action and degradation in cultures of BMMs have revealed several new findings. First, CSF-1 is required for both the survival (without proliferation) and the proliferation of BMMs. Second, CSF-1 is degraded by BMMs in a concentration-dependent manner, over the range of concentrations that stimulates both cell survival and proliferation. Third, the rate of CSF-1 degradation is saturable (or approximately 7 X 10(4) molecules per cell per hour) at CSF-1 concentrations that cause maximum proliferation (or approximately 0.4 nM). Under these conditions, BMMs are greatly enlarged and contain numerous phase-lucent vacuoles. Thus macrophages specifically require CSF-1 for both survival and proliferation, yet selectively and rapidly degrade it. This apparent dichotomy may have important implications for the role of CSF-1 in macrophage homeostasis in vivo."

One of three virus-carrying cell lines, tested after being subjected to lethal x-irradiation, consistently transformed leukocytes from adult peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood. All the transformed cell lines expressed adult T cell leukemia virus-associated antigen, but transformed lines originating from adult and umbilical cord blood exhibited T cell and non-T, non-B cell surface natures, respectively. Efforts to transform human leukocytes with cell-free virus were unsuccessful."
https://openalex.org/W2062573006,"Compaction, a process of cell-cell adhesion between mouse blastomeres or between embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells requires calcium ions. A decompaction effect similar to that observed in the absence of Ca2+ is triggered by Fab fragments of rabbit anti-EC IgG. This effect occurs through the recognition of a specific cell-surface glycoprotein named uvomorulin. An 84,000 dalton fragment of uvomorulin (UMt) has been previously extracted by trypsin from EC cell membranes and purified. We present evidence that the effects of Ca2+ on compaction are transmitted through conformational changes in uvomorulin. First, Ca2+ protects UMt from further proteolysis by trypsin. Mn2+ and Sr2+ have similar effects, whereas this protection is reversed by La3+. Second, UMt can bind the monoclonal antibody DE1 only in the presence of Ca2+ (half-binding at 10âˆ’5 M Ca2+). This antigenic exposure also takes place in the presence of Mn2+ or Sr2+ and is reversed by La3+. Third, metal ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Sr2+) that promote trypsin resistance and recognition by DE1 are found to trigger the compaction of morulae and EC cells. Metal ions (La3+) that reduce trypsin resistance and affinity for DE1 result in decompaction."

https://openalex.org/W2068309971,"Autoradiographic studies with 3H-labeled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] demonstrate, in certain neurons of rat forebrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord, a nuclear retention and concentration of radioactivity, which can be prevented by treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, but not with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. These results indicate the presence of brain receptors in addition to pituitary receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3 and suggest a central modulation of calcium homeostasis and other central effects for this hormone. The existence of a brain-pituitary axis for certain 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated endocrine-autonomic effects is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W1510058062,"Addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to quiescent confluent cultures of human foreskin fibroblasts causes a rapid, nearly 2-fold stimulation of unidirectional Na+ influx and a doubling of the rate of the Na+,K+ pump, whereas K+ efflux remains unaltered. The diuretic amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, completely blocks EGF-induced Na+ influx, Na+,K+-pump activity, and DNA synthesis without affecting the cellular binding, visible clustering, and internalization of 125I-labeled and fluorescent EGF. In the absence of EGF, the induction of amiloride-sensitive Na+ influx and Na+,K+-pump activity can be mimicked by exposing the cells to weak acids. Neither the rapid stimulation of Na+ influx by EGF nor its inhibition by amiloride is accompanied by a detectable change in membrane potential (mean value of -66 mV), as evidenced by direct intracellular recording. In contrast, a rapid but transient membrane depolarization of about 50 mV, due to an unselective permeability increase, is observed in response to serum-growth factors. These results (i) indicate that EGF rapidly activates an electroneutral, previously inactive Na+ transport system in the plasma membrane of quiescent fibroblasts, and (ii) suggest that EGF-induced Na+ influx occurs in exchange for intracellular protons. The data further imply that early changes in membrane potential are not necessary for the initiation of a mitogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W1565281311,"This study has examined the interaction between human leukocyte elastase and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, or C1 inactivator, inhibitors of proteases of the complement, kinin, coagulation, and fibrinolytic enzyme systems. Leukocyte elastase, in catalytic concentrations, progressively inactivates the plasmin inhibitory activity of both inhibitors. The C1s binding function of C1 inactivator is also destroyed by leukocyte elastase. The nature of the molecular events underlying the inactivation of these protease inhibitors was examined by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Loss of functional activity was accompanied by limited proteolytic cleavage of both inhibitors with the production of several characteristic derivative peptide chains. Leukocyte elastase cleaved alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor at two separate sites and generated lower molecular weight fragments similar to those produced by bovine beta-trypsin. C1 inactivator was hydrolyzed at three different regions on the molecule whereas beta-trypsin cleaved two regions in common with leukocyte elastase. These findings suggest that inactivation of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor and C1 inactivator by leukocyte elastase released in the inflammatory reaction may potentiate pathological proteolysis. The limited digestion of these inhibitory proteins by leukocyte elastase may prove useful in studies of their primary structure."

https://openalex.org/W1524888592,"Reactions between near equimolar amounts of antithrombin and Factors IXa or Xa resulted in the formation of a free proteolytically modified, two-chain form of the inhibitor, in addition to the inactive antithrombin-protease complexes. The modified inhibitor produced by either enzyme was electrophoretically identical with that formed in the reaction with thrombin. As in the latter reaction, the formation of the modified antithrombin by Factor Xa was increased in the presence of heparin, while only small amounts were produced by Factor IXa both in the absence and presence of the polysaccharide. NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the isolated modified inhibitor formed by Factor Xa showed that a single Arg-Ser bond in the COOH-terminal end of the inhibitor had been cleaved. This cleavage site is identical with that identified in free thrombin-modified antithrombin. The purified antithrombin-Factor IXa and antithrombin-Factor Xa complexes were dissociated by ammonia or hydroxylamine into free enzyme and a modified two-chain form of the inhibitor. Electrophoresis studies and NH2-terminal sequence analyses showed that the modified antithrombin obtained from either complex was identical with that produced in free form by the two enzymes and also with the modified inhibitor that is released from the antithrombin-thrombin complex. The fact that identical results were obtained for the reactions between antithrombin and three enzymes with different specificities strongly suggests that the observed Arg-Ser cleavage site is the active site of antithrombin."

During the onset of contraction as well as after a step, the ratio of stiffness to force differed from that determined during the tetanus plateau. The data after a step are predicted by the Huxley-Simmons model of muscular contraction, but the results during the rise suggest that a long-lived state may exist between crossbridge attachment and force generation."
https://openalex.org/W1596802196,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase from pig liver has been purified to homogeneity, as judged by several criteria: (i) a single band with a subunit molecular weight of 77,300 following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate; (ii) a molecular weight determined by amino acid analysis of 74,500 per flavin, in agreement with the subunit molecular weight; and (iii) constant specific activities in the peak fractions during the final chromatography step. The purified enzyme exhibits a typical flavoprotein absorption spectrum. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is a minor constituent of pig liver, and to obtain homogeneous enzyme, a 32,000-fold purification must be accomplished. The preparation described herein attains such purification in 5 steps and with a 14% yield. The enzyme isolated in this fashion is active and stable, and contains a stoichiometric complement of FAD. The enzyme is reducible under anaerobic conditions by 5-deazaflavin/EDTA/light or by NADPH. Reduction of 1 mol of enzyme-bound FAD requires 1.1 mol of NADPH. The reduced enzyme can be reoxidized by (6-R)-methylenetetrahydrofolate, again with nearly 1:1 stoichiometry. Steady state kinetic measurements of the NADPH-methylenetetrahydrofolate oxidoreductase activity give parallel line double reciprocal plots. The turnover number per mol of enzyme-bound flavin is 1600/min under Vmax conditions. The spectrum of the enzyme-bound flavin is significantly perturbed by the binding of S-adenosylmethionine, a metabolite known to be an allosteric modulator of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1987176584,"Splicing of newly formed nuclear RNA transcripts has been demonstrated during adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) mRNA formation in HeLa cells in the presence of ""cordycepin,"" 3' deoxyadenosine, a drug that stops poly(A) addition to nuclear RNA. Nuclear RNA prepared from Ad2-infected cells after a 30 min label time in the presence or absence of 3' deoxyadenosine was hybridized to and eluted from Ad2 DNA sequences in the transcription units of region E1b and region E2. The nuclear RNA from the 3' dA-treated cells did not contain poly(A) but did contain Ad2-specific molecules approximately 200 to 250 bases shorter than the spliced mRNAs of the control infected cells. In addition, the approximately 2 kb RNA from Ad2 region E2 was shown to have sequences that lie more than 3.5 kb apart on the DNA, suggesting that correct cutting and splicing of the primary transcript in the absence of poly(A) synthesis had occurred. Therefore, although poly(A) addition usually precedes splicing during mRNA formation, poly(A) is not required for splicing."

https://openalex.org/W1576421572,"Experimental conditions for the measurement of prostatic androgen receptors occupied with unlabeled hormone are described. The assay allows quantitation of cytoplasmic and nuclear receptors occupied with unlabeled ligand by exchange with 17 beta-hydroxy-17 alpha-methyl [3H]estra-4,9,11-trien-3-one at 0 degrees C. The mercurial reagent mersalyl acid (0.2 mM) is used to promote dissociation of more than 90% receptor-bound steroid. The half-time of this reaction is 10-15 min. The reaction is reversible by addition of dithiothreitol or monothioglycerol. Treatment of the receptor with mersalyl and displacement of this reagent by thiol reagents does not alter the steroid binding affinity of the receptor or the sedimentation characteristics. Binding is measured by the hydroxylapatite procedure and all buffers contain 10 mM sodium molybdate. This assay circumvents many of the difficulties associated with conventional exchange assays performed either at elevated temperature or at 16 degrees C for 20-24 h, such as receptor degradation or incomplete exchange."

https://openalex.org/W2030257170,Three-day-old rat pups with electrodes directed at the medial forebrain bundle at the level of the lateral hypothalamic area were trained to push a paddle to receive electrical brain stimulation. Pups receiving stimulation that was contingent on lifting the paddle responded more frequently than did control pups and also learned a two-choice spatial discrimination task that was rewarded with brain stimulation. The experiments indicate that a neural substrate in the area of the medial forebrain bundle is involved in the central mediation of reinforcement in the rat pup.
https://openalex.org/W1527941179,"Adenosine deaminase (adenosine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.4) was examined in human lymphoblast cell lines from normal and adenosine deaminase-deficient individuals as well as individuals heterozygous for adenosine deaminase deficiency. Adenosine deaminase activity was determined by a specific enzymatic assay and compared to immunoreactive adenosine deaminase protein (or cross-reacting material) determined by radioimmunoassay, in order to investigate mutations affecting adenosine deaminase. Two different antisera, raised in goat and rabbit against human adenosine deaminase, had different sensitivities and apparent specificities when used for radioimmunoassay. Rabbit antisera provided the most sensitive assay of normal enzyme, whereas goat antiserum provided the most sensitive assay for detection of mutant proteins. A wide range of values for the ratio of immunoreactive protein to activity was observed for the adenosine deaminase deficient cell lines, ranging from near normal to 23 times normal. The cell lines with high ratios appear to contain large amounts of catalytically defective or inactive protein. The amount of mutant protein detected by radioimmunoassay in the deficient cell lines depends upon the antiserum utilized, making as much as a 50-fold difference. The heterozygous lines contain approximately half of the normal amounts of immunoreactive protein and activity, and thus have a normal ratio of the two. Two cell lines partially deficient in adenosine deaminase appear to contain large amounts of an unstable adenosine deaminase protein with partially impaired activity. Immunoreactive protein was visualized in extracts from several cell lines, after electrophoresis and transfer to activated paper, by labeling with immunological probes and autoradiography."
https://openalex.org/W2087740324,"Contraction of isolated, intact frog muscle fibers under increasing tonicity of the external solution was studied by adding (i) effectively impermeant sodium chloride and sucrose and (ii) permeant potassium chloride. Force of isometric contraction decreased as a function of tonicity, independent of the permeability of the solute. In contrast, cell volume changed with tonicity in impermeant solutes and was constant with potassium chloride. The results are evidence that ionic strength in the sarcoplasm directly influences the contraction mechanism. Also, the findings show that force development is unaffected by changes in fiber volume, suggesting that the force per cross-bridge is constant at different distances between the thin and myofilaments. Finally, in light of the length-force relation, the results support the idea that cross-bridges are independent force generators."

Giving these hens additional 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or 24,24-difluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 at 1.25 nanomoles per day resulted in 90 to 100 percent normal embryos, and hence, hatchability.

https://openalex.org/W1579627745,"Biochemical genetic studies to determine the molecular basis for the differences in N-acetylation between the A/J and C57BL/6J mouse strains were carried out. Purification of liver N-acetyltransferase from both strains showed that aminofluorene and p-aminobenzoic acid activities are not separable by protein purification techniques which exploit differences in charge and size. In addition, both aminofluorene and p-aminobenzoic acid N-acetyltransferase activities from the C57BL/6J mouse liver enzymes migrated as a single symmetrical protein band after polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. For aminofluorene and p-aminobenzoic acid, the two mouse strains showed apparent Km differences which suggest a difference in a structural gene product, and at least may partially account for the observed differences in N-acetylation. N-Acetyltransferase activity of selected extrahepatic tissues showed that both small intestine and kidney reflect the animal's phenotype as determined by liver or blood N-acetyltransferase. Sex differences were apparent in this activity in C57BL/6J mouse kidney, with males exhibiting approximately 2.5-fold higher activity for aminofluorene and approximately 3-fold higher activity for p-aminobenzoic acid than did females."

https://openalex.org/W1597201626,"The hydrogen exchange behavior of rhodopsin was re-examined by studies of the protein in the disc membrane and after solubilization in octyl glucoside. The methods used measure either the peptide hydrogens alone (hydrogen-deuterium exchange by infrared spectroscopy) or all slowly exchanging hydrogens (hydrogen-tritium exchange by hel filtration). Under mild exchange conditions, disc membranes and solubilized lipid-free proteins show very similar exchange behavior, indicating the absence of slowly exchanging lipid protons. At high temperature, exchange of an additional large group of very slow peptide NH can be detected. The total number of slow hydrogens significantly exceeds the amide content, and apparently includes slowly exchanging protons from perhaps 40% of the protein's non-amide side chains. This is thought to require the involvement of many polar side chains in internal H-bonding. The exchange rates of the non-amide side chains sites have not been determined. However, to the extent that these contribute to the fast time region of the measured kinetic H-exchange curve, previously identified with exposed, non-H-bonded peptides, the estimate of freely exposed rhodopsin peptides must be reduced. The fraction of free peptides could range from a remarkably high value of 70% down to about 45%."
https://openalex.org/W1554347661,"Immunoselection with HLA-A2 or HLA-A1 specific alloantisera has been utilized to isolate spontaneously arising and mutagen-induced variants from the B lymphoblastoid cell line T5-1 (HLA haplotypes DR3, B8, A1 and DR1, B27, Cw1, A2). Such variants are characterized by reduced reactivity with alloantisera of the selecting specificity, but normal reactivity with alloantisera directed to the other HLA specificities of T5-1. Biochemical analysis reveals two classes of variants. In all HLA-A1 and some HLA-A2 variants, the heavy chain in question cannot be detected; however, in other HLA-A2 variants, a structurally altered HLA-A2 heavy chain is found. In the HLA-A2 variant 6.6.5, this heavy chain is glycosylated and thus has presumably been inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane in vivo. However, unlike all other HLA heavy chains, the 6.6.5 HLA-A2 heavy chain does not associate with beta 2-microglobulin, does not undergo processing of its high mannose oligosaccharide, and does not migrate to the cell surface, although it is relatively stably expressed within the cell. We suggest that the primary defect in these cells is the failure of the 6.6.5 HLA-A2 heavy chain to associate stably with beta 2-microglobulin. It is likely that the observed structural alteration in this heavy chain reflects a change in amino acid sequence, and thus, a mutation in the structural gene encoding HLA-A2."

The anomalous cones, previously thought to be absent, are less sensitive than normal cones to both spectral and temporal variations, and have spectral sensitivities like those of the abnormal cones of anomalous trichromats. These results are not consistent with either loss or replacement models of X-linked recessive color-vision defects, since some dichromats apparently have the same three photopigments as anomalous trichromats."

https://openalex.org/W1492675112,"The evolutionary homology of pepsinogens was further evaluated by isolating and characterizing the pepsinogen of the esophageal glands of Rana catesbeiana. Like other pepsinogens, this esophageal enzyme was activated by acid; the resulting pepsin was optimally active between pH 1.4 and 2.0, and was irreversibly denatured above pH 7.0. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose at pH 7.0 separated four acid protease fractions corresponding to pepsinogens B, D, A, and C. Hydroxylapatite chromatography of the major peptic fraction, pepsinogen A, followed by rechromatography on DEAE-cellulose at pH 8.5 yielded pure pepsinogen A which was free of detectable contaminants. Estimation of molecular weight by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.1% SDS and by sedimentation equilibrium gave values of 31,500, 33,500, and 33,700, respectively. These studies suggest that the difference between bullfrog and other pepsinogens is located in a 90 to 110 amino acid (Mr 9,000 to 11,000) region of the molecule which must be remote from the catalytic and immunogenic sites. This lower molecular weight pepsinogen should thus provide a simpler molecular model for study of the catalytic and immunogenic properties. The pepsinogen from bullfrog gastric mucosa was found to have similar properties which suggested that gastric and esophageal pepsinogens of bullfrog are derived from a common ancestral origin. This archetypic pepsinogen may have undergone deletions late in evolution to render modern bullfrog pepsinogen structurally dissimilar from other described pepsinogens. The modern bullfrog enzyme has retained peptic enzymatic activity despite these evolutionary changes."
https://openalex.org/W1523827073,"A C4-dependent hemolytic complement assay and competitive binding assays with [1,4(n)-3H]putrescine or [14C]methylamine were used to determine the structural preferences of C4 and of metastable C4 for covalent modification with a series of alkyl primary amines. The pKa values of individual amines did not correspond with their ability to inactivate the hemolytic function of C4. The rank order of effectiveness did correlate with the molecular weight and conformation of the organic amines tested. In contrast to results with C4, metastable C4b displays a general increased susceptibility for modification by C3 and C4 alkyl amines. However, C4b exhibits a distinct preference for diamines, putrescine and 1,3-diaminopropane, over monoamines of the same alkyl chain length, s-butylamine and n-propylamine. Taken together, these studies provide the first direct evidence for a conformational change in the thioester region of C4 upon proteolytic activation to metastable C4b. A model is proposed to explain the results of competitive binding experiments with metastable C4b in terms of two binding sites for amines on C4b, the presumptive thioester and a second site such as the free side chain carboxyl group of glutamic acid. It is suggested that all amines except methylamine bind preferentially to the latter site; once bound, only diamines would still be capable of mounting a nucleophilic attack on the thioester bond with the second amino group."
