Methods Retrospective analysis was performed on 634 children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) hospitalized in our hospital between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014. The clinical features, laboratory data, radiological findings between the RMPP group and the general Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (GMPP) group were compared and the predictive values of related factors were analyzed. Results The median age of the RMPP patients (n = 145) was much older than that of the GMPP patients (n = 489) (P<0.01). We also found more severe presentations, higher incidence of extra-pulmonary complications and more serious radiological findings in RMPP group, which needed oxygen more often, longer antibiotics administration and intensive care (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), immunoglobulin A (IgM), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and the percentage of neutrophils, CD8+ in RMPP group were significantly higher than those in GMPP group (P<0.05); while the levels of prealbumin (PAB) were lower than that in GMPP group (P<0.01). In ROC curve analysis, the percentage of neutrophil, CRP, LDH, PAB, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ were useful for differentiating patients with RMPP from those with GMPP. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the CRP≥16.5mg/L, LDH ≥417IU/L and IL-6 ≥14.75pg/ml were significant predictors regarding to RMPP. Conclusions CRP≥16.5mg/L, LDH ≥417IU/L and IL-6 ≥14.75pg/ml might be the significant predictors of RMPP in children, which can aid in early recognition of RMPP."
https://openalex.org/W2395841582,"Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a risk factor for problematic cannabis use. However, clinical and anecdotal evidence suggest an increasingly popular perception that cannabis is therapeutic for ADHD, including via online resources. Given that the Internet is increasingly utilized as a source of healthcare information and may influence perceptions, we conducted a qualitative analysis of online forum discussions, also referred to as threads, on the effects of cannabis on ADHD to systematically characterize the content patients and caregivers may encounter about ADHD and cannabis. Methods A total of 268 separate forum threads were identified. Twenty percent (20%) were randomly selected, which yielded 55 separate forum threads (mean number of individual posts per forum thread = 17.53) scored by three raters (Cohen’s kappa = 0.74). A final sample of 401 posts in these forum threads received at least one endorsement on predetermined topics following qualitative coding procedures. Results Twenty-five (25%) percent of individual posts indicated that cannabis is therapeutic for ADHD, as opposed to 8% that it is harmful, 5% that it is both therapeutic and harmful, and 2% that it has no effect on ADHD. This pattern was generally consistent when the year of each post was considered. The greater endorsement of therapeutic versus harmful effects of cannabis did not generalize to mood, other (non-ADHD) psychiatric conditions, or overall domains of daily life. Additional themes emerged (e.g., cannabis being considered sanctioned by healthcare providers). Conclusions Despite that there are no clinical recommendations or systematic research supporting the beneficial effects of cannabis use for ADHD, online discussions indicate that cannabis is considered therapeutic for ADHD—this is the first study to identify such a trend. This type of online information could shape ADHD patient and caregiver perceptions, and influence cannabis use and clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W2401410992,"Olfactory receptors, which belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors, are found to be ectopically expressed in non-sensory tissues mediating a variety of cellular functions. In this study we detected the olfactory receptor OR51E2 at the transcript and the protein level in human epidermal melanocytes. Stimulation of primary melanocytes with the OR51E2 ligand β-ionone significantly inhibited melanocyte proliferation. Our results further showed that β-ionone stimulates melanogenesis and dendritogenesis. Using RNA silencing and receptor antagonists, we demonstrated that OR51E2 activation elevated cytosolic Ca2+ and cAMP, which could mediate the observed increase in melanin synthesis. Co-immunocytochemical stainings using a specific OR51E2 antibody revealed subcellular localization of the receptor in early endosomes associated with EEA-1 (early endosome antigen 1). Plasma membrane preparations showed that OR51E2 protein is present at the melanocyte cell surface. Our findings thus suggest that activation of olfactory receptor signaling by external compounds can influence melanocyte homeostasis.

Axel R. A novel multigene family may encode odorant receptors: a molecular basis for odor recognition.Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Later on, a subset of human OR genes have been found to be expressed in various non-olfactory tissues (2Flegel C. Manteniotis S. Osthold S. Hatt H. Gisselmann G. Expression profile of ectopic olfactory receptors determined by deep sequencing.PloS ONE. 2013; 8: e55368Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 3Kang N. Koo J.

Characterizing the expression of the human olfactory receptor gene family using a novel DNA microarray.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This ectopic expression of OR genes raised the possibility that a subset of ORs may have physiological functions in non-olfactory tissues in addition to their canonical role in odor detection in the sensory neurons. Functionality of olfactory receptors in non-olfactory cell types is becoming better understood. Initially, a lack of correlation in expression levels in different tissues between human-mouse orthologous pairs and between intact and pseudogenized ORs was taken as an indication that functional interpretation of ectopic OR expression cannot be based on transcriptional information (5Feldmesser E. Olender T. Khen M. Yanai I. Ophir R. Lancet D. Widespread ectopic expression of olfactory receptor genes.BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 121Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Analysis of non-olfactory tissues in human and chimpanzee later revealed that OR orthologous genes are expressed in the same tissues more often than expected by chance alone. Orthologous OR genes with conserved ectopic expression have evolved under stronger evolutionary constraints than OR genes expressed exclusively in the olfactory epithelium (6De la Cruz O. Blekhman R. Zhang X. Nicolae D. Firestein S. Gilad Y. A signature of evolutionary constraint on a subset of ectopically expressed olfactory receptor genes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2009; 26: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), indicating that ectopically expressed OR genes have conserved functions in non-olfactory tissues. In the studies performed so far, functional analysis of ectopically expressed ORs revealed a possible role in sperm chemotaxis (7Fukuda N. Yomogida K. Okabe M. Touhara K.

Human ORs were also shown to mediate serotonin release in enterochromaffin cells (10Braun T. Voland P. Kunz L. Prinz C. Gratzl M.

The OR2A4 that localizes to the cytokinetic structures in cells was shown to participate in cytokinesis (13Zhang X. Bedigian A.V. Wang W. Eggert U.S. G protein-coupled receptors participate in cytokinesis.Cytoskeleton. 2012; 69: 810-818Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).

In the murine kidney, ORs and olfactory signaling proteins control the glomerular filtration rate, renin secretion, and blood pressure (15Pluznick J.L. Protzko R.J. Gevorgyan H. Peterlin Z. Sipos A.

A synthetic sandalwood compound was shown to accelerate wound healing processes by activation of OR2AT4 expressed in human keratinocytes (17Busse D. Kudella P. Grüning N.M. Gisselmann G. Ständer S.

In contrast to olfactory neurons, where activation of the receptors elicits a receptor current, activation of ectopically expressed receptors can have diverse effects. ORs are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which can couple to different intracellular signaling cascades depending on the activation of different types of heterotrimeric G-proteins (18Luttrell L.M. Transmembrane signaling by G protein-coupled receptors.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 332: 3-49PubMed Google Scholar), the interaction with other cellular partners such as arrestins (19Defea K.

Regulation of GPCRs by endocytic membrane trafficking and its potential implications.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). GPCRs, which are activated by chemical ligands such as small amines, peptide hormones, chemokines, and odorants, can elicit a huge variety of cellular responses, among them cell shape changes and altered adhesion (24Cotton M. Claing A. G protein-coupled receptors stimulation and the control of cell migration.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as well as changes in cell proliferation (25New D.C. Wong Y.H. Molecular mechanisms mediating the G protein-coupled receptor regulation of cell cycle progression.J. Mol. Signal. 2007; 2: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study we functionally characterized the signaling pathway and the implication of activation of OR51E2 in human melanocytes. We found that OR activation in these cells elicits Ca2+ signals and ultimately regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation, similar to that observed previously in prostate epithelial cells (11Neuhaus E.M.

Hana3a cells were maintained under standard conditions in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin and 2 mm l-glutamine. Hana3a cells were transiently transfected (3 μg of OR cDNA per dish) in 35-mm dishes (Falcon, BD Bioscience) using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Primary neonatal normal human epidermal melanocytes were a generous gift from Dr. G. Neufang (Beiersdorf, Hamburg, Germany). Melanocytes were maintained under standard conditions in melanocyte growth medium (Cell Systems, St. Katharinen, Germany). For siRNA experiments, melanocytes were transiently transfected with either targeted or scrambled siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to manufacturers' instructions. The transfection rates were <1% with both OR51E2 siRNA and control siRNA as detected by co-expression of GFP. Cells were analyzed in Ca2+ imaging experiments 2 days after transfection. The following primary antibodies were used: (a) rabbit polyclonal antibody against OR51E2 (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium); (b) mouse polyclonal antibody against human EEA-1 (Abcam); (c) rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human p44/42 MAPK and against human p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); (d) rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human-phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK and against human phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling); (e) mouse monoclonal antibody against glycerinaldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Abcam); (f) mouse monoclonal antibody against human tyrosinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX); (g) mouse monoclonal antibody against rhodopsin, 4D2 (Abcam); (h) rabbit monoclonal against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Abcam); (i) mouse monoclonal alkaline phosphatase-coupled antibody against digoxin (Sigma); (j) secondary goat-anti-rabbit and goat-anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to HRP (Bio-Rad); (k) secondary goat-anti-rabbit and goat-anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 or Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies). 80% confluent cells were harvested by scraping, and proteins were prepared by standard methods. Sample aliquots of fractionated melanocytes were mixed with Laemmli buffer (30% glycerol, 3% SDS, 125 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8), resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protan, Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma), blocked with TBST (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dried milk (Bio-Rad), and incubated with the primary antibody diluted in 3% dry milk in TBST. After washing and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, detection was performed with ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences) and the Fusion-SL image acquisition system (Vilber Lourmat Deutschland GmbH, Eberhardzell, Germany). Signal intensities were quantified using ImageJ (v1.4.3.67, Broken Symmetry Software). Biotinylation and isolation of cell surface proteins for Western blotting analysis were performed using the Thermo ScientificTM PierceTM Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Melanocytes were incubated for 45 min, and Hana3a cells were incubated for 30 min in loading buffer, pH 7.4, containing Ringers' solution and 7.5 μm Fura-2-AM (Life Technologies). After removal of extracellular Fura-2 by washing, ratiofluorometric Ca2+ imaging was performed using an inverted microscope equipped for ratiometric live cell imaging (IX71, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) with a 150-watt xenon arc lamp, a motorized fast change filter wheel illumination system for multiwavelength excitation (MT20, Olympus), and a 12-bit 1376 × 1032-pixel charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (F-View II, Olympus). WinNT-based cellRTM imaging software (Olympus) served to collect and quantify spatiotemporal Ca2+-dependent fluorescence signals (excited at 340 and 380 nm, measured at 510 nm, and calculated as a f340/f380 intensity ratio) of the cells. Compounds were diluted in Ringer's solution or for Ca2+free experiments in Ringer's solution containing 50 μm EGTA and applied using a specialized pressure-driven microcapillary perfusion system designed for instantaneous solution change and focal application. Images were acquired in randomly selected fields of view. Ultrapure α-ionone and β-ionone were a generous gift of Dr. J. Panten (Symrise, Holzminden, Germany). Steroids were purchased from Steraloids (Steraloids Inc., Newport, RI), aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), SKF 96365, GdCl3, and BTP2 were from Tocris (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), and endothelin-1, thapsigargin, and ATP were from Sigma. Odorants were prediluted in DMSO (Sigma) so that the DMSO concentration did not exceed 1‰ (v/v), which was well tolerated by melanocytes. All odorants assayed for potential inhibition of OR51E2 were tested in at least three different series of transfection experiments. Cells were seeded on coverslips and maintained as described above. The cells were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. After blocking with 1% gelatin for 1 h, cells were incubated overnight with the primary antibody. For visualization, secondary fluorescent IgGs (Life Technologies) (1:1000) were used. Micrographs were taken by using a LSM510 Meta confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). 50–70% confluent melanocytes were stimulated for 72 h with different concentrations of β-ionone or solvent only. Apoptotic activity was detected by Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Apoptotic cells were quantified using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) based In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Hoffmann-La Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Growing melanocytes were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well. After 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, cells were treated with different concentrations of β-ionone. Cell proliferation was assessed after 6 days using CyQUANT cell proliferation assay kit (Life Technologies). For the visualization of proliferating cells via PCNA staining, cells were stimulated for 6 days with β-ionone (50 μm) or solvent only. Afterward, cells were stained with anti-PCNA antibody (1:500) as described under “Immunocytochemistry” and with Alexa Fluor® 546 phalloidin (Life Technologies; 1:200). Prostate-specific G-protein-coupled receptor targeted and scrambled hairpin siRNA designs were carried out with siRNA Target Designer-Version 1.51 (Promega) as described previously (11Neuhaus E.M.

Chem. 2009; 284: 16218-16225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The best working siRNA sequence of OR51E2 was gctgcctcctgtcatcaat; the oligonucleotide sequences to generate 5′-target-loop-reverse-complement-3′ hairpins were: 5′tctcgtgcctctgtcatcaataagttctctattcatcacaggaggcagcct-3′, 5′-ctgcaggctgcctcctgtcatcaatagagaacttattcatgacaggaggcagc-3′. The following scrambled versions of the siRNA sequence were used as control: 5′-tctcgtacactgaccccctttgtaagttctctacaaagggggtcagtgtacct-3′, 5′-ctgcaggtacactgacccccttctagagaacttacaaagggggtcagtgtac-3′. RNA of melanocytes was isolated with the RNeasy Mini kit including on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturers' instruction. RNA concentration and quality (A260/A280 ratio) were analyzed using Spectrophotometer NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNA synthesis and semiquantitative RT-PCR cDNA synthesis was performed by using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Control reactions with no reverse transcriptase (−RT) served to exclude contamination with genomic DNA. RT-PCR was performed using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) with 2 ng of template cDNA and 10 pmol of specific primers designed for OR amplification. The amplifications were done for 40 cycles (45°s, 94 °C; 45 s, 60 °C; 45 s, 72 °C). Primers used for RT-PCR were: actin 5′-tcttccagccttccttcctg-3′ and 5′-cacggagtacttgcgctcag-3′; Tyr-P1 5′-ggcccgggctcaattcccaa-3′ and 5′-gcaagggccagacctcccga-3′; OR1J2 5′gaacaccatcccccatgtct-3′ and 5′-tggatccctttggttgaagg-3′; OR2D2 5′-agtgcgcccttcttgcagtga-3′ and 5′-actgcctcggtagggtagcct-3′; OR4N5 5′-ctgcacttgcctttctgtgg-3′ and 5′-atatgggtggtgcatgtgga-3′; OR5C1 5′-ctatgtcgcagcgtctatgc-3′ and 5′-gcagtggagggatatcgcag-3′; OR6K3 5′-gaggggatcttgctgaccac-3′ and 5′-aggcttagcacagggaccaa-3′; OR6T1 5′-ttccccagtagccacctcat-3′ and 5′-caagcatcttgggaaccaca-3′; OR9G1 5′-ctggctgcctgtgtcagttc-3′ and 5′-accagcaatgcacacagctt-3′; OR10A4 5′-agcttctcagccctgtccac-3′ and 5′-gggcacaatgaccaagttga-3′; OR10H5 5′-gctcactgtcatgggctacg-3′ and 5′-ccaccaccagcacatcatct-3′; OR11H4 5′-gacccatgaacaggtcagca-3′ and 5′-aggcaaaatttcccagcaga-3′; OR51E2 5′-actg-ccttccaagtcagagc-3′ and 5′-cttgcctcccacagcctg-3′; OR2A4/7 5′-ggtgccccggatgctggtg-3′ and 5′-ggggtggcagatggccacg-3′; OR51B5 5′-caatggcaccctccttcttc-3′ and 5′-caagcagaatgccagactcg-3′; OR5P3 5′-tggtagagtttactcttttggggt-3′ and 5′-tgagcatgacaggtgtgact-3′; OR6B3 5′-cagctccctggtgtgcaccg-3′ and 5′-caccagctggaggcacagcc-3′; OR10AD1 5′-actgcctggttctttgggctga-3′ and 5′-gccaatcactatgggggcctca-3′; OR51E2 (intron-overspanning) 5′-cctcagccttctgagtcagc-3′ and 5′-gagactgtgacaa-gccctgg-3′. Semiquantitative real-time PCR was performed using GoTaq® qPCR Master Mix (Promega) with the Mastercycler Realplex2 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) (20 μl total volume; 40 cycles of 95 °C, 60 °C and 72 °C at 45 s each). All experiments were conducted in triplicate. PCR was performed with cDNA (equivalent of 100 ng total RNA) and specific primer pairs for the amplification of tyrosinase and GAPDH. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was used for relative quantification by the ΔCt (cycle threshold) method. Results are reported as -fold changes in gene expression compared with control as calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. The following primer pairs were used: tyrosinase (1) 5′-ggctgttttgtactgcctgc-3′ and 5′-aggaacctctgcctgaaagc-3′; tyrosinase(2) 5′-cttcacaggggtggatgacc-3′ and 5′-tctctgtgcagtttggtccc-3′; GAPDH 5′-accacagtccatgccatcac-3′ and 5′-tcccaccaccctgttgctgta-3′. cAMP concentration was analyzed using a cAMP kit from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MI). In brief, 7 × 104 melanocytes were stimulated with growth medium containing odorant or forskolin and 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) as cAMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Afterward, the cells were lysed in 0.1 m HCl in ice-cold ethanol. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells lysates were desiccated for 5 h at 37 °C. Samples were reconstituted in 400 μl of 0.1 m HCl. Sample volumes of 100 μl per well were transferred to a microtiter plate, and cAMP concentrations per well were measured according to the manufacturers' instructions with the following minor changes. To exclude differences in anti-cAMP antibody binding efficiency, all samples and standards were adjusted to identical ionic conditions; i.e. standards provided by the manufacturer in 10 mm HCl/ethanol were desiccated and reconstituted in 0.1 m HCl. For each tested condition and standard, three replicate experiments were performed, and results were averaged. Melanocytes were cultured for 72 h in basal medium containing β-ionone (50 μm), forskolin (20 μm), α-ionone (200 μm), H89 (10 μm), or the solvent only (0.1% DMSO). Melanin contents of stimulated melanocytes were measured according to the method of Oka et al. (26Oka M. Ichihashi M. Chakraborty A.K. Enhanced expression of protein kinase C subspecies in melanogenic compartments in B16 melanoma cells by UVB or MSH.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After stimulation, cells were harvested by scraping, and cell numbers were counted using a counting chamber (Blaubrand Neubauer improved, Sigma). To take the anti-proliferative effect of β-ionone into account, cell numbers were adjusted to 1 × 105 before determination of the melanin content. Cell pellets were solubilized in boiling 1 m NaOH for 10 min. Spectrophotometric analysis of melanin content was performed at 400 nm absorbance. Melanocytes were cultured for 6 days in basal medium containing β-ionone (50 μm), forskolin (20 μm), or the solvent only (0.1% DMSO). Cell morphology was checked by bright field microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope with 20× magnification. Undifferentiated (bipolar morphology, small cell bodies, less pigmentation) and differentiated melanocytes (multiple dendrite, large cell body, high pigmentation) were quantified. FITC-labeled steroids were obtained by chemical synthesis from dihydrotestosterone and dehydrotestosterone. In brief, the 17-β-OH group of the respective steroid was activated by acylation with carbonyldiimidazole (27Staab H. Transacylierungen I: N-Acyl-Verbindungen stickstoffhaltiger heterozyklen.Chem.

The resulting monoimidazolide was treated with excess 4,7,10-trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine in acetonitrile followed by evaporation and washing with aqueous NaHCO3. Treatment of the resulting primary amine intermediate with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate in DMF in the presence of Hünig's base (iPr2NEt) provided the fluorescently labeled steroid ligands. The final products were purified to homogeneity by using preparative HPLC and obtained as orange powders after lyophilization in 12–50% overall yield. Details of synthesis procedures and characterization data for all new compounds α (m.p., high resolution mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C NMR, IR) was described in the following section. All solvents, when not purchased in suitable purity or dryness, were distilled using standard methods. Alternatively, solvents (HPLC grade) were passed through activated alumina columns under dry argon atmosphere (solvent purification system, M. Braun Inertgas-Systeme GmbH, Garching, Germany). Deionized water was used for all experiments. All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Acros, Novabiochem, Sigma) and used without purification. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck precoated silica gel plates (60F-254) using ultraviolet light irradiation at 254 nm or phosphomolybdic acid solution as staining reagent (1 wt% in EtOH). Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (J. T. Baker, particle size 40 μm; pore size 60 Å) under a pressure of 0.3–0.5 bar. Analytical HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1100 system using a C18 gravity 3-μm reverse phase column (Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany). The separations were started at 10% MeCN (with 0.1% HCOOH) in H2O (with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) with a flow of 1 ml/min, and the MeCN proportion was linearly increased after 1 min to 100% over a period of 10 min and then kept at constant ratio for a period of 5 min. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian system using a C18 gravity 5-μm reversed phase column (Macherey & Nagel) using a MeCN in H2O gradient. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury VX 400 (400.1 MHz (1H) and 100.6 MHz (13C)) spectrometer. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (ppm), and the spectra were calibrated to residual solvent signals of CDCl3 (7.26 ppm (1H) and 77.0 ppm (13C)), CD3OD (3.31 ppm (1H), and 49.0 ppm (13C)), respectively. Coupling constants are given in Hertz (Hz), and the following notations indicate the multiplicity of the signals: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), qui (quintet), sext (sextet), sept (septet), m (multiplet), app (apparent), br (broad signal). Unless otherwise stated, NMR spectra were recorded at 27 °C. Low resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ ESI spectrometer (source voltage 70 keV). High resolution FAB (fast atom bombardment) spectra were recorded on a Jeol SX 102 A (matrix: meta-nitrobenzyl alcohol). High resolution electrospray ionization spectra were recorded on a Thermo Electron LTQ Orbitrap (source voltage 3.8 kV, resolution: 60000) spectrometer. Dihydrotestosterone-derived imidazolide (7): Dihydrotestosterone (3, 300 mg, 1.00 mmol) and carbonyl diimidazole (330 mg, 2.00 mmol) were dissolved in THF (15 ml) and stirred overnight at room temperature. After the disappearance of dihydrotestosterone on TLC (Rf = 0.4, EtOAc/hexanes 1:1), the solvent was evaporated. The residue was partitioned with ethyl acetate (50 ml) and water (20 ml). The layers were separated, and the organic extract was washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution and brine (20 ml each), dried with MgSO4, and evaporated to obtain imidazolide 7 a colorless solid (350 mg). The crude product was purified by Flash column chromatography (EtOAc/hexanes 1:9 → 1:2) to obtain the title compound as a colorless solid (280 mg, yield 73%). TLC: Rf = 0.25 (EtOAc/hexanes 1:1).

https://openalex.org/W2492545900,"Inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are associated with many neurological diseases. ER stress is brought on by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, which leads to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved pathway that transmits signals to restore homeostasis or eliminate the irreparably damaged cell. We provide evidence that inhibition or genetic haploinsufficiency of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) can selectively control inflammation brought on by ER stress without impinging on UPR-dependent survival and adaptive responses or normal immune responses. Using astrocytes lacking one or both alleles of PERK or the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, we demonstrate that PERK haploinsufficiency or partial inhibition led to reduced ER stress-induced inflammation (IL-6, CCL2, and CCL20 expression) without compromising prosurvival responses. In contrast, complete loss of PERK blocked canonical PERK-dependent UPR genes and promoted apoptosis. Reversal of eIF2α-mediated translational repression using ISRIB potently suppressed PERK-dependent inflammatory gene expression, indicating that the selective modulation of inflammatory gene expression by PERK inhibition may be linked to attenuation of eIF2α phosphorylation and reveals a previously unknown link between translational repression and transcription of inflammatory genes. Additionally, ER-stressed astrocytes can drive an inflammatory M1-like phenotype in microglia, and this can be attenuated with inhibition of PERK. Importantly, targeting PERK neither disrupted normal cytokine signaling in astrocytes or microglia nor impaired macrophage phagocytosis or T cell polarization. Collectively, this work suggests that targeting PERK may provide a means for selective immunoregulation in the context of ER stress without disrupting normal immune function.

Collectively, this work suggests that targeting PERK may provide a means for selective immunoregulation in the context of ER stress without disrupting normal immune function. Normal inflammatory responses are transient, protective, and essential to overall health. However, chronic inflammation is associated with a multitude of common maladies, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Left unchecked, inflammation can cause cellular dysfunction and tissue damage from the prolonged production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and proteases, among others, potentially exacerbating the disease state (1Medzhitov R. Origin and physiological roles of inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3887) Google Scholar). Broadly targeting inflammatory processes with drugs such as glucocorticoids can be difficult in chronic conditions because of serious side effects (2Coutinho A.E. Chapman K.E. The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids, recent developments and mechanistic insights.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2011; 335: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) and may impair normal inflammatory processes that are essential for tissue repair and resolution (3Buckley C.D.

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 10141-10155Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The delicate balance between beneficial and detrimental inflammation is of profound importance in the CNS, where damage can have dire and long-lasting effects. Within the CNS, glial cells, particularly astrocytes and microglia, have a key role in controlling the inflammatory environment (5Ransohoff R.M. Brown M.A. Innate immunity in the central nervous system.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 1164-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 6Burda J.E. Sofroniew M.V. Reactive gliosis and the multicellular response to CNS damage and disease.Neuron. 2014; 81: 229-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Glial cells are in an inflammatory (gliotic) state in most neurological diseases. As with peripheral inflammatory responses, gliosis, when properly executed and resolved, is protective and promotes homeostasis (7Verkhratsky A. Parpura V. Pekna M. Pekny M. Sofroniew M. Glia in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2014; 42: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, chronic glia-derived inflammation may contribute to neurodegeneration (8Heneka M.T. Kummer M.P. Latz E. Innate immune activation in neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 463-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Conversely, a reduction of immunological function and surveillance in the CNS can be equally disruptive and may worsen injuries, impair cognitive function, and contribute to neurological diseases (9Bush T.G. Puvanachandra N. Horner C.H. Polito A. Ostenfeld T. Svendsen C.N. Mucke L. Johnson M.H. Sofroniew M.V.

Thus, a major challenge is to identify processes driving chronic damaging inflammation that can be targeted without disruption of normal beneficial immune function. Cell and tissue damage can elicit an inflammatory response (11Chen G.Y. Nuñez G. Sterile inflammation: sensing and reacting to damage.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). In neurodegenerative diseases, cells are likely damaged through several processes, including the accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumUPRunfolded protein responsePERKprotein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinaseATFactivating transcription factorOSMOncostatin MqPCRquantitative PCRthapsthapsigargintunictunicamycinCHOPC/EBP homologous proteinC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. stress (12Hetz C. Mollereau B. Disturbance of endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a homeostatic response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. The UPR is mediated by trans-ER membrane proteins that include PERK, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor (ATF) 6. This response promotes reduced protein synthesis through PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and selective up-regulation of transcriptional regulators and molecular chaperones to restore homeostasis (13Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar). Apoptotic pathways are also readied should the adaptive response fail. In addition to intracellular signaling in response to ER stress, there is also extracellular communication via cytokine and chemokine production (14Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. From endoplasmic-reticulum stress to the inflammatory response.Nature. 2008; 454: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). The ER stress pathway is coupled to inflammatory responses through activation of key signaling networks such as NF-κB and JAK/STAT, leading to the production of cytokines, chemokines, and reactive species (15Kitamura M. Control of NF-κB and inflammation by the unfolded protein response.Int. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 30: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Meares G.P. Liu Y. Rajbhandari R. Qin H. Nozell S.E. Mobley J.A. Corbett J.A. Benveniste E.N. PERK-dependent activation of JAK1 and STAT3 contributes to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced inflammation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 34: 3911-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In chronic diseases, ER stress and inflammation may collaborate to drive sustained inflammation (14Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. From endoplasmic-reticulum stress to the inflammatory response.Nature. 2008; 454: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). By targeting ER stress signaling, it may be possible to break this cycle. PERK is a particularly attractive target because it is a key player in ER stress-induced inflammation, and disruption of PERK has been shown to be beneficial in mouse models of Alzheimer disease and prion disease (17Ma T. Trinh M.A. Wexler A.J. Bourbon C. Gatti E. Pierre P. Cavener D.R. Klann E. Suppression of eIF2α kinases alleviates Alzheimer's disease-related plasticity and memory deficits.Nat.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ER stress-induced inflammation could be selectively regulated without disrupting normal inflammatory responses. We modulated ER stress signaling by disrupting PERK function genetically or pharmacologically with the small-molecule PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 (19Axten J.M. Medina J.R. Feng Y. Shu A. Romeril S.P.

Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 7193-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) to demonstrate that an intermediate level of PERK activity greatly reduces inflammatory responses without compromising ER stress-induced adaptive responses or normal immunological function. Overall, this study provides in vitro proof of concept for PERK as a selective immunoregulatory target. PERK has emerged as a critical signaling node linking ER stress and inflammation (14Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. From endoplasmic-reticulum stress to the inflammatory response.Nature. 2008; 454: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar, 20Martinon F. Glimcher L.H. Regulation of innate immunity by signaling pathways emerging from the endoplasmic reticulum.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2011; 23: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, ER stress drives the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6 and CCL2, and the ER stress-selective transcription factor CHOP (Fig. 1A). To verify the importance of PERK in driving inflammatory responses, we isolated primary astrocytes from wild-type, PERK heterozygous (+/−), and PERK knock-out (−/−) embryos and induced ER stress in these cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, wild-type and PERK+/− cells responded to ER stress with increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and STAT3. However, as expected, eIF2α phosphorylation was reduced in PERK+/− cells and absent in PERK−/− cells. STAT3 phosphorylation was not reduced in PERK+/− cells and was attenuated in PERK−/− cells. Wild-type astrocytes increased IL-6, CCL2, and CCL20 in response to ER stress, and this was reduced in PERK+/− astrocytes and abolished in PERK−/− cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, PERK haploinsufficiency did not reduce ER stress-induced expression of the prototypical UPR genes CHOP, ATF4, and GRP78. In PERK−/− cells, induction of CHOP and ATF4 was blocked, whereas up-regulation of GRP78, which is ATF6-dependent (21Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Identification of the cis-acting endoplasmic reticulum stress response element responsible for transcriptional induction of mammalian glucose-regulated proteins: involvement of basic leucine zipper transcription factors.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), remained unaffected (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that, with partial loss of PERK, cells are still able to mount an adaptive survival response, albeit with reduced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. Consistent with this, wild type and PERK+/− cells exposed to ER stress for 24 h showed little apoptosis, as measured by caspase 3 cleavage, whereas PERK−/− had a marked increase in cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 1D). To validate these findings, we used an additional genetic approach to acutely knock out PERK. PERK floxed (fl/fl) mice (22Zhang P. McGrath B. Li S. Frank A. Zambito F. Reinert J. Gannon M. Ma K. McNaughton K. Cavener D.R. The PERK eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α kinase is required for the development of the skeletal system, postnatal growth, and the function and viability of the pancreas.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3864-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) were crossed with the global tamoxifen-inducible cre line, CAGG-CreERTM. Astrocytes were isolated from littermates and treated for 24 h with 4-hydroxytamoxifen to delete one or both alleles of PERK. Seventy-two hours after removal of tamoxifen, astrocytes were treated with thapsigargin. As shown in Fig. 2A, PERK expression and eIF2a phosphorylation were modestly reduced in CreERTM-positive PERKfl/wt astrocytes and absent in CreERTM-positive PERKfl/fl cells. Consistent with the previous data, deletion of one PERK allele reduced ER stress-induced IL-6 expression but not CHOP or ATF4. Deletion of both PERK alleles abrogated IL-6, CHOP, and ATF4 expression (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that, although PERK is essential for survival during ER stress, an intermediate level of PERK will suffice. From these data, we hypothesized that it may be possible to target PERK with partial inhibition as a means to control ER stress-induced inflammation without disrupting adaptive responses to ER stress or normal immunological function.FIGURE 2Inducible deletion of PERK regulates ER stress-induced gene expression. A, astrocytes were isolated from PERKfl/fl, PERKfl/wt × CAGG-CreERTM and PERKfl/fl × CAGG-CreERTM littermates. Astrocytes were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (1 μm) for 24 h to delete the floxed PERK alleles in the Cre-expressing cells. Seventy-two hours after removal of the tamoxifen, cells were treated with thaps (1 μm) for the indicated times, followed by immunoblotting. B, astrocytes were isolated and treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen as in A and then treated with thaps (1 μm) for 4 h, followed by qPCR analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test this hypothesis, we used the small-molecule inhibitor of PERK GSK2606414. As shown in Fig. 3A, 0.1 μm GSK2606414 partially inhibited, by ∼50%, thapsigargin-induced eIF2α phosphorylation at 30 min, indicating partial inhibition of PERK. By 4 h, the inhibitory effect of GSK2606414 was still apparent, although diminished. This level of inhibition led to a minor (∼20%) decrease in ATF4 protein expression and did not inhibit the low level of CHOP expression (Fig. 3B). However, it was effective at blocking ER stress-induced IL-6, CCL2, and CCL20 but not CHOP, ATF4, and GRP78 mRNA (Fig. 3C), similar to that observed in PERK+/− cells. Only at high concentrations (1 μm) was GSK2606414 able to block CHOP and ATF4 mRNA expression (Fig. 3C), similar to that observed in PERK−/− cells. GSK2606414 also significantly inhibited ER stress-induced IL-6 and CCL2 protein after 24 h, as measured by ELISA (Fig. 3D). At this time point, GSK2606414 was no longer effective at inhibiting eIF2α phosphorylation but, at high concentrations, did prevent ATF4 and CHOP expression (Fig. 3E). To extend these findings, we examined the inhibitory effect of GSK2606414 on ER stress-induced cytokine and chemokine expression by multiplex ELISA. In addition to the significant inhibition of IL-6 and CCL2, we also observed inhibition of ER stress-induced CXCL10, CXCL1, and CXCL2 (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that modest PERK inhibition can reduce some inflammatory molecules stimulated by ER stress.FIGURE 4PERK-dependent regulation of cytokines and chemokines.

Immunol. 2012; 189: 4630-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To test whether PERK inhibition could modulate this effect, astrocytes were treated with the cytokines IL-1β, OSM, or IFN-γ individually or in the presence of thapsigargin. ER stress enhanced the expression of IL-6 in response to IL-1β, OSM, and IFN-γ (Fig. 5A) and, similarly, enhanced the expression of CCL2 in response to IFN-γ and OSM (Fig. 5B). Cytokines did not affect thapsigargin-induced CHOP expression (data not shown). To determine whether the enhanced inflammatory gene expression was sensitive to PERK inhibition, astrocytes were treated with cytokines and thapsigargin in the absence or presence of the PERK inhibitor. GSK2606414 did not affect gene expression induced by cytokines alone but did attenuate the enhancement by ER stress (Fig. 5, A and B). Additionally, ER stress did not enhance, but instead suppressed, IFN-γ-induced TNFα expression, and this was unaffected by PERK inhibition (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that PERK is dispensable in canonical cytokine signaling and that PERK inhibition can block ER stress-induced augmentation of cytokine-mediated gene expression. Our previous work demonstrated that ER stress-induced IL-6 and CCL2 in astrocytes is dependent on JAK1 (16Meares G.P. Liu Y. Rajbhandari R. Qin H. Nozell S.E. Mobley J.A. Corbett J.A. Benveniste E.N. PERK-dependent activation of JAK1 and STAT3 contributes to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced inflammation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 34: 3911-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, our data showing that deletion of one PERK allele attenuates IL-6 and CCL2 but does not reduce STAT3 phosphorylation suggests that additional mechanisms contribute to the sensitivity of these genes to PERK inhibition. Many of the PERK-mediated effects are dependent on eIF2α phosphorylation and subsequent expression of ATF4 (25Wek R.C. Cavener D.R. Translational control and the unfolded protein response.Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2007; 9: 2357-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the eIF2α-induced translational inhibition was involved in the regulation of these inflammatory genes using the recently described compound ISRIB (26Sidrauski C. Acosta-Alvear D. Khoutorsky A. Vedantham P. Hearn B.R. Li H. Gamache K. Gallagher C.M. Ang K.K. Wilson C. Okreglak V. Ashkenazi A. Hann B. Nader K. Arkin M.R. et al.Pharmacological brake-release of mRNA translation enhances cognitive memory.eLife. 2013; 2: e00498Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This compound reverses the translational block brought on by phosphorylation of eIF2α through an agonistic effect on EIF2B (27Sidrauski C. Tsai J.C. Kampmann M. Hearn B.R. Vedantham P. Jaishankar P. Sokabe M. Mendez A.S. Newton B.W. Tang E.L. Verschueren E. Johnson J.R. Krogan N.J. Fraser C.S. Weissman J.S. et al.Pharmacological dimerization and activation of the exchange factor eIF2B antagonizes the integrated stress response.eLife. 2015; 4: e07314Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As expected, ISRIB suppressed thapsigargin-induced ATF4 protein expression, had no effect on ATF4 mRNA, and modestly reduced CHOP mRNA (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, this highlights that PERK controls ATF4 at two levels through distinct mechanisms. ATF4 protein is dependent on eIF2α-induced translational inhibition, whereas ATF4 mRNA is PERK-dependent but independent of eIF2α. These data are consistent with data showing that PERK-NRF2 signaling drives ATF4 transcription (28Afonyushkin T. Oskolkova O.V. Philippova M. Resink T.J. Erne P. Binder B.R. Bochkov V.N. Oxidized phospholipids regulate expression of ATF4 and VEGF in endothelial cells via NRF2-dependent mechanism: novel point of convergence between electrophilic and unfolded protein stress pathways.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Concomitant with suppression of ATF4 protein, ISRIB potently suppressed thapsigargin-induced IL-6, CCL2, and CCL20 expression (Fig. 6B). This suggests that ER stress-induced inhibition of translation promotes transcription of inflammatory molecules such as IL-6, CCL2, and CCL20. Importantly ISRIB does not broadly block inflammatory gene expression, as it had no effect on cytokine-induced IL-6 or CCL2 expression (data not shown). To test whether ATF4 connects translational repression to inflammatory gene expression, we used siRNA to knock down ATF4. As shown in Fig. 6C, ATF4 expression is reduced, and thapsigargin-induced expression of the ATF4 target gene tribbles 3 (Trib3) (29Han J. Back S.H. Hur J. Lin Y.-H. Gildersleeve R. Shan J. Yuan C.L. Krokowski D. Wang S. Hatzoglou M. Kilberg M.S. Sartor M.A. Kaufman R.J. ER-stress-induced transcriptional regulation increases protein synthesis leading to cell death.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) is abrogated by ATF4 siRNA. This confirms functional silencing of ATF4. Knockdown of ATF4 did not inhibit thapsigargin-induced IL-6 and partially reduced CCL2 expression (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these data indicate that the eIF2α-induced translational block is essential for inflammatory gene expression but is largely independent of ATF4. We previously demonstrated that PERK-dependent communication between ER-stressed astrocytes and naïve microglia resulted in the activation of microglia (16Meares G.P. Liu Y. Rajbhandari R. Qin H. Nozell S.E. Mobley J.A. Corbett J.A. Benveniste E.N. PERK-dependent activation of JAK1 and STAT3 contributes to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced inflammation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 34: 3911-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether PERK inhibition could also modulate astrocyte-microglia interactions. Astrocytes were treated transiently (2 h) with thapsigargin in the absence or presence of GSK2606414, washed thoroughly to remove the thapsigargin, and cultured in fresh medium with or without GSK2606414. Following the addition of fresh medium, primary microglia were added in a Transwell (Fig. 7A). The microglia were cultured with astrocytes for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 7B, astrocytes under ER stress promoted a proinflammatory M1-like phenotype in microglia that included down-regulation of the M2 markers arginase, CD206, and IGF1 and up-regulation of inflammatory genes, including IL-1β, TNFα, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), and IL-12p40. PERK inhibition had no effect on the down-regulation of M2 markers but did reduce the levels of IL-1β, TNFα, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase. The expression of IL-12p40 was unaffected by PERK inhibition (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that ER-stressed astrocytes promote a proinflammatory phenotype in microglia and that this can be attenuated by inhibiting PERK. A major challenge in managing inflammation is to suppress chronic, pathological inflammation while leaving normal beneficial immunological functions intact. Our observation that PERK inhibition suppresses ER stress-induced inflammatory gene expression but not cytokine-induced gene expression (Fig. 5) suggests that targeting PERK may not disrupt normal immune function. To test this, we used several primary cell types to assess the immunological impact of PERK inhibition. Macrophage-mediated phagocytosis is a key component in innate immunity. Treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages for 24 h with GSK2606414 did not cause toxicity (data not shown) or impair phagocytosis (Fig. 8A). Next, we examined the inflammatory response in primary microglia to the bacterial component LPS. Similar to our findings with cytokines, LPS stimulated potent inflammatory gene expression that was not affected by PERK inhibition (Fig. 8B). Differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into various effector T cell subsets is paramount in establishing an appropriate adaptive immune response. As such, we tested whether PERK inhibition could alter CD4+ T cell polarization. T cells were cultured under Th1- or Th17-polarizing conditions in the absence or presence of GSK2606414 for 3 days. As shown in Fig. 8C, GSK2606414 had little effect on Th1 or Th17 polarization, as assessed by their hallmark cytokines IFN-γ and IL-17A, respectively. These data indicate that, although PERK inhibition can suppress inflammation under ER stress conditions, targeting PERK does not have a broad impact on overall immunological function. In line with these results, PERK has also been shown to be dispensable for B cell development and immunoglobulin secretion (30Gass J.N. Jiang H.-Y. Wek R.C. Brewer J.W.

Neurological diseases are a growing public health problem. Decades of research have greatly expanded our knowledge of neuroscience but have yet to lead to effective therapies, largely because of the complex nature of these diseases. We now appreciate that critical non-neuronal factors, such as neuroinflammation, are involved in neurological diseases. Specifically, inflammation is thought to contribute to the chronic non-resolving pathology common to neurodegenerative diseases (5Ransohoff R.M. Brown M.A. Innate immunity in the central nervous system.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 1164-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Selectively disrupting disease-driven inflammation while leaving normal immune function intact could provide a new therapeutic avenue. Unfortunately, targets to achieve such specificity are currently unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that small molecule inhibition or genetic haploinsufficiency of the UPR kinase PERK can selectively control inflammation brought on by ER stress without impinging on UPR-dependent survival and adaptive responses. In healthy tissue, an inflammatory response is"

It has been suggested that α-synuclein fibrils or intermediate protofibrils in the process of fibril formation may have a toxic effect on neuronal cells. In this study, we investigated the ability of soluble monomeric α-synuclein to promote microtubule assembly and the effects of conformational changes of α-synuclein on Tau-promoted microtubule assembly. In marked contrast to previous findings, monomeric α-synuclein had no effect on microtubule polymerization. However, both α-synuclein fibrils and protofibrils inhibited Tau-promoted microtubule assembly. The inhibitory effect of α-synuclein fibrils was greater than that of the protofibrils. Dot blot overlay assay and spin-down techniques revealed that α-synuclein fibrils bind to Tau and inhibit microtubule assembly by depleting the Tau available for microtubule polymerization. Using various deletion mutants of α-synuclein and Tau, the acidic C-terminal region of α-synuclein and the basic central region of Tau were identified as regions involved in the binding. Furthermore, introduction of α-synuclein fibrils into cultured cells overexpressing Tau protein induced Tau aggregation. These results raise the possibility that α-synuclein fibrils interact with Tau, inhibit its function to stabilize microtubules, and also promote Tau aggregation, leading to dysfunction of neuronal cells. α-Synuclein is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and of glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy.

To characterize the impact of widespread inventory management policies on stock-outs of essential drugs in Zambia’s health clinics and develop related recommendations.


Methods 
Daily clinic storeroom stock levels of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) products in 2009–2010 were captured in 145 facilities through photography and manual transcription of paper forms, then used to determine historical stock-out levels and estimate demand patterns. Delivery lead-times and estimates of monthly facility accessibility were obtained through worker surveys. A simulation model was constructed and validated for predictive accuracy against historical stock-outs, then used to evaluate various changes potentially affecting product availability.


Findings 
While almost no stock-outs of AL products were observed during Q4 2009 consistent with primary analysis, up to 30% of surveyed facilities stocked out of some AL product during Q1 2010 despite ample inventory being simultaneously available at the national warehouse. Simulation experiments closely reproduced these results and linked them to the use of average past monthly issues and failure to capture lead-time variability in current inventory control policies. Several inventory policy enhancements currently recommended by USAID | DELIVER were found to have limited impact on product availability.


Conclusions 
Inventory control policies widely recommended and used for distributing medicines in sub-Saharan Africa directly account for a substantial fraction of stock-outs observed in common situations involving demand seasonality and facility access interruptions. Developing central capabilities in peripheral demand forecasting and inventory control is critical. More rigorous independent peer-reviewed research on pharmaceutical supply chain management in low-income countries is needed."

The mobilization of distinct lipids by sPLA2s appears to rely not only on their intrinsic enzymatic properties, but also tissue- or disease-specific contexts such as the lipid composition of target membranes or the spatial and temporal availability of downstream lipid-editing enzymes (18Murakami M.

Lipid Res. 2015; 56: 1248-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which may account for why sPLA2s exert pro- or anti-inflammatory functions with different lipid mediator profiles in distinct settings. Group IID sPLA2 (sPLA2-IID) is preferentially and abundantly expressed in DCs in lymphoid organs (12Miki Y. Yamamoto K. Taketomi Y. Sato H. Shimo K. Kobayashi T. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Nakanishi H.

Med. 2013; 210: 1217-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting its regulatory role in acquired immunity. Indeed, a recent study using Pla2g2d−/− mice have revealed that sPLA2-IID alleviates a Th1-driven immune response in the elicitation phase of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) by decreasing the level of ω3 PUFAs and their metabolites such as DHA-derived resolvin D1 (RvD1) in draining lymph nodes (LNs) (12Miki Y.

Med. 2013; 210: 1217-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, sPLA2-IID prevents an anti-virus Th1 immune response by directing the anti-inflammatory PGD2-DP1 (PGD2 receptor) axis, which prevents DC migration and thereby enhances viral infection and associated lung inflammation (28Vijay R. Hua X. Meyerholz D.K. Miki Y. Yamamoto K. Gelb M. Murakami M. Perlman S.

Med. 2015; 212: 1851-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, administration of sPLA2-IID-Fc protein to mice attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis (29von Allmen C.E. Schmitz N. Bauer M. Hinton H.J. Kurrer M.O. Buser R.B. Gwerder M. Muntwiler S. Sparwasser T. Beerli R.R. Bachmann M.F. Secretory phospholipase A2-IID is an effector molecule of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11673-11678Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To extend our understanding of the biological functions of sPLA2-IID, we herein investigated the roles of this particular sPLA2 in several disease models, including contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and skin cancer using Pla2g2d-deficient (Pla2g2d−/−) and Pla2g2d-overexpressing transgenic (Pla2g2d-TG) mice. Our results point to a general role of sPLA2-IID as an immunosuppressive sPLA2 that alters the steady-state lipid balance toward an anti-inflammatory state, thereby providing significant impacts on inflammation and cancer. In a model of CHS, application of the hapten antigen dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) to abdominal skin (sensitization) followed by a second application of the same antigen to ear skin (elicitation) elicits Th1-driven ear swelling (13Sawada Y.

Med. 2015; 212: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that, in the elicitation phase of CHS, the resolution of a pro-inflammatory Th1 response in the skin and regional LNs is markedly delayed in Pla2g2d−/− mice (12Miki Y.

We therefore examined the effect of Pla2g2d ablation on acute inflammation in the sensitization phase of CHS, which is equivalent to irritant dermatitis, as a model system. Consistent with the view that Pla2g2d expression in DCs or macrophages is down-regulated after cell activation (12Miki Y. Yamamoto K. Taketomi Y. Sato H. Shimo K. Kobayashi T. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T.

However, we noticed that on day 0 (i.e. 5 days after DNFB treatment), LN expression of the inflammatory DC/macrophage markers Itgax (CD11c) and Itgam (CD11b) was significantly greater in Pla2g2d−/− mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice (Fig. 1C). When LN cells isolated from DNFB-treated mice were cultured ex vivo, Pla2g2d−/− cells produced more IFN-γ, a signature Th1 cytokine, than did Pla2g2d+/+ cells over 48 h (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that Pla2g2d deficiency results in exacerbation of the late stage of acute inflammation toward a Th1 response in skin-regional LNs, a tissue in which sPLA2-IID is abundantly expressed. Although Pla2g2d deficiency did not profoundly affect the increased (Ccl2 and Ccr5) or constitutive (Ccl19 and Ccr7) expression of DC/macrophage-attracting chemokines or chemokine receptors in the LNs on day 0, the expression of Crth2, which encodes the pro-inflammatory chemotactic PGD2 receptor CRTH2/DP2 (30Yamamoto Y.

The LN expression of Crth2 was much higher than that of Ptgdr (DP1), another PGD2 receptor that prevents DC migration (28Vijay R. Hua X. Meyerholz D.K. Miki Y. Yamamoto K. Gelb M. Murakami M.

In addition, the expression of Ptgds2, a major PGD2 synthase in the LNs, was greater in Pla2g2d−/− mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice (Fig. 1E). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of lipids in the regional LNs under the steady-state condition (i.e. on day −5) revealed that the levels of ω3 PUFAs and their oxygenated metabolites were markedly reduced in Pla2g2d−/− mice relative to Pla2g2d+/+ mice (Fig. 1F). Although the level of ω6 AA was also lower in Pla2g2d−/− mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice, the levels of AA metabolites (i.e. PGs) were barely affected by Pla2g2d deficiency. These lipid profiles are consistent with our previous study and imply again that sPLA2-IID is preferentially coupled with the production of ω3 PUFA metabolites, whereas PGs are mainly produced from an sPLA2-IID-independent AA pool, most likely through the action of cPLA2α (12Miki Y.

After 5 days of DNFB application (day 0), however, differences in the LN levels of PUFAs between the genotypes became smaller (Fig. 1G), and the RvD1 level in Pla2g2d+/+ LNs was markedly decreased to a level similar to that in Pla2g2d−/− LNs (Fig. 1H), being attributable, in part, to the down-regulation of Pla2g2d expression (Fig. 1A). Exceptionally, the LN level of PGD2, but not PGE2, was greatly increased in Pla2g2d−/− mice relative to Pla2g2d+/+ mice on day 0 (Fig. 1G), corroborating the increased expression of Ptgds2 in the null mice (Fig. 1E). Moreover, when LN cells from DNFB-treated mice on day 0 were stimulated with dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS; a water-soluble form of DNFB) for 24 h ex vivo, PGD2 production, which depends on cPLA2α (15Uozumi N.

These results suggest that the lack of sPLA2-IID exacerbates the late stage of LN inflammation in the process of irritant dermatitis with augmentation of the pro-inflammatory PGD2-CRTH2 axis and an immunological shift toward an increased Th1 immune response, which may be dependent on the steady-state reduction of ω3 PUFA metabolites. The marked decrease in the steady-state level of ω3 PUFA metabolites in Pla2g2d−/− LNs suggests that sPLA2-IID could also influence other types of immune response. To address this possibility, we next examined the effect of Pla2g2d ablation on psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) due to aberrant proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, scaling, erythematous plaque formation, and increased production of pro-inflammatory (e.g. TNFα) and Th17-type (e.g. IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-23) cytokines. In a model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis (33Tortola L. Rosenwald E. Abel B. Blumberg H. Schäfer M. Coyle A.J. Renauld J.C. Werner S. Kisielow J. Kopf M. Psoriasiform dermatitis is driven by IL-36-mediated DC-keratinocyte crosstalk.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 3965-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), repeated IMQ challenges to mouse ears elicit psoriasis-like acanthosis and dermal swelling with Th17-type immune responses (a schema of the procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2A). We found that IMQ-induced ear swelling and epidermal hyperplasia were significantly greater in Pla2g2d−/− mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice (Fig. 2, A–C). On day 6, the sPLA2-IID signal was colocalized in most, if not all, CD11c+MHC-II+ dermal DCs in the affected skin of WT mice (Fig. 2D). Quantitative RT-PCR of the skin and draining LNs revealed that the expression levels of Th17-related cytokines (Il17a and Il22) and chemokine (Ccl20) were substantially higher in IMQ-treated Pla2g2d−/− mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice (Fig. 2, E and F), implying an increased Th17-type immune response in null mice. However, in contrast to sPLA2-IIF, an epidermal sPLA2 whose gene ablation leads to perturbed keratinocyte differentiation and activation (24Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Murakami M. The role of group IIF-secreted phospholipase A2 in epidermal homeostasis and hyperplasia.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 1901-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Pla2g2d deficiency did not affect the expression of the keratinocyte differentiation marker Krt1 (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the anti-inflammatory aspect of sPLA2-IID (see above), LN expression of Pla2g2d in WT mice tended to decrease following IMQ treatment (Fig. 2F). Flow cytometry of IL-17A- or IL-22-expressing CD3ϵ+ T cells in the skin further supported the greater Th17 response in IMQ-treated and even IMQ-untreated Pla2g2d−/− mice than in replicate Pla2g2d+/+ mice (Fig. 2G). Lipidomics analysis of the affected skin revealed substantial reductions of DHA-derived metabolites such as RvD1 (7,8,17-trihydroxy-DHA) and RvD5 (7,17-dihydroxy-DHA) but not AA-derived eicosanoids such as PGE2 and PGD2 in Pla2g2d−/− mice relative to Pla2g2d+/+ mice (Fig. 2H). Thus, Pla2g2d deficiency leads to exacerbation of the Th17 immune response in psoriasis, accompanied by selective reduction of ω3 PUFA metabolites. To obtain additional evidence for the immunosuppressive function of sPLA2-IID, we generated Pla2g2d-overexpressing TG mice in accordance with the procedure depicted in Fig. 3A (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). An example of PCR genotyping is shown in Fig. 3B. As a result of the Cre/loxP reaction, the amplified fragment for the Pla2g2d transgene shifted from a 1,300-bp band (for silent LNL-Pla2g2d) to a 170-bp band (for active Pla2g2d). Pla2g2d expression in various tissues as well as in bone marrow-derived macrophages and DCs was markedly higher in Pla2g2d-TG mice than in control mice (Fig. 3C). In the LNs, the steady-state levels of ω3 PUFA metabolites were consistently (>2-fold) elevated in Pla2g2d-TG mice compared with WT mice, although the levels of some ω6 AA-derived metabolites also tended to be slightly higher in the TG mice (Fig. 3D). Pla2g2d-TG mice were born normally and were fertile, showing normal serum biochemical parameters over 6 months under normal housing conditions. We then subjected Pla2g2d-TG mice and littermate WT mice to the models of psoriasis (Fig. 4, A–F) and CHS (Fig. 4, G and H). In sharp contrast to Pla2g2d−/− mice (Fig. 2), IMQ-induced ear swelling was significantly ameliorated in Pla2g2d-TG mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4A). In both skin and LNs, Pla2g2d expression was markedly higher in Pla2g2d-TG mice than in WT mice, irrespective of IMQ challenge (Fig. 4B). The LN expression of Il17a and IL-22 was substantially lower in IMQ-treated Pla2g2d-TG mice than in replicate WT mice (Fig. 4C). This observation was further supported by flow cytometry, where the IMQ-induced increase in IL-17A- or IL-22-expressing CD3ϵ+ T cells was significantly reduced in"

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT conducted with hemoporfin and a 532 nm continuous wave laser to treat port-wine stain clinically. Patients and Methods This randomized clinical trial was conducted in eight hospitals in China. Participants were adolescent and adult patients (age range: 14–65 years old) with port-wine stain. During stage 1 (day 1 to week 8) all patients were randomized at a 3:1 ratio to treatment (532 nm laser irradiation (96–120 J/cm2) with hemoporfin (5mg/kg; PDT-hemoporfin, n = 330)) or placebo groups (irradiation with placebo (PDT-placebo, n = 110)); during stage 2 (week 8 to 16) patients in both groups were offered treatment. Clinician-evaluators, who were blind to the study, classified each case on the following four-level scale according to assessment of before and after standardized pictures of the lesion area: no improvement: <20%; some improvement: 20–59%; great improvement: 60–89%; or nearly completely resolved: ≥90%. The primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients achieving at least some improvement at week 8. The secondary efficacy endpoints were proportion of patients achieving nearly completely resolved or at least great improvement at week 8, proportion of patients achieving early completely resolved, at least great improvement, or at least some improvement at week 16, and the corresponding satisfaction of the investigators and the patients (designated as ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘moderate’, or ‘ineffective’) at weeks 8 and 16. Results Compared to the PDT-placebo group, the PDT-hemoporfin group showed a significantly higher proportion of patients that achieved at least some improvement (89.7% [n = 295; 95% CI, 85.9%-92.5%] vs. 24.5% [n = 27; 95% CI, 17.4%-33.3%]) at week 8 (P < 0.0001) and higher improvements for all secondary efficacy endpoints. Treatment reactions occurred in 99.5% (n = 731; 95% CI, 98.7%-99.8%) of the PDT-hemoporfin treatments (n = 735). Hyperpigmentation occurred in 22.9 per 100 patient-treatments (n = 168; 95% CI, 20.0–26.0) in the PDT-hemoporfin treated patients. Conclusions Hemoporfin-mediated PDT is an effective and safe treatment option for adolescent and adult patients with port-wine stain.

The efficacy of acupuncture for PD remains unclear, largely due to methodological flaws and lack of studies using objective outcome measures.To objectively assess the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) for gait disorders using body-worn sensor technology in patients with PD.In this randomized pilot study, both the patients and assessors were masked. Fifteen PD patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 10) or to a control group (n = 5). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after completion of three weekly EA treatments. Measurements included gait analysis during single-task habitual walking (STHW), dual-task habitual walking (DTHW), single-task fast walking (STFW), dual-task fast walking (DTFW). In addition, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), SF-12 health survey, short Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were utilized.All gait parameters were improved in the experimental group in response to EA treatment. After adjustment by age and BMI, the improvement achieved statistical significant level for gait speed under STHW, STFW, and DTFW (9%-19%, p<0.05) as well as stride length during DTFW (9%, p = 0.037) and midswing speed during STFW (6%, p = 0.033). No significant changes were observed in the control group (p>0.110). The highest correlation between gait parameters and UPRDS scores at baseline was observed between gait speed during STFW and UPDRS II (r = -0.888, p = 0.004). The change in this gait parameter in response to active intervention was positively correlated with baseline UPDRS (r = 0.595, p = 0.057). Finally, comparison of responses to treatment between groups showed significant improvement, prominently in gait speed (effect size 0.32-1.16, p = 0.001).This study provides the objective proof of concept for potential benefits of non-pharmaceutical based EA therapy on enhancing gait in patients with PD.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02556164."
https://openalex.org/W2404639528,"Background and Aims Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with increased dietary intake of fat and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Modification of fat metabolism may alter inflammation and disease severity. Our aim was to assess differences in dietary and serum fatty acid levels between control and UC subjects and associations with disease activity and inflammatory cytokines. Methods Dietary histories, serum, and colonic tissue samples were prospectively collected from 137 UC subjects and 38 controls. Both histologic injury and the Mayo Disease Activity Index were assessed. Serum and tissue cytokines were measured by Luminex assay. Serum fatty acids were obtained by gas chromatography. Results UC subjects had increased total fat and oleic acid (OA) intake, but decreased arachidonic acid (AA) intake vs controls. In serum, there was less percent saturated fatty acid (SFA) and AA, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic acid, OA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in UC. Tissue cytokine levels were directly correlated with SFA and inversely correlated with PUFA, EPA, and DPA in UC subjects, but not controls. 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy blunted these associations. Conclusions In summary, we found differences in serum fatty acids in UC subjects that correlated with pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines. We propose that fatty acids may affect cytokine production and thus be immunomodulatory in UC."
https://openalex.org/W2399990901,"Hydrolyzable tannins (HTs) play important roles in plant herbivore deterrence and promotion of human health. A critical step in HT production is the formation of 1-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (β-glucogallin, ester-linked gallic acid and glucose) by a UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) activity. We cloned and biochemically characterized four candidate UGTs from pomegranate (Punica granatum), of which only UGT84A23 and UGT84A24 exhibited β-glucogallin forming activities in enzyme assays. Although overexpression and single RNAi knockdown pomegranate hairy root lines of UGT84A23 or UGT84A24 did not lead to obvious alterations in punicalagin (the prevalent HT in pomegranate) accumulation, double knockdown lines of the two UGTs resulted in largely reduced levels of punicalagins and bis-hexahydroxydiphenyl glucose isomers. An unexpected accumulation of galloyl glucosides (ether-linked gallic acid and glucose) was also detected in the double knockdown lines, suggesting that gallic acid was utilized by an unidentified UGT activity for glucoside formation. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and immunogold labeling in roots of pomegranate seedlings collectively indicated cytosolic localization of UGT84A23 and UGT84A24. Overall, functional characterization and localization of UGT84A23 and UGT84A24 open up opportunities for further understanding the regulatory control of HT metabolism in plants and its coordination with other biochemical pathways in the metabolic network."
https://openalex.org/W2402830625,"Successful purification of multiple viruses from mixed infections remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) mixed infection in goats. Rather than in a single cell type, cytopathic effect (CPE) of the virus was observed in cocultured Vero/BHK-21 cells at 6th blind passage (BP). PPRV, but not FMDV could be purified from the virus mixture by plaque assay. Viral RNA (mixture) transfection in BHK-21 cells produced FMDV but not PPRV virions, a strategy which we have successfully employed for the first time to eliminate the negative-stranded RNA virus from the virus mixture. FMDV phenotypes, such as replication competent but noncytolytic, cytolytic but defective in plaque formation and, cytolytic but defective in both plaque formation and standard FMDV genome were observed respectively, at passage level BP8, BP15 and BP19 and hence complicated virus isolation in the cell culture system. Mixed infection was not found to induce any significant antigenic and genetic diversity in both PPRV and FMDV. Further, we for the first time demonstrated the viral interference between PPRV and FMDV. Prior transfection of PPRV RNA, but not Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and rotavirus RNA resulted in reduced FMDV replication in BHK-21 cells suggesting that the PPRV RNA-induced interference was specifically directed against FMDV. On long-term coinfection of some acute pathogenic viruses (all possible combinations of PPRV, FMDV, NDV and buffalopox virus) in Vero cells, in most cases, one of the coinfecting viruses was excluded at passage level 5 suggesting that the long-term coinfection may modify viral persistence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented evidence describing a natural mixed infection of FMDV and PPRV. The study not only provides simple and reliable methodologies for isolation and purification of two epidemiologically and economically important groups of viruses, but could also help in establishing better guidelines for trading animals that could transmit further infections and epidemics in disease free nations."
https://openalex.org/W2395145991,"We report the discovery and present a detailed analysis of a freshwater bivalve from Shuidonggou Locality 2, layer CL3. This layer is located c. 40 cm below layer CL2, which has yielded numerous ostrich eggshell beads. The shell is identified as the valve of a Corbicula fluminea. Data on the occurrence of this species in the Shuidonggou region during Marine Isotope Stage 3 and taphonomic analysis, conducted in the framework of this study, of a modern biocoenosis and thanatocoenosis suggest that the archeological specimen was collected at one of the numerous fossil or sub-fossil outcrops where valves of this species were available at the time of occupation of level CL3. Experimental grinding and microscopic analysis of modern shells of the same species indicate that the Shuidonggou shell was most probably ground on coarse sandstone to open a hole on its umbo, attach a thread, and use the valve as a personal ornament. Experimental engraving of freshwater shells and microscopic analysis identify an incision crossing the archaeological valve outer surface as possible deliberate engraving. Reappraisal of the site chronology in the light of available radiocarbon evidence suggests an age of at least 34-33 cal kyr BP for layer CL3. Such estimate makes the C. fluminea recovered from CL3 one of the earliest instances of personal ornamentation and the earliest example of a shell bead from China."

Proton translocation takes place in the membrane arm, probably via four antiporter folds. The remaining thirty supernumerary subunits are distributed between both arms. They have no direct roles in catalysis, but at least one of them is involved in the assembly of the complex (13Andrews B. Carroll J. Ding S. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E.

One of them, NDUFAF7, is a member of the 7β-strand family of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases, and transfers methyl groups to the ω-NG- and ω-NG′-atoms of Arg-85 in subunit NDUFS2 at an early stage in the assembly of complex I (19Rhein V.F.

NDUFAF5 is another member of the 7β-strand family of SAM-dependent methyltransferases. Its biochemical function is not known, but pathogenic mutations in NDUFAF5 are associated with a deficiency in complex I, and are found in patients with neonatal mitochondrial disease (21Sugiana C.

The introduction of these mutations into Dictyostelium produced a defect in complex I similar to that observed in human cells (24Carilla-Latorre S. Annesley S.J. Muñoz-Braceras S. Fisher P.R.

Here, we describe investigations into the role of NDUFAF5 in human mitochondria. NDUFAF5 with a C-terminal FLAG tag was found uniquely in the mitochondria of human 143B cells (Fig. 1), in agreement with earlier experiments (21Sugiana C. Pagliarini D.J. McKenzie M. Kirby D.M. Salemi R. Abu-Amero K.K. Dahl H.-H.M. Hutchison W.M. Vascotto K.A. Smith S.M. Newbold R.F. Christodoulou J. Calvo S. Mootha V.K. Ryan M.T. Thorburn D.R. Mutation of C20orf7 disrupts complex I assembly and causes lethal neonatal mitochondrial disease.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 83: 468-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). By SILAC and quantitative mass spectrometry experiments with an inducible tagged version of NDUFAF5, six proteins were found to be associated with statistical significance with NDUFAF5 (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1). The complex I subunit, NDUFS7, was enriched to the greatest extent, and the complex I subunit NDUFAB1, iron-sulfur cluster scaffold homolog NFU1, stroma cell-derived factors 2 and 2-like (SDF2 and SDF2L1, respectively), and DNAJ homolog subfamily B member 11 (DNAJB11), to lesser degrees. Control experiments were conducted in parallel with an inducible and tagged version of METTL12, a member of the 7β-strand methyltransferases of unknown function. Complementary SILAC experiments were performed with a tagged version of NDUFS7 and with a tagged version of the complex I subunit NDUFB3 as a control. They showed that NDUFAF5, NDUFAF3, and NDUFAF4 (both assembly factors for complex I) and α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH7A1) were associated significantly with NDUFS7 (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S2), and that no protein was associated significantly with NDUFB3. However, in both of these independent and complementary experiments, NDUFS7 and NDUFAF5 were the only two proteins that were associated consistently with each other. Subunit NDUFS7 contains no post-translationally methylated amino acids, but the conserved arginine residue (residues 73 and 77 in the human and bovine complexes, respectively) is completely hydroxylated (25Carroll J. Ding S. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Post-translational modifications near the quinone binding site of mammalian complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 24799-24808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that NDUFAF5 might catalyze the introduction of this modification was investigated as follows. In HEK cells where tagged-NDUFS7 was being overexpressed, the expression of NDUFAF5 was suppressed transiently, and in a control experiment the expression of the assembly factor NDUFAF7 was suppressed. It was found that the transcripts for NDUFAF5 and NDUFAF7 had been suppressed by 60–70% relative to controls, and these levels of suppression had been maintained throughout the experiment (Fig. 3A). In untreated cells where NDUFS7 had been overexpressed, about 50% of its Arg-73 was hydroxylated, and treatment with negative control siRNA did not alter this level appreciably (Fig. 3B). However, suppression of the expression of NDUFAF5 with 50 nm siRNA reduced the relative hydroxylation of Arg-73 by 49%, whereas suppression of NDUFAF7 had no impact on hydroxylation of this residue (Fig. 3B). When the expression of NDUFAF5 was suppressed with a higher 100 nm concentration of siRNA the relative level of hydroxylation was reduced to 41%. Suppression of NDUFAF7 with 100 nm siRNA also reduced the relative level of hydroxylation of Arg-73 to a lesser extent (58%), but this reduction is the expected consequence of the extensive disruption of the assembly of complex I accompanying the suppression of expression of this assembly factor. The identities of the unmodified and hydroxylated forms of the AspN peptide (residues 66–79) containing Arg-73 were confirmed by fragmentation of the triply charged ions m/z 541.29 and 546.62, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D). In cells where expression of NDUFAF5 had been suppressed, the extent of methylation of Arg-85 in NDUFS2 was unchanged, whereas the dimethylation was reduced progressively in cells where NDUFAF7 had been depleted (data not shown), as reported before (19Rhein V.F. Carroll J. Ding S. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. NDUFAF7 methylates arginine 85 in the NDUFS2 subunit of human complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 33016-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When the expression of NDUFAF5 was suppressed, both NDUFS7 and ND1, representing the peripheral and membrane arms of complex I, were lost progressively (Fig. 4A), indicating that the participation of NDUFAF5 in the pathway of assembly of complex I affects both arms of the complex. Because endogenous NDUFS7 becomes degraded in these circumstances, the effect of suppression of expression of NDUFAF5 on the hydroxylation of Arg-73 in NDUFS7 was investigated in cells where NDUFS7 was overexpressed (Fig. 3). Although the level of subunit NDUFS2, a component of the peripheral arm, remained constant over the course of the experiment (Fig. 4A), the level of intact complex I was reduced progressively relative to control cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that some or all of the NDUFS2 being monitored had not been incorporated into the complex. The reduction in the level of complex I associated with the depletion of NDUFAF5 (Fig. 4B) was accompanied by the accumulation of a sub-complex with an apparent molecular mass of 370 kDa, containing subunit NDUFB8, a component of the membrane arm of complex I. At the same time, another sub-complex observed in control cells with an apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa, containing the peripheral arm subunit NDUFS2 was reduced. Subunit NDUFB3 contains methylated histidine residues, and therefore it was considered as a potential substrate for NDUFAF5. However, depletion of these two proteins impacted on different stages of the assembly of complex I. The suppression of NDUFAF5 affected the biogenesis of complex I at an early stage of assembly, whereas the depletion of NDUFB3 did not influence the formation of the early stage 200 kDa sub-complex identified with antibodies against NDUFS2 and assembly factor NDUFAF3 (Fig. 5). Additionally, NDUFB3 is a subunit of sub-complex Iβ, which represents the region of the membrane arm of complex I that lies distal from its peripheral arm (3Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J.

U.S.A. 2015; 112: 12087-12092Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); this part of the complex is added at a later stage in the assembly process (18Mimaki M. Wang X. McKenzie M. Thorburn D.R. Ryan M.T. Understanding mitochondrial complex I assembly in health and disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1817: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Depletion of NDUFB3 had the effect of reducing the level of the intact complex (Fig. 5). The effect of suppression of expression of NDUFAF5 on cellular energetics was examined by monitoring the OCR. Over the course of the experiment, transcripts for NDUFAF5 were reduced to about 30% of the control level (Fig. 6A). At 120 h, the suppression of NDUFAF5 was associated with a reduction of the E/L ratio (see Fig. 6B). At 192 h, the E/L ratio had been reduced further, and in these cells the OCR linked to complexes I and III was reduced (Fig. 6C). These effects are due to the disruption of the assembly of complex I and the potential secondary adverse effect of the depletion of NDUFAF5 on complex IV activity (21Sugiana C. Pagliarini D.J.

The hydroxylation of arginine residues in proteins is a rare post-translational modification, and, other than NDUFS7, only three instances have been reported. First, a single 3-hydroxyarginine residue has been found at position-81 of the L16 component of the 50S subunit of the Escherichia coli ribosome (26Ge W. Wolf A. Feng T. Ho C.-H. Sekirnik R. Zayer A. Granatino N. Cockman M.E. Loenarz C. Loik N.D. Hardy A.P. Claridge T.D.W. Hamed R.B. Chowdhury R. Gong L. Robinson C.V. Trudgian D.C. Jiang M. Mackeen M.M. McCullagh J.S. Gordiyenko Y. Thalhammer A.

Oxygenase-catalyzed ribosome hydroxylation occurs in prokaryotes and humans.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Second, numerous 4-hydroxyarginine residues are present in protein components of adhesive plaques of the mussel Mytilus edulis (27Papov V.V. Diamond T.V. Biemann K. Waite J.H. Hydroxyarginine-containing polyphenolic proteins in the adhesive plaques of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20183-20192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Third, a single 4-hydroxyarginine residue has been identified in the large subunit of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CO-DHL) from Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava (28Hänzelmann P. Dobbek H. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O. The effect of intracellular molybdenum in Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava on the crystallographic structure of the seleno-molybdo-iron-sulfur flavoenzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1221-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). From the point of view of the current investigation, the modification of CO-DHL is highly significant because the sequence around the site of hydroxylation in NDUFS7 is related to the sequence around the site of hydroxylation in CO-DHL (Fig. 7A). In the structure of CO-DHL, this sequence, which also includes the active site cysteine, forms a loop followed by an α-helix (28Hänzelmann P. Dobbek H. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O. The effect of intracellular molybdenum in Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava on the crystallographic structure of the seleno-molybdo-iron-sulfur flavoenzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1221-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7B). In bacterial and mitochondrial complexes I, the arginine residue is conserved, but the bacterial residue is not modified (25Carroll J. Ding S. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Post-translational modifications near the quinone binding site of mammalian complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 24799-24808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that this arginine in prokaryotic complex I has a role in enzyme assembly or activity. NDUFS7 is the equivalent of bovine subunit PSST, fungal subunit NUKM and bacterial subunit NuoB/Nqo6. In none of the complex I structures was there unambiguous electron density for the loop (5Vinothkumar K.R. Zhu J. Hirst J. Architecture of mammalian respiratory complex I.Nature. 2014; 515: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 9Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S. Sazanov L.A.

Brandt U. Structural biology. Mechanistic insight from the crystal structure of mitochondrial complex I.Science. 2015; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), possibly because it is mobile. In bacterial complexes I, the corresponding arginine residue in subunit Nqo6 lies close to a tunnel, also involving subunits Nqo8 (ND1) and Nqo4 (NDUFS2), in the membrane and peripheral arms of the complex respectively, where the oxidized coenzyme Q is thought to bind and accept electrons from iron-sulfur cluster N2 (9Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S. Sazanov L.A. Crystal structure of the entire respiratory complex I.Nature. 2013; 494: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The restricted access to the residue via the tunnel in the mitochondrial enzyme makes it most unlikely that the hydroxylation could occur in this assembled state, in agreement with the proposal that the modification occurs during assembly of the complex, and before formation of the tunnel. The finding that a member of the family of SAM-dependent 7β-strand methyltransferases is a hydroxylase has a precedent. While many protein and small molecule hydroxylases belong either to the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (29Markolovic S. Wilkins S.E. Schofield C.J.

Like NDUFAF5, RdmB belongs to the family of SAM-dependent 7β-strand methyltransferases, and is structurally very similar to the methytransferase DnrK (the r.m.s.d. of superimposed main chain atoms is 1.14 Å) (34Jansson A.

https://openalex.org/W2405064451,"Carbapenemase-producing strains of bacteria, which were primarily found in the medical field, have increasingly been found in the environment, thus posing potential risks to public health. One possible way for carbapenemase genes to enter the environment is via wastewater. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the occurrence and fate of five high-risk carbapenemase genes in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in northern China using real-time qPCR. Results showed that the blaKPC-2, blaGES-1, and blaIMP-1 genes prevailed throughout all processing stages (even in the chlorination disinfection unit) in the WWTP, whereas the blaVIM-2 and blaOXA-48 genes were not detected in all samples. Worryingly, considerable amounts of carbapenemase genes ((1.54 ± 0.61) × 103 copies/mL to (2.14± 0.41) × 105 copies/mL) were detected in WWTP effluent samples, while the majority of the carbapenemase genes were transported to the dewatered sludge with concentrations from (6.51 ± 0.14) × 109 copies/g to (6.18 ± 0.63) × 1010 copies/g dry weight. Furthermore, a total of 97 KPC-2-producing strains, belonging to 8 bacterial genera, were isolated from the WWTP. Sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that most of KPC-2 producing isolates were opportunistic pathogens, including Klebsiella spp. (10.3%), Enterococcus spp. (11.3%), Acinetobacter spp. (19.6%), Escherichia spp. (12.4%), Shigella spp. (17.5%), Stenotrophomonas spp. (10.3%) and Wautersiella spp. (9.3%). Moreover, blaKPC-2 genes were identified for the first time in Paenibacillus spp. isolates (an indigenous bacteria), indicating an increased risk of horizontal transfer between clinical pathogens and environmental bacteria. Indeed, a conjugation experiment demonstrated transfer of the blaKPC-2 gene to an E.coli J53 strain from a Klebsiella strain isolated from the WWTP. To our knowledge, this is the first study to obtain Paenibacillus spp. isolates carrying the carbapenemase gene and to quantify the abundance of carbapenemase genes in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2395969776,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a prototypical emerging virus for which no effective therapeutics currently exist. WNV uses programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to synthesize the NS1′ protein, a C terminally extended version of its non-structural protein 1, the expression of which enhances neuro-invasiveness and viral RNA abundance. Here, the NS1′ frameshift signals derived from four WNV strains were investigated to better understand −1 PRF in this quasispecies. Sequences previously predicted to promote −1 PRF strongly promote this activity, but frameshifting was significantly more efficient upon inclusion of additional 3′ sequence information. The observation of different rates of −1 PRF, and by inference differences in the expression of NS1′, may account for the greater degrees of pathogenesis associated with specific WNV strains. Chemical modification and mutational analyses of the longer and shorter forms of the −1 PRF signals suggests dynamic structural rearrangements between tandem stem-loop and mRNA pseudoknot structures in two of the strains. A model is suggested in which this is employed as a molecular switch to fine tune the relative expression of structural to non-structural proteins during different phases of the viral replication cycle.

The observation of different rates of −1 PRF, and by inference differences in the expression of NS1′, may account for the greater degrees of pathogenesis associated with specific WNV strains. Chemical modification and mutational analyses of the longer and shorter forms of the −1 PRF signals suggests dynamic structural rearrangements between tandem stem-loop and mRNA pseudoknot structures in two of the strains. A model is suggested in which this is employed as a molecular switch to fine tune the relative expression of structural to non-structural proteins during different phases of the viral replication cycle."

The norms can be downloaded as supplementary materials for this manuscript from https://figshare.com/s/8e7b445b729527262c88 These ratings may be of potential relevance to researches who are interested in characterizing the interplay between language and emotion. Additionally, with the aim of investigating how the affective features interact with the lexicosemantic properties of words, we performed correlational analyses between norms for familiarity, subjective AoA and SER, and scores for those affective variables which are currently included in the MADs. A distinct pattern of significant correlations with affective features was found for different lexicosemantic variables. These results show that familiarity, subjective AoA and SERs may have independent effects on the processing of emotional words. They also suggest that these psycholinguistic variables should be fully considered when formulating theoretical approaches to the processing of affective language."
https://openalex.org/W2398643893,"Citrus Bergamia Risso, commonly known as Bergamot, is a fruit whose Essential Oil and Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction have numerous medicinal properties. It is also an excellent antioxidant and in this study, for the first time, its potential effect on morphine induced tolerance in mice has been investigated. Our studies revealed that development of antinociceptive tolerance to repeated doses of morphine in mice is consistently associated with increased formation of superoxide, malondialdehyde and tyrosine-nitrated proteins in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord such as the enzyme glutamine synthase. Nitration of this protein is intimately linked to inactivation of its biological function and resulting increase of glutamate levels in the spinal cord. Administration of Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction (5–50 mg/kg) attenuated tolerance development. This effect was accompanied by reduction of superoxide and malondialdehyde production, prevention of GS nitration, re-establishment of its activity and of glutamate levels. Our studies confirmed the main role of free radicals during the cascade of events induced by prolonged morphine treatment and the co-administration of natural derivatives antioxidant such as Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction can be an important therapeutic approach to restore opioids analgesic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2403564902,"A peptide segment that binds the active site of a serine protease in a substrate-like manner may behave like an inhibitor or a substrate. However, there is sparse information on which factors determine the behavior a particular peptide segment will exhibit. Here, we describe the first x-ray crystal structure of a nanobody in complex with a serine protease. The nanobody displays a new type of interaction between an antibody and a serine protease as it inserts its complementary determining region-H3 loop into the active site of the protease in a substrate-like manner. The unique binding mechanism causes the nanobody to behave as a strong inhibitor as well as a poor substrate. Intriguingly, its substrate behavior is incomplete, as 30-40% of the nanobody remained intact and inhibitory after prolonged incubation with the protease. Biochemical analysis reveals that an intra-loop interaction network within the complementary determining region-H3 of the nanobody balances its inhibitor versus substrate behavior. Collectively, our results unveil molecular factors, which may be a general mechanism to determine the substrate versus inhibitor behavior of other protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2403163366,"Concern has been expressed over societal losses of plant species identification skills. These losses have potential implications for engagement with conservation issues, gaining human wellbeing benefits from biodiversity (such as those resulting from nature-based recreational activities), and early warning of the spread of problematic species. However, understanding of the prevailing level of species identification skills, and of its key drivers, remains poor. Here, we explore socio-demographic factors influencing plant identification knowledge and ability to classify plants as native or non-native, employing a novel method of using real physical plants, rather than photographs or illustrations. We conducted face-to-face surveys at three different sites chosen to capture respondents with a range of socio-demographic circumstances, in Cornwall, UK. We found that survey participants correctly identified c.60% of common plant species, were significantly worse at naming non-native than native plants, and that less than 20% of people recognised Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica, which is a widespread high profile invasive non-native in the study region. Success at naming plants was higher if participants were female, a member of at least one environmental, conservation or gardening organisation, in an older age group (than the base category of 18–29 years), or a resident (rather than visitor) of the study area. Understanding patterns of variation in plant identification knowledge can inform the development of education and engagement strategies, for example, by targeting sectors of society where knowledge is lowest. Furthermore, greater understanding of general levels of identification of problematic invasive non-native plants can guide awareness and education campaigns to mitigate their impacts."

Spt16 is also essential and functions globally in transcriptional regulation as a component of the facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) histone chaperone complex. Here we demonstrate that Mot1 and Spt16 regulate a largely overlapping set of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As expected, Mot1 was found to control TBP levels at co-regulated promoters. In contrast, Spt16 did not affect TBP recruitment. On a global scale, Spt16 was required for Mot1 promoter localization, and Mot1 also affected Spt16 localization to genes. Interestingly, we found that Mot1 has an unanticipated role in establishing or maintaining the occupancy and positioning of nucleosomes at the 5′ ends of genes. Spt16 has a broad role in regulating chromatin organization in gene bodies, including those nucleosomes affected by Mot1. These results suggest that the large scale overlap in Mot1 and Spt16 function arises from a combination of both their unique and shared functions in transcription complex assembly and chromatin structure regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2397892724,"The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in many physiological processes. Several studies indicate that AHR is also involved in energy homeostasis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important regulator of the fasting and feeding responses. When administered to various genetic and diet-induced mouse models of obesity, FGF21 can attenuate obesity-associated morbidities. Here, we explore the role of AHR in hepatic Fgf21 expression through the use of a conditional, hepatocyte-targeted AHR knock-out mouse model (Cre(Alb)Ahr(Fx/Fx)). Compared with the congenic parental strain (Ahr(Fx/Fx)), non-fasted Cre(Alb)Ahr(Fx/Fx) mice exhibit a 4-fold increase in hepatic Fgf21 expression, as well as elevated expression of the FGF21-target gene Igfbp1 Furthermore, in vivo agonist activation of AHR reduces hepatic Fgf21 expression during a fast. The Fgf21 promoter contains several putative dioxin response elements (DREs). Using EMSA, we demonstrate that the AHR-ARNT heterodimer binds to a specific DRE that overlaps binding sequences for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), and cAMP response element-binding protein, hepatocyte specific (CREBH). In addition, we reveal that agonist-activated AHR impairs PPARα-, ChREBP-, and CREBH-mediated promoter activity in Hepa-1 cells. Accordingly, agonist treatment in Hepa-1 cells ablates potent ER stress-driven Fgf21 expression, and pre-treatment with AHR antagonist blocks this effect. Finally, we show that pre-treatment of primary human hepatocytes with AHR agonist diminishes PPARα-, glucose-, and ER stress-driven induction of FGF21 expression, indicating the effect is not mouse-specific. Together, our data show that AHR contributes to hepatic energy homeostasis, partly through the regulation of FGF21 expression and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2396304782,"Jak-family tyrosine kinases mediate signaling from diverse cytokine receptors. Binding of Jaks to their cognate receptors is mediated by their N-terminal region, which contains FERM and SH2 domains. Here we describe the crystal structure of the FERM-SH2 region of Jak2 at 3.0Å resolution. The structure reveals that these domains and their flanking linker segments interact intimately to form an integrated structural module. The Jak2 FERM-SH2 structure closely resembles that recently described for Tyk2, another member of the Jak family. While the overall architecture and interdomain orientations are preserved between Jak2 and Tyk2, we identify residues in the putative receptor-binding groove that differ between the two and may contribute to the specificity of receptor recognition. Analysis of Jak mutations that are reported to disrupt receptor binding reveals that they lie in the hydrophobic core of the FERM domain, and are thus expected to compromise the structural integrity of the FERM-SH2 unit. Similarly, analysis of mutations in Jak3 that are associated with severe combined immunodeficiency suggests that they compromise Jak3 function by destabilizing the FERM-SH2 structure."
https://openalex.org/W2398782872,"Nerve endings are often identified within solid tumors, but their impact on the tumor growth and progression remains poorly understood. Emerging data suggests that the central nervous system may affect cancer development and spreading via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomous nervous system. However, the role of the afferent sensory neurons in tumor growth is unclear, except some reports on perineural invasion in prostate and pancreatic cancer and cancer-related pain syndrome. Here, we provide the results of primary testing of the concept that the interaction between melanoma cells and sensory neurons may induce the formation of tumor-supporting microenvironment via attraction of immune regulatory cells by the tumor-activated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We report that despite DRG cells not directly up-regulating proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro, presence of DRG neurons allows tumors to grow significantly faster in vivo. This effect has been associated with increased production of chemokines by tumor-activated DRG neurons and attraction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells both in vitro and in vivo. These initial proof-of-concept results justify further investigations of the sensory (afferent) nervous system in the context of tumorigenesis and the local protumorigenic immunoenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2260964318,"The systematic creation of gaps within canopies results in fragmentation and the architecture of fragmented canopies differs substantially from non-fragmented canopies. Canopy fragmentation leads to spatial heterogeneity in hydrodynamics and therefore heterogeneity in the sheltering of canopy communities. Identifying the level of instability due to canopy fragmentation is important for canopies in coastal areas impacted by human activities and indeed, climate change. The gap orientation relative to the wave direction is expected to play an important role in determining wave attenuation and sheltering. Initially we investigated the effect of a single transversal gap within a canopy (i.e. a gap oriented perpendicular to the wave direction) on hydrodynamics, which was compared to fully vegetated canopies (i.e. no gaps) and also to bare sediment. The wave velocity increased with gap width for the two canopy densities studied (2.5% and 10% solid plant fraction) reaching wave velocities found over bare sediments. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) within the gap also increased, but was more attenuated by the adjacent vegetation than the wave velocity. As expected, denser canopies produced a greater attenuation of both the wave velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy within an adjacent gap, compared to sparse canopies. Using non-dimensional analysis and our experimental data, a parameterization for predicting TKE in a canopy gap was formulated, as a function of easily measured variables. Based on the experimental results, a fragmented canopy model was then developed to determine the overall mixing level in such canopies. The model revealed that canopies with large gaps present more mixing than canopies with small gaps despite having the same total gap area in the canopy. Furthermore, for the same total gap area, dense fragmented canopies provide more shelter than sparse fragmented canopies."

Med. 2015; 212: 1901-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Pla2g2f mRNA (encoding sPLA2-IIF) was expressed abundantly in mouse dorsal skin throughout the peri- to postnatal period (Fig. 1B). We noticed that, although the skin expression of Pla2g2e was low before birth, it increased markedly during P5–15, even exceeding the expression of Pla2g2f (Fig. 1B). Thereafter, the expression of Pla2g2e declined to nearly the basal level during P20–25 and then increased again to a level higher than that of Pla2g2f at P30. The periodic pattern of Pla2g2e expression appeared to coincide with the hair cycle, which involves repeated cycles of growth (anagen; P0–15), regression (catagen; P15–20), rest (telogen; P20–25), and re-growth (the next anagen; beyond P25), raising the possibility that sPLA2-IIE is expressed in hair follicles. To address this issue, we separated the epidermis and hair follicles from frozen sections of mouse dorsal skin at P8 by microdissection. As expected (19Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Murakami M. The role of group IIF-secreted phospholipase A2 in epidermal homeostasis and hyperplasia.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 1901-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Pla2g2f was distributed in the epidermal fraction almost exclusively, whereas Pla2g2e was expressed in both fractions, with more abundant expression in the hair follicle fraction than in the epidermal fraction (Fig. 1C). Although Pla2g10 (encoding sPLA2-X) has been reported to be expressed in hair follicles in correlation with the hair cycle (21Yamamoto K. Taketomi Y. Isogai Y. Miki Y. Sato H. Masuda S. Nishito Y. Morioka K. Ishimoto Y. Suzuki N. Yokota Y. Hanasaki K. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kobayashi T. et al.Hair follicular expression and function of group X secreted phospholipase A2 in mouse skin.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 11616-11631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), its hair follicle expression, relative to that of Pla2g2e, was nearly negligible (Fig. 1C). Expression levels of other sPLA2s (IB, IID, and V) in hair follicles were minimal (19Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Murakami M. The role of group IIF-secreted phospholipase A2 in epidermal homeostasis and hyperplasia.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 1901-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, sPLA2-IIE is the predominant sPLA2 expressed in hair follicles during anagen. Because a substantial level of Pla2g2e expression was also detected in the epidermal fraction (Fig. 1C), we examined its expression in epidermal keratinocytes in primary culture. Ca2+-induced differentiation of primary keratinocytes from newborn WT mice resulted in robust induction of Pla2g2f in parallel with that of the keratinocyte differentiation marker Krt1 (Fig. 1D), as reported previously (19Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Murakami M. The role of group IIF-secreted phospholipase A2 in epidermal homeostasis and hyperplasia.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 1901-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, Pla2g2e expression in cultured keratinocytes was constant regardless of the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that, in contrast to sPLA2-IIF that is induced in differentiated keratinocytes (19Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Murakami M. The role of group IIF-secreted phospholipase A2 in epidermal homeostasis and hyperplasia.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 1901-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), sPLA2-IIE is constantly expressed in undifferentiated basal keratinocytes. Consistent with the preferential distribution of Pla2g2e in hair follicles, in situ hybridization of Pla2g2e in mouse dorsal skin at 4 weeks, a period corresponding to the next anagen, confirmed its distribution in growing hair follicles but not in the dermal papilla (Fig. 2). High magnification images of the cross-sections of hair follicles revealed that the Pla2g2e signal was localized in the second outermost layer and the innermost layer surrounding the growing hair shafts. These results suggest the specific localization of sPLA2-IIE in companion cells of the outer root sheath (ORS) and cuticular cells of the inner root sheath (IRS) in hair follicles during anagen. To assess the roles of sPLA2-IIE in mouse skin, we employed Pla2g2e−/− mice (24Sato H. Taketomi Y. Ushida A. Isogai Y. Kojima T. Hirabayashi T. Miki Y. Yamamoto K. Nishito Y. Kobayashi T. Ikeda K. Taguchi R. Hara S. Ida S.

Grossly, Pla2g2e−/− mice over 1 year of age under normal housing conditions had a normal appearance with no apparent skin abnormality. Histologically, the skins of both genotypes showed no apparent differences in the density and length of hair follicles, thickness of the dermis and epidermis, and organization of the subcutaneous fat layer between the skins of both genotypes at P33 (Fig. 3A). We noticed, however, that the upper part of growing hair follicles, where sPLA2-IIE was located (Fig. 2), appeared to be swollen in Pla2g2e−/− mice relative to Pla2g2e+/+ mice. To clarify the subtle skin alterations caused by Pla2g2e ablation, we performed microarray analysis using Pla2g2e−/− skin in comparison with Pla2g2e+/+ skin at this stage. We also compared the gene expression profile in Pla2g2e−/− skin with that in age-matched Pla2g2f−/− skin, which displayed only modest epidermal abnormalities under normal conditions (19Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Murakami M. The role of group IIF-secreted phospholipase A2 in epidermal homeostasis and hyperplasia.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 1901-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed, there were only a few alterations of gene expression in normal skin of Pla2g2f−/− mice relative to that of WT mice at this stage (Fig. 3B). Similarly to Pla2g2f−/− skin, the global gene expression profile was not profoundly affected in Pla2g2e−/− skin. We found, however, that the expression levels of a subset of genes (e.g. S100a9, Defb8, Sprr2f, Serpine1, Adam8, Klk6, Il1b, Il1f6, and Ccl5), which are reportedly elevated in response to epidermal stress (25Schonthaler H.B.

The microarray results were further verified by quantitative RT-PCR, in which the expression of S100a9 and Klk6 was significantly higher, whereas that of Camp was lower, in Pla2g2e−/− skin than in Pla2g2e+/+ skin (Fig. 3C). Increased expression of Krt14, but not Krt1, in Pla2g2e−/− skin (Fig. 3C) implies that the lack of sPLA2-IIE has some influence on hair follicular and/or basal keratinocytes rather than on suprabasal keratinocytes. However, the state of the inside-out skin barrier, as assessed by transepidermal water loss (TEWL), did not differ between Pla2g2e−/− and Pla2g2e+/+ skins (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the modest changes in the expression of a subset of skin genes did not affect epidermal barrier function in Pla2g2e−/− mice. Notably, expression of specific keratins (Krt16 and its partners Krt6a and Krt6b), which are preferentially distributed in the companion layer of hair follicles (31Bernot K.M. Coulombe P.A.

Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the increased expression of Krt16, Krt6a, and Krt6b in Pla2g2e−/− skin relative to Pla2g2e+/+ skin, although the expression of other hair keratins was unaffected by Pla2g2e deficiency (Fig. 3E). Thus, in agreement with the main localization of sPLA2-IIE in hair follicles (Fig. 1), Pla2g2e−/− skin harbors some alterations in the expression of several, if not all, hair follicular genes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed notable abnormalities in hair follicles (Fig. 4, A and B), rather than epidermis (data not shown), in Pla2g2e−/− mice. The hair follicle consists of several distinctive layers as follows: ORS, companion layer, IRS (Henle's layer, Huxley's layer, and IRS cuticle), and hair shaft (cuticle, hair cortex, and medulla) from the outermost to innermost layers. In contrast to the well organized architecture of hair follicles in WT mice, those in Pla2g2e−/− mice had noticeable defects in the IRS and hair shaft (Fig. 4B). In hair follicles of Pla2g2e−/− skin, IRS cells contained large cytoplasmic cysts and pyknotic nuclei and were devoid of keratohyalin granules. Adjacent to the cuticle, Pla2g2e−/− mice had unusual pericuticular cells that were absent in WT mice, suggesting altered differentiation of hair follicular cells. Moreover, the cuticle in Pla2g2e−/− mice was abnormally dissociated from the hair cortex and medulla, which had an immature or regressed appearance. These results appear to be compatible with the swollen feature of Pla2g2e−/− hair follicles under the light microscope (Fig. 3A). Thus, the lack of sPLA2-IIE leads to hair follicle abnormalities. In psoriasis and skin cancer, sPLA2-IIF is up-regulated in the thickened epidermis and promotes epidermal hyperplasia through production of the unique lysophospholipid P-LPE (19Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Murakami M.

Some alterations in Pla2g2e−/− skin under normal conditions (Figs. 3, 4) prompted us to examine the impact of Pla2g2e deficiency on these skin disorders. However, neither imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis nor dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced contact dermatitis was affected in Pla2g2e−/− mice in comparison with Pla2g2e+/+ mice (Fig. 5, A and B). This was in contrast to Pla2g2f−/− mice, where ear swelling was significantly ameliorated in both models. Moreover, although the level of P-LPE, a main metabolite produced by sPLA2-IIF, was selectively reduced in IMQ-treated Pla2g2f−/− skin relative to WT mice as reported previously (19Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Murakami M.

Thus, unlike sPLA2-IIF that promotes epidermal hyperplasia (19Yamamoto K. Miki Y. Sato M. Taketomi Y. Nishito Y. Taya C. Muramatsu K. Ikeda K. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Kambe N. Kabashima K. Lambeau G.

https://openalex.org/W2403014169,"The North American Beaver (Castor canadensis) is the second largest living rodent and an iconic symbol of Canada. The beaver is a semi-aquatic browser whose diet consists of lignocellulose from a variety of plants. The beaver is a hindgut fermenter and has an enlarged ceacum that houses a complex microbiome. There have been few studies examining the microbial diversity in gastrointestinal tract of hindgut fermenting herbivores. To examine the bacterial and archaeal communities inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of the beaver, the microbiome of the ceacum and feaces was examined using culture-independent methods. DNA from the microbial community of the ceacum and feaces of 4 adult beavers was extracted, and the16S rRNA gene was sequenced using either bacterial or archaeal specific primers. A total of 1447 and 1435 unique bacterial OTUs were sequenced from the ceacum and feaces, respectively. On average, the majority of OTUs within the ceacum were classified as Bacteroidetes (49.2%) and Firmicutes (47.6%). The feaces was also dominated by OTUs from Bacteroidetes (36.8%) and Firmicutes (58.9%). The composition of bacterial community was not significantly different among animals. The composition of the ceacal and feacal microbiome differed, but this difference is due to changes in the abundance of closely related OTUs, not because of major differences in the taxonomic composition of the communities. Within these communities, known degraders of lignocellulose were identified. In contrast, to the bacterial microbiome, the archaeal community was dominated by a single species of methanogen, Methanosphaera stadtmanae. The data presented here provide the first insight into the microbial community within the hindgut of the beaver."
https://openalex.org/W2403077834,"Hip arthroplasty is the standard treatment of a painful hip destruction. The use of modern metal-on-metal (MOM) bearing surfaces gained popularity in total hip arthroplasties during the last decade. Recently, worrisome failures due to adverse reaction to metal debris (ARMD), including pseudotumor response, have been widely reported. However, the pathogenesis of this reaction remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ARMD response by flow cytometry approach.Sixteen patients with a failed Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip prosthesis were included in the study. Samples of pseudotumor tissues collected during revision surgery were degraded by enzyme digestion and cells were typed by flow cytometry. Whole blood chromium and cobalt concentrations were analyzed with mass spectrometry before revision surgery.Flow cytometry analysis showed that the peri-implant pseudotumor tissue expressed two principal phenotypes, namely macrophage-dominated and T-lymphocyte-dominated response; the average portions being 54% (macrophages) and 25% (T-lymphocytes) in macrophage-dominated inflammation and 20% (macrophages) and 54% (T-lymphocytes) in T-lymphocyte-dominated response. The percentages of B-lymphocytes and granulocytes were lower in both phenotypes. Interestingly, the levels of blood chromium and cobalt were significantly higher in patients with macrophage-dominated response.The results suggest that the adverse tissue reactions induced by MOM wear particles contain heterogeneous pathogeneses and that the metal levels are an important factor in the determination of the inflammatory phenotype. The present results support the hypothesis that higher metal levels cause cytotoxicity and tissue injury and macrophages are recruited to clear the necrotic debris. On the other hand, the adverse response developed in association with lower metal levels is T-lymphocyte-dominated and is likely to reflect hypersensitivity reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2398191418,"Obesity is a global public health priority. Restrained eating is related to obesity and total energy intake but associations with the eating patterns are unclear. We examined the associations of restrained eating with the size and frequency of intake occasions among 1213 British adult (19–64 y) participants in a cross-sectional analysis of the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2000. The Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire assessed restrained eating. Overall intake occasions were all energy consumed in a 60 min period. A food-based classification separated intake occasions into meals, snacks, or drinks from seven-day weighed food diaries. Average daily frequency and size (kcal) of overall intake, meal, snack and drink occasions were calculated and associations with restrained eating were modelled using multiple linear regression including under-reporting of energy intake, age, gender, BMI, emotional eating, external eating and physical activity as covariates. Restrained eating was very weakly positively correlated with overall intake (r = 0.08, p<0.05) and meal frequency (r = 0.10, p<0.05) but not snack or drink frequency (r = 0.02 and -0.02 respectively). Adjusted regressions showed a one-point change in restrained eating was associated with 0.07 (95% CI 0.03, 0.11) more meal occasions/day and 0.13 (95% CI 0.01, 0.25) extra overall intake occasions/day. Overall intake occasion size was weakly negatively correlated with restrained eating regardless of type (r = -0.16 to -0.20, all p<0.0001). Adjusted regressions showed each one-point increase in restrained eating was associated with lower-energy meals (-15 kcal 95% CI -5.9, -24.2) and drinks (-4 kcal 95%CI -0.1, -8), but not snacks or overall intake occasions. Among a national sample of UK adults, greater restrained eating was associated with smaller and slightly more frequent eating, suggesting that restrained eaters restrict their energy intake by reducing meal/drink size rather than skipping snacks."
https://openalex.org/W2408032827,"The pervasive pattern of aggregated tree distributions in natural communities is commonly explained by the joint effect of two clustering processes: environmental filtering and dispersal limitation, yet little consensus remains on the relative importance of the two clustering processes on tree aggregations. Different life stages of examined species were thought to be one possible explanation of this disagreement, because the effect of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation are expected to increase and decrease with tree life stages, respectively. However, few studies have explicitly tested these expectations. In this study, we evaluated these expectations by three different methods (species-habitat association test based on Poisson Clustering model and spatial point pattern analyses based on Heterogeneous Poisson model and the jointly modeling approach) using 36 species in a 20-ha subtropical forest plot. Our results showed that the percentage of species with significant habitat association increased with life stages, and there were fewer species affected by dispersal limitation in later life stages compared with those in earlier stages. Percentage of variance explained by the environmental filtering and dispersal limitation also increases and decreases with life stages. These results provided a promising alternative explanation on the existing mixed results about the relative importance of the two clustering processes. These findings also highlighted the importance of plant life stages for fully understanding species distributions and species coexistence."

In the acute inflammation model, the oral pretreatment with doses from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg of N-acylhydrazone derivatives was able to significantly reduce leukocyte migration to the cavity. Pretreatment with LASSBio-1524 and its analogues also decreased NO, TNF-α and ROS biosynthesis an events closely involved with NF-kB pathway. The tetrahydronaphthyl-N-acylhydrazone derivative LASSBio-1764 was the most promising compound from this series, surpassing even LASSBio-1524.

Movement through the cell cycle is controlled at multiple stages.

Other studies identified a second restriction point in non-quiescent cells that occurs in the preceding cell cycle (4Spencer S.L. Cappell S.D. Tsai F.C. Overton K.W. Wang C.L. Meyer T.

It has become clear from these studies that the average measurements of a population tend to obscure the range of responses seen in single cells, and thus hide important differences about how within-population heterogeneity influences long-term outcomes. Results also have revealed how single time point measurements may limit the understanding of dynamic behaviors that occur at different times in different cells as they transit through the cell cycle (4Spencer S.L. Cappell S.D. Tsai F.C. Overton K.W. Wang C.L. Meyer T.

Despite advances in fundamentals of cell cycle control described in these publications, the observations collectively have provided only limited insights into how growth factors influence cell cycle progression. Here we have developed an experimental cell system that allows simultaneous tracking in real time of initial and longer-term responses to different growth factors, which we have applied to assess cell cycle progression in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. We find that at the population level there are clear dose- and time-thresholds for individual growth factors to promote the G1 to S phase transition, but that in single cells these thresholds are variable. As a consequence, although growth factor signaling activity correlates with cell cycle progression in the overall population, it does not in individual cells. Hence an acute signaling response cannot be used to determine if a cell will commit to S phase. Thus, our studies reveal how growth factor signaling is encoded into cell cycle progression at the population level but not in single cells. Growth factors play a key role in cell proliferation, but their actions have been found to be temporally limited (1Pardee A.B. A restriction point for control of normal animal cell proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 2Zetterberg A. Larsson O. Wiman K.G.

Growth factor-dependent signaling and cell cycle progression.FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Jones S.M. Kazlauskas A. Growth-factor-dependent mitogenesis requires two distinct phases of signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Before reaching the restriction point in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, growth factors are required; after it, cell cycle movement to S phase is growth factor independent. However, it is unclear if individual cells show behaviors similar to the entire population with regard to responsiveness to growth factor signaling and cell cycle progression. To address this issue, we developed an experimental system in C3H10T1/2 fetal fibroblasts that allows simultaneous tracking of growth factor actions in individual cells, as assessed by activity of the Akt protein kinase (16Gross S.M. Rotwein P. Akt signaling dynamics in individual cells.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 2509-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Gross S.M. Rotwein P. Mapping growth factor encoded akt signaling dynamics.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129: 2052-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and cell cycle progression, as defined by Cdk2 activity. To dynamically measure Akt signaling, we monitored the real time subcellular distribution of a chimeric molecule composed of the Akt substrate, FoxO1, and the green fluorescent protein, clover (FoxO1-clover (16Gross S.M. Rotwein P. Akt signaling dynamics in individual cells.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 2509-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Increased Akt activity causes nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation of the reporter molecule (16Gross S.M. Rotwein P. Akt signaling dynamics in individual cells.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 2509-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For tracking different phases of the cell cycle, we used a protein consisting of a segment of the Cdk2 substrate, human DNA helicase B (HDHB), fused to the red fluorescent protein, mKate2 (mKate2-HDHB, Ref. 4Spencer S.L.

In response to increased Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation during the G1 to S phase transition, HDHB localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (4Spencer S.L. Cappell S.D. Tsai F.C. Overton K.W.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: E4386-E4E93Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). To test the effects of growth factors on cell cycle progression, we first analyzed cells incubated in medium with 10% FBS. In this treatment protocol, each individually tracked cell progressed through mitosis with average cell cycle duration of 19.4 ± 0.7 h. In > 80% of the cells analyzed, the mKate2-HDHB reporter relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm within 6.5 h after mitosis (Fig. 1D, black circles mark S phase); under these conditions the average duration of G1 was 5.5 ± 0.4 h (range of 2.25 to 19.5 h, Fig. 1E). To test the effects of a growth factor on both sensor proteins, cells first were incubated for 24 h in SFM to promote cell cycle arrest in early G1. This resulted in 82.7 ± 2.5% of cells being in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, as assessed by nuclear localization of the mKate2-HDHB reporter (4Spencer S.L. Cappell S.D. Tsai F.C. Overton K.W.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: E4386-E4E93Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SFM or IGF-I was then added, and cells were tracked at 15-min intervals for the next 24 h. In the continuing presence of SFM, the mKate2-HDHB reporter remained predominantly nuclear for 24 h in 22/25 cells analyzed (Fig. 2A). In contrast, after addition of IGF-I, the reporter was retained in the nucleus in only 5/25 cells (Fig. 2, B and C, supplemental Movie S1). FoxO1-clover was exported to the cytoplasm in cells incubated with IGF-I, and was maintained there in nearly all cells for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 2C, lower panels). Thus, using our dual reporter cell line, we can simultaneously track Akt activity and cell cycle reentry. To test the time dependence of growth factor actions on cell cycle progression, we incubated cells in SFM for 24 h, and then added IGF-I with or without the IGF-I receptor inhibitor, linsitinib (18Mulvihill M.J. Cooke A. Rosenfeld-Franklin M. Buck E. Foreman K. Landfair D. O'Connor M. Pirritt C. Sun Y. Yao Y. Arnold L.D. Gibson N.W. Ji Q.S. Discovery of OSI-906: a selective and orally efficacious dual inhibitor of the IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor.Future Med. Chem. 2009; 1: 1153-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), at 0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 h later. IGF-I promoted sustained Akt activity, leading to persistent nuclear to cytoplasmic relocation of FoxO1-clover (Fig. 3A). This was rapidly and completely inhibited by linsitinib (Fig. 3A), although the nuclear intensity of the reporter molecule was apparently greater the later that linsitinib was added, possibly reflecting changes in cell shape and in rates of protein synthesis from prolonged stimulation by IGF-I. Linsitinib also decreased the percentage of cells that moved from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle in a manner that was dependent on the time that it was added. Addition coincident with or 3 h after IGF-I prevented cell cycle progression in 80–90% of the population compared with no inhibitor, but addition at 6 h after IGF-I caused only a 43% decline. When linsitinib was added 9 or 12 h after IGF-I there was a minimal reduction in cell cycle progression compared with cells incubated solely with IGF-I (Fig. 3B). Our results thus indicate a restriction point in C3H10T1/2 cells that is dependent on the duration of growth factor signaling. To separate population averages from single cell responses, we quantified cell cycle reentry in individual cells. This analysis revealed remarkable variability in the timing of the G1-S transition, with a range of < 4 to 24 h after exposure to IGF-I (n = 104 cells, Fig. 3C). This broad distribution was not dependent on the duration of IGF-I receptor activity, since G1 to S phase transition times remained similar regardless of when linsitinib was added (Fig. 3C). Thus, the main effect of more sustained IGF-I action was to recruit more cells to transit to S phase, rather than altering the timing of cell cycle progression (Fig. 3, C and D). In these experiments, 30.7 ± 8.7% (n = 3 experiments) of cells did not undergo the transition from G1 to S phase when incubated with IGF-I (Fig. 3B, dark blue bar). These cells could have been unresponsive to growth factor stimulation. To test this idea, we compared the integrated Akt signaling activity of cells that exited G1 with those that did not. Although Akt activity varied among individual fibroblasts, there were no consistent differences between cells that remained quiescent and those that entered the cell cycle (Fig. 3D). Note that signaling activity accumulated at a relatively steady rate over the course of 24 h in cells that entered the cell cycle, and that there was no direct relationship with timing of G1 exit (Fig. 3E). We thus found that the rate or extent of IGF-I-initiated Akt signaling in a single cell was not strictly linked to its progression through the cell cycle. At sub-maximal growth factor concentrations, signaling effects might accumulate in cells over time and eventually trigger a longer-term outcome such as cell cycle progression. Alternatively, each individual cell may have its own signaling threshold, which must be overcome to promote the G1 to S phase transition. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cells were incubated for 24 h with SFM, and then IGF-I plus different concentrations of linsitinib were added concomitantly. Under these conditions, IGF-I robustly stimulated Akt activity, as measured by an initial ∼80% decline in nuclear levels of the FoxO1-clover reporter within 30 min compared with little effect of SFM (Fig. 4A). IGF-I also led to a ∼6.5-fold increase in the fraction of cells undergoing the G1 to S transition by 24 h compared with SFM, from 13.5 ± 2.9% versus 78.0 ± 5.2% (n = 4 experiments) (Fig. 4B). The IGF-I receptor inhibitor caused a dose-dependent reduction in both sustained Akt activity and in cell cycle progression that was particularly evident at the highest concentrations of linsitinib (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the results from Figs. 3B and 4B show that at the population level there is a duration and dose threshold of IGF-I-mediated signaling that must be met for a cell to progress from G1 to S phase. Although the percentage of cells in the population that exited G1 and entered S phase declined with increased IGF-I receptor blockade, the time of the G1 to S phase transition remained dynamically broad, with a range of < 5 to 24 h regardless of the presence or dose of linsitinib (Fig. 4C). The main effect of more IGF-I receptor activity was an increase in the number of cells entering S phase without variation in the time of entry (Fig. 4, C and D). This observation argues against cumulative signaling activity being critical for cell cycle progression, since at higher effective growth factor doses this level should be reached sooner, resulting in an earlier G1 exit. Rather, it appears that a signaling threshold must be exceeded that differs among individual cells in the population. To examine the concept of a signaling threshold for cell cycle progression in a second way, we analyzed IGF-I-mediated cell migration and compared it with effects on S phase entry after coincident treatment with varying concentrations of linsitinitib (Fig. 5). Incubation with IGF-I promoted cell migration that varied in distance traveled from ∼50 to >300 μm over 24 h (Fig. 5A). Under these conditions 22/25 cells entered S phase from 4–21 h after initiation of growth factor treatment (Fig. 4A, black circles). Linsitinib added at the same time as IGF-I caused a dose-dependent decline in integrated Akt signaling and in cell migration in the population as a whole (Fig. 5B). In single cells, however, there was not a strict relationship between the summed migration distance and cell cycle progression to S phase over 24 h. Although mean migration distance was diminished in the presence of linsitinib in the population, it varied substantially over this interval in individual cells, even at the highest inhibitor concentration (from <50 to >300 μm at [250 μm], Fig. 5C). Thus, as seen in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, a cell can demonstrate both growth factor-stimulated migration and Akt activity, but not exhibit cell cycle progression. Growth factors differ in their potency as mitogens in the same cell types despite the presence of appropriate receptors (12Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D.

Objectives To assess the net clinical benefit of a multifaceted intervention in emergency wards (educational lectures, posters, pocket cards, computerized clinical decision support systems and, where feasible, electronic reminders) for the prevention of venous thromboembolism. Patients/Methods Prospective cluster-randomized trial in 27 hospitals. After a pre-intervention period, centers were randomized as either intervention (n = 13) or control (n = 14). All patients over 40 years old, admitted to the emergency room, and hospitalized in a medical ward were included, totaling 1,402 (712 intervention and 690 control) and 15,351 (8,359 intervention and 6,992 control) in the pre-intervention and intervention periods, respectively. Results Symptomatic venous thromboembolism or major bleeding (primary outcome) occurred at 3 months in 3.1% and 3.2% of patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively (adjusted odds ratio: 1.02 [95% confidence interval: 0.78–1.34]). The rates of thromboembolism (1.9% vs. 1.9%), major bleedings (1.2% vs. 1.3%), and mortality (11.3% vs. 11.1%) did not differ between the groups. Between the pre-intervention and intervention periods, the proportion of patients who received prophylactic anticoagulant treatment more steeply increased in the intervention group (from 35.0% to 48.2%: +13.2%) than the control (40.7% to 44.1%: +3.4%), while the rate of adequate thromboprophylaxis remained stable in both groups (52.4% to 50.9%: -1.5%; 49.1% to 48.8%: -0.3%). Conclusions Our intervention neither improved adequate prophylaxis nor reduced the rates of clinical events.

https://openalex.org/W2402626899,"Photoacclimatory responses of the seagrass Zostera marina in the intertidal and subtidal zones were investigated by measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, photosynthetic pigments, leaf δ13C values, and shoot morphology in two bay systems. Intertidal plants had higher carotenoid concentrations than subtidal plants to avoid photodamage under excess light conditions during the day. The maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and minimum saturation irradiance (Ek) of the intertidal plants were higher than those of the subtidal plants, whereas photosynthetic efficiency (α) and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) were higher in subtidal plants. The intertidal plants also had significantly greater Stern-Volmer non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) than that of the subtidal plants. These results suggest that the subtidal plants photoacclimated to use limited light more efficiently, and the intertidal plants exhibited photosynthetic responses to minimize photodamage at excess irradiance. The δ13C values of leaf tissues were more negative in the intertidal plants than those in the subtidal plants, suggesting that the intertidal plants used atmospheric or dissolved CO2 for photosynthesis during emersion. Effective quantum yield (ΔF/Fm´) in the intertidal plants decreased more slowly after emersion than that in the subtidal plants, indicating higher desiccation tolerance of the intertidal plants. The intertidal plants also recovered more rapidly from desiccation damage than the subtidal plants, suggesting photosynthetic adaptation to desiccation stress. The photosynthetic plasticity of Z. marina in response to variable environmental conditions most likely allows this species to occur in the intertidal and subtidal zones."

At 1 month after MI, in the MI border and scar area, the LIF-injected mice had 31.41 ± 5.83 X-gal-negative cardiomyocytes/mm2, whereas the control mice had 12.34 ± 2.56 X-gal-negative cardiomyocytes/mm2 (p < 0.05). Using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyurinide (EdU) administration after MI, the percentages of EdU-positive CSP cells in the LIF-treated and control mice were 29.4 ± 2.7% and 10.6 ± 3.7%, respectively, which suggests that LIF influenced CSP proliferation. Moreover, LIF activated the Janus kinase (JAK)signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated (MEK)extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT pathways in CSPs in vivo and in vitro. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-bone marrow-chimeric CreLacZ mouse results indicated that LIF did not stimulate cardiogenesis via circulating bone marrow-derived cells during the 4 weeks following MI. Thus, LIF stimulates, in part, stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte regeneration by activating cardiac stem or precursor cells. This approach may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for cardiogenesis."

M. aeruginosa NIES-843, for which a complete genome has been sequenced, was used to characterize ribosomal proteins as biomarkers and to optimize conditions for observing ribosomal proteins as major peaks in a given mass spectrum. Thirty-one of 52 ribosomal subunit proteins were detected and identified along the mass spectrum. Fifty-five strains of M. aeruginosa from different habitats were analyzed using MALDI-TOF MS; among these samples, different ribosomal protein types were observed. A polygenetic analysis was performed using an unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means and different ribosomal protein types to classify the strains into five major clades. Two clades primarily contained toxic strains, and the other three clades contained exclusively non-toxic strains. This is the first study to differentiate cyanobacterial strains using MALDI-TOF MS."
https://openalex.org/W2395913867,"Hepatic cytochrome P450 levels are down-regulated during inflammatory disease states, which can cause changes in downstream drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity. Long-term, we seek sufficient new insight into P450-regulating mechanisms to correctly anticipate how an individual’s P450 expressions will respond when health and/or therapeutic interventions change. To date, improving explanatory mechanistic insight relies on knowledge gleaned from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical experiments augmented by case reports. We are working to improve that reality by developing means to undertake scientifically useful virtual experiments. So doing requires translating an accepted theory of immune system influence on P450 regulation into a computational model, and then challenging the model via in silico experiments. We build upon two existing agent-based models—an in silico hepatocyte culture and an in silico liver—capable of exploring and challenging concrete mechanistic hypotheses. We instantiate an in silico version of this hypothesis: in response to lipopolysaccharide, Kupffer cells down-regulate hepatic P450 levels via inflammatory cytokines, thus leading to a reduction in metabolic capacity. We achieve multiple in vitro and in vivo validation targets gathered from five wet-lab experiments, including a lipopolysaccharide-cytokine dose-response curve, time-course P450 down-regulation, and changes in several different measures of drug clearance spanning three drugs: acetaminophen, antipyrine, and chlorzoxazone. Along the way to achieving validation targets, various aspects of each model are falsified and subsequently refined. This iterative process of falsification-refinement-validation leads to biomimetic yet parsimonious mechanisms, which can provide explanatory insight into how, where, and when various features are generated. We argue that as models such as these are incrementally improved through multiple rounds of mechanistic falsification and validation, we will generate virtual systems that embody deeper credible, actionable, explanatory insight into immune system-drug metabolism interactions within individuals."

The CAD-associated locus 7q32.2 is unusual in that the lead variant, rs11556924, is not in strong linkage disequilibrium with any other variant and introduces a coding change in ZC3HC1, which encodes NIPA. In this study, we show that rs11556924 polymorphism is associated with lower regulatory phosphorylation of NIPA in the risk variant, resulting in NIPA with higher activity. Using a genome-editing approach we show that this causes an effective decrease in cyclin-B1 stability in the nucleus, thereby slowing its nuclear accumulation. By perturbing the rate of nuclear cyclin-B1 accumulation, rs11556924 alters the regulation of mitotic progression resulting in an extended mitosis.

Many of these loci do not affect known risk factors for CAD, such as blood pressure or LDL-cholesterol levels, which are the primary targets of current treatments for CAD. Therefore, studying the function of associated variants at these loci may identify novel gene pathways contributing to CAD, which may result in the development of novel therapeutics. The 7q32.2 CAD locus was first reported by Schunkert et al. (7Schunkert H. König I.R. Kathiresan S. Reilly M.P. Assimes T.L. Holm H. Preuss M. Stewart A.F. Barbalic M. Gieger C. Absher D.

SCFNIPA is only present in the nucleus and acts to ensure degradation of cyclin-B1 during interphase, keeping its levels in the nucleus low (8Bassermann F. von Klitzing C. Münch S. Bai R.Y.

Cyclin-B1 is a key regulator of mitotic entry (14Nurse P. et al.Universal control mechanism regulating onset of M-phase.Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar); its levels are low during interphase, then it begins to accumulate in the cytoplasm during S-phase, and then ultimately accumulates in the nucleus to promote entry into mitosis (15Pines J.

The key regulation of Cyclin-B1 occurs by preventing Cyclin-B1 from accumulating in the nucleus where it is required to bind to CDK1 to form the MPF (Maturation-Promoting Factor) complex. Two factors contribute to preventing Cyclin-B1 from accumulating in the nucleus - an atypical nuclear export signal in Cyclin-B1 promotes its export from the nucleus (17Li J. Meyer A.N.

The function of NIPA itself is regulated by phosphorylation at key residues, Ser-354 and Ser-359 targeted by the ERK1/2 kinases (20Illert A.L. Zech M. Moll C. Albers C. Kreutmair S. Peschel C.

Münch S. Morris S.W. Pagano M. Peschel C. Duyster J. et al.Multisite phosphorylation of nuclear interaction partner of ALK (NIPA) at G2/M involves cyclin B1/Cdk1.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15965-15972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Ser-354 and Ser-359 residues lie close to the Arg-363-His residue altered by rs11556924 (Fig. 1A). Ser-395 is also in the same region of the protein, although a bit further away in the secondary structure. Given these findings we hypothesized that the Arg-363-His polymorphism in NIPA affects Cyclin-B1 dynamics and cell cycle regulation through an impact on phosphorylation of NIPA and undertook experiments to investigate this. Our study provides a potential functional basis for the effect of allelic variation at rs11556924 on altered CAD risk. To determine if the Arg-363-His polymorphism has the potential to impact on phosphorylation of NIPA, we generated a predicted structural model of the two forms of the protein (Fig. 1B). In our model, in the Arg-363 (CAD-associated) variant, the arginine side chain forms a strong hydrogen bond with the Ser-395 residue, the phosphorylation target of CDK1. In the His-363 form of the protein, however, the side chain of the histidine residue points toward the inner core of the leucine rich repeat binding domain and does not interact with Ser-395. There are also conformational changes in the leucine-rich repeat protein binding domain. In particular, the His-363 variant has a looser structure due to the looser winding of several α-helices. To experimentally confirm whether these changes in the structure of the protein are sufficient to alter the phosphorylation of the protein in this region, we used in vitro kinase assays. To achieve this, the 2 NIPA variants, tagged with MBP (maltose-binding protein), were bacterially expressed and then used as substrates for a kinase assay using recombinant CDK1 and ERK2 kinases. MBP alone was used as a negative control and was not phosphorylated. A kinase assay using CDK1 kinase showed that phosphorylation of NIPA occurred at a mean rate of 0.494 ± 0.044 pmol phosphate/min in the Arg-363 variant compared with 0.694 ± 0.141 pmol phosphate/min in the His-363 variant, so phosphorylation is occurring significantly slower in the CAD-risk variant of the protein (p = 0.002) (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation by ERK2, however, showed no significant difference between phosphorylation of the 2 NIPA variants (p = 0.622), with a mean rate of 0.184 ± 0.065 pmol phosphate/min in the His-363 variant and 0.198 ± 0.025 pmol phosphate/min in the Arg-363 (Fig. 1D). To further validate this effect of rs11556924 on the regulatory phosphorylation of NIPA, we used MS/MS proteomics to carry out phospho-analysis of the NIPA protein. To achieve this, vectors expressing each variant were generated and expressed in HEK293T cells. We then immunoprecipitated NIPA and used MS/MS to examine its phosphorylation. We enriched for phospho-peptides using TiO2 beads and used SILAC quantitation to look for differences in the level of phosphorylation at these sites. A total of 39 phosphorylation sites in NIPA were identified in our phospho-enriched samples. We were able to quantify the relative level of phosphorylation at 30 of these sites. Phosphorylation at Ser-395 was measurable using this approach, but phosphorylation at Ser-354 and Ser-359 was not, due to low levels of peptide detection. The site at Ser-395 had 44% lower phosphorylation of the Arg-363 variant compared with the His-363 variant (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the polymorphism is perturbing phosphorylation at this site. Having shown that the coding variation caused by rs11556924 alters regulatory phosphorylation of NIPA, we next investigated the effect of the SNP on endogenous protein function in cells. To do this we created isogenic lines differing only at rs11556924, using a recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) genome editing approach (Fig. 2A). rAAV is an effective method for generating small genetic alterations (22Khan I.F.

Hendrickson E.A. et al.The mechanism of gene targeting in human somatic cells.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004251Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). rAAV genome editing relies on homologous recombination for targeting and does not generate double-strand breaks or cause the off-target effects, which have been associated with nuclease-based methods of genome editing (31Kim H.S. Bernitz J.M. Lee D.-F. Lemischka I.R. et al.Genomic editing tools to model human diseases with isogenic pluripotent stem cells.Stem Cells Dev. 2014; 23: 2673-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As the role of ZC3HC1 in CAD is unknown, it is uncertain which cardiovascular cell type is most relevant. Also, it is not possible to generate clonal knock-in cell lines in primary cell types. For these reasons, we carried out genome editing in the pseudo-diploid colon carcinoma cell line DLD-1, which has been extensively used as a target cell line for this type of genome editing (22Khan I.F.

The DLD-1 cell line, which is heterozygous for the SNP, was targeted with rAAV carrying each allele of rs11556924 allowing us to knock in either genotype, generating 4 homozygote CAD-non-risk lines, 4 heterozygote lines (with a recombination event but no change in genotype) and 3 homozygote CAD-risk lines. Genotypes were confirmed by sequencing across the SNP (Fig. 2B). Examining multiple lines of each genotype helps to ensure that differences between lines of different genotypes are down to the changes generated at rs11556924 and not due to off-target effects. A previous study had suggested that rs11556924 may be associated with expression of the KLHDC10 gene, which is the next gene downstream from ZC3HC1 (19kb away) (28Erbilgin A. Civelek M. Romanoski C.E. Pan C. Hagopian R. Berliner J.A. Lusis A.J. et al.Identification of CAD candidate genes in GWAS loci and their expression in vascular cells.J. Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 1894-1905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To test for an effect on the expression of KLHDC10, and also to test whether rs11556924 had any effect on expression of ZC3HC1 itself, we examined mRNA levels of both genes in the genome edited lines of all 3 genotypes using qRT-PCR. There was no change in expression of either ZC3HC1 (p = 0.442) (Fig. 2C) or KLHDC10 (p = 0.291) (Fig. 2D), indicating that the SNP does not alter expression of either of these genes. Phosphorylation of NIPA at Ser-395 acts to deactivate NIPA, preventing it from ubiquitinating Cyclin-B1 and thus allowing accumulation of Cyclin-B1 in the nucleus. We therefore next studied the rs11556924 genome edited lines to test whether the SNP genotype impacted on Cyclin-B1 stability. We first examined total Cyclin-B1 in cells of the three genotypes using Western blotting with an α-Cyclin-B1 antibody. We found that Cyclin-B1 levels were higher in CAD-risk genotype cells compared with CAD-non-risk cells, with the heterozygote intermediate between the homozygotes (Fig. 3A). The overall trend was significant (ANOVA p = 0.017) and post-hoc tests showed a significant difference between homozygotes (p = 0.015). This finding was contrary to our expectations, a reduction of NIPA phosphorylation in the CAD risk genotype group would have been expected to result in more active NIPA and consequently lower levels of Cyclin-B1. To further examine the impact of rs11556924 on Cyclin-B1 regulation we needed to examine the impact of rs11556924 on its stability in the nucleus more directly. To investigate the effect of rs11556924 on the nuclear stability of Cyclin-B1, we examined the effect of genotype on Cyclin-B1 at the time in the cell cycle when this effect is likely to be most important, the time of mitotic entry as cyclin-B1 begins to accumulate in the nucleus. We hypothesized that the rate of nuclear accumulation could be altered, perturbing cell cycle dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we expressed Cyclin-B1-GFP in the genome edited cell lines, and used live microscopy to monitor the nuclear entry of Cyclin-B1-GFP (Fig. 3B, i). We then quantified the relative amount of Cyclin-B1-GFP in the nucleus at 2 min intervals in the time around mitotic entry but prior to nuclear-envelope breakdown. The rate of nuclear entry of Cyclin-B1-GFP was reduced in cells of the risk genotype with risk cells having a mean rate of 0.095 ± 0.032 compared with 0.134 ± 0.048 in cells of the non-risk genotype (p = 0.004) (Fig. 3B, ii). To confirm that the effect of rs11556924 on Cyclin-B1 nuclear accumulation was due to altered stability of Cyclin-B1, we tested the effect of rs11556924 on the stability of endogenous Cyclin-B1. To achieve this, we blocked protein synthesis in our genome edited cell lines using cycloheximide. Total Cyclin-B1 levels were determined by Western blotting analysis in cells treated with cycloheximide for 5 h and then the relative amount of Cyclin-B1 quantified (Fig. 3C). There was a trend toward a lower amount remaining in the CAD-risk genotype cells compared with CAD-non-risk, although this difference was not significant (p = 0.167). Having demonstrated that rs11556924 alters the ability of NIPA to regulate the levels of Cyclin-B1 in the nucleus, we next investigated the effect of this altered regulation on control of the cell cycle. Initially, we tested the effect of rs11556924 genotype in the genome-edited cell lines on the mitotic index of these cells, i.e. the proportion of cells in mitosis at any one time. We found an increase in the mitotic index of the cells of the CAD-risk genotype, with a mean of 5.50 ± 0.26% compared with CAD-non-risk cells with a mean of 3.62 ± 0.30% with the heterozygote again showing an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 4A) (ANOVA p = 0.012). Post-hoc testing showed a significant difference between homozygotes (p = 0.010). There are several possible explanations for this higher mitotic index in cells with the CAD risk genotype, the CAD-risk cells could be proceeding through the cell cycle more quickly, which would result in faster cellular proliferation. Alternatively they could be arresting in mitosis due to perturbation of Cyclin-B1 dynamics leading to mitotic errors, or simply taking longer to proceed through mitosis, which could result in slower proliferation. Given our observation that cells of the risk genotype accumulate Cyclin-B1 into the nucleus more slowly (Fig. 3), our hypothesis was that the most likely explanation for the higher mitotic index in these cells was that they were taking longer to complete mitosis. To test this we used live imaging of cells of the non-risk and risk homozygote genotypes and measured the time taken to complete mitosis. There was an increase in the mean time taken to complete mitosis in the cells carrying the risk genotype, with a mean of 35.4 ± 1.1 min compared with a mean of 32.0 ± 0.9 min in non-risk genotype cells (p = 0.011) (Fig. 4B). To test whether perturbation of Cyclin-B1 dynamics resulted in errors in mitosis, which could in turn result in a longer mitosis, we assessed the success of chromosome segregation by carrying out chromosome spreads of metaphase cells and counting the number of chromosomes in each cell. Errors in chromosome segregation would be expected to cause a widening in the distribution of chromosome number in the cells. We did not see this effect; the variation in chromosome number was the same in cells of the non-risk and risk genotypes (p = 0.652) (Fig. 4C). As the dynamics of Cyclin-B1 accumulation and the duration of mitosis are perturbed by rs11556924, this would be expected to alter the rate of proliferation of the cells. In order to test the effect of the SNP on proliferation, we used a Sulforhodamine-B assay of cell number across 72 h of cell growth in the genome-edited lines. There was no difference between cells of the different genotypes (p = 0.522) (Fig. 4D). Given that in the CAD-risk genotype cells, mitosis is taking longer, but these cells do not proliferate more slowly, we wondered whether this apparent contradiction was caused by decreased apoptosis in the CAD-risk cells. To test this, we measured apoptosis in the cell lines using a flow cytometry annexin-V assay. We found no detectable difference in the levels of apoptosis between cells of different rs11556924 genotypes (p = 0.251) (Fig. 4E). GWAS studies have been very fruitful in identifying SNPs that are associated with altered risk of various complex diseases, including CAD. In many cases, there are several variants in high linkage disequilibrium at each locus that are associated with disease and identifying the causal SNP can be challenging (11Braenne I. Civelek M. Vilne B. Di Narzo A. Johnson A.D. Zhao Y. Reiz B. Codoni V. Webb T.R. Foroughi Asl H. Hamby S.E. Zeng L. Trégouët D.A. Hao K. Topol E.J. Schadt E.E. Yang X. Samani N.J. Björkegren J.L. Erdmann J.

Biol. 2015; 35: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As a result, it is often difficult to predict which gene or genes are the causal ones at a particular CAD-associated locus. Even where the causal gene at a locus is easily predicted, many of those genes do not have known roles in cardiovascular function. Functional analysis of these genes and variants may increase our understanding of the processes of CAD and therefore have the potential to lead to novel therapeutic targets. The rs11556924 SNP in the ZC3HC1 gene has been shown to be associated with CAD, with a 9% increased risk with each additional copy of the CAD-associated allele (7Schunkert H. König I.R. Kathiresan S.

In this case, the SNP is a coding change in the gene, resulting in an amino acid substitution from arginine to histidine. The effect of this substitution on protein function is as yet unknown. In this study, in addition to investigating the effect of the rs11556924 polymorphism on the biochemistry of the NIPA protein encoded by the ZC3HC1 gene, we have utilized a genome editing approach to investigate the effect of the SNP on ZC3HC1 gene function in human cells. This is a powerful approach for investigating the function of SNPs identified from GWAS studies (29Spisák S. Lawrenson K. Fu Y. Csabai I. Cottman R.T. Seo J.H. Haiman C. Han Y. Lenci R. Li Q.

This lesion is also formed endogenously in DNA from lipid oxidation. Recombinant human DNA polymerase η (hpol η) can replicate oligonucleotide templates containing 1,N6-ϵdA. In steady-state kinetic analysis, hpol η preferred to incorporate dATP and dGTP, compared with dTTP. Mass spectral analysis of incorporation products also showed preferred purine (A, G) incorporation and extensive −1 frameshifts, suggesting pairing of the inserted purine and slippage before further replication. Five x-ray crystal structures of hpol η ternary complexes were determined, three at the insertion and two at the extension stage. Two insertion complexes revealed incoming non-hydrolyzable dATP or dGTP analogs not pairing with but instead in a staggered configuration relative to 1,N6-ϵdA in the anti conformation, thus opposite the 5′-T in the template, explaining the proclivity for frameshift misincorporation. In another insertion complex, dTTP was positioned opposite 1,N6-ϵdA, and the adduct base was in the syn conformation, with formation of two hydrogen bonds. At the extension stage, with either an incorporated dA or dT opposite 1,N6-ϵdA and 2′-deoxythymidine-5′-[(α,β)-imido]triphosphate opposite the 5′-A, the 3′-terminal nucleoside of the primer was disordered, consistent with the tendency not to incorporate dTTP opposite 1,N6-ϵdA.

Some specific types of DNA damage can result from either exogenous or endogenous sources, as exemplified by the etheno (ϵ) adducts (9.Swenberg J.A. Lu K. Moeller B.C. Gao L. Upton P.B. Nakamura J.

We analyzed incorporation events using steady-state kinetics and LC-MS analysis of primers extended opposite 1,N6-ϵdA by hpol η, in different sequence contexts. The results show hpol η bypass past 1,N6-ϵdA in a highly error-prone manner, with a proclivity for incorporation of purines and generation of frameshifts. We also describe five x-ray crystal structures of hpol η ternary complexes, three containing 1,N6-ϵdA paired with dTTP, dAMPNPP, or dGMPNPP (non-hydrolyzable dATP/dGTP analogs) at the insertion stage and two further structures of complexes at the extension stage, with either dA or dT opposite 1,N6-ϵdA followed by a nascent pair between template A and an incoming dTMPNPP. To determine the efficiency and fidelity of translesion synthesis 1,N6-ϵdA adducts by hpol η, steady-state kinetic analysis was performed. With an unmodified template (substrate B, Table 1), hpol η incorporated a single dNTP opposite A in the order of preference T ≫ A > G > C (Table 2), as expected. However, incorporation of dTTP opposite 1,N6-ϵdA was very unfavorable, with a drastically decreased catalytic efficiency (1000-fold) compared with that of dTTP insertion opposite A (Table 2). In this study, dATP and dGTP were inserted more efficiently (3.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively, Table 2) than dTTP opposite 1,N6-ϵdA. These results indicated that hpol η catalyzes translesion synthesis opposite 1,N6-ϵdA in a very error-prone manner.

Sequences of full-length extension products and relative yields were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1 and TABLE 4, TABLE 5, TABLE 6). The −1 frameshift products accounted for 37% of total products in a sequence with a T positioned 5′ of the 1,N6-ϵdA (substrate D-U, TABLE 1, TABLE 4). The fraction of extension products with a G incorporated opposite the lesion was 27% and with an A incorporated opposite the lesion was 25%. Small amounts of products with T (11%) and C (1%) incorporated were also observed in the mass spectra. The formation of the −1 frameshift products may be the result of the incoming dATP skipping the lesion and pairing with the neighboring base T (Table 4).TABLE 4LC-MS analysis of products of hpol η replication past 1,N6-ϵdA (T 5′-adjacent to adduct, Substrate D-U) Open table in a new tab TABLE 5LC-MS analysis of products of hpol η replication past template 1,N6-ϵdA (C 5′-adjacent to adduct, Substrate A-U) Open table in a new tab TABLE 6LC-MS analysis of products of hpol η replication past template 1,N6-ϵdA (T 5′-adjacent to adduct, Substrate C-U) (34.Levine R.L.

LC-MS/MS results revealed 14 sequences of full-length products corresponding to nine peaks of M − 2H ions (Table 5). With this template, 70% of the products were due to −1 frameshifts, followed by 16% A and 14% T incorporation opposite the lesion. Extension products containing a G opposite 1,N6-ϵdA were not observed in this setting, presumably because the dGTP skipped 1,N6-ϵdA and paired with the C positioned 5′ to the lesion to yield a frameshift. Human pol η, like many other DNA polymerases (35.Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P.

Some extension oligonucleotides were added to the second nucleotide following the blunt end in this experiment (Table 5). We also included a template containing 1,N6-ϵdA in another sequence context with a C in the 5′ position (substrate C-U, Table 1), one that had been used in a previous study of 1,N6-ϵdA by Levine et al. (34.Levine R.L. Miller H. Grollman A. Ohashi E. Ohmori H. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Moriya M. Translesion DNA synthesis catalyzed by human pol η and pol κ across 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine.J. Biol.

Again we found −1 frameshifts (39%, dominated by an A in the next position) and incorporation of A (29%) and G (23%) opposite 1,N6-ϵdA, instead of T (8%) and C (<1%), consistent with our results from the steady-state study with this sequence (Table 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). We determined five crystal structures of ternary hpol η-DNA·dNTP complexes with template strands containing 1,N6-ϵdA, three of which were trapped at the insertion stage. The resolution of these three structures varied between 2.12 and 2.26 Å (Table 7), and representative images of the quality of the final electron density are provided in Fig. 2, A–C. The first two complexes are of incoming dAMPNPP and dGMPNPP opposite 1,N6-ϵdA, the nucleoside triphosphates preferentially incorporated according to the steady-state kinetic data (ϵdA:dAMPNPP and ϵdA:dGMPNPP, see TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3, TABLE 7). The structures revealed that the purine bases of incoming nucleotides adopt a staggered orientation relative to 1,N6-ϵdA in the anti conformation. This arrangement leads to extensive cross-strand stacking between the adducted base and A or G (Fig. 3). Stacking interactions between 1,N6-ϵdA and adenines from the incoming nucleotide and 3′-adjacent template residue appear to be slightly more favorable (Fig. 3B) compared with the structure with incoming G (Fig. 3D). In the latter, the adduct base appears to have shifted slightly into the major groove, whereas the relative positions of the base portions of incoming nucleotides relative to the template A located 3′ to the adduct are very similar in the two structures. In both, Gln-38 forms an H-bond to the sugar O4′ of 1,N6-ϵdA (Fig. 3). In the structure with dGMPNPP, guanine N2 and Gln-38 are also engaged in an H-bond (Fig. 3B), although this interaction is absent in the insertion-stage complex with incoming dAMPNPP (Fig. 3D). Shared properties of the two structures are the conformat"
https://openalex.org/W2400893476,"Background The recently updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol treatment guidelines outline a paradigm shift in the approach to cardiovascular risk reduction. One major change included a recommendation that practitioners prescribe fixed dose statin regimens rather than focus on specific LDL targets. The goal of this study was to determine whether achieved LDL or statin intensity was more strongly associated with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) using practice-based data from electronic health records (EHR). Methods We analyzed the EHR data of more than 40,000 adult patients on statin therapy between 1995 and 2013. Demographic and clinical variables were extracted from coded data and unstructured clinical text. To account for treatment selection bias we performed propensity score stratification as well as 1:1 propensity score matched analyses. Conditional Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to identify variables associated with MACE. Results We identified 7,373 adults with complete data whose cholesterol appeared to be actively managed. In a stratified propensity score analysis of the entire cohort over 3.3 years of follow-up, achieved LDL was a significant predictor of MACE outcome (Hazard Ratio 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.2; P < 0.0004), while statin intensity was not. In a 1:1 propensity score matched analysis performed to more aggressively control for covariate balance between treatment groups, achieved LDL remained significantly associated with MACE (HR 1.3; 95% CI, 1.03–1.7; P = 0.03) while treatment intensity again was not a significant predictor. Conclusions Using EHR data we found that on-treatment achieved LDL level was a significant predictor of MACE. Statin intensity alone was not associated with outcomes. These findings imply that despite recent guidelines, achieved LDL levels are clinically important and LDL titration strategies warrant further investigation in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2395940075,"Basal release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells modulates contractile activity in the corpus cavernosum via inhibition of the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway. We aimed to investigate nitric oxide bioavailability, oxidative stress and the Rho-kinase pathway in the relaxation of the corpus cavernosum of an obese and diabetic model of mice (db/db mice). We hypothesized that in db/db mice impaired relaxation induced by Rho-kinase inhibitor is accompanied by diminished NO bioavailability, increased oxidative stress and upregulation of the RhoA/Rho-kinase signalling pathway. Cavernosal strips from male lean and non-diabetic db/+ and db/db mice were mounted in myographs and isometric force in response to Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was recorded. Enzyme activity and protein expression of oxidative stress markers and key molecules of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway were analyzed. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 concentration-dependently caused corpus cavernosum relaxation and inhibited cavernosal contractions. Nonetheless, a rightward shift in the curves obtained in corpus cavernosum of db/db mice was observed. Compared to db/+, this strain presented increased active RhoA, higher MYPT-1 phosphorylation stimulated by phenylephrine, and increased expression of ROKα and Rho-GEFs. Further, we observed normal expression of endothelial and neuronal NOS in corpus cavernosum of db/db mice. However, nitrate/nitrate (NOx) levels were diminished, suggesting decreased NO bioavailability. We measured the oxidant status and observed increased lipid peroxidation, with decreased SOD activity and expression. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in db/db mice, upregulation of the RhoA/Rho-kinase signalling pathway was accompanied by decreased NO bioavailability and increased oxidative stress contributing to impaired relaxation of the corpus cavermosum of db/db mice."
https://openalex.org/W2399367657,"We present the results of a longitudinal surveillance study (1995-2014) on fluoroquinolone resistance (FQ-R) among Belgian non-invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 5,602). For many years, the switch to respiratory fluoroquinolones for the treatment of (a)typical pneumonia had no impact on FQ-R levels. However, since 2011 we observed a significant decrease in susceptibility towards ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin with peaks of 9.0%, 6.6% and 3.1% resistant isolates, respectively. Resistance to moxifloxacin arised sporadically, and remained <1% throughout the entire study period. We observed classical topoisomerase mutations in gyrA (n = 25), parC (n = 46) and parE (n = 3) in varying combinations, arguing against clonal expansion of FQ-R. The impact of recombination with co-habiting commensal streptococci on FQ-R remains marginal (10.4%). Notably, we observed that a rare combination of DNA Gyrase mutations (GyrA_S81L/GyrB_P454S) suffices for high-level moxifloxacin resistance, contrasting current model. Interestingly, 85/422 pneumococcal strains display MICCIP values which were lowered by at least four dilutions by reserpine, pointing at involvement of efflux pumps in FQ-R. In contrast to susceptible strains, isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin significantly overexpressed the ABC pump PatAB in comparison to reference strain S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, but this could only be linked to disruptive terminator mutations in a fraction of these. Conversely, no difference in expression of the Major Facilitator PmrA, unaffected by reserpine, was noted between susceptible and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Finally, we observed that four isolates displayed intermediate to high-level ciprofloxacin resistance without any known molecular resistance mechanism. Focusing future molecular studies on these isolates, which are also commonly found in other studies, might greatly assist in the battle against rising pneumococcal drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2400484846,"Background A better knowledge of the burden and risk factors associated with severity due to spider bites would lead to improved management with a reduction of sequelae usually seen for this neglected health problem, and would ensure proper use of antivenoms in remote localities in the Brazilian Amazon. The aim of this study was to analyze the profile of spider bites reported in the state of Amazonas in the Western Brazilian Amazon, and to investigate potential risk factors associated with severity of envenomation. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a case-control study in order to identify factors associated with spider bite severity in the Western Brazilian Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Patients evolving to any severity criteria were considered cases and those with non-severe bites were included in the control group. All variables were retrieved from the official Brazilian reporting systems. Socioeconomical and environmental components were also included in a multivariable analysis in order to identify ecological determinants of incidence and severity. A total of 1,181 spider bites were recorded, resulting in an incidence of 4 cases per 100,000 person/year. Most of the spider bites occurred in males (65.8%). Bites mostly occurred in rural areas (59.5%). The most affected age group was between 16 and 45 years old (50.9%). A proportion of 39.7% of the bites were related to work activities. Antivenom was prescribed to 39% of the patients. Envenomings recorded from urban areas [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.40 (95%CI = 0.30–0.71; p<0.001)] and living in a municipality with a mean health system performance index (MHSPI >median [OR = 0.64 (95%CI = 0.39–0.75; p<0.001)] were independently associated with decreased risk of severity. Work related accidents [OR = 2.09 (95%CI = 1.49–2.94; p<0.001)], Indigenous status [OR = 2.15 (95%CI = 1.19–3.86; p = 0.011)] and living in a municipality located >300 km away from the state capital Manaus [OR = 1.90 (95%CI = 1.28–2.40; p<0.001)] were independently associated with a risk of severity. Living in a municipality located >300 km away from the state capital Manaus [OR = 1.53 (95%CI = 1.15–2.02; p = 0.003)] and living in a municipality with a MHSPI <median [OR = 1.91 (95%CI = 1.28–2.47; p = 0.002)] increased the odds of antivenom underdosage. Conclusions Spider bites is prevalent across the study region with a higher incidence in the rainy season in rural areas. Spider bites can be painful and lead to local manifestations but rarely result in life-threatening envenoming. Major local complications were dermonecrosis and secondary infection in cases diagnosed as Loxosceles bites. Based on the correlations shown here, envenomings occurring in remote rural areas, Indigenous status and living in a municipality located >300 km away from the state capital Manaus could be contributing factors to higher severity of spider envenomings in this area, as well as to antivenom underdosage."
https://openalex.org/W2395493569,"Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease affecting the skin, tissues and in some cases the bones, caused by the environmental pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans). Its mode of transmission is still elusive. Delayed treatment may cause irreversible disabilities with consequent social and economic impacts on the victim. Socio-cultural beliefs, practices and attitudes in endemic communities have been shown to influence timely treatment causing disease management, prevention and control a great challenge. An assessment of these factors in endemic localities is important in designing successful intervention strategies. Considering this, we assessed the knowledge, attitude and practices regarding BU in three endemic localities in the South West region, Cameroon to highlight existing misconceptions that need to be addressed to enhance prompt treatment and facilitate effective prevention and control.A cross-sectional study was executed in three BU endemic health districts. Using qualitative and quantitative approaches we surveyed 320 randomly selected household heads, interviewed BU patients and conducted three focus group discussions (FGDs) to obtain information on awareness, beliefs, treatment, and attitudes towards victims. The influence of socio-demographic factors on these variables was investigated.Respondents (84.4%) had a good knowledge of BU though only 65% considered it a health problem while 49.4% believed it is contagious. Socio-demographic factors significantly (P<0.05) influenced awareness of BU, knowledge and practice on treatment and attitudes towards victims. Although the majority of respondents stated the hospital as the place for appropriate treatment, FGDs and some BU victims preferred witchdoctors/herbalists and prayers, and considered the hospital as the last option. We documented beliefs about the disease which could delay treatment.Though we are reporting a high level of knowledge of BU, there exist fallacies about BU and negative attitudes towards victims in communities studied. Efforts towards disease eradication must first of all target these misconceptions."
https://openalex.org/W2408036904,"Background Switzerland recommends individuals who originate from high-prevalence countries to be screened for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, not all these persons are equally at risk. We thus aimed to describe the number and characteristics of persons with HCV infection born outside of Switzerland. Methods We compared characteristics of anti-HCV-positive individuals in the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS) and of HCV cases reported to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), with those of the general population in Switzerland. Persons who inject drugs (PWID) and persons who do not inject drugs (non-PWID) were compared by age groups for different countries of origin (represented by ≥1% of participants in the SCCS or FOPH). Results We included 4,199 persons from the SCCS and 26,610 cases from the FOPH. Both groups had similar characteristics. In both data sources non-PWID were more frequent in foreign-born than in Swiss-born persons (63% versus 34% in the SCCS). The only subgroup with a clearly higher proportion both in the SCCS and FOPH than in the general population were persons over 60 years from Italy and Spain, with a 3.7- and 2.8-fold increase in the SCCS. These persons were non-PWID (99%), less frequently HIV- and anti-HBc positive and more often female than PWID from Italy and Spain; cirrhosis at enrolment was frequent (31%). Their HCV genotypes were consistent with those observed in elderly non-PWID of their birth countries. In the FOPH a higher proportion than in the general population was also seen for cases from Georgia and Russia. Conclusion The identification of subgroups in which HCV infection is particularly frequent might allow for better targeting HCV screening among foreign-born persons in Switzerland and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2398852472,"Objective Recent guidelines recommend the use by healthcare personnel of a fit-tested N95 particulate respirator or higher-grade respiratory precaution in a patient undergoing bronchoscopy when pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is suspected. However, PTB may be unexpectedly diagnosed in this setting and therefore not evaluated, resulting in the unexpected exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) of healthcare workers in the bronchoscopy suite. Here, we examined the incidence of unexpected exposure to MTB during flexible bronchoscopy and determined the exposure-related factors. Methods Between 2011 and 2013, a retrospective study was conducted to evaluate unexpected diagnoses of PTB in the bronchoscopy suite. During the study period, 1650 consecutive patients for whom previous CT scans were available and who underwent bronchoscopy for respiratory disease other than PTB were included. The results of bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage, and post-bronchoscopic sputum were reviewed. Results PTB was unexpectedly diagnosed in 76 patients (4.6%). The presence of anthracofibrosis [odds ratio (OR), 3.878; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.291–11.650; P = 0.016), bronchiectasis (OR, 1.974; 95% CI, 1.095–3.557; P = 0.024), or atelectasis (OR, 1.740; 95% CI, 1.010–2.903; P = 0.046) as seen on chest CT scan was independently associated with unexpected PTB. Patients with both anthracofibrosis and atelectasis were at much higher risk of unexpected PTB (OR, 4.606; 95% CI, 1.383–15.342; P = 0.013). Conclusions The risk of MTB exposure by healthcare personnel in the bronchoscopy suite due to patients with undiagnosed PTB has been underestimated. Therefore, in geographic regions with an intermediate PTB prevalence, such as South Korea (97/100,000 persons per year), higher-grade respiratory precaution, such as a fit-tested N95 particulate respirator, should be considered to prevent occupational exposure to MTB during routine bronchoscopy, especially in patients with CT-confirmed anthracofibrosis, bronchiectasis, or atelectasis."
https://openalex.org/W2399274264,"Maintenance of the physiological morphologies of different types of cells and tissues is essential for the normal functioning of each system in the human body. Dynamic variations in cell and tissue morphologies depend on accurate adjustments of the cytoskeletal system. The cytoskeletal system in the glomerulus plays a key role in the normal process of kidney filtration. To enhance the understanding of the possible roles of the cytoskeleton in glomerular diseases, we constructed the Glomerular Cytoskeleton Network (GCNet), which shows the protein-protein interaction network in the glomerulus, and identified several possible key cytoskeletal components involved in glomerular diseases. In this study, genes/proteins annotated to the cytoskeleton were detected by Gene Ontology analysis, and glomerulus-enriched genes were selected from nine available glomerular expression datasets. Then, the GCNet was generated by combining these two sets of information. To predict the possible key cytoskeleton components in glomerular diseases, we then examined the common regulation of the genes in GCNet in the context of five glomerular diseases based on their transcriptomic data. As a result, twenty-one cytoskeleton components as potential candidate were highlighted for consistently down- or up-regulating in all five glomerular diseases. And then, these candidates were examined in relation to existing known glomerular diseases and genes to determine their possible functions and interactions. In addition, the mRNA levels of these candidates were also validated in a puromycin aminonucleoside(PAN) induced rat nephropathy model and were also matched with existing Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) transcriptomic data. As a result, there are 15 of 21 candidates in PAN induced nephropathy model were consistent with our predication and also 12 of 21 candidates were matched with differentially expressed genes in the DN transcriptomic data. By providing a novel interaction network and prediction, GCNet contributes to improving the understanding of normal glomerular function and will be useful for detecting target cytoskeleton molecules of interest that may be involved in glomerular diseases in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2394789040,"To precisely quantify the circumferential strains created along the radicular dentin of maxillary incisors during a simulated clinical procedure of lateral compaction.Six miniature strain gauges were bonded on the roots of fourteen recently extracted maxillary central incisors that were subjected to root canal instrumentation. The strain gauges were bonded at three levels (apical, middle, and coronal) and four aspects (buccal, lingual, mesial, and distal) of the roots. Each tooth was embedded in a PVC cylinder containing polyvinyl-siloxane impression material. Root filling was then performed by simulating the clinical procedure of lateral compaction using nickel-titanium finger spreaders. The force applied to the spreader and the strains developing in the surface root dentin were continuously recorded at a frequency of 10 Hz.The highest strains that developed during lateral compaction were in the mesial and distal aspects at the apical level of the root. The magnitudes of the maximal mesial/distal strains at the apical as well as the mid-root levels were approximately 2.5-3 times higher than those at the buccal/lingual aspects (p = 0.041). The strains decreased significantly (p<0.04) from the apical through the mid-root levels to the coronal level, yielding gradients of 2.5- and 6-fold, respectively. The mesial and distal strains were consistently tensile and did not differ significantly; however, the buccal strains were generally 35-65% higher than the lingual strains (p = 0.078). Lateral compaction resulted in the gradual build-up of residual strains, resulting in generation of a 'stair-step' curve. These strains declined gradually and almost completely disappeared after 1000 sec.With proper mounting of several miniature strain gauges at various levels and aspects of the root, significant circumferential strains can be monitored under clinically relevant compaction forces. The residual strains at the end of lateral compaction are not stored in the dentin but decrease gradually to negligible levels."
https://openalex.org/W2406431177,"The structural analyses of four metabolic enzymes that maintain and regulate the stationary growth phase of Escherichia coli have been performed primarily drawing on the results obtained from solution small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and other structural techniques. The proteins are (i) class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FbaB); (ii) inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase); (iii) 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate isomerase (KduI); and (iv) glutamate decarboxylase (GadA). The enzyme FbaB, that until now had an unknown structure, is predicted to fold into a TIM-barrel motif that form globular protomers which SAXS experiments show associate into decameric assemblies. In agreement with previously reported crystal structures, PPase forms hexamers in solution that are similar to the previously reported X-ray crystal structure. Both KduI and GadA that are responsible for carbohydrate (pectin) metabolism and acid stress responses, respectively, form polydisperse mixtures consisting of different oligomeric states. Overall the SAXS experiments yield additional insights into shape and organization of these metabolic enzymes and further demonstrate the utility of hybrid methods, i.e., solution SAXS combined with X-ray crystallography, bioinformatics and predictive 3D-structural modeling, as tools to enrich structural studies. The results highlight the structural complexity that the protein components of metabolic networks may adopt which cannot be fully captured using individual structural biology techniques."
