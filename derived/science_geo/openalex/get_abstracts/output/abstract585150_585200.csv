Park et al. found that these animals fuel anaerobic glycolysis with fructose by a rewired pathway that avoids tissue damage (see the Perspective by Storz and McClelland). These results provide insight into the adaptations that this strange social rodent has to make for life underground. They also have implications for medical practice, particularly for understanding how to protect tissues from hypoxia. Science , this issue p. 307 ; see also p. 248"

On investigating microtubule breakage in live fibroblasts, Xu et al. found that if they were not acetylated, long-lived microtubules underwent frequent rupture after buckling. Acetylation makes microtubules more mechanically stable, facilitates sliding between filaments, and makes the lattice more plastic. Science , this issue p. 328"
https://openalex.org/W2606412267,"The environment experienced by an animal can sometimes influence gene expression for one or a few subsequent generations. Here, we report the observation that a temperature-induced change in expression from a Caenorhabditis elegans heterochromatic gene array can endure for at least 14 generations. Inheritance is primarily in cis with the locus, occurs through both oocytes and sperm, and is associated with altered trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) before the onset of zygotic transcription. Expression profiling reveals that temperature-induced expression from endogenous repressed repeats can also be inherited for multiple generations. Long-lasting epigenetic memory of environmental change is therefore possible in this animal."

The strong carbon-hydrogen bonds of methane can be activated by heterogeneous catalysts but often at temperatures that make it difficult to control reactions selectively. Liang et al. show that methane, adsorbed on the stoichiometric IrO 2 (110) under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions, reacts with exposed iridium atoms to break the carbon-hydrogen bonds at temperatures as low as 150 K. On heating, the surface fragments react cleanly with surface oxygen to form carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water. Science , this issue p. 299"

One explanation is that the protective gut microbiota is not fully established in infants. How the microbiota might protect against pathogens is unclear. Kim et al. found that members of the group of strictly anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria known as clostridia protect neonatal mice against diarrhea-causing pathogens. The protective effect is enhanced by giving mice the metabolite succinate in drinking water. Succinate favors colonization of the neonatal gut by cluster IV and XIVa clostridia and concomitantly excludes Salmonella typhimurium. Science , this issue p. 315"
https://openalex.org/W3101694027,"We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift z = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy."
https://openalex.org/W2607462092,"The molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation in isogenic bacterial populations remain poorly understood. We report that AcrAB-TolC, the main multidrug efflux pump of Escherichia coli, exhibits a strong partitioning bias for old cell poles by a segregation mechanism that is mediated by ternary AcrAB-TolC complex formation. Mother cells inheriting old poles are phenotypically distinct and display increased drug efflux activity relative to daughters. Consequently, we find systematic and long-lived growth differences between mother and daughter cells in the presence of subinhibitory drug concentrations. A simple model for biased partitioning predicts a population structure of long-lived and highly heterogeneous phenotypes. This straightforward mechanism of generating sustained growth rate differences at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations has implications for understanding the emergence of multidrug resistance in bacteria."

One limitation is interference by the electron beam. Sun et al. monitored the oxidation of iron nanoparticles in solution by using small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations (see the Perspective by Cadavid and Cabot). These methods revealed the formation of voids within the nanoparticles, diffusion of material into and out of the nanoparticles, and ultimately the coalescence of the voids.

These so-called electronic nematic states usually have inversion symmetry, but theorists have predicted that in metals with strong spin-orbit coupling, the inversion symmetry can be lost. Harter et al. teased out the symmetry of the electronic order in the compound Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 (see the Perspective by Dodge). They found that a known structural transition in this material is a consequence of another, previously hidden electronic order that breaks inversion symmetry.

https://openalex.org/W2605790715,"The advancement of metabarcoding techniques, declining costs of high-throughput sequencing and development of systematic sampling devices, such as autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS), have provided the means to gather a vast amount of diversity data from cryptic marine communities. However, such increased capability could also lead to analytical challenges if the methods used to examine these communities across local and global scales are not standardized. Here we compare and assess the underlying biases of four ARMS field processing methods, preservation media, and current bioinformatic pipelines in evaluating diversity from cytochrome c oxidase I metabarcoding data. Illustrating the ability of ARMS-based metabarcoding to capture a wide spectrum of biodiversity, 3,372 OTUs and twenty-eight phyla, including 17 of 33 marine metazoan phyla, were detected from 3 ARMS (2.607 m2 area) collected on coral reefs in Mo’orea, French Polynesia. Significant differences were found between processing and preservation methods, demonstrating the need to standardize methods for biodiversity comparisons. We recommend the use of a standardized protocol (NOAA method) combined with DMSO preservation of tissues for sessile macroorganisms because it gave a more accurate representation of the underlying communities, is cost effective and removes chemical restrictions associated with sample transportation. We found that sequences identified at ≥ 97% similarity increased more than 7-fold (5.1% to 38.6%) using a geographically local barcode inventory, highlighting the importance of local species inventories. Phylogenetic approaches that assign higher taxonomic ranks accrued phylum identification errors (9.7%) due to sparse taxonomic coverage of the understudied cryptic coral reef community in public databases. However, a ≥ 85% sequence identity cut-off provided more accurate results (0.7% errors) and enabled phylum level identifications of 86.3% of the sequence reads. With over 1600 ARMS deployed, standardizing methods and improving databases are imperative to provide unprecedented global baseline assessments of understudied cryptic marine species in a rapidly changing world."
https://openalex.org/W2606364564,"Background Elderly adults are at particular risk of sustaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and tend to suffer worse outcomes compared to other age groups. Falls are the leading cause of TBI among the elderly. Methods We examined nationwide trends in TBI hospitalizations among elderly adults (ages 65 and older) between April 2006 and March 2011 using a population-based database that is mandatory for all hospitals in Canada. Trends in admission rates were analyzed using linear regression. Predictors of falls and in-hospital mortality were identified using logistic regression. Results Between 2006 and 2011, there were 43,823 TBI hospitalizations resulting in 6,939 deaths among elderly adults in Canada. Over the five-year study period, the overall rate of TBI admissions increased by an average of 6% per year from 173.2 to 214.7 per 100,000, while the rate of fall-related TBI increased by 7% annually from 138.6 to 179.2 per 100,000. There were significant trends towards increasing age and comorbidity level (p<0.001 and p = 0.002). Advanced age, comorbidity, and injury severity were independent predictors of both TBI-related falls and mortality on multivariate analysis. Conclusion Prevention efforts should be targeted towards vulnerable demographics including the “older old” (ages 85 and older) and those with multiple medical comorbidities. Additionally, hospitals and long-term care facilities should be prepared to manage the burgeoning population of older patients with more complex comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2606282518,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) collect and store both honey and pollen in preserved forms. Pollen storage involves the addition of honey or nectar and oral secretions to pollen granules. It is controversial whether the duration of pollen storage alters the palatability or nutritive value of the pollen storage medium. We examined how bees utilize different-aged stored pollen during an extended pollen flow. The deposition of pollen into wax cells and subsequent consumption were monitored daily on 18 brood frames from 6 colonies over an 8d observation period. Despite a greater abundance of older stored pollen cells on brood frames, bees showed a marked preference for the consumption of freshly-stored pollen. Two to four day-old pollen cell contents were significantly more likely to be consumed, while pollen cell contents more than seven days old were eaten at much lower rates. Similar experiments that controlled for cell abundance and spatial effects using cage assays yielded the same result. One day-old stored pollen was consumed approximately three times more often than 10d-old stored pollen, and two times more often than 5d-old stored pollen. These consumption preferences for freshly-stored pollen occurred despite a lack of clear developmental advantages. Young adult workers reared for 7 days on 1d-, 5d-, or 10d-old stored pollen showed no difference in body mass, stored pollen consumption, hindgut fecal material accumulation, or hypopharyngeal gland (HPG) protein titers, suggesting that different-aged pollen stores did not vary in their nutritional value to adult bees. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis promoting a period of microbially-mediated, “beebread maturation” that results in greater palatability or nutritive value for aged pollen stores. Rather, stored pollen that is not eaten in the first few days accumulates as excess stores preserved in a less preferred, but nutritionally-similar state."
https://openalex.org/W2605395546,"Background Diagnosis of pulmonary (PTB) and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in smear-negative patients can be difficult. We assessed retrospectively the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF system (Xpert, Cepheid) in diagnosing smear-negative tuberculosis (TB), which represents the most common form of TB in a low incidence setting. Methods Performance of Xpert was compared to acid-fast microscopic examination using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain in patients with culture-confirmed TB. Results 386 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) culture-positive samples were detected out of 5170 specimens tested with smear microscopy, Xpert and culture: 323 were both culture- and Xpert-positive, and 63 culture-positive only. Of these, 234 (60.6%) were smear-negative. In addition Xpert detected 40 probable TB cases, based on clinical findings, which were culture-negative. Compared to culture, Xpert showed an overall sensitivity of 83.7% and a specificity of 99.1%; sensitivity was higher for respiratory samples (86.5%) than for non-respiratory samples (76.8%). Xpert sensitivity for smear-negative culture-confirmed TB was 73.1% and was not influenced by TB localization. As sensitivity of microscopy alone was poor (39.4%), Xpert improved both diagnosis of pulmonary TB (Δ = 36.5%) and extra-pulmonary TB (Δ = 63.4%). Conclusions Xpert MTB/RIF is a sensitive method for rapid diagnosis of TB compared to the conventional ZN staining. Xpert can serve as a sensitive and time-saving diagnostic method for microbiological diagnosis of smear-negative TB in countries with a low TB prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W2606719385,"Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. Abnormalities in chromosome number have the potential to lead to disruption of the proteostasis network (PN) and accumulation of misfolded proteins. DS individuals suffer from several comorbidities, and we hypothesized that disruption of proteostasis could contribute to the observed pathology and decreased cell viability in DS. Our results confirm the presence of a disrupted PN in DS, as several of its elements, including the unfolded protein response, chaperone system, and proteasomal degradation exhibited significant alterations compared to euploid controls in both cell and mouse models. Additionally, when cell models were treated with compounds that promote disrupted proteostasis, we observed diminished levels of cell viability in DS compared to controls. Collectively our findings provide a cellular-level characterization of PN dysfunction in DS and an improved understanding of the potential pathogenic mechanisms contributing to disrupted cellular physiology in DS. Lastly, this study highlights the future potential of designing therapeutic strategies that mitigate protein quality control dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2606541769,"Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are deregulated in cancer and contribute to oncogenesis. In urothelial carcinoma (UC), several lncRNAs have been reported to be overexpressed and proposed as biomarkers. As most reports have not been confirmed independently in large tissue sets, we aimed to validate the diagnostic and prognostic value of lncRNA upregulation in independent cohorts of UC patients. Thus, expression of seven lncRNA candidates (GAS5, H19, linc-UBC1, MALAT1, ncRAN, TUG1, UCA1) was measured by RT-qPCR in cell lines and tissues and correlated to clinicopathological parameters including follow-up data (set 1: N n = 10; T n = 106). Additionally, publicly available TCGA data was investigated for differential expression in UC tissues (set 2: N n = 19; T n = 252,) and correlation to overall survival (OS). All proposed candidates tended to be upregulated in tumour tissues, with the exception of MALAT1, which was rather diminished in cancer tissues of both data sets. However, strong overexpression was generally limited to individual tumour tissues and statistically significant overexpression was only observed for UCA1, TUG1, ncRAN and linc-UBC1 in tissue set 2, but for no candidate in set 1. Altered expression of individual lncRNAs was associated with overall survival, but not consistently between both patient cohorts. Interestingly, lower expression of TUG1 in a subset of UC patients with muscle-invasive tumours was significantly correlated with worse OS in both cohorts. Further analysis revealed that tumours with low TUG1 expression are characterized by a basal-squamous-like subtype signature accounting for the association with poor outcome. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that overexpression of the candidate lncRNAs is found in many UC cases, but does not occur consistently and strongly enough to provide reliable diagnostic or prognostic value as an individual biomarker. Subtype-dependent expression patterns of lncRNAs like TUG1 could become useful to stratify patients by molecular subtype, thus aiding personalized treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2986596926,"Patients with testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) have an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). We identified risk factors for VTE in this patient cohort and developed a clinical risk model.In this retrospective cohort study at the Medical University of Graz we included 657 consecutive TGCT patients across all clinical stages. A predictive model for VTE was developed and externally validated in 349 TGCT patients treated at the University Hospital Zurich.Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 34 (5.2%) patients in the Graz cohort. In univariable competing risk analysis, higher clinical stage (cS) and a retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (RPLN) were the strongest predictors of VTE (p<0.0001). As the presence of a RPLN with more than 5cm in greatest dimension without coexisting visceral metastases is classified as cS IIC, we constructed an empirical VTE risk model with the following four categories (12-month-cumulative incidence): cS IA-B 8/463 patients (1.7%), cS IS-IIB 5/86 patients (5.9%), cS IIC 3/21 patients (14.3%) and cS IIIA-C 15/70 patients (21.4%). This risk model was externally validated in the Zurich cohort (12-month-cumulative incidence): cS IA-B (0.5%), cS IS-IIB (6.0%), cS IIC (11.1%) and cS IIIA-C (19.1%). Our model had a significantly higher discriminatory performance than a previously published classifier (RPLN-VTE-risk-classifier) which is based on the size of RPLN alone (AUC-ROC: 0.75 vs. 0.63, p = 0.007).According to our risk stratification, TGCT patients with cS IIC and cS III disease have a very high risk of VTE and may benefit from primary thromboprophylaxis for the duration of chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2606578576,"Candida albicans, along with some other non-albicans Candida species, is a group of yeast, which causes serious infections in humans that can be both systemic and superficial. Despite the fact that extensive efforts have been put into the discovery of novel antifungal agents, the frequency of these fungal infections has increased drastically worldwide. In our quest for the discovery of novel antifungal compounds, we had previously synthesized and screened quinoline containing 1,2,3-triazole (3a) as a potent Candida spp inhibitor. In the present study, two structural analogues of 3a (3b and 3c) have been synthesized to determine the role of quinoline and their anti-Candida activities have been evaluated. Preliminary results helped us to determine 3a and 3b as lead inhibitors. The IC50 values of compound 3a for C. albicans ATCC 90028 (standard) and C. albicans (fluconazole resistant) strains were 0.044 and 2.3 μg/ml, respectively while compound 3b gave 25.4 and 32.8 μg/ml values for the same strains. Disk diffusion, growth and time kill curve assays showed significant inhibition of C. albicans in the presence of compounds 3a and 3b. Moreover, 3a showed fungicidal nature while 3b was fungistatic. Both the test compounds significantly lower the secretion of proteinases and phospholipases. While, 3a inhibited proteinase secretion in C. albicans (resistant strain) by 45%, 3b reduced phospholipase secretion by 68% in C. albicans ATCC90028 at their respective MIC values. Proton extrusion and intracellular pH measurement studies suggested that both compounds potentially inhibit the activity of H+ ATPase, a membrane protein that is crucial for various cell functions. Similarly, 95-97% reduction in ergosterol content was measured in the presence of the test compounds at MIC and MIC/2. The study led to identification of two quinoline based potent inhibitors of C. albicans for further structural optimization and pharmacological investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2607069053,"Serum albumin concentration is associated with both type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We sought to investigate whether baseline serum albumin and change in serum albumin could be independent risk factors for prediabetes in subjects without MetS. We further examined the effect of serum albumin on progression to overt diabetes in subjects who developed prediabetes.Among 10,792 participants without diabetes and MetS who consecutively underwent yearly health check-ups over six years, 9,807 subjects without incident MetS were enrolled in this longitudinal retrospective study. The risk of developing prediabetes (impared fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1c) was analyzed according to baseline and percent change in serum albumin concentration using Cox regression analysis. Serial changes in serum albumin concentration were measured from baseline to one year before prediabetes diagnosis, and then from the time of prediabetes diagnosis to progression to overt diabetes or final follow-up.A total of 4,398 incident cases of prediabetes developed during 35,807 person-years (median 3.8 years). The hazard ratio for incident prediabetes decreased as percent change in serum albumin concentration (quartiles and per 1%) increased in a crude and fully adjusted model. However, baseline serum albumin concentration itself was not associated with prediabetic risk. Serum albumin levels kept increasing until the end of follow-up in prediabetic subjects who returned to normal glycemic status, whereas these measures did not change in prediabetic subjects who developed type 2 diabetes. Serum albumin concentration measured at the end of follow-up was the highest in the regression group, compared to the stationary (p = 0.014) or progression groups (p = 0.009).Increase in serum albumin concentration might protect against early glycemic deterioration and progression to type 2 diabetes even in subjects without MetS."

https://openalex.org/W2607282557,"MicroRNAs are short, single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules that function as regulators of tumor progression in various cancers, including glioma. The present study sought to investigate the biological functions of miR-9-3p in glioma progression. The results of a microRNA microarray indicated that microRNA-9-3p (miR-9-3p, miR-9*) is down-regulated in high-grade (grades III and IV) gliomas compared with non-tumor tissues. These results were confirmed with real-time PCR. The miR-9-3p expression level was associated with age and tumor grade. Herpud1 was regulated by miR-9-3p in glioma cells and tissues and was identified as a miR-9-3p target with luciferase reporter assays. Glioma cells transfected with miR-9-3p mimics or HERPUD1-RNAi had more apoptotic cells than them in control after induced by H2O2. Our results indicated that low expression of miR-9-3p results in a high level of Herpud1, which may protect against apoptosis in glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2606237775,"Background Little is known about patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who receive medical management despite evaluation at a heart valve treatment center. Objective We identified patient characteristics associated with medical management, physician-reported reasons for selecting medical management, and patients’ perceptions of their involvement and satisfaction with treatment selection. Methods and results Of 454 patients evaluated for AS at 9 established heart valve treatment centers from December 12, 2013 to August 19, 2014, we included 407 with severe symptomatic AS. Information was collected using medical record review and survey of patients and treating physicians. Of 407 patients, 212 received transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), 124 received surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and 71 received medical management (no SAVR/TAVR). Thirty-day predicted mortality was higher in patients receiving TAVR (8.7%) or medical management (9.8%) compared with SAVR (3.4%) (P<0.001). Physician-reported reasons for medical management included patient preference (31.0%), medical futility (19.7%), inoperability/anatomic infeasibility (11.3%), and inadequate vascular access (8.5%). Compared with patients receiving AVR, medically managed patients were less likely to report that they received enough information about the pros and cons of treatment options (P = 0.03), that their physicians involved them in treatment decisions (P<0.001), and that final decisions were the right ones (P<0.001). Conclusions Patient preference was the most common physician-reported reason for selecting non-invasive AS management, yet patients not undergoing AVR after valve center evaluation reported being less likely to receive sufficient education about treatment options and more likely to feel uncertain about final treatment decisions. Greater attention to shared decision making may improve the experience of care for this vulnerable group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2606448430,"Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) and Halyomorpha halys (Stål) cause injury to soybeans by piercing and sucking pods and seeds. Growers believe that new damage decreases near to harvest despite the occurrence of these bugs at that time. As this question has never been assessed, we evaluated two diets: a) mature soybean pods (dried shell + dried soybean seeds) and b) dried soybean seeds for the two bugs by assessing their biological, behavioral, and morphological attributes on each diet in laboratory. While nymphs of both species were able to develop and adults able to reproduce on the tested diets, bugs fed on pods had longer development times and 2.2 to 5.0 times higher mortality rates than bugs fed on seeds. Furthermore, adult longevity of R. pedestris and H. halys fed on pods was 8.4 and 7.5 days shorter, respectively, than that of bugs fed on seeds. However, pod feeding had no effect on adult fecundity or egg viability. In a behavioral choice test, adult R. pedestris preferred seeds over pods and probed seeds longer than pods. On average, adult H. halys also preferred seeds over pods, although 15.6% of H. halys showed the reverse, preferring pods over seeds. The proboscis length and estimated depth of stylet penetration into the host tissue of both nymphs and adults of both species was much greater than the thickness of the pod shell, suggesting that mouthpart structure does not explain the negative effects of pods vs. seeds. In conclusion, mature soybean pods were found to be a suitable food source for both R. pedestris and H. halys despite some negative effects, and thus careful attention should be paid to the population levels of these two bugs approaching harvest to reduce economic damage in soybean."
https://openalex.org/W2607159943,"Kidney allograft failure due to chronic injury/rejection remains the main cause of graft loss in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Here, we investigated whether specific biomarkers of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover are associated with allograft function and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage in RTR. Seventy-eight patients who attended the University Medical Center Groningen for a routine check-up after kidney transplantation were enrolled in the study. Plasma and/or 24h-urine samples were collected and specific matrix-metalloproteinase-generated neo-epitope fragments of collagens were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results demonstrated that urinary levels of C3M, a marker for collagen type III degradation, correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; r = 0.58, p<0.0001), with lower levels detected in the urine of patients with advanced CKD. In addition, plasma levels of Pro-C6, a marker for collagen type VI formation, significantly increased with disease progression and correlated with eGFR (r = -0.72, p<0.0001). Conversely, plasma C3M and urinary Pro-C6 levels showed no correlation with renal function. We identified two neo-epitope biomarkers of tissue turnover associated with ECM remodeling and fibrosis that can stratify patients by CKD stage. This is as promising first step towards non-invasive monitoring of ECM turnover in the kidneys."
https://openalex.org/W2606434372,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play key roles in life processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulations, and immune response, etc. Identification of PPIs enables better understanding of the functional networks within a cell. Common experimental methods for identifying PPIs are time consuming and expensive. However, recent developments in computational approaches for inferring PPIs from protein sequences based on coevolution theory avoid these problems. In the coevolution theory model, interacted proteins may show coevolutionary mutations and have similar phylogenetic trees. The existing coevolution methods depend on multiple sequence alignments (MSA); however, the MSA-based coevolution methods often produce high false positive interactions. In this paper, we present a computational method using an alignment-free approach to accurately detect PPIs and reduce false positives. In the method, protein sequences are numerically represented by biochemical properties of amino acids, which reflect the structural and functional differences of proteins. Fourier transform is applied to the numerical representation of protein sequences to capture the dissimilarities of protein sequences in biophysical context. The method is assessed for predicting PPIs in Ebola virus. The results indicate strong coevolution between the protein pairs (NP-VP24, NP-VP30, NP-VP40, VP24-VP30, VP24-VP40, and VP30-VP40). The method is also validated for PPIs in influenza and E.coli genomes. Since our method can reduce false positive and increase the specificity of PPI prediction, it offers an effective tool to understand mechanisms of disease pathogens and find potential targets for drug design. The Python programs in this study are available to public at URL (https://github.com/cyinbox/PPI)."
https://openalex.org/W2606570812,"Objectives To investigate disease risk mechanisms of early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) associated with the recurrent 22q11.2 deletion, a genetic risk factor for early-onset PD. Methods In a proof-of-principle study, we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate sequence variants in nine adults with 22q11.2DS, three with neuropathologically confirmed early-onset PD and six without PD. Adopting an approach used recently to study schizophrenia in 22q11.2DS, here we tested candidate gene-sets relevant to PD. Results No mutations common to the cases with PD were found in the intact 22q11.2 region. While all were negative for rare mutations in a gene-set comprising PD disease-causing and risk genes, another candidate gene-set of 1000 genes functionally relevant to PD presented a nominally significant (P = 0.03) enrichment of rare putatively damaging missense variants in the PD cases. Polygenic score results, based on common variants associated with PD risk, were non-significantly greater in those with PD. Conclusions The results of this first-ever pilot study of WGS in PD suggest that the cumulative burden of genome-wide sequence variants may contribute to expression of early-onset PD in the presence of threshold-lowering dosage effects of a 22q11.2 deletion. We found no evidence that expression of PD in 22q11.2DS is mediated by a recessive locus on the intact 22q11.2 chromosome or mutations in known PD genes. These findings offer initial evidence of the potential effects of multiple within-individual rare variants on the expression of PD and the utility of next generation sequencing for studying the etiology of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2606945152,"According to the international guidelines, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is unanimously used to treat coagulation disorders. The quality of FFP is critical for the clinical transfusion. Till now, few studies have integratedly evaluated the differences of FFP from blood donors at between high altitude (HA) and low altitude (LA). Besides, there were no special quality standards for HA FFP in China.Up to 41 HA (Lhasa, 3700 m) and 46 LA (Chengdu, 500 m) blood donors were included in our study to estimate the differences of FFP from HA and LA blood donors. The concentration of total plasma proteins, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (Fbg), factor (F) II, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, D-dimer, protein C (PC), protein S (PS), antithrombin III (ATIII) and von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) were determined, respectively.As compared with FFP of LA blood donors, the total protein content of HA blood donors showed a significant decrease (65.2±8.9 vs.57.2±6.3 g/L; p<0.001); PT, aPTT, TT were significantly increased (p<0.001); the levels of FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, FXII and vWF:Ag were notably decreased (all p<0.05), whereas Fbg and D-dimer were dramaticly increased (p = 0.038). Additionly, in HA blood donors, vWF: Ag and FVIII:C of O-group was significantly lower (p<0.05) than that of non-O-group. It should be noted that FVIII:C of HA blood donors (0.64±0.10 IU/mL) was lower than the current Chinese quality requirements for FFP (≥ 0.7 IU/ml). No significant differences were observed in PC, PS and ATIII.In general, our findings showed that the quality of FFP was significantly different between HA and LA blood donors, and the current Chinese quality requirements of FFP are not suitable for HA FFP. Therefore, setting up a special quality requirement for HA is quite necessary and meaningful."

The balance of the spine is subject of an increasing number of publications. The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the validity of lordotic alignment on the course of CSM and to set this parameter in context with well-validated tools, namely the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system (mJOAS) and the visual analogue scale (VAS), to predict and measure the clinical outcome after surgery.This is a retrospective study with prospectively collected data of a heterogeneous cohort. The authors analyzed the records of 102 patients suffering from CSM that underwent decompressive surgery and instrumentation. Clinical outcome was assessed by using the mJOAS, VAS and Odom's criteria. The radiological analysis involved comparison of pre- and postoperative radiographs. The patients were divided into subgroups to be able to compare the influence of various amounts of correction (3 Delta-groups: <0°, 1-7° and ≥8°) and final lordosis (4 Omega-groups: 0-7°, 8-14°, 15-21°, ≥22°).219 levels were fused in 102 patients. Surgery improved the clinical outcome of all groups significantly. A lordotic profile was achieved in all analyzed groups. Patients that showed small lordosis after surgery (<8°) did not have an inferior clinical outcome compared to patients with larger cervical lordosis (>14°). The comparison of Odom's criteria showed that preoperatively kyphotic patients benefitted more from surgery than lordotic patients (p = 0.029), but no differences could be seen comparing neck pain and neurological improvement. The improvement of pain and neurological impairment measured by VAS and mJOAS supports the statistical impact and validity of the data despite comparatively small numbers of patients. The lack of postoperative kyphosis is a major limitation of the study to encompass the impact of sagittal alignment on clinical outcome.Decompression and stabilization appear to be key elements of surgical treatment of CSM. While the achievement of cervical lordosis remains a major goal of surgery, clinical improvement is not hindered in patients who show small lordosis. However, kyphosis should be eliminated in symptomatic patients. The terms ""balance"" and ""physiologic lordosis"" remain complex entities without clear definition. To check the results of our study controlled randomized trials to validate and determine the exact role of cervical balance on the course of CSM would be helpful."

https://openalex.org/W2606666360,"In diverse tropical webs, trophic cascades are presumed to be rare, as species interactions may dampen top-down control and reduce their prevalence. To test this hypothesis, we used an open experimental design in the Galápagos rocky subtidal that enabled a diverse guild of fish species, in the presence of each other and top predators (sea lions and sharks), to attack two species of sea urchins grazing on benthic algae. Time-lapse photography of experiments on natural and experimental substrates revealed strong species identity effects: only two predator species–blunthead triggerfish (Pseudobalistes naufragium) and finescale triggerfish (Balistes polylepis)–drove a diurnal trophic cascade extending to algae, and they preferred large pencil urchins (Eucidaris galapagensis) over green urchins (Lytechinus semituberculatus). Triggerfish predation effects were strong, causing a 24-fold reduction of pencil urchin densities during the initial 21 hours of a trophic cascade experiment. A trophic cascade was demonstrated for pencil urchins, but not for green urchins, by significantly higher percent cover of urchin-grazed algae in cages that excluded predatory fish than in predator access (fence) treatments. Pencil urchins were more abundant at night when triggerfish were absent, suggesting that this species persists by exploiting a nocturnal predation refuge. Time-series of pencil urchin survivorship further demonstrated per capita interference effects of hogfish and top predators. These interference effects respectively weakened and extended the trophic cascade to a fourth trophic level through behavioral modifications of the triggerfish-urchin interaction. We conclude that interference behaviors capable of modifying interaction strength warrant greater attention as mechanisms for altering top-down control, particularly in speciose food webs."

However, there is no direct evidence linking glucocorticoids and sensitisation achieved by repeated administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. We tested the hypothesis that co-administration of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, prior to repeated daily MK-801 injections would block the expression of locomotor sensitisation due to its dual effects on corticosterone and dopamine. We employed a repeated MK-801 administration locomotor sensitisation paradigm in male Sprague Dawley rats. RU486 or a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle was co-administered with MK-801 or saline during the induction phase. Subsequent to withdrawal, rats were challenged with MK-801 alone to test for the expression of sensitisation. In a separate cohort of rats, plasma corticosterone levels were quantified from blood samples taken on the 1st, 4th and 7th day of induction and at expression. One day after challenge, nucleus accumbens tissue levels of dopamine and its metabolites DOPAC and HVA were measured. During the induction phase, RU486 progressively enhanced locomotor sensitisation to MK-801. RU486 and MK-801 both showed stimulatory effects on corticosterone levels and this was further augmented when given in combination. Contrary to our hypothesis, RU486 did not block the expression of locomotor sensitisation to MK-801 and actually increased levels of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA in nucleus accumbens tissue. Our results showed that RU486 has augmentative rather than inhibitory effects on MK-801-induced sensitisation. This study indicates a divergent role for glucocorticoids in sensitisation to MK-801 compared to sensitisation with other psychostimulants."

We assessed time trends in age-standardized incidence rates using joinpoint regression and in 5-year relative survival using Poisson regression model. Kulldorff's scan method was used to assess spatial variation and clustering.Age-standardized incidence rates (per million person-years) in males and females were 34.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.9-39.1) and 26.2 (95% CI 21.5-30.7) for LL, 10.5 (95% CI 7.7-13.3) and 12.5 (95% CI 9.4-15.7) for HL, 12.5 (95% CI 9.3-15.4) and 7.7 (95% CI 5.2-10.2) for NHL (except for Burkitt lymphomas), and 3.2 (95% CI 1.6-4.7) and 1.5 (95% CI 0.4-2.5) for Burkitt lymphomas. Age- and sex- standardized LL incidence rate increased 1.4% (95% CI 0.3%-2.5%) per year, while the changes for HL and NHL incidence rates were not statistically significant. There were geographic differences in age-standardized incidence rates for LL, HL, and NHL and spatial clusters were detected in southern part of the province. Five-year relative survival has improved over time and there was no difference between rural and urban areas.Lymphoid leukemia incidence rate increased over time and varied by geographic area. Further research should examine the factors contributing to these trends."

Our study aims to isolate the mechanisms underlying the effects of feedback on achieving efficient behavior in a controlled environment. We design a laboratory experiment in which individuals are not aware of the consequences of different alternatives and, thus, cannot easily identify the efficient ones. We introduce feedback as a mechanism to enhance the awareness of consequences and to stimulate exploration and search for efficient alternatives. We assess the efficacy of three different types of intervention: provision of social information, manipulation of the frequency, and framing of feedback. We find that feedback is most effective when it is framed in terms of losses, that it reduces efficiency when it includes information about inefficient peers’ behavior, and that a lower frequency of feedback does not disrupt efficiency. By quantifying the effect of different types of feedback, our study suggests useful insights for policymakers."

However, the mechanism by which S.dysenteriae infection regulates proinflammatory cytokines during intestinal inflammation is still obscure. In this study, we evaluated whether the interaction of β-catenin and NF-κB regulates proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8 by modulating GSK-3β activity during S.dysenteriae infection in rat ileal loop model. Here we demonstrated that S.dysenteriae infection stimulate β-catenin degradation which in turn decreased the association between NF-κB and β-catenin. Also, we showed that S.dysenteriae infection increased GSK-3β kinase activity which in turn phosphorylates β-catenin for its degradation by ubiquitination and upregulates IL-8 through NF-κB activation thereby leading to inflammation. Thus these findings revealed the role of β-catenin/ NF-κB and GSK-3β in modulating the inflammatory response during bacterial infection and also showed that β-catenin acts as a critical regulator of inflammation."

Here we analyze the association of IgM antibodies against OxPS (anti-OxPS) with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).Among sixty-year olds from Stockholm County in Sweden, previously screened for cardiovascular risk factors (2039 men, 2193 women), there were 210 incident CVD-cases identified during a 5-year follow-up. Using a nested case-control design, 622 age- and sex-matched controls were selected. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% intervals (CI) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. IgM anti-OxPS was measured by ELISA. Phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat-cells by macrophages was studied by flow cytometry.Anti-OxPS levels were lower among cases (median (interquartile range): 80.7 (60.9-101.0 vs. 84.6 (65.8-109.6); p = 0.047); among men (76.6 (55.8-99.2) vs. 82.0 (63.1-105.1); p = 0.022) and among women 89.6 (72.3-110.1) vs. 89.8 (69.9-114.4); p = 0.79). After adjustment for smoking, BMI, diabetes mellitus type II, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension, and dividing into quartiles, using the highest quartile (quartile 4) as reference, quartile 3 was associated with a OR of 1.74 (CI 1.08-2.81). Quartiles 2 and 1 had similar associations, the later reaching statistical significance. Among men associations were stronger whereas no significant associations were observed in women. The OR of MI/angina comparing quartile 3 with quartile 4 was 2.31 (CI 1.30-4.11). The OR for quartile 2 and 1, respectively, were similar as for quartile 3. Total IgM increased uptake of apoptotic cells, which was reversed if incubated with OxPS.IgM anti-OxPS is a novel potential protection marker for CVD, in particular in men. Increased phagocytosis of dying/dead cells could be one potential underlying mechanism."

We sought to test whether explosive anger was integrally associated with symptoms of grief amongst the Timorese, a society that has experienced extensive conflict-related losses. In 2010 and 2011 we recruited adults (n = 2964), 18-years and older, living in an urban and a rural village in Timor-Leste. We applied latent class analysis to identify subpopulations based on symptoms of explosive anger and grief. The best fitting model comprised three classes: grief (24%), grief-anger (25%), and a low symptom group (51%). There were more women and urban dwellers in the grief and grief-anger classes compared to the reference class. Persons in the grief and grief-anger classes experienced higher rates of witnessing murder and atrocities and traumatic losses, ongoing poverty, and preoccupations with injustice for the two historical periods of conflict (the Indonesian occupation and the later internal conflict). Compared to the reference class, only the grief-anger class reported greater exposure to extreme deprivations during the conflict, ongoing family conflict, and preoccupations with injustice for contemporary times; and compared to the grief class, greater exposure to traumatic losses, poverty, family conflict and preoccupations with injustice for both the internal conflict and contemporary times. A substantial number of adults in this post-conflict country experienced a combined constellation of grief and explosive anger associated with extensive traumatic losses, deprivations, and preoccupations with injustice. Importantly, grief-anger may be linked to family conflict in this post-conflict environment."

https://openalex.org/W2607247404,"Non-microscopy-based assays for sensitive and rapid detection of Plasmodium infection in mosquitoes are needed to allow rapid and high throughput measurement of transmission intensity and malaria control program effectiveness. Here, we report on a modified enhanced chemiluminescence-based slot blot assay for detection of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozite protein (PfCSP) expressed on parasite oocysts developing inside the mosquito midgut. This modified assay has several novel features that include eliminating the need for exposure to autoradiography (AR) film, as well as utilizing a novel high affinity anti-CSP antibody, and optimizing assay procedures resulting in significant reduction in the time required to perform the assay. The chemiluminescent signal for the detection of PfCSP in mosquito samples was captured digitally utilizing the C-Digit blot scanner that, allowed the detection of 0.01 pg of recombinant P. falciparum CSP and as few as 0.02 P. falciparum oocysts in a little over two hours. The earlier ECL-SB detected rCSP and oocysts and took approximately 5 h to perform. Whole mosquito lysates from both high and low prevalence—infected mosquito populations were prepared and evaluated for PfCSP detection on the ECL-SB by both AR film and digital data capture and analysis. There was a 100% agreement between the AR film and the C-Digit scanner methods for PfCSP detection in randomly sampled mosquitoes. This novel “No Film” Slot Blot assay obviates the need for AR film exposure and development and significantly reduces the assay time enabling widespread use in field settings."
https://openalex.org/W2605743880,"The Repayment Policy for Multiple Loans is about a given set of loans and a monthly incoming cash flow: what is the best way to allocate the monthly income to repay such loans? In this article, we close the almost 20-year-old open question about how to model the repayment policy for multiple loans problem together with its computational complexity. Thus, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model that establishes an optimal repayment schedule by minimizing the total amount of cash required to repay the loans. We prove that the most employed repayment strategies, such as the highest interest debt and the debt snowball methods, are not optimal. Experimental results on simulated cases based on real data show that our methodology obtains on average more than 4% of savings, that is, the debtor pays approximately 4% less to the bank or loaner, which is a considerable amount in finances. In certain cases, the debtor can save up to 40%."

Low-density magnesium alloys are a promising type of material for making lighter vehicles and improving fuel efficiency. One challenge for lightweighting is developing high-strength magnesium alloys. Wu et al. created a dual-phase magnesium thin film with near-ideal strength. The alloy consists of small nanocrystalline cores surrounded by glass, combining the benefits of both phases to create the high-strength alloy. The strategy for creating this type of nanostructure should translate to other types of alloys, opening a different pathway to creating high-strength metals.

As science education moves toward more active classes, what can we learn about how student socialization affects learning? Zwolak et al. used social network analysis to investigate the academic and social experiences of students in an introductory Modeling Instruction (active learning) physics course. Students were asked to list the names of fellow students with whom they had a meaningful interaction five times throughout the semester. Using centralities, which are measures of position within the social network, intrapersonal interactions between students were quantified. Results showed that students with a higher centrality at the end of the semester were more likely to persist in physics (i.e., continue through the sequence of courses), suggesting that social integration may help in keeping students in science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines.

Conventional chemotherapy with DNA-damaging agents has helped countless cancer patients become cancer survivors. This successful outcome is sometimes accompanied by long-term side effects, however. In young female patients, for example, the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide can compromise fertility. This occurs because the drug causes inappropriate activation of ovarian follicular development, thereby exposing oocytes to its DNA-damaging effects. Studying a mouse model, Goldman et al. showed that ovarian function and fertility are preserved when cyclophosphamide is coadministered with drugs called mTORC1/2 inhibitors, which suppress a signaling pathway required for follicular activation. mTORC1/2 inhibitors are already clinically approved for other purposes, including treatment of certain forms of breast cancer, and may merit exploration as a fertility-preserving strategy in female cancer patients.

The successful growth of large tissues requires the formation of a vascular system to ensure the proper supply of nutrients to the growing cells. One route to angiogenesis in the growing tissue is through the delivery of growth factors such as VEGF, but clinically this method has limitations. An alternative is to harness proangiogenic cells, such as blood-derived CD133+ cells, also known as circulating angiogenic cells (CACs). Parlato et al. used a cell invasion assay to optimize a hydrogel designed to recruit CACs over a period of 24 hours. Although hydrogel degradability and hydrogel stiffness—two known variables often connected with cell behavior—were found to be important in attracting CACs, a key third factor was the presentation of a gradient of stromal derived factor 1.

The proteins that regulate cellular responses to hypoxia form a sensitive on-off switch. Cells survive hypoxia by activating the transcription factor HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α). HIF-1α is active when it is associated with the transcriptional coactivator CBP. The protein CITED2 opposes such activation. CITED2 and HIF-1α bind overlapping regions of CBP with similar affinity. But CITED2 can much more effectively displace HIF-1α from CBP and inhibit transcription. The flexibility of intrinsically disordered regions of CITED2 apparently allows it to slip in and cause an allosteric change in CBP that hinders interaction with HIF-1α. Other such switches may exist, and in such cases, modeling on the basis of binary dissociation constants would be very misleading.
