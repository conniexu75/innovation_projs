https://openalex.org/W2911252450,"Although a high marine food intake is considered cardioprotective, randomized trials of ω-3 fatty acids initially generated conflicting results in terms of the role of ω-3 supplementation in cardiovascular prevention. This work demonstrates the results of the 3 most recent clinical trials with ω-3 fatty acids are put into the context of possible mechanisms mediating their beneficial cardiovascular effects. In particular, the randomized Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with EPA Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) showed that icosapent ethyl, which is the ethyl ester form of the ω-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), induced a significant reduction of cardiovascular events. Importantly, EPA serves as a substrate for the formation of the specialized proresolving mediator resolvin E1 (RvE1), which stimulates the resolution of inflammation. RvE1 reduces atherosclerosis and intimai hyperplasia by means of its specific receptor ERV1/ChemR23. The decreased levels of proinflammatory and proatherosclerotic leukotrienes by ω-3 fatty acids may further contribute to a beneficial inflammatory balance. Consequently, the Rv/leukotriene ratio is emerging as a marker of nonresolving vascular inflammation. Recent experimental studies have shown that anti-inflammatory and proresolving effects of lipid mediators derived from ω-3 fatty acids inhibit atherosclerosis independently of cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The results of the 3 most recent clinical trials of ω-3 fatty acid supplementation indicate an importance of the type and dose of ω-3 supplementation and highlight the need for risk stratification in the patient selection for ω-3 supplementation for either primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.—Bäck, M., Hansson, G.

https://openalex.org/W2911675408,"Annotation of foot-contact and foot-off events is the initial step in post-processing for most quantitative gait analysis workflows. If clean force plate strikes are present, the events can be automatically detected. Otherwise, annotation of gait events is performed manually, since reliable automatic tools are not available. Automatic annotation methods have been proposed for normal gait, but are usually based on heuristics of the coordinates and velocities of motion capture markers placed on the feet. These heuristics do not generalize to pathological gait due to greater variability in kinematics and anatomy of patients, as well as the presence of assistive devices. In this paper, we use a data-driven approach to predict foot-contact and foot-off events from kinematic and marker time series in children with normal and pathological gait. Through analysis of 9092 gait cycle measurements we build a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural networks. The best-performing model identifies foot-contact and foot-off events with an average error of 10 and 13 milliseconds respectively, outperforming popular heuristic-based approaches. We conclude that the accuracy of our approach is sufficient for most clinical and research applications in the pediatric population. Moreover, the LSTM architecture enables real-time predictions, enabling applications for real-time control of active assistive devices, orthoses, or prostheses. We provide the model, usage examples, and the training code in an open-source package."
https://openalex.org/W2912499277,"Regulated secretion is critical for diverse biological processes ranging from immune and endocrine signaling to synaptic transmission. Botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins, which specifically proteolyze vesicle fusion proteins involved in regulated secretion, have been widely used as experimental tools to block these processes. Genetic expression of these toxins in the nervous system has been a powerful approach for disrupting neurotransmitter release within defined circuitry, but their current utility in the brain and elsewhere remains limited by lack of spatial and temporal control. Here we engineered botulinum neurotoxin B so that it can be activated with blue light. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for inducibly disrupting excitatory neurotransmission, providing a first-in-class optogenetic tool for persistent, light-triggered synaptic inhibition. In addition to blocking neurotransmitter release, this approach will have broad utility for conditionally disrupting regulated secretion of diverse bioactive molecules, including neuropeptides, neuromodulators, hormones, and immune molecules.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwMWQ0NjNiN2E2ZjEyMjM4ZTFkYzg0NDI0MTVhNmY2NyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MDMxNTY3fQ.HppxP0OzfVpWztggpAkUERmu2RoHu_InOHiBMv_K6mnxnBtFRhlO91O5Ok6igMLHbM7-q_UD4FVfxrEq7POliWofV4OIModopXukgBjKNCYkIXd95XvJ593i4-of9-9TXOGEMQu34JOCS-eRIkiMHgVTHytT5HB0VVmE5rPhp3Oh1lDQLugL3pv7zggKveo4Og66Uq37SRdyXqCTap-b6gFBTa3xpaoBPO_kUikbv_wlHDsX1ZrATeBLmLTwfWDYJqfQjf93z8mZyQVbnOJ5TbN0-v-fvje-rHxe1RV3UK4ebqzU7evttgSHT4ixxFYoZJWhdF-2zZfmZTqXImzn4A(mp4, (9.65 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2930632179,"Eukaryotic DNA methylation prevents genomic instability by regulating the expression of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. The negative effects of dysregulated DNA methylation are highlighted by a strong correlation between mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase gene DNA methyltransferase 3α (DNMT3A) and poor prognoses among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We show here that clinically observed DNMT3A mutations dramatically alter enzymatic activity, including mutations that lead to 6-fold hypermethylation and 3-fold hypomethylation of the human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B or p15) gene promoter. Our results provide insights into the clinically observed heterogeneity of p15 methylation in AML. Cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) constitutes 40-50% of all AML cases and is the most epigenetically diverse AML subtype with pronounced changes in non-CpG DNA methylation. We identified a subset of DNMT3A mutations that enhance the enzyme's ability to perform non-CpG methylation by 2-8-fold. Many of these mutations mapped to DNMT3A regions known to interact with proteins that themselves contribute to AML, such as thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). Using functional mapping of TDG-DNMT3A interactions, we provide evidence that TDG and DNMT3-like (DNMT3L) bind distinct regions of DNMT3A. Furthermore, DNMT3A mutations caused diverse changes in the ability of TDG and DNMT3L to affect DNMT3A function. Cell-based studies of one of these DNMT3A mutations (S714C) replicated the enzymatic studies and revealed that it causes dramatic losses of genome-wide methylation. In summary, mutations in DNMT3A lead to diverse levels of activity, interactions with epigenetic machinery components and cellular changes."
https://openalex.org/W2911988836,"Progress in common bean breeding requires the exploitation of genetic variation among market classes, races and gene pools. The present study was conducted to determine the amount of genetic variation and the degree of relatedness among 192 selected common bean advanced cultivars using 58 simple-sequence-repeat markers (SSR) evenly distributed along the 11 linkage groups of the Phaseolus reference map. All the lines belonged to commercial seed type classes that are widely grown in the USA and include both dry bean and snap beans for the fresh and processing markets. Through population structure, principal components analyses, cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), Andean and Mesoamerican genotypes as well as most American commercial type classes could be distinguished. The genetic relationship among the commercial cultivars revealed by the SSR markers was generally in agreement with known pedigree data. The Mesoamerican cultivars were separated into three major groups—black, small white, and navy accessions clustered together in a distinct group, while great northern and pinto clustered in another group, showing mixed origin. The Andean cultivars were distributed in two different groups. The kidney market classes formed a single group, while the green bean accessions were distributed between the Andean and Mesoamerican groups, showing inter-gene pool genetic admixture. For a subset of 24 SSR markers, we compared and contrasted the genetic diversity of the commercial cultivars with those of wild and domesticated landrace accessions of common bean. An overall reduction in genetic diversity was observed in both gene pools, Andean and Mesoamerican, from wild to landraces to advanced cultivars. The limited diversity in the commercial cultivars suggests that an important goal of bean breeding programs should be to broaden the cultivated gene pool, particularly the genetic diversity of specific commercial classes, using the genetic variability present in common bean landraces."
https://openalex.org/W2913867375,"Background With increasing use of nCPAP, the safety and comfort associated with nCPAP have come into the forefront. The reported incidence of nasal injuries associated with the use of nCPAP is 20% to 60%. A recent meta-analysis concluded that the use of nasal masks significantly decreases CPAP failure and the incidence of moderate to severe nasal injury and stress the need for a well powered RCT to confirm their findings. Methods In this Open label, 3 arms, sequential, stratified randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the incidence and severity of nasal injury at removal of nCPAP when using two different nasal interfaces and in three groups (i.e. rotation group, mask continue group, prong continue group). Preterm infants with gestation ≤ 30 weeks and respiratory distress within the first 6 hours of birth and in need of CPAP were eligible for the study. Results Among the 175 newborns included in the study, incidence of nasal injury in mask continue group [n = 19/57 (33.3%)] was significantly less as compared to prong continue group [n = 55/60 (91.6%)] and rotation group [33/ 58 (56.9%), p value <0.0001]. Median maximum nasal injury score was significantly less in Mask continue group as compared to Prong continue group and Rotation group [Injury Score 0 (IQR 0–1) vs. Injury Score 3 (IQR 2–5) vs. Injury Score 1 (IQR 0–2), p value = <0.0001] respectively. The proportion of infants failing nCPAP was similar across the three groups. Conclusion nCPAP with nasal masks significantly reduces nasal injury in comparison with nasal prongs or rotation of nasal prongs and nasal masks. However, the type of interface did not affect the nCPAP failure rates."
https://openalex.org/W2912930390,"Among the members of flaviviruses, the Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a potent infectious disease agent, with its associated pandemic prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a global public health concern. Thus, rapid and accurate diagnosis of the ZIKV is needed. In this study, we report a new immunofluorescence biosensor for the detection of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of the ZIKV, which operates using the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) signal from plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to amplify the fluorescence intensity signal of quantum dots (QDs) within an antigen-antibody detection process. The LSPR signal from the AuNPs was used to amplify the fluorescence intensity of the QDs. For ultrasensitive, rapid, and quantitative detection of NS1 of the ZIKV, four different thiol-capped AuNPs were investigated. Our biosensor could detect the ZIKV in a wide concentration range from 10–107 RNA copies/mL, and we found that the limit of detection (LOD) for the ZIKV followed the order Ab-L-cysteine-AuNPs (LOD = 8.2 copies/mL) > Ab-3-mercaptopropionic acid-AuNPs (LOD = 35.0 copies/mL). Immunofluorescence biosensor for NS1 exhibited excellent specificity against other negative control targets and could also detect the ZIKV in human serum."

https://openalex.org/W2914050499,"The capacity to find humorous perspectives in aversive situations may outline a helpful strategy in the context of cognitive reappraisal. Yet, research suggested that some people produce more adaptive humour than others. At the same time, not all forms of cognitive reinterpretation seem to be unequivocally beneficial. The present study aimed to investigate specific cognitive reappraisal strategies that individuals employ in humorous reappraisal of adverse events. In a sample of 95 participants, the use of cognitive reappraisal sub-strategies was assessed in a behavioural test in which participants were required to generate a series of humorous reappraisals of self-relevant, threatening events. These reappraisal sub-strategies (three positive reinterpretation strategies, three de-emphasising strategies) were then related to the habitual use of different kinds of humour as well as the broader DSM-5 personality trait domains and well-being in terms of depressive experiences, assessed by self-report questionnaires. While no robust relationships were found for reappraisal strategies based on de-emphasising, sub-strategies within the positive reinterpretation category showed specific and contrasting associations with the examined traits. Findings indicated that the ability to produce humour is only linked to a favourable pattern of reappraisal strategies when manifested in benign forms of humour. Specific relations also emerged for the broader personality traits. The study suggests that some characteristics that advance the use of benign humour also benefit adaptive emotion regulation. The opposite seems to be true for malicious, or ""dark"" humour. The introduced behavioural approach to the analysis of humorous cognitive reappraisal may prove useful also in future related research."
https://openalex.org/W2908724657,"The frontline anti-malarial drug artemisinin and its derivatives have also been implicated in modulating multiple mammalian cellular pathways, including the recent identification of targeting γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) signaling in the pancreas. Their molecular mechanism of action, however, remains elusive. Here, we present crystal structures of gephyrin, the central organizer at inhibitory postsynapses, in complex with artesunate and artemether at 1.5-A resolution. These artemisinins target the universal inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor-binding epitope of gephyrin, thus inhibiting critical interactions between gephyrin and glycine receptors (GlyRs) as well as GABAARs. Electrophysiological recordings reveal a significant inhibition of gephyrin-mediated neurotransmission by artemisinins. Furthermore, clustering analyses in primary neurons demonstrate a rapid inhibition and a time-dependent regulation of gephyrin and GABAAR cluster parameters. Our data not only provide a comprehensive model for artemisinin-mediated modulation of inhibitory neurotransmission but also establish artemisinins as potential lead compounds to pharmacologically interfere with this process."
https://openalex.org/W2911973985,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar, the most severe form of leishmaniasis, can lead to death if not properly diagnosed and treated. Correct identification of infected patients and reservoirs is vital for controlling the spread of leishmaniasis. Current diagnostic kits for leishmaniasis show high sensitivity and specificity, but can also result in false negatives and cross reactions with related parasitic infections. New diagnostic methods with greater accuracy are urgently needed for diagnosis of leishmaniasis. In this study, we aimed to uncover a new highly effective antigen for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs and humans, aiming to improve the accuracy compared with those of current methods of diagnosis. Initially, in-silico epitope prediction analyses identified several potential B-cell epitopes in the repetitive region of Leishmania infantum kinesin, which co-localized with predicted structural disordered regions, suggesting high potential for antigenicity. Based on this analysis, 8.5 genomic motifs, which encode the repetitive sequence of 39 degenerate amino acids, were selected for recombinant expression. BLASTn analysis of this repetitive region indicated that it is absent in the T. cruzi parasite, which is closely related to Leishmania, indicating the specificity of this region. This potentially antigenic protein, named recombinant kinesin degenerated derived repeat (rKDDR), was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Star using the pET28a-TEV expression vector. We then evaluated the performance of rKDDR in correctly diagnosing Leishmania infection and compared this new assay with currently used diagnostic tests for leishmaniasis. rKDDR showed greater sensitivity and specificity in correctly diagnosing leishmaniasis both in human (sensitivity 92.86% and specificity 100%) and canine (sensitivity 88.54% and specificity 97.30%) sera compared with those of rK39 (human: sensitivity 90.48% and specificity 97.92%; canine: sensitivity 78.13% and specificity 90.09%). In addition, the rKDDR-ELISA outperformed the EIE-LVC kit, which is the serologic kit recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health for the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis. These results indicate that rKDDR is a highly promising candidate for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis, and is more accurate than the currently used gold-standard antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2913119502,"Nicotine and cannabis use during adolescence has the potential to induce long lasting changes on affective and cognitive function. Here, we examined whether adolescent exposure to nicotine, the cannabinoid agonist WIN55-212,2 (WIN), or co-exposure to both would alter operant learning, locomotion, and anxiety- and reward-related behaviors in male and female mice during adulthood. Males exposed to a moderate dose of WIN (2 mg/kg) or co-exposed to nicotine and the moderate dose of WIN exhibited decreased anxiety-associated behaviors and increased cognitive flexibility, but did not differ in operant learning or generalized locomotion. In contrast, differences were not found among the females in these measures at the moderate WIN dose or in both sexes with exposure to a low WIN dose (0.2 mg/kg). Furthermore, a sex-dependent dissociative effect was found in natural reward consumption. Males exposed to the moderate dose of WIN or co-exposed to nicotine and the moderate dose of WIN demonstrated increased sucrose consumption. In contrast, females exposed to the moderate dose of WIN exhibited a decrease in sucrose consumption, which was ameliorated with co-administration of nicotine. Together, these novel findings demonstrate that adolescent exposure to cannabinoids in the presence or absence of nicotine results in altered affective and reward-related behaviors during adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2913874693,"The current extinction crisis leaves us increasingly reliant on captive populations to maintain vulnerable species. Approximately one third of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are living in semi-captive conditions in range countries. Their relationship with humans stretches back millennia, yet elephants have never been fully domesticated. We rely on the expertise of traditional handlers (mahouts) to manage these essentially wild animals, yet this profession may be threatened in the modern day. Here, we study the handling system of semi-captive timber elephants in Myanmar; the largest global semi-captive population (~5 000). We investigate how recent changes in Myanmar may have affected the keeping system and mahout-elephant interactions. Structured interviews investigated changes to mahout attitude and experience over the last two decades, as perceived by those who had worked in the industry for at least 10 years (n = 23) and as evaluated in current mahouts (n = 210), finding mahouts today are younger (median age 22yrs), less experienced (median experience 3yrs), and change elephants frequently, threatening traditional knowledge transfer. Mahout-elephant interactions manifested as 5 components (‘job appreciation’; ‘experience is necessary’; ‘human-elephant interaction’; ‘own knowledge’; ‘elephant relationship’), according to Principal Components Analysis. Experienced mahouts and mahouts of bulls and younger elephants were more likely to agree that ‘experience is necessary’ to be a mahout. Mahouts with difficult elephants scored lower on ‘human-elephant interaction’ and a mahout’s perception of their ‘own knowledge’ increased with more experience. Our finding of change in terms of mahout experience, age and commitment in the largest semi-captive elephant population suggests need for formal training and assessment of impacts on elephant welfare; these are findings applicable to thousands of elephants under similar management."
https://openalex.org/W2914045263,"The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) regulates the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) in the synaptic cleft and recycles DA for storage in the presynaptic vesicular pool. Many neurotransmitter transporters exist as oligomers, but the physiological role of oligomerization remains unclear; for example, it has been speculated to be a prerequisite for amphetamine-induced release and protein trafficking. Previous studies point to an oligomeric quaternary structure of hDAT; however, the exact stoichiometry and the fraction of co-existing oligomeric states are not known. Here, we used single-molecule brightness analysis to quantify the degree of oligomerization of heterologously expressed hDAT fused to monomeric GFP (mGFP–hDAT) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We observed that monomers and dimers of mGFP–hDAT co-exist and that higher-order molecular complexes of mGFP–hDAT are absent at the plasma membrane. The mGFP–hDAT dimers were stable over several minutes, and the fraction of dimers was independent of the mGFP–hDAT surface density. Furthermore, neither oxidation nor depletion of cholesterol had any effect on the fraction of dimers. Unlike for the human serotonin transporter (hSERT), in which direct binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) stabilized the oligomers, the stability of mGFP–hDAT dimers was PIP2 independent."
https://openalex.org/W2952206265,"Background aims Delaying replicative senescence and extending lifespan of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may enhance their potential for tissue engineering and cell based therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests that inhibitors of the mTOR signaling pathway, such as rapamycin, constitute promising pharmacological agents to retard senescence and extend stemness properties of various progenitor cell types. Here, we investigated whether the ability of rapamycin to postpone replicative senescence varies among bone marrow MSC samples (BM-MSCs) derived from different healthy donors, and explored the molecular mechanisms that drive rapamycin-mediated lifespan increment. Methods BM-MSCs at early passages were serially passaged either in absence or continuous presence of rapamycin and the number of cell population doublings until growth arrest was measured. The inhibition of mTOR signaling was assessed by the phosphorylation status of the downstream target RPS6. The expression levels of several senescence and pluripotency markers at early and late/senescent passages were analyzed by RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and western blot. Results We found that the lifespan extension in response to the continuous rapamycin treatment was highly variable among samples, but effective in most BM-MSCs. Despite all rapamycin-treated cells secreted significantly reduced levels of IL6, a major SASP cytokine, and expressed significantly higher levels of the pluripotency marker NANOG, the expression patterns of these markers were not correlated with the rapamycin-mediated increase in lifespan. Interestingly, rapamycin-mediated life-span extension was significantly associated only with repression of p16INK4A protein accumulation. Conclusions Taken together, our results suggest that some, but not all, BM-MSC samples would benefit from using rapamycin to postpone replicative arrest and reinforce a critical role of p16INK4A protein downregulation in this process."

We extracted 15,547 newly diagnosed AS subjects among the entire Korean population and excluded wash-out patients (n = 162) and patients that were inappropriate for cohort match (n = 1192). Finally, 14,193 subjects were chosen as the AS group, and through 1:5 age- and sex-stratified matching, 70,965 subjects were chosen as the control group. We evaluated patient demographics, household incomes, and comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The prevalence of overall dementia (1.37%) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (0.99%) in the AS group was significantly higher than in the control group (0.87% and 0.63%), respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio of the AS group for overall dementia (1.758) and AD (1.782) showed statistical significance also. On the other hand, the prevalence of vascular dementia did not differ significantly between the two groups. Subgroup analyses revealed the following risk factors for dementia in the AS group: male gender, greater than 65 years in age, fair income (household income greater than 20% of the median), urban residency, no diabetes, and no hypertension. From the nationwide, population-based, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study, AS patients showed a significantly higher prevalence of overall dementia and Alzheimer's dementia. Comprehensive patient assessment using our subgroup analysis could help to prevent dementia in patients suffering from AS."
https://openalex.org/W2914049293,"Introduction Globally, it is estimated that around 20–25% adult population has metabolic syndrome. Individuals who have metabolic syndrome are up to five times more susceptible for chronic diseases than those who have no metabolic syndrome. In Ethiopia there is no sufficient information regarding the magnitude and factors of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study is to assess prevalence and associated factors of metabolic syndrome among residents of Mizan-Aman town, South West, Ethiopia. Methods The community based cross-sectional study was held at Mizan-Aman town residents. Systematic random sampling was employed to select each household and lottery method was used to select one individual from the household. Data were cleaned, coded and entered by EPI-INFO version 3.5.4 and were transported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. To indicate the strength of association, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used. Results In this study from a total of 558 respondents 534 were completed the interview correctly, which gives a response rate of 95.7%. The overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 9.6%. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that physical inactivity [AOR = 2.61, 95% CI (1.22, 5.58)], age from 18 to 28 years [AOR = 0.36, 95% CI (0.14, 0.90)], being male [AOR = 0.46, 95% CI (0.22, 0.96)] and educational status with cannot write and read [AOR = 0.15, 95% CI (0.04,0.53)], from grade 1 to 8 [AOR = 0. 17, (0.11,0.55)], from grade 9 to12 [AOR = 0.11, (0.03, 0.38)] and from diploma to degree [AOR = 0. 13, (0.01, 0.36)] were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome. Conclusion The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this study was found to be high. Age, physical activity, educational status and sex were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome. Physical activity was found to be the means of metabolic syndrome prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2911841983,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane proteins widely distributed in various organisms, and they facilitate bidirectional diffusion of water and uncharged solutes. The catalase-negative bacterium Streptococcus oligofermentans produces the highest H2O2 levels reported to date, which has to be exported to avoid oxidative stress. Here, we report that a S. oligofermentans aquaporin functions as a peroxiporin facilitating bidirectional transmembrane H2O2 transport. Knockout of this aquaporin homolog, So-AqpA, reduced H2O2 export by ∼50% and increased endogenous H2O2 retention, as indicated by the cellular H2O2 reporter HyPer. Heterologous expression of So-aqpA accelerated exogenous H2O2 influx into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli cells, indicating that So-AqpA acts as an H2O2-transferring aquaporin. Alanine substitution revealed Phe-40 as a key residue for So-AqpA–mediated H2O2 transport. Northern blotting, qPCR, and luciferase reporter assays disclosed that H2O2 induces a >10-fold expression of So-aqpA. Super-resolution imaging showed that H2O2 treatment increases So-AqpA protein molecules per cell by 1.6- to 3-fold. Inactivation of two redox-regulatory transcriptional repressors, PerR and MntR, reduced H2O2-induced So-aqpA expression to 1.8- and 4-fold, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays determined that MntR, but not PerR, binds to the So-aqpA promoter, indicating that MntR directly regulates H2O2-induced So-aqpA expression. Importantly, So-aqpA deletion decreased oxic growth and intraspecies competition and diminished the competitive advantages of S. oligofermentans over the caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans. Of note, So-aqpA orthologs with the functionally important Phe-40 are present in all streptococci. Our work has uncovered an intrinsic, H2O2-inducible bacterial peroxiporin that has a key physiological role in H2O2 detoxification in S. oligofermentans."
https://openalex.org/W2913047268,"The minimum amount of physical activity needed to obtain health benefits has been widely determined. Unlikely, the impact of extreme amounts of very vigorous physical activity (VVPA, ≥ 8 metabolic equivalents) to the heart remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the dose-response relationship between VVPA and heart rate variability (HRV) in adults. We selected 1040 asymptomatic individuals (60% women, 42 ± 15 years, 28 ± 6 kg/m2) from the Epidemiology and Human Movement Study (EPIMOV). Participants remained in the supine position for 10 min, and we selected an intermediate 5-min window for HRV analysis. The standard deviation of the RR intervals, root mean square of RR intervals, successive RR intervals that differ > 50 ms, powers of the low-and high-frequency bands and Poincaré plot standard deviations were quantified. Participants used a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3x+) above the dominant hip for 4-7 consecutive days for quantifying their physical activity. We also evaluated the maximum oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) during an exercise test. We stratified participants into five groups according to the VVPA in min/week (group 1, ≤ 1.50; 2, 1.51-3.16; 3, 3.17-3.54; 4, 3.55-20.75; and 5, > 20.75). The linear trends of the HRV through the quintiles of VVPA were investigated. We used logarithmic transformations to compare the five groups adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk, and [Formula: see text]. We found a better HRV with increased VVPA for all HRV indices studied (p trend < 0.05). However, group 5 did not differ from group 4 (p > 0.05) for none of the indices. We conclude that there is an incremental benefit of VVPA on HRV of asymptomatic adults. Since we found neither additional benefits nor the harmful impact of amounts of VVPA as high as 22 min/week on HRV, our results should not discourage asymptomatic adults to perform VVPA."
https://openalex.org/W2914093099,"Background Exhaled aerosols from lungs have unique patterns, and their variation can be correlated to the underlying lung structure and associated abnormities. However, it is challenging to characterize such aerosol patterns and differentiate their difference because of their complexity. This challenge is even greater for small airway diseases, where the disturbance signals are weak. Objectives and methods The objective of this study is exploiting different feature extraction algorithms to develop a practical classifier to diagnose obstructive lung diseases using exhaled aerosol images. These include proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), principal component analysis (PCA), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and DMD with control (DMDC). Aerosol images were generated via physiology-based simulations in one normal and four diseased airway models in G7-9 bronchioles. The image data were classified using both the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) algorithms. The effectiveness of different features was evaluated by classification accuracy and misclassification rate. Findings Results show a significantly higher performance using dynamic feature extractions (DMD and DMDC) than static algorithms (POD and PCA). Adding the control variables to DMD further improved classification accuracy. Comparing the classification methods, RF persistently outperformed SVM for all types of features considered. While the performance of RF constantly increased with the number of features retained, the performance of SVM peaked at 50 and decreased thereafter. The 5-class classification accuracy was 94.8% using the DMDC-RF model and 93.0% using the DMD-RF model, both of which were higher than 87.0% in the previous study that used fractal dimension features. Conclusion Considering that disease progression is inherently a dynamic process, DMD(C)-based feature extraction preserves temporal information and is preferred over POD and PCA. Compared with hand-crafted features like fractals, feature extraction by DMD and DMDC is automatic and more accurate."
https://openalex.org/W2914118101,"The objective of this study is to characterize the seroprevalence of anti-dengue (DENV) and anti-chikungunya (CHIKV) antibodies among blood donors residing in Qatar who are Middle East and North Africa (MENA) nationals and non-nationals. Sera were collected from adult blood donors in Qatar from 2013 to 2016 and tested for anti-DENV and anti-CHIKV IgG using commercial microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Age-specific seroprevalence was summarized by region/nationality: Asia (India, Philippines), Middle East (Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Palestine, Syria, Yemen), North Africa (Egypt, Sudan), Qatar. The adjusted odds of anti-DENV and anti-CHIKV IgG seropositivity was estimated by logistic regression. Among 1,992 serum samples tested, Asian nationals had higher adjusted odds of being seropositive for anti-DENV antibodies compared to nationals of the Middle East (aOR 0.05, 95% CI 0.04–0.07), North Africa (aOR 0.14, 95% CI 0.10–0.20), and Qatar (aOR 0.01, 95% CI 0.01–0.03). Asian nationals also had higher adjusted odds of being seropositive for anti-CHIKV antibodies compared to those from the Middle East (aOR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07–0.27), North Africa (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26–0.96), and Qatar (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15–0.96). The adjusted odds of being anti-DENV seropositive was higher among anti-CHIKV seropositive adults, and vice versa (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.09–3.44), suggesting co-circulation of these viruses. DENV and CHIKV exposure is lower in Qatar and MENA nationals compared to Asian nationals suggesting a lower burden of DENV and CHIKV disease in the MENA. Antibodies to both viruses were detected in nationals from most MENA countries, supporting the need to better understand the regional epidemiology of these viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2914200124,"Objectives The majority of human chronic wounds contain bacterial biofilms, which produce proteases and retard the resolution of inflammation. This in turn leads to elevated patient protease activity. Chronic wounds progressing towards closure show a reduction in proteolytic degradation. Therefore, the modulation of protease activity may lead to the faster healing of chronic wounds. Antimicrobials are used to control biofilm-based infection; however, some of them also exhibit the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases and bacterial proteases. We investigated the antimicrobial agents used in wound healing for their potential to inhibit bacterial and host proteases relevant to chronic wounds. Methods Using in vitro zymography, we tested the ability of povidone-iodine, silver lactate, chlorhexidine digluconate, and octenidine hydrochloride to inhibit selected human proteases and proteases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Serratia liquefaciens. We investigated penetration and skin protease inhibition by means of in situ zymography. Results All the tested antimicrobials inhibited both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteases in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The tested compounds were also able to penetrate into skin ex vivo and inhibit the resident proteases. Silver lactate and chlorhexidine digluconate showed an inhibitory effect ex vivo even in partial contact with skin in Franz diffusion cells. Conclusions Our in vitro and ex vivo results suggest that wound healing devices which contain iodine, silver, chlorhexidine, and octenidine may add value to the antibacterial effect and also aid in chronic wound healing. Antiprotease effects should be considered in the design of future antimicrobial wound healing devices."
https://openalex.org/W2912372546,"Prions are infectious protein aggregates that cause several fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Prion research has been hindered by a lack of cellular paradigms for studying the replication of prions from different species. Although hamster prions have been widely used to study prion replication in animals and within in vitro amplification systems, they have proved challenging to propagate in cultured cells. Because the murine catecholaminergic cell line CAD5 is susceptible to a diverse range of mouse prion strains, we hypothesized that it might also be capable of propagating nonmouse prions. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering, we demonstrate that CAD5 cells lacking endogenous mouse PrP expression (CAD5-PrP−/− cells) can be chronically infected with hamster prions following stable expression of hamster PrP. When exposed to the 263K, HY, or 139H hamster prion strains, these cells stably propagated high levels of protease-resistant PrP. Hamster prion replication required absence of mouse PrP, and hamster PrP inhibited the propagation of mouse prions. Cellular homogenates from 263K-infected cells exhibited prion seeding activity in the RT-QuIC assay and were infectious to naive cells expressing hamster PrP. Interestingly, murine N2a neuroblastoma cells ablated for endogenous PrP expression were susceptible to mouse prions, but not hamster prions upon expression of cognate PrP, suggesting that CAD5 cells either possess cellular factors that enhance or lack factors that restrict the diversity of prion strains that can be propagated. We conclude that transfected CAD5-PrP−/− cells may be a useful tool for assessing the biology of prion strains and dissecting the mechanism of prion replication."
https://openalex.org/W2912901545,"Background Millions of people use a second language every day. Does this have an effect on their decision-making? Are decisions in a second language more deliberate? Two mechanisms have been proposed: reduced emotionality or increased deliberation. Most studies so far used problems where both mechanisms could contribute to a foreign language effect. Here, we aimed to identify whether deliberate reasoning increases for problems that are devoid of any emotional connotation when using a second language or having to switch between native and second language. Method We measured deliberate reasoning with items from the cognitive reflection test, ratio bias, a probability matching task, and base rate neglect items. We recruited over 500 participants from Norway and the Netherlands that had English as their second language. Participants were randomly assigned to either the native, switching or second language condition. We measured: number of correctly answered items–deliberate reasoning score, perceived effort, perceived accuracy or confidence, and language proficiency. Results Deliberate reasoning was not increased when using a second language or when having to switch between native and second language. All three groups performed equally well. Significant predictors of deliberate reasoning were age, gender, education, perceived effort, and confidence but not the language context. Participants with low English proficiency spent more time reading compared to more fluent speakers. Conclusion There is no advantage of second language on deliberate reasoning in the absence of time pressure. Deliberation was not increased by providing items in a second language, but through the willingness to spend cognitive effort and time to read carefully."
https://openalex.org/W2913459230,"Background Low-educated native Dutch and non-western minority women have inadequate access to obstetric care. Moreover, the care they receive lacks responsiveness to their needs and cultural competences. Gaining a deeper understanding of their experiences and satisfaction with antenatal, birthing and maternity care will help to adjust healthcare responsiveness to meet their needs during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Methods We combined the World Health Organization conceptual framework of healthcare responsiveness with focus group research to measure satisfaction with antenatal, birthing and maternity care of women with a low-educated native Dutch and non-western ethnic background. Results From September 2011 until December 2013, 106 women were recruited for 20 focus group sessions. Eighty-five percent of the women had a non-western immigrant background and 89% a low or intermediate educational attainment. The study population was mostly positive about the provided care during the antenatal phase. They were less positive about the other two phases of care. Moreover, the obstetric healthcare systems’ responsiveness in all phases of care (antenatal, birthing and maternity) did not meet these women’s needs. The ‘respect for persons’ domains ‘autonomy’, ‘communication’ and ‘dignity’ and the ‘client orientation’ domain ‘prompt attention’ were judged most negatively. Conclusions The study findings give contextual meaning and starting points for improvement of responsiveness in the provision of obstetric care within a multi-ethnic women’s population."
https://openalex.org/W2912792987,"Objectives Moderately and late preterm children (MLPs, 32.0–36.9 weeks gestational age) have a greater risk of poorer growth. This seems to be associated with poorer neuropsychological functioning. Evidence is limited on whether this also holds for emotional and behavioral (EB) problems. Therefore, we assessed whether longitudinal growth from birth until age 7 was associated with EB problems at age 7 in MLPs. Study design This study was part of the Longitudinal Preterm Outcome Project, a prospective cohort study. Data on growth (height, weight, head circumference, and extent of catch-up growth) were obtained from assessments from birth until age 7. EB problems were assessed at age 7 with the Child Behavior Checklist. We assessed whether growth and EB problems were associated using logistic regression analyses, adjusting for multiple birth, parity, and socioeconomic status. Results We included 248 MLPs. Median gestational age was 34 weeks (interquartile range: 33–35 weeks). Mean birth weight was 2.2 kg (standard deviation: 0.5 kg). Postnatal growth measures were below the Dutch reference norm. EB problems were more prevalent in MLPs than in the general Dutch population. Generally, we found no associations between growth and EB problems; odds ratios ranged from 0.20 to 2.72. Conclusions In MLPs, postnatal growth from birth until age 7 was not associated with EB problems at age 7. Poorer growth thus seems to relate to neuropsychological problems, but not to EB problems. This suggests that the etiologies of these problems differ at least partially."
https://openalex.org/W2912826091,"The base excision repair (BER) pathway is an important DNA repair pathway and is essential for immune responses. In fact, it regulates both the antigen-stimulated somatic hypermutation (SHM) process and plays a central function in the process of class switch recombination (CSR). For both processes, a central role for apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) has been demonstrated. APE1 acts also as a master regulator of gene expression through its redox activity. APE1’s redox activity stimulates the DNA-binding activity of several transcription factors, including NF-κB and a few others involved in inflammation and in immune responses. Therefore, it is possible that APE1 has a role in regulating the CSR through its function as a redox coactivator. The present study was undertaken to address this question.

We found that APE1’s endonuclease activity is essential for IgA-class switch recombination. We provide evidence that the redox function of APE1 appears to play a role in regulating CSR through the interleukin-6 signaling pathway and in proper IgA expression.

https://openalex.org/W2911711114,"Background China is experiencing rapid age, which will lead to increasing burden of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia. Objectives The aim of this study was to 1) Explore the temporal trend of mortality of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other forms of dementia in China and 2) Analyze its geographic variations and urban-rural differences and calculate the years of life lost (YLLs) from AD and other forms of dementia. Data and methods Data were extracted from the National Mortality Surveillance System (NMS). Age-standardized mortalities were calculated with the Western Grade 26 Standard Life List, and the YLLs were calculated using the DALY template provided by the WHO / World Bank global burden of disease (GBD) Working Group. The trends in crude and age-standardized mortality of AD and other forms of dementia were examined using Cochran-Armitage trend test. Results In China, the crude mortality from AD and other forms of dementia increased from 2009 to 2015, but the age-standardized mortality decreased. The YLLs of AD and other forms of dementia increased during the study period. The age-standardized mortality in the east was higher than those in the west and middle regions, and the age-standardized mortality in rural areas was higher than that in urban areas. Conclusion In China, the age-standardized mortality of AD and other forms of dementia decreased from 2009 to 2015. However, the disease burden from AD and other forms of dementia is becoming heavier due to increasing elderly population. Moreover, there were geographic variations and urban-rural differences in mortality of AD and other forms of dementia in China."

However, the molecular mechanism of how Drp1 is recruited to the mitochondrial surface by receptors MiD49 and MiD51 remains elusive. Here, we showed that the interaction between Drp1 and MiD51 is regulated by GTP binding and depends on the polymerization of Drp1. We identified two regions on MiD51 that directly bind to Drp1, and found that dimerization of MiD51, relevant to residue C452, is required for mitochondrial dynamics regulation. Our Results have suggested a multi-faceted regulatory mechanism for the interaction between Drp1 and MiD51 that illustrates the potentially complicated and tight regulation of mitochondrial fission."
https://openalex.org/W2912303371,"In contrast to northern and northeastern Thailand, central Thailand was believed not to be endemic for Opisthorchis viverrini (OV). Fieldwork conducted in a rural area of central Thailand revealed that the prevalence and incidence were relatively high compared with regional average data. We hypothesized that the behavioural-psycho-social background of the study population might play an important role in the high burden of the infection. As a result, a qualitative study was conducted to highlight potential social determinants of the infection dynamics to gain greater understanding of the risk behaviours and their contexts. A qualitative study using focus group discussion and in-depth interviews was conducted in Na-ngam Village, Chachoengsao Province from 2012–14. Framework analysis was used to explore associations between infection and thematic content. Social influence showed a strong impact on infection dynamics of OV infection. Our results revealed that Koi pla (chopped raw fish salad) remains a popular dish in the community, as the dish itself represents northeastern culture. The cultural norm had been transferred from ancestors to their descendants. Some elders complained that discontinuing the consumption of Koi pla went against old traditions with respect to cultural norms and socialization. In contrast, modern education teaches about hygiene including OV infection risks, and accordingly teenagers and young adults were reported to modify their lifestyles including their eating habits. Children are a potential key to pass knowledge to their parents and school-based education programs can serve as a practical hub for knowledge dissemination. However, health education alone might not lead to behavioural change in other age groups. Therefore, more efforts are needed to support the transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2911265341,"We present a single center's experience of treatment outcomes and dosimetric parameters for breast cancer patients treated with hypofractionated Helical TomoTherapy (HT). This is a retrospective study of one hundred and thirty-six patients with invasive breast cancer treated between March 2012 and October 2016. Dosimetric parameters and 3-year loco-regional failure free survival (LRFFS) were analyzed. Dose to ipsilateral lung, heart and contralateral breast as well as acute and late toxicities were recorded. The median follow-up time is 45 months (range: 5-83). Two patients had loco-regional failure. The 3-year LRFFS was 99%. Acute grade 1 and 2 skin toxicities occurred in 95% and 1%, respectively. Coverage of the target volumes was achieved with the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of homogeneity and conformity index being 0.1 ± 0.04, and 0.8 ± 0.07, respectively. Dose to ipsilateral lung, contralateral breast, and heart was also within the limited constraints regardless of the complexity of target volumes. Only two percent of patients experienced late grade 2 skin toxicity. No late grade 2 subcutaneous tissue toxicity was found. Nine percent of patients developed late grade 1 lung toxicity. Hypofractionated radiotherapy using Helical TomoTherapy in breast irradiation provides excellent 3-year LRFFS and minimal acute and late toxicities. A careful, longer follow-up of healthy tissue effects to lung, heart, and contralateral breast is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2914352354,"Introduction In many Sub-Saharan African countries, women with infertility search relentlessly for treatment. Guided by the Partners for Applied Social Sciences model for health seeking behaviour and access to care research, this study aims to understand the health seeking behaviour of women with infertility in the West Coast region of The Gambia and the influence of aetiological beliefs on health seeking paths. Methodology A qualitative approach was used to generate both primary and secondary data for thematic analysis. The data collection methods included in-depth interviews (36), observations (18), informal conversations (42), group discussion (7) and made use of pile-sorting exercises. Sources of secondary data included government and non-governmental reports and media outputs. Results The health seeking approaches of women living in both rural and urban areas were extremely complex and dynamic, with women reporting that they looked for biomedical treatment as well as seeking indigenous treatment provided by local healers, sacred places and kanyaleng groups. While treatment choice was related to the perceived aetiology of infertility, it was also strongly influenced by the perceived effectiveness of the treatment available and the duration of the fertility problems. Other relevant factors were the affordability, accessibility and availability of treatment and respondents’ family and social networks, whereby access to the biomedical health sector was strongly influenced by people’s socio-economic background. Conclusion On the basis of this analysis and our wider research in the area, we see a need for health authorities to further invest in providing information and counselling on issues related to infertility prevention and treatment. The availability of locally applicable guidelines for the management of infertility for both men and women at all levels of the health system would facilitate such work. In addition, the public sphere should provide more space for alternative forms of social identity for both men and women."
https://openalex.org/W2914382359,"Background It is indicated that Oman is witnessing an increase in issues pertinent to alcohol and psychoactive substance use. Aim The aim of this study was to identify the characteristics of Omanis with substance use disorder attending a specialized hospital in Oman and the pattern of their utilization of healthcare services. A related aim was to ascertain the age group most vulnerable to alcohol and substance use in Oman. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care center specialized for treatment of those engaging in substance use in Oman. The participants in the study were selected from a convenience sample among patients seeking consultation at the center for alcohol and substance use. A six-part questionnaire was designed to obtain information regarding socio-demographic background, clinical history, healthcare utilization and perceived hurdles to access. Chi-square analyses were used to evaluate the significance of differences among categorical data. Logistic regression modelling was used to obtain measures of association after adjusting for confounding factors. Results Among the patients (n = 293) seeking cessation therapy, 99% were male and less than 30 years of age. Peer influences on the initiation of substance use were significant. Most patients had a history of polysubstance use, including intravenous substance use. Cannabis and alcohol were the first substances consumed by most patients and Hepatitis C and psychiatric disorders were found to be the most common co-morbidities. The participants that reported use of cannabis and benzodiazepines were more likely to perceive “improvement” upon receiving treatment. Conclusion This study indicated that males below 30 years of age with a history of polysubstance use were likely to attend a hospital specialized in treating substance use disorder in Oman. This study identified information regarding socio-demographic background, risk factors and perceived hurdles to healthcare that could serve as groundwork for further studies conducted on newly emerging issues of substance use in Oman."
https://openalex.org/W2914223830,"This study was designed to test the hypothesis that nitrogen (N) addition leads to enhanced soil respiration (SR) in nitrogen deficient marsh. Here, we report the response of SR to simulated N deposition in a temperate marsh of northeastern China from June 2009 to September 2011. The experiment included three-levels of N treatment (control: no N addition, Low-N: 4g N m-2 y-1, and High-N: 8 g N m-2 y-1). Our study showed various responses of SR to level and duration of N addition. Yearly SR was increased by 11.8%-15.2% (P<0.05) under Low-N addition during the three years, while SR showed a strong increase by 27.5% (P<0.05) in the first year and then decreased by 4.4% (P>0.05) and 15.4% (P<0.05) in the next two years under High-N addition. Soil respiration was positively correlated with soil temperature and negatively correlated with soil water content. High-N treatment reduced soil pH value (P<0.05). The negative response of SR to High-N addition in the following two years may attribute to lower microbial activity, microbial biomass and alteration in the microbial community due to lower soil pH, which consequently leads to decreased SR. Meanwhile, we found root biomass were increased under High-N addition. This implies that the increase of autotrophic respiration was lower than the decline of heterotrophic respiration in the following two years. Our findings suggest complex interactions between N deposition and SR, which is needed to be further investigated in the future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2912548526,"Camels are livestock with unique adaptations to hot-arid regions. To effectively study camel traits, a biobank of camel DNA specimens with associated biological information is needed. We examined whole-blood, saliva (buccal swabs), and tail-hair follicle samples to determine which is the best source for establishing a DNA biobank. We inspected five amounts of each of whole-blood, buccal swabs, and tail-hair follicles in nine camels, both qualitatively via gel electrophoresis and quantitatively using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. We also tested the effects of long term-storage on the quality and quantity of DNA, and measured the rate of degradation, by analyzing three buccal swab samples and 30 tail-hair follicles over a period of nine months. Good quality DNA, in the form of visible large size DNA bands, was extracted from all three sources, for all five amounts. The five volumes of whole-blood samples (20-100μl) provided ~0.4-3.6 μg, the five quantities of buccal swabs (1-5) produced ~0.1-12 μg, while the five amounts of tail-hair follicles (10-50) resulted in ~0.7-25 μg. No differences in the rate of degradation of buccal swab and tail-hair follicle DNA were detected, but there was clearly greater deterioration in the quality of DNA extracted from buccal swabs when compared to tail-hair follicles. We recommend using tail-hair samples for camel DNA biobanking, because it resulted in both an adequate quality and quantity of DNA, along with its ease of collection, transportation, and storage. Compared to its success in studies of other domesticated animals, we anticipate that using ~50 tail-hair follicles will provide sufficient DNA for sequencing or SNP genotyping."
https://openalex.org/W2913266553,"Background Liver cirrhosis is associated with profound immunodysfunction, i.e. a parallel presence of chronic systemic inflammation and immunosuppression, which can result in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Omega-3 fatty acids are precursors of pro-resolving mediators and support the resolution of inflammation. Objective The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of omega-3 fatty acids in patients with liver cirrhosis and ACLF. Methods Patients with liver cirrhosis with and without ACLF were enrolled in a prospective cohort study and analyzed post-hoc for the present sub-study. Clinical data and biomaterials were collected at baseline and at day 7, 28 and after 3 months of follow-up. Plasma concentrations of arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which represent key omega-6 and -3 fatty acids, respectively, were quantified and associated with markers of systemic inflammation and severity of liver cirrhosis. Results A total of 117 patients were included in the present analyses. Of those, 26 (22.2%), 51 (43.6%) and 40 (34.2%) patients had compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, and ACLF. Plasma levels of ARA and DHA were similar in patients with compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and ACLF. Furthermore, no significant association between plasma ARA or DHA and C-reactive protein or peripheral blood leukocytes were observed (P>0.05). Conclusion In our study plasma levels of key omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid are neither associated with the severity of liver cirrhosis nor with liver-cirrhosis-associated systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2914402790,"Background Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test has been increasingly promoted as an alternative to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to diagnose dysglycaemia but its performance in HIV-infected Africans has yet to be established. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c for dysglycaemia including FPG-defined and OGTT-defined dysglycaemia, and OGTT-defined diabetes in HIV-infected Africans, and the effect of HbA1c-predicted dysglycaemia on Joint Interim Statement (JIS)-based prevalent metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods A cross-sectional study included HIV-positive patients recruited across public healthcare facilities in the Western Cape. The recommended HbA1c cut-points were tested alongside the optimal cut-points obtained from receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, while the agreement between the MS criteria were assessed using kappa statistic. Results 748 participants (157 men), median age 38 years, 93% on anti-retroviral drugs were included. The optimal HbA1c cut-points of 5.75% (39.3 mmol/mol) showed 54% sensitivity, 84% specificity for FPG-defined dysglycaemia, and 52% sensitivity, 85% specificity for OGTT-defined dysglycaemia. The HbA1c value of 5.85% (40.4 mmol/mol) (63% sensitivity, 99% specificity) was optimal for diabetes. The internationally advocated cut-point of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) had 37% sensitivity and 99% specificity for diabetes, while HbA1c ≥5.7% (≥39 mmol/mol) yielded similar performance with the study-specific cut-point for any dysglycaemia. MS prevalence by the JIS criteria (28.2%) increased to 29.7% when using HbA1c ≥5.75% (≥39.3 mmol/mol) and to 32.9% with HbA1c ≥5.7% (≥39 mmol/mol); agreement between the original and modified criteria was generally good. Conclusions This study agrees with the internationally recommended HbA1c cut-point for detecting dysglycaemia, but not for diabetes in HIV-infected Africans. In line with previous studies in general African populations, our findings suggest that similar factors interfere with HbA1c values regardless of HIV infection status. Replacing FPG-based with HbA1c-predicted dysglycaemia in the JIS criteria to diagnose MS is feasible in HIV-infected Africans."
https://openalex.org/W2911835216,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most commonly used gas euthanasia agents in mice, despite reports of aversion and nociception. Inert gases such as nitrogen (N2) may be a viable alternative to carbon dioxide. Here we compared behavioural and electrophysiological reactions to CO2 or N2 at either slow fill or rapid fill in C57Bl/6 mice undergoing gas euthanasia. We found that mice euthanised with CO2 increased locomotor activity compared to baseline, whereas mice exposed to N2 decreased locomotion. Furthermore, mice exposed to CO2 showed significantly more vertical jumps and freezing episodes than mice exposed to N2. We further found that CO2 exposure resulted in increased theta:delta of the EEG, a measure of excitation, whereas the N2 decreased theta:delta. Differences in responses were not oxygen-concentration dependent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CO2 increases both behavioural and electrophysiological excitation as well as producing a fear response, whereas N2 reduces behavioural activity and central neurological depression and may be less aversive although still produces a fear response. Further studies are required to evaluate N2 as a suitable euthanasia agent for mice."
https://openalex.org/W2913566190,"Forest management guidelines for rare or declining species in the Pacific Northwest, USA, include both late successional reserves and specific vegetation management criteria. However, whether current management practices for well-studied species such as northern spotted owls (Strix occidentallis caurina) can aid in conserving a lesser known subspecies-Humboldt martens (Martes caurina humboldtensis)-is unclear. To address the lack of information for martens in coastal Oregon, USA, we quantified vegetation characteristics at locations used by Humboldt martens and spotted owls in two regions (central and southern coast) and at two spatial scales (the site level summarizing extensive vegetation surveys and regionally using remotely sensed vegetation and estimated habitat models). We estimated amount of predicted habitat for both species in established reserves. If predicted overlap in established reserves was low, then we reported vegetation characteristics to inform potential locations for reserves or management opportunities. In the Central Coast, very little overlap existed in vegetation characteristics between Humboldt martens and spotted owls at either the site or regional level. Humboldt martens occurred in young forests composed of small diameter trees with few snags or downed logs. Humboldt martens were also found in areas with very dense vegetation when overstory canopy and shrub cover percentages were combined. In the South Coast, Humboldt martens occurred in forests with smaller diameter trees than spotted owl sites on average. Coastal Humboldt martens may use stands of predicted high quality spotted owl habitat in the Pacific Northwest. Nonetheless, our observations suggest that coastal Humboldt martens exist in areas that include a much higher diversity of conifer size classes as long as extensive dense shrub cover, predominantly in the form of high salal and evergreen huckleberry, are available. We suggest that managers consider how structural characteristics (e.g., downed logs, shrub cover, patch size), are associated with long-term species persistence rather than relying on reserves based on broad cover types. Describing vegetation may partially describe suitability, but available prey or predation risk ultimately influence likelihood of individual Humboldt marten use. Guidelines for diversifying vegetation management, and retaining or restoring appropriate habitat conditions at both the stand level and regionally, may increase management flexibility and identify forest conditions that support both spotted owls and Humboldt martens."

In this study, we defined a prototype strategy of using DC-based vaccines pulsed with placenta-derived heat shock protein gp96 to induces anti-tumor T cell responses. Placental gp96 was efficiently taken up by CD11c+ bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and resulted in moderate BMDC maturation. Splenocytes and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) generated with mouse BMDCs pulsed with placental gp96 specifically lysed B16 melanoma and LLC lung carcinoma cells. In both transplantable melanoma and lung carcinoma mice models, immunization with placental gp96-stimulated BMDCs led to a significant decrease in tumor growth and mouse mortality with respect to mice treated with liver gp96-pulsed BMDCs or placental gp96 alone. This vaccine induced strong cross-reactive tumor-specific T cell responses. Our results revealed that DCs pulsed with placenta-derived gp96 represent an effective immunotherapy to induce tumor-reactive immune responses, possibly via loading DCs with its associated carcinoembryonic antigens."

We investigated the effect of PG on accommodation and presbyopia progression in glaucoma patients.We conducted a clinic-based, retrospective, cross-sectional study. Inclusion criteria were bilateral phakic patients aged 40-69 years with best corrected visual acuity better than 20/30. Exclusion criteria were any disease affecting vision other than glaucoma and history of ocular surgery. Subjects with no prescription or vision-affecting disease served as controls (n = 260). The glaucoma patients were prescribed eye drops containing 0.005% latanoprost for more than six months (n = 23). We measured the binocular near add power at a distance of 30 cm in both groups and compared the results using Kaplan-Meier analysis.The mean age (± SD) of the control subjects was 51.5 ± 5.2 years and 39% were male. Similarly, the glaucoma patients had a mean age of 51.0 ± 7.2 years and 39% were male. There were no significant differences in age, gender, intra-ocular pressure, spherical equivalent, astigmatism, or anisometropia between groups. Survival analysis indicated that the glaucoma patients in this study reached the endpoint (near add power of +3.00 D) significantly earlier than control patients (P = 0.0001; generalized Wilcoxon test).Exacerbation of presbyopia progression in glaucoma patients is a potential side effect of latanoprost eyedrops."
https://openalex.org/W2913030680,"5’-nucleotidases are widespread among all domains of life. The enzymes hydrolyze phosphate residues from nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives. In some pathobiontic bacteria, 5’-nucleotidases contribute to immune evasion by dephosphorylating adenosine mono-, di-, or tri-phosphates, thereby either decreasing the concentration of pro-inflammatory ATP or increasing the concentration of anti-inflammatory adenosine, both acting on purinergic receptors of phagocytic cells. The strict human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes expresses a surface-associated 5’-nucleotidase (S5nA) under infection conditions that has previously been discussed as a potential virulence factor. Here we show that deletion of the S5nA gene does not significantly affect growth in human blood, evasion of phagocytosis by neutrophils, formation of biofilms and virulence in an infection model with larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella in S. pyogenes serotypes M6, M18 and M49. Hence, the surface-associated 5’-nucleotidase S5nA seems dispensable for evasion of phagocytosis and biofilm formation in S. pyogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2803712352,"Introduction In this paper we perform a replication analysis of “Effect of a cash transfer programme for schooling on prevalence of HIV and herpes simplex type 2 in Malawi: a cluster randomised trial” by Sarah Baird and others published in “The Lancet” in 2012. The original study was a two-year cluster randomized intervention trial of never married girls aged 13–22 in Malawi. Enumeration areas were randomized to either an intervention involving cash transfer (conditional or unconditional of school enrollment) or control. The study included 1708 Malawian girls, who were enrolled at baseline and had biological testing for HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) at 18 months. The original findings showed that in the cohort of girls enrolled in school at baseline, the intervention had an effect on school enrollment, sexual outcomes, and HIV and HSV-2 prevalence. However, in the baseline school dropout cohort, the original study showed no intervention effect on HIV and HSV-2 prevalence. Methods We performed a replication of the study to investigate the consistency and robustness of key results reported. A pre-specified replication plan was approved and published online. Cleaned data was obtained from the original authors. A pure replication was conducted by reading the methods section and reproducing the results and tables found in the original paper. Robustness of the results were examined with alternative analysis methods in a measurement and estimation analysis (MEA) approach. A theory of change analysis was performed testing a causal pathway, the effect of intervention on HIV awareness, and whether the intervention effect depended on the wealth of the individual. Results The pure replication found that other than a few minor discrepancies, the original study was well replicated. However, the randomization and sampling weights could not be verified due to the lack of access to raw data and a detailed sample selection plan. Therefore, we are unable to determine how sampling influenced the results, which could be highly dependent on the sample. In MEA it was found that the intervention effect on HIV prevalence in the baseline schoolgirls cohort was somewhat sensitive to model choice, with a non-significant intervention effect for HIV depending on the statistical model used. The intervention effect on HSV-2 prevalence was more robust in terms of statistical significance, however, the odds ratios and confidence intervals differed from the original result by more than 10%. A theory of change analysis showed no effect of intervention on HIV awareness. In a causal pathway analysis, several variables were partial mediators, or potential mediators, indicating that the intervention could be working through its effect on school enrollment or selected sexual behaviors. Conclusions The effect of intervention on HIV prevalence in the baseline schoolgirls was sensitive to the model choice; however, HSV-2 prevalence results were confirmed. We recommend that the results from the original published analysis indicating the impact of cash transfers on HIV prevalence be treated with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2911705182,"Many aspects of the laboratory environment are not tailored to the needs of rodents, which may cause stress. Unpredictable stressors can cause ulcers, prolonged pituitary-adrenal activation, and anhedonia. Similarly, pain has been demonstrated to slow wound healing, and mice experiencing pain exhibit altered behavior. However it is unknown how husbandry, which occurs when the mice are inactive, and lack of analgesia, specifically in a punch biopsy procedure, effects animal physiology, behavior, and welfare, particularly as it relates to sleep fragmentation. We hypothesized that sleep fragmentation, induced by unpredictable husbandry and lack of pain management will slow wound healing. Two main treatments were tested in a factorial design in C57BL/6 mice of both sexes (64 mice total); 1) analgesia (carprofen and saline) and 2) sleep disruptions (random and predictable). Mice were singly housed in a non-invasive sleep monitoring apparatus on arrival (Day -4). Disruption treatments were applied from Day -3 to 2. All mice received a punch biopsy surgery (Day 0) with topical lidocaine gel and their analgesic treatment prior to recovery, and on Days 1 and 2. Nesting behavior was assessed daily and a sugar cereal consumption test, as a measure of anhedonia, was conducted on Days -1 to 2. On Day 3, mice were euthanized and wound tissue and adrenal glands were collected. We found that the disruption predictability had no effect on mouse sleep, wound healing, or adrenal cortex:medulla ratio. It's possible that the disruption period was not long enough to induce chronic stress. However, male mice who received analgesia slept more than their female counterparts; this may be related to sex differences in pain perception. Overall, it does not appear that the predictability of disturbance effects sleep fragmentation or stress responses, indicating that husbandry activities do not need to occur at set predictable times to improve welfare."
https://openalex.org/W2913966878,"The long-term prognosis of patients with postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) after cardiovascular surgery is unclear. We aimed to investigate long-term renal outcomes and survival in these patients to determine the risk factors for negative outcomes. Long-term prognosis was examined in 144 hospital survivors. All patients were independent and on renal replacement therapy at hospital discharge. The median age at operation was 72.0 years, and the median pre-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 39.5 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median follow-up duration was 1075 days. The endpoints were death, chronic maintenance dialysis dependence, and a composite of death and chronic dialysis. Predictors for death and dialysis were evaluated using Fine and Gray's competing risk analysis. The cumulative incidence of death was 34.9%, and the chronic dialysis rate was 13.3% during the observation period. In the multivariate proportional hazards analysis, eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at discharge was associated with the composite endpoint of death and dialysis [hazard ratio (HR), 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-3.8; P = 0.02]. Hypertension (HR 8.7, 95% CI, 2.2-35.4; P = 0.002) and eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at discharge (HR 26.4, 95% CI, 2.6-267.1; P = 0.006) were associated with dialysis. Advanced age (≥75 years) was predictive of death. Patients with severe CRRT-requiring AKI after cardiovascular surgery have increased risks of chronic dialysis and death. Patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at discharge should be monitored especially carefully by nephrologists due to the risk of chronic dialysis and death."
https://openalex.org/W2911639188,"A cysteine protease belonging to peptidase C1A superfamily from the eukaryotic, symbiotic dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium sp. strain KB8, was characterized. The protease was purified to near homogeneity (566-fold) by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, ultrafiltration, and column chromatography using a fluorescent peptide, butyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-Lys-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Boc-VLK-MCA), as a substrate for assay purposes. The enzyme was termed VLKP (VLK protease), and its activity was strongly inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors and activated by reducing agents. Based on the results for the amino acid sequence determined by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry, a cDNA encoding VLKP was synthesized. VLKP was classified into the peptidase C1A superfamily of cysteine proteases (C1AP). The predicted amino acid sequence of VLKP indicated a tandem array of highly conserved precursors of C1AP with a molecular mass of approximately 71 kDa. The results of gel-filtration chromatography and SDS-PAGE suggested that VLKP exists as a monomer of 31-32 kDa, indicating that the tandem array is likely divided into two mass-equivalent halves that undergo equivalent posttranslational modifications. The VLKP precursor contains an inhibitor prodomain that might become activated after acidic autoprocessing at approximately pH 4. Both purified and recombinant VLKPs had a similar substrate specificity and kinetic parameters for common C1AP substrates. Most C1APs reside in acidic organelles such as the vacuole and lysosomes, and indeed VLKP was most active at pH 4.5. Since VLKP exhibited maximum activity during the late logarithmic growth phase, these attributes suggest that, VLKP is involved in the metabolism of proteins in acidic organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2912390070,"Although mutations in several genes have been reported in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), most of PAH cases do not carry these mutations. This study aimed to identify a novel cause of PAH. To determine the disease-causing variants, direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were performed to analyze 18 families with multiple affected family members with PAH. In one of the 18 families with PAH, no disease-causing variants were found in any of BMPR2, ACVRL1, ENG, SMAD1/4/8, BMPR1B, NOTCH3, CAV1, or KCNK3. In this family, a female proband and her paternal aunt developed PAH in their childhood. Whole-exome next-generation sequencing was performed in the 2 PAH patients and the proband's healthy mother, and a BRCA1-associated protein (BRAP) gene variant, p.Arg554Leu, was identified in the 2 family members with PAH, but not in the proband's mother without PAH. Functional analyses were performed using human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs). Knockdown of BRAP via small interfering RNA in hPASMCs induced p53 signaling pathway activation and decreased cell proliferation. Overexpression of either wild-type BRAP or p.Arg554Leu-BRAP cDNA constructs caused cell death confounding these studies, however we observed higher levels of p53 signaling inactivation and hPASMC proliferation in cells expressing p.Arg554Leu-BRAP compared to wild-type BRAP. In addition, p.Arg554Leu-BRAP induced decreased apoptosis of hPASMCs compared with wild-type BRAP. In conclusion, we have identified a novel variant of BRAP in a Japanese family with PAH and our results suggest it could have a gain-of-function. This study sheds light on new mechanism of PAH pathogenesis."
