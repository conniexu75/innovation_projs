https://openalex.org/W2331479474,"Epidemiologic evidence suggests that air pollution is a risk factor for childhood obesity. Limited experimental data have shown that early-life exposure to ambient particles either increases susceptibility to diet-induced weight gain in adulthood or increases insulin resistance, adiposity, and inflammation. However, no data have directly supported a link between air pollution and non-diet-induced weight increases. In a rodent model, we found that breathing Beijing's highly polluted air resulted in weight gain and cardiorespiratory and metabolic dysfunction. Compared to those exposed to filtered air, pregnant rats exposed to unfiltered Beijing air were significantly heavier at the end of pregnancy. At 8 wk old, the offspring prenatally and postnatally exposed to unfiltered air were significantly heavier than those exposed to filtered air. In both rat dams and their offspring, after continuous exposure to unfiltered air we observed pronounced histologic evidence for both perivascular and peribronchial inflammation in the lungs, increased tissue and systemic oxidative stress, dyslipidemia, and an enhanced proinflammatory status of epididymal fat. Results suggest that TLR2/4-dependent inflammatory activation and lipid oxidation in the lung can spill over systemically, leading to metabolic dysfunction and weight gain.-Wei, Y., Zhang, J., Li, Z., Gow, A., Chung, K.

https://openalex.org/W2280973620,"Background In developing countries, inadequate access to effective screening for cervical cancer often contributes to the high morbidity and mortality caused by the disease. The largest burden of this falls mostly on underserved populations in rural areas, where health care access is characterized by transport challenges, ill equipped health facilities, and lack of information access. This study assessed uptake of cervical cancer screening and associated factors among women in rural Uganda. Methods This descriptive cross sectional study was carried out in Bugiri and Mayuge districts in eastern Uganda and utilised quantitative data collection methods. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire on cervical cancer screening among females aged between 25 and 49 years who had spent six or more months in the area. Data were entered in Epidata 3.02 and analysed in STATA 12.0 statistical software. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results Of the 900 women, only 43 (4.8%) had ever been screened for cervical cancer. Among respondents who were screened, 21 (48.8%) did so because they had been requested by a health worker, 17 (39.5%) had certain signs and symptoms they associated with cervical cancer while 16 (37.2%) did it voluntarily to know their status. Barriers to cervical cancer screening were negative individual perceptions 553 (64.5%) and health facility related challenges 142 (16.6%). Other respondents said they were not aware of the screening service 416 (48.5%). The independent predictors of cervical cancer screening were: being recommended by a health worker [AOR = 87.85, p<0.001], knowing where screening services were offered [AOR = 6.24, p = 0.004], and knowing someone who had ever been screened [AOR = 9.48, p = 0.001]. Conclusion The prevalence of cervical cancer screening is very low in rural Uganda. Interventions to increase uptake of cervical cancer screening should be implemented so as to improve access to the service in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2282209564,"There is a need to increase people’s engagement with and connection to nature, both for human well-being and the conservation of nature itself. In order to suggest ways for people to engage with nature and create a wider social context to normalise nature engagement, The Wildlife Trusts developed a mass engagement campaign, 30 Days Wild. The campaign asked people to engage with nature every day for a month. 12,400 people signed up for 30 Days Wild via an online sign-up with an estimated 18,500 taking part overall, resulting in an estimated 300,000 engagements with nature by participants. Samples of those taking part were found to have sustained increases in happiness, health, connection to nature and pro-nature behaviours. With the improvement in health being predicted by the improvement in happiness, this relationship was mediated by the change in connection to nature."
https://openalex.org/W2273841829,"Yellow and red-violet betalain plant pigments are restricted to several families in the order Caryophyllales, where betacyanins play analogous biological roles to anthocyanins. The initial step in betalain biosynthesis is the hydroxylation of tyrosine to form L-DOPA. Using gene expression experiments in beets, yeast, and Arabidopsis, along with HPLC/MS analysis, the present study shows that two novel cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, CYP76AD6 and CYP76AD5, and the previously described CYP76AD1 can perform this initial step. Co-expressing these CYP450s with DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase in yeast, and overexpression of these CYP450s in yellow beets show that CYP76AD1 efficiently uses L-DOPA leading to red betacyanins while CYP76AD6 and CYP76AD5 lack this activity. Furthermore, CYP76AD1 can complement yellow beetroots to red while CYP76AD6 and CYP76AD5 cannot. Therefore CYP76AD1 uniquely performs the beet R locus function and beets appear to be genetically redundant for tyrosine hydroxylation. These new functional data and ancestral character state reconstructions indicate that tyrosine hydroxylation alone was the most likely ancestral function of the CYP76AD alpha and beta groups and the ability to convert L-DOPA to cyclo-DOPA evolved later in the alpha group."
https://openalex.org/W2284378488,We present a mathematical model for vascular tumor growth. We use phase fields to model cellular growth and reaction-diffusion equations for the dynamics of angiogenic factors and nutrients. The model naturally predicts the shift from avascular to vascular growth at realistic scales. Our computations indicate that the negative regulation of the Delta-like ligand 4 signaling pathway slows down tumor growth by producing a larger density of non-functional capillaries. Our results show good quantitative agreement with experiments.
https://openalex.org/W4210304426,"The specific autophagic elimination of mitochondria (mitophagy) plays the role of quality control for this organelle. Deregulation of mitophagy leads to an increased number of damaged mitochondria and triggers cell death. The deterioration of mitophagy has been hypothesized to underlie the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson disease. Although some of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control are described in detail, physiological or pathological triggers of mitophagy are still not fully characterized. Here we show that the induction of mitophagy by the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP is independent of the effect of mitochondrial membrane potential but dependent on acidification of the cytosol by FCCP. The ionophore nigericin also reduces cytosolic pH and induces PINK1/PARKIN-dependent and -independent mitophagy. The increase of intracellular pH with monensin suppresses the effects of FCCP and nigericin on mitochondrial degradation. Thus, a change in intracellular pH is a regulator of mitochondrial quality control."
https://openalex.org/W2285460751,"The hallmark of fibrotic disorders is a highly cross-linked and dense collagen matrix, a property driven by the oxidative action of lysyl oxidase. Other fibrosis-associated proteins also contribute to the final collagen matrix properties, one of which is fibromodulin. Its interactions with collagen affect collagen cross-linking, packing, and fibril diameter. We investigated the possibility that a specific relationship exists between fibromodulin and lysyl oxidase, potentially imparting a specific collagen matrix phenotype. We mapped the fibromodulin-collagen interaction sites using the collagen II and III Toolkit peptide libraries. Fibromodulin interacted with the peptides containing the known collagen cross-linking sites and the MMP-1 cleavage site in collagens I and II. Interestingly, the interaction sites are closely aligned within the quarter-staggered collagen fibril, suggesting a multivalent interaction between fibromodulin and several collagen helices. Furthermore, we detected an interaction between fibromodulin and lysyl oxidase (a major collagen cross-linking enzyme) and mapped the interaction site to 12 N-terminal amino acids on fibromodulin. This interaction also increases the activity of lysyl oxidase. Together, the data suggest a fibromodulin-modulated collagen cross-linking mechanism where fibromodulin binds to a specific part of the collagen domain and also forms a complex with lysyl oxidase, targeting the enzyme toward specific cross-linking sites."
https://openalex.org/W2284024436,"Asparaginase is an important antileukemic agent extensively used worldwide but the intrinsic glutaminase activity of this enzymatic drug is responsible for serious life threatening side effects. Hence, glutaminase free asparaginase is much needed for upgradation of therapeutic index of asparaginase therapy. In the present study, glutaminase free asparaginase produced from Enterobacter cloacae was purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme was found to be homodimer of approximately 106 kDa with monomeric size of approximately 52 kDa and pI 4.5. Purified enzyme showed optimum activity between pH 7-8 and temperature 35-40°C, which is close to the internal environment of human body. Monovalent cations such as Na+ and K+ enhanced asparaginase activity whereas divalent and trivalent cations, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Fe3+ inhibited the enzyme activity. Kinetic parameters Km, Vmax and Kcat of purified enzyme were found to be 1.58×10-3 M, 2.22 IU μg-1 and 5.3 × 104 S-1, respectively. Purified enzyme showed prolonged in vitro serum (T1/2 = ~ 39 h) and trypsin (T1/2 = ~ 32 min) half life, which is therapeutically remarkable feature. The cytotoxic activity of enzyme was examined against a panel of human cancer cell lines, HL-60, MOLT-4, MDA-MB-231 and T47D, and highest cytotoxicity observed against HL-60 cells (IC50 ~ 3.1 IU ml-1), which was comparable to commercial asparaginase. Cell and nuclear morphological studies of HL-60 cells showed that on treatment with purified asparaginase symptoms of apoptosis were increased in dose dependent manner. Cell cycle progression analysis indicates that enzyme induces apoptosis by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Mitochondrial membrane potential loss showed that enzyme also triggers the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Furthermore, the enzyme was found to be nontoxic for human noncancerous cells FR-2 and nonhemolytic for human erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2286322794,"Background The number of morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery (BS) has increased dramatically in recent years. Therefore, monitoring food intake and its consequences in terms of nutritional status is necessary to prevent nutritional deficiencies. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of food restriction on nutritional parameters in the short-term (≤3 months) period after BS in morbid obesity. Method In a prospective study, we followed 22 obese women who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) or adjustable gastric banding (AGB) at baseline (T0) and 1 (T1) and 3 (T3) months after surgery. We evaluated food intake, nutrient adequacy and serum concentrations of vitamins and minerals known to be at risk for deficiency following BS. Results Before surgery, we observed suboptimal food intakes, leading to a risk of micronutrient deficiencies. Serum analysis confirmed nutritional deficiencies for iron and thiamine for 27 and 23% of the patients, respectively. The drastic energy and food reduction seen in the short term led to very low probabilities of adequacy for nutrients equivalent across both surgeries. Serum analysis demonstrated a continuous decrease in prealbumin during the follow-up, indicating mild protein depletion in 21 and 57% of GBP patients and 50 and 63% of AGB patients, respectively, at T1 and T3. Regarding vitamins and minerals, systematic supplementation after GBP prevented most nutritional deficiencies. By contrast, AGB patients, for whom there is no systematic supplementation, developed such deficiencies. Conclusions Our results suggest that cautious monitoring of protein intake after BS is mandatory. Furthermore, AGB patients might also benefit from systematic multivitamin and mineral supplementation at least in the short term."
https://openalex.org/W2283924758,"Aim To evaluate the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and antifibrotic effects of carvedilol (CARV) in rats with ethanol-induced liver injury. Methods Liver injury was induced by gavage administration of alcohol (7 g/kg) for 28 consecutive days. Eighty Wistar rats were pretreated with oral CARV at 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg or with saline 1 h before exposure to alcohol. Liver homogenates were assayed for interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level as well as for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity and liver triglyceride (TG) levels were also assayed. Immunohistochemical analyses of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B/ligand (RANK/RANKL), suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS1), the Kupffer cell marker IBA-1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) expression were performed. Confocal microscopy analysis of IL-1β and NF-κB expression and real-time quantitative PCR analysis for TNFα, PCI, PCIII, and NF-κB were performed. Results CARV treatment (5 mg/kg) during the alcohol exposure protocol was associated with reduced steatosis, hepatic cord degeneration, fibrosis and necrosis, as well as reduced levels of AST (p < 0.01), ALT (p < 0.01), TG (p < 0.001), MPO (p < 0.001), MDA (p < 0.05), and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α, both p < 0.05), and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (p < 0.001) and GSH (p < 0.05), compared to the alcohol-only group. Treatment with CARV 5 mg/kg also reduced expression levels of COX-2, RANK, RANKL, IBA-1, and ICAM-1 (all p < 0.05), while increasing expression of SOCS1, SOD-1, and GPx-1 (all p < 0.05) and decreasing expression of IL-1β and NF-κB (both, p < 0.05). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that mRNA production of TNF-α, procollagen type I (PCI), procollagen type III (PCIII), and NF-κB were decreased in the alcohol-CARV 5 mg/kg group relative to the alcohol-only group. Conclusions CARV can reduce the stress oxidative, inflammatory response and fibrosis in ethanol-induced liver injury in a rat model by downregulating signalling of Kuppfer cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) through suppression of inflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2283753265,"Assessing current fatigue of athletes to fine-tune training prescriptions is a critical task in competitive sports. Blood-borne surrogate markers are widely used despite the scarcity of validation trials with representative subjects and interventions. Moreover, differences between training modes and disciplines (e.g. due to differences in eccentric force production or calorie turnover) have rarely been studied within a consistent design. Therefore, we investigated blood-borne fatigue markers during and after discipline-specific simulated training camps. A comprehensive panel of blood-born indicators was measured in 73 competitive athletes (28 cyclists, 22 team sports, 23 strength) at 3 time-points: after a run-in resting phase (d 1), after a 6-day induction of fatigue (d 8) and following a subsequent 2-day recovery period (d 11). Venous blood samples were collected between 8 and 10 a.m. Courses of blood-borne indicators are considered as fatigue dependent if a significant deviation from baseline is present at day 8 (Δfatigue) which significantly regresses towards baseline until day 11 (Δrecovery). With cycling, a fatigue dependent course was observed for creatine kinase (CK; Δfatigue 54±84 U/l; Δrecovery -60±83 U/l), urea (Δfatigue 11±9 mg/dl; Δrecovery -10±10 mg/dl), free testosterone (Δfatigue -1.3±2.1 pg/ml; Δrecovery 0.8±1.5 pg/ml) and insulin linke growth factor 1 (IGF-1; Δfatigue -56±28 ng/ml; Δrecovery 53±29 ng/ml). For urea and IGF-1 95% confidence intervals for days 1 and 11 did not overlap with day 8. With strength and high-intensity interval training, respectively, fatigue-dependent courses and separated 95% confidence intervals were present for CK (strength: Δfatigue 582±649 U/l; Δrecovery -618±419 U/l; HIIT: Δfatigue 863±952 U/l; Δrecovery -741±842 U/l) only. These results indicate that, within a comprehensive panel of blood-borne markers, changes in fatigue are most accurately reflected by urea and IGF-1 for cycling and by CK for strength training and team sport players."
https://openalex.org/W2284698038,"Newer molecular diagnostics have brought paradigm shift in early diagnosis of tuberculosis [TB]. WHO recommended use of GeneXpert MTB/RIF [Xpert] for Extra-pulmonary [EP] TB; critics have since questioned its efficiency.The present study was designed to assess the performance of GeneXpert in 761 extra-pulmonary and 384 pulmonary specimens from patients clinically suspected of TB and compare with Phenotypic, Genotypic and Composite reference standards [CRS].Comparison of GeneXpert results to CRS, demonstrated sensitivity of 100% and 90.68%, specificity of 100% and 99.62% for pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples. On comparison with culture, sensitivity for Rifampicin [Rif] resistance detection was 87.5% and 81.82% respectively, while specificity was 100% for both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. On comparison to sequencing of rpoB gene [Rif resistance determining region, RRDR], sensitivity was respectively 93.33% and 90% while specificity was 100% in both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. GeneXpert assay missed 533CCG mutation in one sputum and dual mutation [517 & 519] in one pus sample, detected by sequencing. Sequencing picked dual mutation [529, 530] in a sputum sample sensitive to Rif, demonstrating, not all RRDR mutations lead to resistance.Current study reports observations in a patient care setting in a high burden region, from a large collection of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples and puts to rest questions regarding sensitivity, specificity, detection of infrequent mutations and mutations responsible for low-level Rif resistance by GeneXpert. Improvements in the assay could offer further improvement in sensitivity of detection in different patient samples; nevertheless it may be difficult to improve sensitivity of Rif resistance detection if only one gene is targeted. Assay specificity was high both for TB detection and Rif resistance detection. Despite a few misses, the assay offers major boost to early diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB, in difficult to diagnose pauci-bacillary TB."
https://openalex.org/W2288177690,"In the last years Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology has benefited from the development of sophisticated machine leaning methods that let the user operate the BCI after a few trials of calibration. One remarkable example is the recent development of co-adaptive techniques that proved to extend the use of BCIs also to people not able to achieve successful control with the standard BCI procedure. Especially for BCIs based on the modulation of the Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) these improvements are essential, since a not negligible percentage of users is unable to operate SMR-BCIs efficiently. In this study we evaluated for the first time a fully automatic co-adaptive BCI system on a large scale. A pool of 168 participants naive to BCIs operated the co-adaptive SMR-BCI in one single session. Different psychological interventions were performed prior the BCI session in order to investigate how motor coordination training and relaxation could influence BCI performance. A neurophysiological indicator based on the Power Spectral Density (PSD) was extracted by the recording of few minutes of resting state brain activity and tested as predictor of BCI performances. Results show that high accuracies in operating the BCI could be reached by the majority of the participants before the end of the session. BCI performances could be significantly predicted by the neurophysiological indicator, consolidating the validity of the model previously developed. Anyway, we still found about 22% of users with performance significantly lower than the threshold of efficient BCI control at the end of the session. Being the inter-subject variability still the major problem of BCI technology, we pointed out crucial issues for those who did not achieve sufficient control. Finally, we propose valid developments to move a step forward to the applicability of the promising co-adaptive methods."
https://openalex.org/W2274854214,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) continues to develop as a clinical tool for patients with brain cancer, offering data that may directly influence surgical decisions. Unfortunately, routine integration of preoperative fMRI has been limited by concerns about reliability. Many pertinent studies have been undertaken involving healthy controls, but work involving brain tumor patients has been limited. To develop fMRI fully as a clinical tool, it will be critical to examine these reliability issues among patients with brain tumors. The present work is the first to extensively characterize differences in activation map quality between brain tumor patients and healthy controls, including the effects of tumor grade and the chosen behavioral testing paradigm on reliability outcomes.Test-retest data were collected for a group of low-grade (n = 6) and high-grade glioma (n = 6) patients, and for matched healthy controls (n = 12), who performed motor and language tasks during a single fMRI session. Reliability was characterized by the spatial overlap and displacement of brain activity clusters, BOLD signal stability, and the laterality index. Significance testing was performed to assess differences in reliability between the patients and controls, and low-grade and high-grade patients; as well as between different fMRI testing paradigms.There were few significant differences in fMRI reliability measures between patients and controls. Reliability was significantly lower when comparing high-grade tumor patients to controls, or to low-grade tumor patients. The motor task produced more reliable activation patterns than the language tasks, as did the rhyming task in comparison to the phonemic fluency task.In low-grade glioma patients, fMRI data are as reliable as healthy control subjects. For high-grade glioma patients, further investigation is required to determine the underlying causes of reduced reliability. To maximize reliability outcomes, testing paradigms should be carefully selected to generate robust activation patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2281948967,"Reference genes used in normalizing qRT-PCR data are critical for the accuracy of gene expression analysis. However, many traditional reference genes used in zebrafish early development are not appropriate because of their variable expression levels during embryogenesis. In the present study, we used our previous RNA-Seq dataset to identify novel reference genes suitable for gene expression analysis during zebrafish early developmental stages. We first selected 197 most stably expressed genes from an RNA-Seq dataset (29,291 genes in total), according to the ratio of their maximum to minimum RPKM values. Among the 197 genes, 4 genes with moderate expression levels and the least variation throughout 9 developmental stages were identified as candidate reference genes. Using four independent statistical algorithms (delta-CT, geNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder), the stability of qRT-PCR expression of these candidates was then evaluated and compared to that of actb1 and actb2, two commonly used zebrafish reference genes. Stability rankings showed that two genes, namely mobk13 (mob4) and lsm12b, were more stable than actb1 and actb2 in most cases. To further test the suitability of mobk13 and lsm12b as novel reference genes, they were used to normalize three well-studied target genes. The results showed that mobk13 and lsm12b were more suitable than actb1 and actb2 with respect to zebrafish early development. We recommend mobk13 and lsm12b as new optimal reference genes for zebrafish qRT-PCR analysis during embryogenesis and early larval stages."

TSC1, TSC2, and TBC1D7 form the core of the TSC protein complex in the cell, which migrates in size exclusion chromatography with a peak mass of ∼2 MDa (26.Menon S. Dibble C.C. Talbott G. Hoxhaj G.

Consistent with its important role in the TSC protein complex, knockdown of TBC1D7 results in decreased association of TSC1 and TSC2, leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions (25.Dibble C.C.

Intriguingly, overexpression of TBC1D7 was also reported to increase mTORC1 activity (23.Nakashima A. Yoshino K. Miyamoto T. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Kikkawa U. Yonezawa K. Identification of TBC7 having TBC domain as a novel binding protein to TSC1-TSC2 complex.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). TBC1D7 mutations have not been found in TSC patients, but homozygous loss of TBC1D7 causes intellectual disability and megalencephaly, a developmental disorder associated with mTORC1 activation (27.Capo-Chichi J.M. Tcherkezian J. Hamdan F.F. Décarie J.C. Dobrzeniecka S. Patry L. Nadon M.A. Mucha B.E. Major P. Shevell M. Bencheikh B.O. Joober R. Samuels M.E. Rouleau G.A. Roux P.P. Michaud J.L. Disruption of TBC1D7, a subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 protein complex, in intellectual disability and megalencephaly.J. Med. Genet. 2013; 50: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Genome-wide brain tissue expression analysis also identified TBC1D7 as a susceptibility locus for migraine (28.Anttila V. Winsvold B.S. Gormley P. Kurth T. Bettella F. McMahon G. Kallela M. Malik R. de Vries B. Terwindt G. Medland S.E. Todt U. McArdle W.L. Quaye L. Koiranen M. et al.Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new susceptibility loci for migraine.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). More recently, loss-of-function TBC1D7 mutations were associated with intellectual disability, macrocrania, patellar dislocation, and celiac disease (29.Alfaiz A.A. Micale L. Mandriani B. Augello B. Pellico M.T. Chrast J. Xenarios I. Zelante L. Merla G. Reymond A. TBC1D7 mutations are associated with intellectual disability, macrocrania, patellar dislocation, and celiac disease.Hum. Mutat. 2014; 35: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, elevated expression of TBC1D7 is associated with lung cancer. In this situation, TSC1 may stabilize TBC1D7 and thus promote tumorigenesis (24.Sato N. Koinuma J. Ito T. Tsuchiya E. Kondo S. Nakamura Y. Daigo Y. Activation of an oncogenic TBC1D7 (TBC1 domain family, member 7) protein in pulmonary carcinogenesis.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010; 49: 353-367PubMed Google Scholar). TBC1D7 is a 293-residue member of the TBC family of proteins. TBC domains usually function as GAPs for members of the Rab family of small G-proteins using a dual-finger mechanism (30.Pan X. Eathiraj S. Munson M. Lambright D.G.

Although the TBC1D7 TBC domain (residues 50–231) does not contain the two most critical catalytic (“finger”) residues (25.Dibble C.C. Elis W. Menon S. Qin W. Klekota J. Asara J.M. Finan P.M. Kwiatkowski D.J. Murphy L.O. Manning B.D.

Ahmadian M.R. Braga V.M. Illuminating the functional and structural repertoire of human TBC/RABGAPs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), TBC1D7 was shown to specifically inactivate Rab17 and to be involved in primary cilia formation (32.Yoshimura S. Egerer J. Fuchs E. Haas A.K. Barr F.A. Functional dissection of Rab GTPases involved in primary cilium formation.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus it remains unclear as to whether TBC1D7 might serve as a GAP. TSC1 contains a folded N-terminal domain (residues 1–265) that is important for TSC1 folding and stability (33.Mozaffari M. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Kwiatkowski D. Sampson J. Ekong R. Povey S. den Dunnen J.T. van den Ouweland A. Halley D. Nellist M.

Crystal structure of the yeast TSC1 core domain and implications for tuberous sclerosis pathological mutations.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mutations affecting this domain account for the majority of pathogenic TSC1 missense mutations. In addition to the N-terminal domain, TSC1 contains a large coiled-coil domain (residues 725–988). The N-terminal region of this domain (residues 681–937), along with a discrete more N-terminal region (residues 302–430), were shown to be important for TSC2 binding (35.Santiago Lima A.J. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Nakashima A. Maat-Kievit A. van den Ouweland A. Halley D. Kikkawa U. Nellist M. Identification of regions critical for the integrity of the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex.PloS One. 2014; 9: e93940Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The TBC1D7-binding site of TSC1 was mapped to the C-terminal region of the coiled-coil domain (residue 939–977) (35.Santiago Lima A.J. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Nakashima A. Maat-Kievit A. van den Ouweland A. Halley D. Kikkawa U. Nellist M. Identification of regions critical for the integrity of the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex.PloS One. 2014; 9: e93940Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of the TSC1-TBC1D7 interaction and TSC complex function, we have determined the crystal structure of a TSC1-TBC1D7 complex. Our work provides new insight into the formation and structure of the TSC complex and will facilitate future studies aimed at understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying TSC1, TSC2, and TBC1D7 dysregulation in human disease. A bacterial expression plasmid of human TBC1D7 was constructed by cloning the full-length cDNA into a self-made vector named pCool. DNA sequences expressing residues 19–293 of TBC1D7 were inserted into a pGEX-4T-1 vector (Novagen). DNA sequences encoding residues 939–992 of human TSC1 were inserted into the pCool vector. GST-tagged recombinant proteins were produced in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the cell density reached A600 = 0.8, after which point the temperature was shifted to 18 °C for 20 h. GST-tagged TBC1D7 was first purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), followed by anion exchange (MonoQ, GE Healthcare) and gel-filtration column chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare). Selenomethionine-substituted TBC1D7(19–293) with a N-terminal GST tag was expressed using the autoinduction method. TBC1D7(19–293)-TSC1(939–992) complex crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at 25 °C in 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 15% PEG-3350. Single or multiple point mutations of TBC1D7 and TSC1 were generated by PCR and verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified following the same protocol as for the wild-type (wt) proteins. The 3.1-Å resolution native dataset and the 3.2-Å resolution single wavelength anomalous dispersion dataset were collected using the BL 8.2.1 and BL 8.2.2 beamlines of the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley. The datasets were processed with HKL2000 (36.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of X-ray Diffraction Data Collected in Oscillation Mode. Academic Press, New York1997Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the C2 space group and there are two TSC1-TBC1D7 complexes in one asymmetric unit. The selenium sites were searched by AutoSol in PHENIX (37.Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16436) Google Scholar), and all 16 potential selenium sites were found and used for phasing. Autobuilding was carried out with ARP/wARP in the CCP4 suite (38.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The 1.9-Å resolution structure of human TBC1D7 (Protein Data Bank code 3QWL) was used to guide model building. The 3.1-Å resolution native dataset was used for refinement. Model building was performed in COOT (39.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17079) Google Scholar) and iterative cycles of model building were fulfilled by Refmac5 in CCP4 (38.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16436) Google Scholar). NCS restraint and TLS were used throughout refinement. The electrostatic potential surfaces shown were generated by the APBS tool in PyMOL (40.DeLano W.L. Brünger A.T. Helix packing in proteins: prediction and energetic analysis of dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric GCN4 coiled-coil structures.Proteins. 1994; 20: 105-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ITC was performed on a VP-ITC Microcal colorimeter (Microcal) at 25 °C. TBC1D7 and TSC1 fragments were buffer exchanged into 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT using size exclusion on a prepacked Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), eluting at a final concentration of ∼15–20 μm. Both ligand and protein were degassed before use. TBC1D7 concentrated to 200 μm was injected in 5-μl quantities every 5 min for a total of 25–40 injections into a 1.4218-ml protein chamber with TSC1, GST-TSC1, or GST separately. Data were analyzed using Origin 7.0. Purified TSC1(939–992) and TBC1D7(1–293) wt and mutant proteins were used in pulldown experiments. All binding and wash steps were carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT and 0.1% Tween 20. All GST pulldowns were repeated three times and stained with Coomassie Blue. To semiquantify the GST pulldown results, we also performed technical triplicates for all TSC1 and TBC1D7 wt/mutant proteins and stained the SDS-PAGE gels using Oriole Fluorescent Gel Stain (Bio-Rad). TSC1(939–992), TBC1D7(1–293), and different molar ratios of TBC1D7 and TSC1 were measured by analytical ultracentrifugation analysis performed on a XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) with a four-cell An-60 Ti rotor. All proteins were in the same buffer, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. The absorbance data at 280 nm were collected at 20 °C. Rotor speed was set at 45,000 rpm for all samples. The analytical ultracentrifugation data were analyzed by the SEDFIT (version 14.81) software. Size exclusion chromatography-coupled multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments were performed at room temperature by loading samples on a 24-ml size exclusion column with a TREOS MiniDAWN MALS detector (Wyatt Technology). TBC1D7 and TSC1 were purified on a Superdex 200 column, using a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. The light scattered by a protein was directly proportional to its weight-average molecular mass and concentration. TBC1D7 and TSC1 variants were derived by site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing of the complete open reading frame. Human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transfected as described previously (35.Santiago Lima A.J. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Nakashima A. Maat-Kievit A. van den Ouweland A. Halley D. Kikkawa U. Nellist M. Identification of regions critical for the integrity of the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex.PloS One. 2014; 9: e93940Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed 24 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and signal quantification were performed as described previously (35.Santiago Lima A.J. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Nakashima A. Maat-Kievit A. van den Ouweland A. Halley D. Kikkawa U. Nellist M. Identification of regions critical for the integrity of the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex.PloS One. 2014; 9: e93940Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) (9B11 anti-myc mouse monoclonal, number 2276; anti-HA tag rabbit polyclonal, number 3724), Covance (Princeton, NJ) (mouse anti-HA tag, MMS-101R), or Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE) (goat anti-rabbit 680 nm, 926–68073; and goat anti-mouse 800 nm conjugates, 926–68072). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against human TSC2 were described previously (4.van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Interaction between hamartin and tuberin, the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Anti-myc (E6654) and anti-HA (E6779) affinity resins were purchased from Sigma. To map the TSC1-TBC1D7 interaction regions in each protein, we overexpressed and purified human TBC1D7 and various GST-tagged human TSC1 fragments. Pulldown experiments using the purified proteins showed that TSC1(939–992) was sufficient for interacting with TBC1D7 (Fig. 1a). TBC1D7 and TSC1(939–992) formed a stable complex and co-migrated in SEC. To minimize shape effects, we used SEC-MALS to measure the molecular weight of each protein and the respective complexes (Fig. 1c). Although the N-terminal half of TSC1(939–992) is part of the predicted TSC1 coiled-coil domain, TSC1(939–992) behaved as a monomer in solution. ITC analysis demonstrated that, when concentrated full-length TBC1D7 is titrated into TSC1(939–992), the apparent Kd for the TBC1D7-TSC1(939–992) interaction is 6.9 μm, with an N number ∼0.5, suggesting two TSC1(939–992) molecules interact with one TBC1D7 molecule (Fig. 1b). Because TSC1(939–992) is monomeric in solution, it is possible that the above ITC result is a mixed effect of TSC1(939–992) dimerization and TBC1D7 binding. Thus we performed ITC analysis using GST-TSC1(939–992), which forms a homodimer in the absence of TBC1D7 based on the SEC-MALS result (data not shown). Under similar ITC titration conditions, TBC1D7 has a Kd of 0.4 μm, which is ∼18-fold tighter than untagged TSC1(939–992) (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that preformed TSC1 dimers enhance TBC1D7 binding. TBC1D7 residues 1–18 are not highly conserved and are predicted to be intrinsically disordered by the metaPrDOS server (41.Ishida T. Kinoshita K. Prediction of disordered regions in proteins based on the meta approach.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ITC showed that full-length TBC1D7 and N-terminal truncated TBC1D7 (residues 19–293) interacted with TSC1(939–992) with comparable affinities: 0.4 and 0.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 1b). Thus we used TBC1D7(19–293) in our structural analysis. In contrast to monomeric TSC1(939–992), a longer TSC1 fragment, TSC1(871–992), existed predominantly as a homodimer (Fig. 1c). We examined the TSC1-TBC1D7 interaction in the SEC-MALS assay using three different TSC1 fragments: 837–992, 871–992, and 939–992. In each case the TSC1-TBC1D7 complex contained two TSC1 molecules and one TBC1D7 molecule (Fig. 1c). To reveal how TBC1D7 interacts with TSC1, we determined the crystal structure of the TSC1 TBC1D7-binding domain (residues 939–992) in complex with near full-length TBC1D7(19–293), using the Se-Met single wavelength anomalous dispersion method (Table 1). In each crystallographic asymmetric unit, there were two TBC1D7 molecules and four TSC1(939–992) fragments. The first 39 residues of each TSC1 helix (residues 939–977) formed a single helix, whereas the last 15 residues were not visible in our electron density map. Two TSC1 helices, A and B, from two different TSC1 molecules, formed a parallel coiled-coil and interacted with one TBC1D7 molecule. Thus there were two 2:1 TSC1-TBC1D7 complexes in each asymmetric unit. Both complexes have almost identical structures, with a r.m.s. deviation value of 0.135 Å. From now on, we will focus on the analysis of the 2:1 TSC1(939–992)-TBC1D7 complex (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Statistics of crystallographic analysisDatasetSeMetNativeData collectionSpace groupC2C2Cell dimensionsa = 180.96 Å, b = 66.04 Å, c = 98.67 Å,a = 183.40 Å, b = 66.70 Å, c = 98.37 Å,α = γ = 90.00°, β = 90.67°α = γ = 90.00°, β = 91.91°Wavelength0.9792 Å1.0000 ÅResolution50.00 Å - 3.20 Å (3.29Å – 3.20 Å)50.00 Å - 3.10Å (3.19 Å – 3.10 Å)Unique reflections19,42921,259Rsym9.1% (91.7%)10.8% (75.8%)〈I〉/〈SIGI〉21.3 (1.40)11.7 (1.45)Completeness99.7% (99.1%)99.7% (98.6%)CC1/2aCC1/2 is the correlation coefficient between symmetry-related intensities taken from random halves of the data set.(0.694)(0.726)Redundancy3.7 (3.6)3.5 (3.1)RefinementRwork/Rfree21.8% / 23.8%Average B factor79.28Å2R.m.s. deviation bond ideality0.0053ÅR.m.s. deviation angle ideality0.9778°Ramachandran favored98.0%Ramachandran allowed2.0%Protein residues679Water0a CC1/2 is the correlation coefficient between symmetry-related intensities taken from random halves of the data set.

The two TSC1 helices predominantly dock onto the longest helix in the TBC1D7 structure (helix α4; residues 70–95; Fig. 2), which is located on a surface distinct from the Rab small G-protein binding sites on other TBC family members (see below). Both TSC1(939–992) A and B helices interact directly with TBC1D7. Helix A makes the majority of the interactions and lies roughly parallel to the long TBC1D7 α4 helix (residues 74–95).

https://openalex.org/W2280601765,"Globally, farmed seaweed production is expanding rapidly in shallow marine habitats. While seaweed farming provides vital income to millions of artisanal farmers, it can negatively impact shallow coral reef and seagrass habitats. However, seaweed farming may also potentially provide food subsidies for herbivorous reef fish such as the Siganidae, a valuable target family, resulting in increased catch. Comparisons of reef fish landings across the central Philippines revealed that the catch of siganids was positively correlated to farmed seaweed production whilst negatively correlated to total reef fish catch over the same period of time. We tested the generality of this pattern by analysing seaweed production, siganid catch, and reef fish catch for six major seaweed-producing countries in the tropics. We hypothesized that increased seaweed production would correspond with increased catch of siganids but not other reef fish species. Analysis of the global data showed a positive correlation between farmed seaweeds and siganids in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) but not Africa (Tanzania and Zanzibar), or the Western Pacific (Fiji). In Southeast Asia, siganid catch increased disproportionately faster with seaweed production than did reef fish catch. Low continuity, sporadic production and smaller volumes of seaweed farming may explain the differences."
https://openalex.org/W2281186257,"Starch is of fundamental importance for plant development and reproduction and its optimized molecular assembly is potentially necessary for correct starch metabolism. Re-structuring of starch granules in-planta can therefore potentially affect plant metabolism. Modulation of granule micro-structure was achieved by decreasing starch branching and increasing starch-bound phosphate content in the barley caryopsis starch by RNAi suppression of all three Starch Branching Enzyme (SBE) isoforms or overexpression of potato Glucan Water Dikinase (GWD). The resulting lines displayed Amylose-Only (AO) and Hyper-Phosphorylated (HP) starch chemotypes, respectively. We studied the influence of these alterations on primary metabolism, grain composition, starch structural features and starch granule morphology over caryopsis development at 10, 20 and 30 days after pollination (DAP) and at grain maturity. While HP showed relatively little effect, AO showed significant reduction in starch accumulation with re-direction to protein and β-glucan (BG) accumulation. Metabolite profiling indicated significantly higher sugar accumulation in AO, with re-partitioning of carbon to accumulate amino acids, and interestingly it also had high levels of some important stress-related metabolites and potentially protective metabolites, possibly to elude deleterious effects. Investigations on starch molecular structure revealed significant increase in starch phosphate and amylose content in HP and AO respectively with obvious differences in starch granule morphology at maturity. The results demonstrate that decreasing the storage starch branching resulted in metabolic adjustments and re-directions, tuning to evade deleterious effects on caryopsis physiology and plant performance while only little effect was evident by increasing starch-bound phosphate as a result of overexpressing GWD."
https://openalex.org/W2277922850,"Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is an acyltransferase/GTP-binding protein that contributes to the development of various diseases. In human cancer cells, tTG activates signaling pathways that promote cell growth and survival, whereas in other disorders (i.e. neurodegeneration), overexpression of tTG enhances cell death. Therefore, it is important to understand how tTG is differentially regulated and functioning to promote diametrically distinct cellular outcomes. Previous structural studies revealed that tTG adopts either a nucleotide-bound closed conformation or a transamidation-competent open conformation. Here we provide evidence showing that these different conformational states determine whether tTG promotes, or is detrimental to, cell survival, with the open conformation of the protein being responsible for inducing cell death. First, we demonstrate that a nucleotide binding-defective form of tTG, which has previously been shown to induce cell death, assumes an open conformation in solution as assessed by an enhanced sensitivity to trypsin digestion and by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. We next identify two pairs of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that, based on existing x-ray structures, are predicted to form between the most C-terminal β-barrel domain and the catalytic core domain of tTG. By disrupting these hydrogen bonds, we are able to generate forms of tTG that constitutively assume an open conformation and induce apoptosis. These findings provide important insights into how tTG participates in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly with regard to the actions of a C-terminal truncated form of tTG (TG-Short) that has been linked to such disorders and induces apoptosis by assuming an open-like conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2279930361,"Microparticles (MPs) are small membrane fragments shed from normal as well as activated, apoptotic or injured cells. Emerging evidence implicates MPs as a causal and/or contributing factor in altering normal vascular cell phenotype through initiation of proinflammatory signal transduction events and paracrine delivery of proteins, mRNA and miRNA. However, little is known regarding the mechanism by which MPs influence these events. Caveolae are important membrane microdomains that function as centers of signal transduction and endocytosis. Here, we tested the concept that the MP-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype shift in endothelial cells (ECs) depends on caveolae. Consistent with previous reports, MP challenge activated ECs as evidenced by upregulation of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. ICAM-1 upregulation was mediated by activation of NF-κB, Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This response was absent in ECs lacking caveolin-1/caveolae. To test whether caveolae-mediated endocytosis, a dynamin-2 dependent process, is a feature of the proinflammatory response, EC’s were pretreated with the dynamin-2 inhibitor dynasore. Similar to observations in cells lacking caveolin-1, inhibition of endocytosis significantly attenuated MPs effects including, EGFR phosphorylation, activation of NF-κB and upregulation of ICAM-1 expression. Thus, our results indicate that caveolae play a role in mediating the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways which lead to EC activation in response to MPs."

https://openalex.org/W2287059485,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation, is a cytoprotective enzyme upregulated in the vasculature by increased flow and inflammatory stimuli. Human genetic data suggest that a diminished HO-1 expression may predispose one to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. In addition, heme is known to strongly induce HO-1 expression. Utilizing the porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) model of AAA induction in HO-1 heterozygous (HO-1+/-, HO-1 Het) mice, we found that a deficiency in HO-1 leads to augmented AAA development. Peritoneal macrophages from HO-1+/- mice showed increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IL-1-beta, and IL-6, but decreased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta. Furthermore, treatment with heme returned AAA progression in HO-1 Het mice to a wild-type profile. Using a second murine AAA model (Ang II-ApoE-/-), we showed that low doses of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin can induce HO-1 expression in aortic tissue and suppress AAA progression in the absence of lipid lowering. Our results support those studies that suggest that pleiotropic statin effects might be beneficial in AAA, possibly through the upregulation of HO-1. Specific targeted therapies designed to induce HO-1 could become an adjunctive therapeutic strategy for the prevention of AAA disease."

However, they are not well detected at the early stages of the cancer. In the present study, perchloric acid (PCA) was used to enhance detection of mucin-type O-glycosylated proteins in the serum in an attempt to identify new biomarkers for early stage breast cancer. Sensitivity and specificity of an earlier developed sandwich enzyme-linked lectin assay were significantly improved with the use of serum PCA isolates. When a pilot case-control study was performed using the serum PCA isolates of normal participants (n = 105) and patients with stage 0 (n = 31) and stage I (n = 48) breast cancer, higher levels of total O-glycosylated proteins in sera of both groups of early stage breast cancer patients compared to the normal control women were demonstrated. Further analysis by gel-based proteomics detected significant inverse altered abundance of proteoglycan 4 and plasma protease C1 inhibitor in both the early stages of breast cancer patients compared to the controls. Our data suggests that the ratio of serum proteoglycan 4 to protease C1 inhibitor may be used for screening of early breast cancer although this requires further validation in clinically representative populations."

As cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of TKIs are much lower than serum concentrations, we hypothesized that this drug-drug interaction might affect the prognosis of patients with de novo brain metastases.This retrospective study evaluated 269 patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had been diagnosed between December 2010 and December 2013, and had been treated using first-line first-generation EGFR-TKIs. Among these patients, we identified patients who concurrently used H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as antacids. Patients who exhibited >30% overlap between the use of TKIs and antacids were considered antacid users.Fifty-seven patients (57/269, 21.2%) were antacid users, and antacid use did not significantly affect progression-free survival (PFS; no antacids: 11.2 months, H2RAs: 9.4 months, PPIs: 6.7 months; p = 0.234). However, antacid use significantly reduced overall survival (OS; no antacids: 25.0 months, H2RAs: 15.5 months, PPIs: 11.3 months; p = 0.002). Antacid use did not affect PFS for various metastasis sites, although antacid users with de novo brain metastases exhibited significantly shorter OS, compared to non-users (11.8 vs. 16.3 months, respectively; p = 0.041). Antacid use did not significantly affect OS in patients with bone, liver, or pleural metastases.Antacid use reduced OS among patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were treated using first-line first-generation EGFR-TKIs, and especially among patients with de novo brain metastases."

Infection with BTV can cause severe clinical signs and can be fatal, particularly in naïve sheep and some deer species. Although 24 distinct BTV serotypes were recognized for several decades, additional ‘types’ have recently been identified, including BTV-25 (from Switzerland), BTV-26 (from Kuwait) and BTV-27 from France (Corsica). Although BTV-25 has failed to grow in either insect or mammalian cell cultures, BTV-26 (isolate KUW2010/02), which can be transmitted horizontally between goats in the absence of vector insects, does not replicate in a Culicoides sonorensis cell line (KC cells) but can be propagated in mammalian cells (BSR cells). The BTV genome consists of ten segments of linear dsRNA. Mono-reassortant viruses were generated by reverse-genetics, each one containing a single BTV-26 genome segment in a BTV-1 genetic-background. However, attempts to recover a mono-reassortant containing genome-segment 2 (Seg-2) of BTV-26 (encoding VP2), were unsuccessful but a triple-reassortant was successfully generated containing Seg-2, Seg-6 and Seg-7 (encoding VP5 and VP7 respectively) of BTV-26. Reassortants were recovered and most replicated well in mammalian cells (BSR cells). However, mono-reassortants containing Seg-1 or Seg-3 of BTV-26 (encoding VP1, or VP3 respectively) and the triple reassortant failed to replicate, while a mono-reassortant containing Seg-7 of BTV-26 only replicated slowly in KC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2281355026,"Arid climates have unpredictable precipitation patterns, and wildlife managers often provide supplemental water to help desert ungulates endure the hottest, driest periods. When surface water is unavailable, the only source of water for ungulates comes from the forage they consume, and they must make resourceful foraging decisions to meet their requirements. We compared two desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) populations in Arizona, USA: a treatment population with supplemental water removed during treatment, and a control population. We examined whether sheep altered their seasonal diets without supplemental water. We calculated water and nutrient intake and metabolic water production from dry matter intake and forage moisture and nitrogen content, to determine whether sheep could meet their seasonal daily water and nutrient requirements solely from forage. Diets of sheep were higher in protein (all seasons) and moisture (autumn and winter) during treatment compared to pretreatment. During treatment, sheep diet composition was similar between the treatment and control populations, which suggests, under the climatic conditions of this study, water removal did not influence sheep diets. We estimated that under drought conditions, without any surface water available (although small ephemeral potholes would contain water after rains), female and male sheep would be unable to meet their daily water requirements in all seasons, except winter, when reproductive females had a nitrogen deficit. We determined that sheep could achieve water and nutrient balances in all seasons by shifting their total diet proportions by 8–55% from lower to higher moisture and nitrogen forage species. We elucidate how seasonal forage quality and foraging decisions by desert ungulates allow them to cope with their xeric and uncertain environment, and suggest that, with the forage conditions observed in our study area during this study period, providing supplemental water during water-stressed periods may not be necessary for desert bighorn sheep."

This property has been usually referred to as hyperbolic discounting, although there are other discount functions which also exhibit decreasing discount rates. This paper focuses on the measurement of the impatience associated with a discount function with the aim of establishing a methodology to compare this characteristic for two different discount functions. In this way, first we define the patience associated with a discount function in an interval as its corresponding discount factor and consequently we deduce that the impatience at a given moment is the corresponding instantaneous discount rate. Second we compare the degree of impatience of discount functions belonging to the same or different families, by considering the cases in which the functions do or do not intersect."
https://openalex.org/W2281964511,"Female breast cancer patients have an increased risk of developing subsequent malignant diseases, but this issue is rarely discussed in regards to male breast cancer patients. Thus, we conducted a national survey that included 100,915 female and 578 male breast cancer patients to investigate the risk of second primary malignancy (SPM). During a follow-up period that included 529,782 person-years, 3,153 cases of SPM developed. Compared with the general population, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of SPM in breast cancer patients was 1.51 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46–1.56]. The observed risk was significantly higher in male patients (SIR 2.17, 95% CI 1.70–2.73) and in patients whose age at breast cancer diagnosis was 40 years or younger (SIR 3.39, 95% CI 2.80–4.07), comparing to age-matched general population. Compared with the overall female population, the SIRs of female breast cancer patients with uterine (SIR: 2.66, 95% CI: 2.37–2.98), thyroid (SIR: 2.30, 95% CI: 2.02–2.62), and bone and soft tissue (SIR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.56–2.91) cancers were significantly increased. Male breast cancer patients also displayed significantly higher SIRs for thyroid (SIR: 13.2, 95% CI: 1.60–47.69), skin (SIR: 8.24, 95% CI: 3.02–17.94) and head and neck (SIR: 4.41, 95% CI: 2.35–7.54) cancers. Among breast cancer patients, risk factors significantly associated with SPM included male gender, older age, chemotherapy treatment and comorbidity with liver cirrhosis. From our analysis, we concluded that the risk of SPM was significantly higher for both male and female breast cancer patients compared with the general population, suggesting that more intensive surveillance may be needed, especially in high-risk patients."

Its long C-terminal proline-rich domain contains 13 PXXP motifs, which orchestrate its interactions with multiple proteins. The SH3 domains of syndapin and endophilin bind the PXXP motifs called Site 2 and 3 (Pro-786–Pro-793) at the N-terminal end of the proline-rich domain, whereas the amphiphysin SH3 binds Site 9 (Pro-833–Pro-836) toward the C-terminal end. In some proteins, SH3/peptide interactions also involve short distance elements, which are 5–15 amino acid extensions flanking the central PXXP motif for high affinity binding. Here we found two previously unrecognized elements in the central and the C-terminal end of the dynamin proline-rich domain that account for a significant increase in syndapin binding affinity compared with a previously reported Site 2 and Site 3 PXXP peptide alone.

SH3 domains predominantly bind proline-rich sequences containing a short and conserved PXXP motif (where X represents any amino acid), as well as a flanking basic residue(s) such as arginine or lysine within 2–4 amino acids on either side of the PXXP motif. We term this 6–8-residue sequence the core PXXP motif. PXXP motifs most often adopt a left-handed type II polyproline (PPII) helix conformation and bind to a canonical hydrophobic pocket located between two short loops of the target SH3 domain, the so-called RT and the n-Src loops (5Feng S.

The partner can interact with the SH3 protein in either of the two opposite orientations, depending on the location of the flanking basic amino acids. In the Class I binding mode, basic amino acids located N-terminal to the PXXP motif also contact the SH3, whereas in the Class II binding mode, basic amino acids located C-terminal to the PXXP motif contact the same part of the SH3 (7Cicchetti P.

These orientation-determining flanking basic residues form salt bridges and are an important specificity determinant for SH3/PXXP interactions. Flanking residues also determine the binding specificity and sometimes substantially increase the binding affinity of both Class I and Class II proline-rich peptides to the SH3 domain. Ligands comprising a short core PXXP motif alone typically have affinities in the range 5–20 μm, with little binding selectivity among SH3 families. However, nearby residues known as short distance elements (SDEs) can additionally bind to less conserved portions of the SH3 surface and contribute to higher (submicromolar) affinity interactions (8Musacchio A. How SH3 domains recognize proline.Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 211-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that some peptides, whole proteins, or protein domains have an even higher affinity (low nanomolar) for SH3 domains. For example, the full-length dynamin I PRD (PRD-Ia, Pro-746–Leu-864) binds amphiphysin and endophilin with a 10 nm dissociation constant (9Solomaha E. Szeto F.L. Yousef M.A. Palfrey H.C.

Each is potentially able to bind to a single SH3 domain-containing protein. Syndapin, endophilin, and amphiphysin I are three of the many binding partners documented to play a direct role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, and these proteins also contain Bin/amphiphysin/RVS (BAR) domains that link dynamin to regions of membrane curvature at the neck of budding vesicles (10Anggono V.

In some of these proteins, the additional residues in the SDE make contacts in an acidic groove on a face of the SH3 domain that is not normally involved in PXXP-type interactions. This acidic pocket has been suggested to be termed the “specificity zone” of the SH3 domain, and SH3s that bear such pockets are typically characterized by unusually high affinity substrate interactions (6Ghose R. Shekhtman A. Goger M.J. Ji H. Cowburn D. A novel, specific interaction involving the Csk SH3 domain and its natural ligand.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Binding specificity and/or affinity can also be enhanced by additional contacts made between the SDE and the variable loops of the SH3 domain. The SDE alone is generally insufficient to bind to the SH3 binding partner without the associated PXXP motif; however, mutations in the SDE can reduce or abolish binding of the SH3 binding partner, suggesting an important functional role for these elements. For example, the interaction of p46phox with the SH3 domain of p67phox involves a 20-amino acid helix-turn-helix SDE in p46phox that extends C-terminal to the core PXXP; this SDE contacts multiple residues on the SH3 domain outside of the PXXP binding groove and greatly increases the affinity of the interaction from 20 μm to 24 nm (13Kami K. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Diverse recognition of non-PXXP peptide ligands by the SH3 domains from p67phox, Grb2, and Pex13p.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4268-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In other situations SDEs have been observed to provide specificity. For example, the 183PANLG187 sequence located 11 amino acids away from the PXXP motif in the herpesvirus tyrosine kinase interacting protein confers specificity of binding to the SH3 domain of the Src family kinase Lyn (17Bauer F. Schweimer K. Meiselbach H. Hoffmann S. Rösch P. Sticht H. Structural characterization of Lyn-SH3 domain in complex with a herpesviral protein reveals an extended recognition motif that enhances binding affinity.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2487-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These residues form an additional helical turn adjacent to the PXXP motif, resulting in a 10-fold higher affinity for the Lyn SH3 domain than for other closely related members of the Src family. In the present study we initially aimed to test the hypothesis that the N-terminal part of the dynamin phosphobox is a SDE that acts as a phosphorylation sensor that is able to inhibit syndapin recruitment. However, our data suggest that no direct contact exists between the phosphobox and the syndapin-SH3. Instead, two non-PXXP elements necessary for their interaction were found on the C-terminal side of the Site 2 PXXP motif of dynamin. To our knowledge this is the first report of two separate and extended long range sequence elements acting to provide higher affinity and specificity to an SH3 domain interacting with its target. The rat dynamin PRD-Ia (amino acids Asn-746–Leu-864) was amplified by PCR from a green fluorescent protein-tagged dynamin construct and subcloned into pGEX6P-1 (GE Healthcare) as described previously (12Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Syndapin I is the phosphorylation-regulated dynamin I partner in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Point mutants of dynamin I-PRD (G797A, P798A, P800A, P798A, P800A, G801A, P802A, P803A, R838A, P840A, P844A, R846A, and P852A) and mouse syndapin-SH3 (Y393A, D394A, G395A, Q396A, E397A, Q398A, E400A, E414A, E415A, D416A, E417A, G419A, W420A, C421A, R422A, L432A, Y433A, N436A, Y437A, and V438A) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mouse GST-syndapin SH3 domain expression construct was from Markus Plomann (University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany). The human GST-amphiphysin I SH3 domain expression construct was from Pietro de Camilli (Yale, New Haven, CT). Full-length mouse syndapin and syndapin-SH3 were subcloned into pTrchisA and pET28a His6-tag expression vectors, and their sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (JM109) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). His6 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli (JM109) and purified using Ni-NTA Super Flowbeads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. GST tags were removed by PreScission-mediated proteolysis according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the cleaved proteins were purified by size-exclusion chromatography (20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4). For synaptosome pulldown experiments, a total rat brain extract was prepared by homogenizing brain tissue in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and EDTA-free Complete-Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 23,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. For pulldown experiments, glutathione-Sepharose beads bound with GST-dynamin-PRD or GST-syndapin-SH3 recombinant proteins were incubated with an equal volume of tissue lysate at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads with bound proteins were washed extensively with ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EGTA, eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5–15% gradient gels, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For dynamin C2 pulldown experiments, GST-tagged C2 was expressed in E. coli (JM109). The GST affinity tag was proteolytically removed with PreScission according to the manufacturer’s instructions. C2 was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex S75 column (GE Healthcare). Beads bound with GST-syndapin-SH3 were then incubated with the same amount of C2 peptide at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads with bound proteins were washed extensively with ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EGTA, eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5–15% gradient gels, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. An anti-syndapin antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-amphiphysin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Pietro De Camilli (Yale, New Haven, CT). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% or 12% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as previously described (18Luo L. King N.P. Yeo J.C. Jones A. Stow J.L.

Western blots were analyzed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Calculation of protein extinction coefficients from amino acid sequence data.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). The theoretical molar extinction coefficient was calculated based on amino acid composition (20van Dalen J.P.

Protein concentrations were confirmed using SDS-PAGE based on a comparison to Mark 12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as a standard. Size-exclusion chromatography combined with multiangle laser light scattering was carried out using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.2. The column was run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 on an AKTAbasic liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) coupled to a miniDawn MALLS detector and an Optilab refractive index detector (Wyatt Technology). The MALLS technique provides a molecular mass estimate that is independent of shape (21Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. Determination of molecular masses of proteins in solution: implementation of an HPLC size exclusion chromatography and laser light scattering service in a core laboratory.J. Biomol Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular masses of bovine serum albumin (BSA, used as a control) and dynamin-PRD/syndapin-SH3 were calculated using a differential refractive index (dn/dc) value of 0.185. Production of 15N-labeled or 13C,15N-labeled dynamin PRD Ia and Ib and syndapin-SH3 was achieved by expression in shaker flasks with 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively (22Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. A method for efficient isotopic labeling of recombinant proteins.J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The isotopically labeled proteins were purified in the same manner as the non-labeled proteins. For all NMR experiments, recombinant GST fusion proteins (of C2, PRD-Ia, PRD-Ib, and syndapin-SH3) were proteolytically cleaved to remove the GST tag and were purified by gel filtration. All NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker Advance III 600 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryogenically cooled probe and z axis pulsed-field gradients. 15N HSQC and triple-resonance experiments were recorded using standard pulse sequences from the Bruker library. All spectra were processed with the TopSpin software (Bruker) and analyzed using SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs, Δδ) in 15N HSQC experiments were calculated as, Affinities for the syndapin·PRD and syndapin·C2 interactions were calculated from titrations of the unlabeled syndapin-SH3 domain into 15N-labeled C2 or PRD. In the former case the changes in amide proton chemical shift of Arg-784, Ala-785, and Val-788 were separately plotted as a function of the concentration of syndapin-SH3, and the data were fitted to simple 1:1 Langmuir binding isotherms. The dissociation constant was taken as the average of the three derived values, and the error was estimated as 20%. In the latter case, however, the exchange between free and bound 15N-labeled PRD is slower (the so-called intermediate exchange regime), and the peak positions are, therefore, not a simple population-weighted average of the chemical shifts of the free and bound forms. In this situation, the line shape at a given point in the titration is given by the imaginary component of the complex quantity G(ν) (23Feeney J. Batchelor J.G. Albrand J.P. Roberts G.C.K. The effects of intermediate exchange processes on the estimation of equilibrium constants by NMR.J. Magn. Reson. (1969). 1979; 33: 519-529Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which is given by, where τ = PF/koff, koff is the off rate for dissociation of the complex, and C is a scaling factor. PF and PB are the proportions of free and bound dynamin-PRD, which is a function of the dissociation constant KD and the concentrations of each protein. The quantities αF and αF are given by, and where T2F and T2B are the transverse relaxation times for the free and bound forms of the resonances in question. We, therefore, chose an intermediate point in the titration (0.4 or 0.8 mol eq of added syndapin-SH3) and extracted one-dimensional cross-sections of the two signals that underwent the largest chemical shift change (the amide nitrogen of Gly-801 and an unassigned Gln/Asn side-chain amide proton). The equations above were coded into Mathematica (Wolfram Research), and simulated line shapes were generated and compared with the experimental data by calculating the sum of the squares of the differences between the simulated and actual data (χ2). The values of KD, koff, C, T2F and T2B were varied in a grid search to find the best fit of the data to the model. The fits obtained were of good quality.

Initial docking attempts using full-length dynamin I PRD including the novel LDE element (Arg-838–Gly-842) (Fig. 6) were unsuccessful, and we, therefore, limited our calculations to the shorter construct incorporating Sites 2 and 3 and the SDE (Fig. 1A). Residues 363–367 of the polyproline-region of p47phox (corresponding to dynamin residues 786–790 of Sites 2 and 3) in the crystal structure with the SH3 domain of the p40phox protein (28Massenet C.

During docking, all dynamin residues were defined as semi-flexible (side chains allowed to move freely), whereas full flexibility was restricted to the C-terminal part of dynamin (residues Ala-791–Pro-802) to maintain the overall conformation of Sites 2 and 3. For the SH3 domain, residues 390–404, 415–422, and 431–439 were defined as semi-flexible based on the chemical shift perturbations and mutational data (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 6). A total of 32 ambiguous interaction restraints were introduced between all atoms of dynamin (13 residues) and all atoms of 19 residues of syndapin (391, 393, 395, 397, 398, 400, 401, 402, 403, 416, 419, 420, 421, 432, 433, 435, 436, 437, 438) based on the NMR and mutational analysis. 1000 structures were calculated in the semi-flexible simulated annealing step, and the best 10 structures based on the HADDOCK score were subject to another annealing procedure (1000 structures) using the same restraints. Finally, the solutions were clustered using a cutoff of 0.5 Å root mean square deviation based on the pair-wise backbone root mean square deviation matrix. The best 20 structures (root mean square deviation of 0.7 Å) of this cluster were analyzed using standard HADDOCK protocols and were used to represent a model of the complex.

https://openalex.org/W2285549980,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory distress, which result in high mortality and morbidity. Although several transgenic mouse models of lung hypoplasia exist, the role of miRNAs in this phenotype is incompletely characterized. In this study, we assessed microRNA expression levels during the pseudoglandular to canalicular phase transition of normal human fetal lung development. At this critical time, when the distal respiratory portion of the airways begins to form, microarray analysis showed that the most significantly differentially expressed miRNA was miR-449a. Prediction algorithms determined that N-myc is a target of miR-449a and identified the likely miR-449a:N-myc binding sites, confirmed by luciferase assays and targeted mutagenesis. Functional ex vivo knock-down in organ cultures of murine embryonic lungs, as well as in ovo overexpression in avian embryonic lungs, suggested a role for miR-449a in distal epithelial proliferation. Finally, miR-449a expression was found to be abnormal in rare pulmonary specimens of human fetuses with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia in the pseudoglandular or canalicular phase. This study confirms the conserved role of miR-449a for proper pulmonary organogenesis, supporting the delicate balance between expansion of progenitor cells and their terminal differentiation, and proposes the potential involvement of this miRNA in human pulmonary hypoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2275932067,"Q-factor constraints are usually imposed on conductor loops employed as proximity range High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification (HF-RFID) reader antennas to ensure adequate data bandwidth. However, pairing such low Q-factor loops in inductive energy transmission links restricts the link transmission performance. The contribution of this paper is to assess the improvement that is reached with a two-stage design method, concerning the transmission performance of a planar square loop relative to an initial design, without compromise to a Q-factor constraint. The first stage of the synthesis flow is analytical in approach, and determines the number and spacing of turns by which coupling between similar paired square loops can be enhanced with low deviation from the Q-factor limit presented by an initial design. The second stage applies full-wave electromagnetic simulations to determine more appropriate turn spacing and widths to match the Q-factor constraint, and achieve improved coupling relative to the initial design. Evaluating the design method in a test scenario yielded a more than 5% increase in link transmission efficiency, as well as an improvement in the link fractional bandwidth by more than 3%, without violating the loop Q-factor limit. These transmission performance enhancements are indicative of a potential for modifying proximity HF-RFID reader antennas for efficient inductive energy transfer and data telemetry links."
https://openalex.org/W2277120767,"Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but observed effects vary and may depend on the group examined. Time since fragmentation may explain some differences between taxonomical groups, as some species and thus species composition respond with a delay to changes in their environment. Impacts of drivers of global change may thus be underestimated in short-term studies. In our study we experimentally fragmented nutrient-poor dry calcareous grasslands and studied the response of species richness, individual density and species composition of various groups of invertebrates (gastropods, ants, ground beetles, rove beetles, orthoptera, spiders, woodlice) in 12 small (1.5 m * 1.5 m) and 12 large (4.5 m * 4.5 m) fragments and their corresponding control plots after 7 years. We further examined responses to fragmentation in relation to body size and habitat preferences. Responses to fragmentation varied between taxonomical groups. While spider species richness and individual density were lower in fragments, the opposite was true for an orthopteran species and woodlice. Species composition and β-diversity differed between fragments and control plots for some groups. However, the interaction treatment*plot size was rarely significant. Species with high occupancy rates in undisturbed control plots responded more negatively to the fragmentation, while species with large body size were relatively more abundant in fragments in some groups. No effect of the fragmentation was found for ants, which may have the longest lag times because of long-lived colonies. However, relationships between abundance and the species' preferences for environmental factors affected by edge effects indicate that ant diversity too may be affected in the longer-term. Our results show the importance of considering different groups in conservation management in times of widespread fragmentation of landscapes. While species richness may respond slowly, changes in abundance related to habitat preferences or morphology may allow insights into likely long-term changes."
https://openalex.org/W2277177390,"Clinical and research evidence has shown that electroacupuncture (EA) promotes recovery of motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the ""efficacy span"" of EA treatment, especially the long-term effect of EA that is thought to last after the cessation of EA treatment, has not been investigated. The present study thus investigated and compared the effect of EA during and after chronic EA application on motor activity and dopamine lesions in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned mouse model of PD. Chronic EA treatment (30 min a day, 6 days a week for 2 or 4 weeks) significantly attenuated motor deficiency and reduced dopamine neuron degeneration. Remarkably, EA showed a long-lasting effect after the cessation of EA stimulation. At 2 and 4 weeks after the termination of EA, EA continued to improve motor function in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Consistent with sustained behavioral effects, EA induced an enduring increase in the dopamine turnover ratio in the striatum 2 weeks after the cessation of EA treatment. Here we demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of EA outlasted the duration of EA application. During a relatively long period of time after the completion of EA treatment, EA is able to continue to improve motor function and enhance dopamine availability in 6-OHDA-lesioned PD mice."
https://openalex.org/W2399610259,"Objective Nonylphenol (NP) belongs to the family of endocrine disruptors, and it is widely used in industrial applications and is ubiquitous in daily foods. Animal studies have suggested that NP exposure might promote motor hyperactivity, likely by causing deficits in dopaminergic neurons. However, research assessing NP exposure and epidemiology studies on human populations are limited. The aim of this study was to explore the association between child NP exposure and ADHD while considering particular covariants, such as lead levels and dopamine-related gene variations. Methods A case-control study was conducted on patients with clinically diagnosed ADHD; the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham, Fourth Revision (SNAP-IV) questionnaire was used to identify normal controls aged 4–15 years. Participants were examined for urinary NP concentrations, blood lead levels, and select single-nucleotide polymorphisms of two dopamine-related genes (D4 dopamine receptor, DRD4, and dopamine transporter, DAT1). Socio-demographic variables, maternal lifestyle factors during pregnancy and family medical history were obtained using a questionnaire. Results A total of 97 children with doctor-diagnosed ADHD and 110 normal controls were enrolled. The blood lead levels in both groups were similar (1.57±0.73 vs. 1.73±0.77 μg/dL, p = 0.15). No significant difference in urinary NP concentration was found between the children with ADHD and the control subjects (4.52±3.22 μg/g cr. vs. 4.64±2.95 μg/g cr., p = 0.43). ADHD was significantly more prevalent among males in this study (male to female ratio: 5:1 for the ADHD group and 1.3:1 for the control group, p<0.01). The analysis was repeated after excluding the females, but this had no effect on the association between NP and ADHD. The regression model, including or excluding females, indicated no increased odds of having ADHD in the context of NP exposure after adjusting for covariants. Conclusion This study indicated that NP exposure might not promote ADHD in children, even though children in Taiwan had relatively high levels of NP compared to those reported previously and those in developed nations."
https://openalex.org/W2274799157,"Visceral fat accretion is a hallmark of aging and is associated with aging-induced metabolic dysfunction. PPARγ agonist was reported to improve insulin sensitivity by redistributing fat from visceral fat to subcutaneous fat. The purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which aging affects adipose tissue remodeling in a type 2 diabetic animal model and through which PPARγ activation modulates aging-related fat tissue distribution. At the ages of 21, 31 and 43 weeks, OLETF rats as an animal model of type 2 diabetes were evaluated for aging-related effects on adipose tissue metabolism in subcutaneous and visceral fat depots. During aging, the ratio of visceral fat weight to subcutaneous fat weight (V/S ratio) increased. Aging significantly increased the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipogenesis such as lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid binding protein aP2, lipin 1, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, which were more prominent in visceral fat than subcutaneous fat. The mRNA expression of adipose triglyceride lipase, which is involved in basal lipolysis and fatty acid recycling, was also increased, more in visceral fat compared to subcutaneous fat during aging. The mRNA levels of the genes associated with lipid oxidation were increased, whereas the mRNA levels of genes associated with energy expenditure showed no significant change during aging. PPARγ agonist treatment in OLETF rats resulted in fat redistribution with a decreasing V/S ratio and improved glucose intolerance. The genes involved in lipogenesis decreased in visceral fat of the PPARγ agonist-treated rats. During aging, fat distribution was changed by stimulating lipid uptake and esterification in visceral fat rather than subcutaneous fat, and by altering the lipid oxidation."

Methods Participants were 4,333 male employees (mean age, 49.3 years) who underwent abdominal computed tomography scanning, measured fasting insulin, and did not self-report diabetes and mental disorders under treatment and history of cancer, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of EDS with abdominal fat deposition and markers of insulin resistance. Results Visceral fat area (VFA) and fasting insulin were significantly, positively associated with EDS. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of high VFA for the lowest through highest quartile of depression score were 1 (reference), 1.18 (0.97–1.42), 1.25 (1.02–1.54), 1.23 (1.01–1.51), respectively, and corresponding figures for high fasting insulin were 1 (reference), 0.98 (0.80–1.19), 1.12 (0.91–1.38), and 1.29 (1.06–1.57), respectively. Subcutaneous fat area was not associated with EDS.

https://openalex.org/W2278917337,"Rainy weather conditions could result in significantly negative impacts on driving on freeways. However, due to lack of enough historical data and monitoring facilities, many regions are not able to establish reliable risk assessment models to identify such impacts. Given the situation, this paper provides an alternative solution where the procedure of risk assessment is developed based on drivers' subjective questionnaire and its performance is validated by using actual crash data. First, an ordered logit model was developed, based on questionnaire data collected from Freeway G15 in China, to estimate the relationship between drivers' perceived risk and factors, including vehicle type, rain intensity, traffic volume, and location. Then, weighted driving risk for different conditions was obtained by the model, and further divided into four levels of early warning (specified by colors) using a rank order cluster analysis. After that, a risk matrix was established to determine which warning color should be disseminated to drivers, given a specific condition. Finally, to validate the proposed procedure, actual crash data from Freeway G15 were compared with the safety prediction based on the risk matrix. The results show that the risk matrix obtained in the study is able to predict driving risk consistent with actual safety implications, under rainy weather conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2417596379,"Higher cardiovascular morbidity in patients with a wide range of autoimmune diseases highlights the importance of autoimmunity in promoting atherosclerosis. Our purpose was to investigate the mechanisms of accelerated atherosclerosis and identified vascular autoantigens targeted by autoimmunity. We created a mouse model of autoimmunity-associated atherosclerosis by transplanting bone marrow from FcγRIIB knockout (FcRIIB–/–) mice into LDL receptor knockout mice. We characterized the cellular and molecular mechanisms of atherogenesis and identified specific aortic autoantigens using serologic proteomic studies. En face lesion area analysis showed more aggressive atherosclerosis in autoimmune mice compared with control mice (0.64 ± 0.12 vs. 0.32 ± 0.05 mm2; P < 0.05, respectively). At the cellular level, FcRIIB–/– macrophages showed significant reduction (46–72%) in phagocytic capabilities. Proteomic analysis revealed circulating autoantibodies in autoimmune mice that targeted 25 atherosclerotic lesion proteins, including essential components of adhesion complex, cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix, and proteins involved in critical functions and pathways. Microscopic examination of atherosclerotic plaques revealed essential colocalization of autoantibodies with endothelial cells, their adherence to basement membranes, the internal elastica lamina, and necrotic cores. The new vascular autoimmunosome may be a useful target for diagnostic and immunotherapeutic interventions in autoimmunity-associated diseases that have accelerated atherosclerosis.—Merched, A.

https://openalex.org/W2279803043,"Objective High concentrations of leukocytes in blood have been associated with diabetes mellitus. This prospective study aimed to explore whether total and differential leukocyte counts are associated with incidence of diabetes. A missense variant R262W in the SH2B3 (SH2B adaptor protein 3) gene, coding for a protein that negatively regulates hematopoietic cell proliferation, was also studied in relation to incidence of diabetes. Methods and Results Leukocyte count and its subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes and mixed cells) were analyzed in 26,667 men and women, 45–73 years old, from the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer study. Information about the R262W polymorphism (rs3184504) in SH2B3 was genotyped in 24,489 subjects. Incidence of diabetes was studied during a mean follow-up of 14 years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine incidence of diabetes by total and differential leukocyte counts. Mendelian randomization analysis using R262W as an instrumental variable was performed with two-stage least squares regression. A total of 2,946 subjects developed diabetes during the follow-up period. After taking several possible confounders into account, concentrations of total leukocyte count, neutrophils and lymphocytes were all significantly associated with incidence of diabetes. The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval; quartile 4 vs quartile 1) were 1.37 (1.22–1.53) for total leukocytes, 1.33 (1.19–1.49) for neutrophils and 1.29 (1.15–1.44) for lymphocytes. The R262W polymorphism was strongly associated with leukocytes (0.11x109 cells/l per T allele, p = 1.14 x10-12), lymphocytes (p = 4.3 x10-16), neutrophils (p = 8.0 x10-6) and mixed cells (p = 3.0 x10-6). However, there was no significant association between R262W and fasting glucose, HbA1c or incidence of diabetes. Conclusions Concentrations of total leukocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes are associated with incidence of diabetes. However, the lack of association with the R262W polymorphism suggests that the associations may not be causal, although limitations in statistical power and balancing pleiotropic effects cannot be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2280027444,"Bradysia odoriphaga (Diptera: Sciaridae) is the most important pest of Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum) in Asia; however, the molecular genetics are poorly understood. To explore the molecular biological mechanism of development, Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly were performed in the third-instar, fourth-instar, and pupal B. odoriphaga. The study resulted in 16.2 Gb of clean data and 47,578 unigenes (≥125 bp) contained in 7,632,430 contigs, 46.21% of which were annotated from non-redundant protein (NR), Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. It was found that 19.67% of unigenes matched the homologous species mainly, including Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, Ceratitis capitata, and Anopheles gambiae. According to differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, 143, 490, and 309 DEGs were annotated as involved in the developmental process in the GO database respectively, in the comparisons of third-instar and fourth-instar larvae, third-instar larvae and pupae, and fourth-instar larvae and pupae. Twenty-five genes were closely related to these processes, including developmental process, reproduction process, and reproductive organs development and programmed cell death (PCD). The information of unigenes assembled in B. odoriphaga through transcriptome and DEG analyses could provide a detailed genetic basis and regulated information for elaborating the developmental mechanism from the larval, pre-pupal to pupal stages of B. odoriphaga."
https://openalex.org/W2282318187,"Previously, genetic polymorphisms of C12orf51 (HECTD4) (rs2074356 and/or rs11066280) have been shown to be related to alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to prospectively examine whether C12orf51 had an interaction with or independent effect on alcohol consumption and the risk of T2D. The present study included 3,244 men and 3,629 women aged 40 to 69 years who participated in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES)_Ansan and Ansung Study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for T2D. rs2074356 and rs11066280 were associated with the risk of T2D after adjusting for alcohol consumption (rs2074356 for AA: HR = 0.39 and 95% CI = 0.17-0.87 in men, and HR = 0.36 and 95% CI = 0.13-0.96 in women; rs11066280 for AA: HR = 0.44 and 95% CI = 0.23-0.86 in men, and HR = 0.39 and 95% CI = 0.16-0.94 in women). We identified that the association of each variant (rs2074356 and rs11065756) in C12orf51 was nearly unchanged after adjusted for alcohol consumption. Therefore, the association of 2 SNPs in C12orf51 with diabetes may not be mediated by alcohol use. There was no interaction effect between alcohol consumption and the SNPs with T2D. However, even in never-drinkers, minor allele homozygote strongly influenced T2D risk reduction (rs2074356 for AA: HR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14-0.90, and p-trend = 0.0035 in men and HR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.13-0.93, and p-trend = 0.2348 in women; rs11066280 for AA: HR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.16-0.82, and p-trend = 0.0014 in men and HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.16-0.95, and p-trend = 0.3790 in women), while alcohol consumption did not influence the risk of T2D within each genotype. rs2074356 and rs11066280 in or near C12orf51, which is related to alcohol drinking behavior, may longitudinally decrease the risk of T2D, but not through regulation of alcohol consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2283347566,"This study compared the performance of 12 brands of cartomizer style electronic cigarettes (EC) using different puffing protocols and measured the concentrations of nicotine in each product.Air flow rate, pressure drop, and aerosol absorbance were measured using two different protocols, first 10 puffs and a modified smoke-out protocol.First 10 puff protocol: The air flow rate required to produce aerosol ranged between brands from 4-21 mL/s. Pressure drop was relatively stable within a brand but ranged between brands from 14-71 mmH2O and was much lower than the earlier classic 3-piece models. Absorbance, a measure of aerosol density, was relatively consistent between puffs, but varied between brands. With the modified smoke-out protocol, most brands were puffed until 300 puffs. The pressure drop was relatively stable for all brands except three. Absorbance of the aerosol decreased as the number of puffs increased. Although there was some uniformity in performance within some brands, there was large variation between brands. The labeled and measured nicotine concentrations were within 10% of each other in only 1 out of 10 brands.Over 10 puffs, the cartomizers all perform similarly within a brand but varied between brands. In smoke-out trials, most brands lasted at least 300 puffs, and performed similarly within brands with respect to pressure drop and absorbance. For five brands, products purchased at different times performed differently. These data show some improvement in performance during evolution of these products, but nevertheless indicate problems with quality control in manufacture."
https://openalex.org/W2274882195,"Retrograde transport is a critical mechanism for recycling certain membrane cargo. Following endocytosis from the plasma membrane, retrograde cargo is moved from early endosomes to Golgi followed by transport (recycling) back to the plasma membrane. The complete molecular and cellular mechanisms of retrograde transport remain unclear. The small GTPase RAB-6.2 mediates the retrograde recycling of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) subunit GLR-1 in C. elegans neurons. Here we show that RAB-6.2 and a close paralog, RAB-6.1, together regulate retrograde transport in both neurons and non-neuronal tissue. Mutants for rab-6.1 or rab-6.2 fail to recycle GLR-1 receptors, resulting in GLR-1 turnover and behavioral defects indicative of diminished GLR-1 function. Loss of both rab-6.1 and rab-6.2 results in an additive effect on GLR-1 retrograde recycling, indicating that these two C. elegans Rab6 isoforms have overlapping functions. MIG-14 (Wntless) protein, which undergoes retrograde recycling, undergoes a similar degradation in intestinal epithelia in both rab-6.1 and rab-6.2 mutants, suggesting a broader role for these proteins in retrograde transport. Surprisingly, MIG-14 is localized to separate, spatially segregated endosomal compartments in rab-6.1 mutants compared to rab-6.2 mutants. Our results indicate that RAB-6.1 and RAB-6.2 have partially redundant functions in overall retrograde transport, but also have their own unique cellular- and subcellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2276132888,"To assess the association between unhealthy dietary habits and cognition in older adults from Southern Brazil.This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the second wave of a population- and household-based epidemiological survey (2013-2014) conducted in the city of Florianópolis. A total of 1,197 older adults (778 women) over 60 years old participated in the study. Cognition, the dependent variable, was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The independent variables were the following indicators of unhealthy dietary habits: low intake of fruits and vegetables (≤ 4 servings/day); fish (< 1 serving/week); and habitual fatty meat intake (yes/no). Adjustments were made for age, education level, income, smoking status, alcohol intake, leisure-time physical activity, depression symptoms, chronic diseases, and body mass index. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were performed, considering sampling weights and stratification by gender.The mean MMSE scores for men and women were 25.15 ± 5.56 and 24.26 ± 5.68, respectively (p = 0.009). After adjustments, in women low fruit and vegetable intake (≤ 4 servings/day) was independently associated with the lowest MMSE scores. No associations were found in men. Additionally, women's mean MMSE scores increased as their daily frequency of fruit and vegetable intake increased (p = 0.001).Women with low fruit and vegetable intake according to the World Health Organization (WHO) have lower cognition scores. Regular intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish in exchange of fatty meats may be a viable public policy strategy to preserve cognition in aging."
https://openalex.org/W2282022467,"Consultations occur frequently in the emergency department (ED) of tertiary care centres and pose a threat for patient safety as they contribute to ED lengths of stay (LOS) and overcrowding. The aim of this study was to investigate reasons and appropriateness of consultations, and the relative impact of specialty and patient characteristics on the probability of a consultation, because this could help to improve efficiency of ED patient care.This prospective cohort study included ED patients presenting to a Dutch tertiary care centre in a setting where ED physicians mostly treat self-referred and undifferentiated patients and other specialists treat referred patients. Consultations were defined as appropriate if the reason of consultation corresponded with the final advice, conclusion or policy of the consulted specialty. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relative contribution of specialty and patient characteristics on consultation.In the 344 (24% (95% CI 22 to 26%)) of the 1434 inclusions another specialty was consulted, resulting in a 55% increase of ED LOS. ED physicians more often consulted another specialty with a corrected odds ratio (OR) of 5.6 (4.0 to 7.8), mostly because consultations were mandatory in case of hospitalization or outpatient follow-up. Limited expertise of ED physicians was the reason for consultation in 7% (5 to 9%). The appropriateness of consultations was 84% (81 to 88%), similar between ED physicians and other specialists (P = 0.949). The patient characteristics age, comorbidity, and triage category and complaint predicted consultation.In a Dutch tertiary care centre another specialty was consulted in 24% of the patients, mostly for an appropriate reason, and rarely because of lack of expertise. The impact of consultations on ED LOS could be reduced if mandatory consultations are abolished and predictors of a consultation are used to facilitate timely consultation."
https://openalex.org/W2275773244,"The PE and PPE protein family are unique to mycobacteria. Though the complete genome sequences for over 500 M. tuberculosis strains and mycobacterial species are available, few PE and PPE proteins have been structurally and functionally characterized. We have therefore used bioinformatics tools to characterize the structure and function of these proteins. We selected representative members of the PE and PPE protein family by phylogeny analysis and using structure-based sequence annotation identified ten well-characterized protein domains of known function. Some of these domains were observed to be common to all mycobacterial species and some were species specific."
https://openalex.org/W2280809101,"Pituitary Prolactin (PRL) and Growth Hormone (GH) are separately controlled and sub-serve different purposes. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that extra-pituitary expression in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is coordinated at mRNA and protein levels. However this was not a uniform effect within populations, such that wide inter-individual variation was superimposed on coordinate PRL/GH expression. Up to 44% of individuals in healthy cohorts of mice and rats showed protein levels above the norm and coordinated expression of PRL and GH transcripts above baseline occurred in the amygdala, frontal lobe and hippocampus of 10% of human subjects. High levels of PRL and GH present in post mortem tissue were often presaged by altered responses in fear conditioning and stress induced hyperthermia behavioral tests. Our data define a common phenotype polymorphism in healthy mammalian brains, and, given the pleiotropic effects known for circulating PRL and GH, further consequences of coordinated CNS over-expression may await discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2284926451,"Cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels play a pivotal role in cone phototransduction, which is a process essential for daylight vision, color vision, and visual acuity. Mutations in the cone channel subunits CNGA3 and CNGB3 are associated with human cone diseases, including achromatopsia, cone dystrophies, and early onset macular degeneration. Mutations in CNGB3 alone account for 50% of reported cases of achromatopsia. This work investigated the role of CNGB3 in cone light response and cone channel structural stability. As cones comprise only 2–3% of the total photoreceptor population in the wild-type mouse retina, we used Cngb3−/−/Nrl−/− mice with CNGB3 deficiency on a cone-dominant background in our study. We found that, in the absence of CNGB3, CNGA3 was able to travel to the outer segments, co-localize with cone opsin, and form tetrameric complexes. Electroretinogram analyses revealed reduced cone light response amplitude/sensitivity and slower response recovery in Cngb3−/−/Nrl−/− mice compared with Nrl−/− mice. Absence of CNGB3 expression altered the adaptation capacity of cones and severely compromised function in bright light. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that CNGA3 channels lacking CNGB3 were more resilient to proteolysis than CNGA3/CNGB3 channels, suggesting a hindered structural flexibility. Thus, CNGB3 regulates cone light response kinetics and the channel structural flexibility. This work advances our understanding of the biochemical and functional role of CNGB3 in cone photoreceptors."
