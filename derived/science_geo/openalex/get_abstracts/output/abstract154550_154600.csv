https://openalex.org/W2102584403,"When attention is directed to a location in the visual field, sensitivity to stimuli at that location is increased. At the neuronal level, this could arise either through a multiplicative increase in firing rate or through an increase in the effective strength of the stimulus. To test conflicting predictions of these alternative models, we recorded responses of V4 neurons to stimuli across a range of luminance contrasts and measured the change in response when monkeys attended to them in order to discriminate a target stimulus from nontargets. Attention caused greater increases in response at low contrast than at high contrast, consistent with an increase in effective stimulus strength. On average, attention increased the effective contrast of the attended stimulus by a factor of 1.51, an increase of 51% of its physical contrast."
https://openalex.org/W2108024591,"Caenorhabditis elegans modulates its locomotory rate in response to its food, bacteria, in two ways. First, well-fed wild-type animals move more slowly in the presence of bacteria than in the absence of bacteria. This basal slowing response is mediated by a dopamine-containing neural circuit that senses a mechanical attribute of bacteria and may be an adaptive mechanism that increases the amount of time animals spend in the presence of food. Second, food-deprived wild-type animals, when transferred to bacteria, display a dramatically enhanced slowing response that ensures that the animals do not leave their newly encountered source of food. This experience-dependent response is mediated by serotonergic neurotransmission and is potentiated by fluoxetine (Prozac). The basal and enhanced slowing responses are distinct and separable neuromodulatory components of a genetically tractable paradigm of behavioral plasticity."

The gene for ORCA3, a jasmonate-responsive APETALA2 (AP2)-domain transcription factor from Catharanthus roseus, was isolated by transferred DNA activation tagging. Orca3 overexpression resulted in enhanced expression of several metabolite biosynthetic genes and, consequently, in increased accumulation of terpenoid indole alkaloids. Regulation of metabolite biosynthetic genes by jasmonate-responsive AP2-domain transcription factors may link plant stress responses to changes in metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2131220353,"Adaptation is a widespread phenomenon in nervous systems, providing flexibility to function under varying external conditions. Here, we relate an adaptive property of a sensory system directly to its function as a carrier of information about input signals. We show that the input/output relation of a sensory system in a dynamic environment changes with the statistical properties of the environment. Specifically, when the dynamic range of inputs changes, the input/output relation rescales so as to match the dynamic range of responses to that of the inputs. We give direct evidence that the scaling of the input/output relation is set to maximize information transmission for each distribution of signals. This adaptive behavior should be particularly useful in dealing with the intermittent statistics of natural signals."

https://openalex.org/W1997222931,"p53 plays an essential pro-apoptotic role, a function thought to be shared with its family members p73 and p63. Here, we show that p73 is primarily present in developing neurons as a truncated isoform whose levels are dramatically decreased when sympathetic neurons apoptose after nerve growth factor (NGF) withdrawal. Increased expression of truncated p73 rescues these neurons from apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal or p53 overexpression. In p73–/– mice, all isoforms of p73 are deleted and the apoptosis of developing sympathetic neurons is greatly enhanced. Thus, truncated p73 is an essential anti-apoptotic protein in neurons, serving to counteract the pro-apoptotic function of p53."
https://openalex.org/W1983183777,"Since its classification nearly 80 years ago, the human pathogen Candida albicans has been designated as an asexual yeast. In this report, we describe the construction of C. albicans strains that were subtly altered at the mating-type–like ( MTL ) locus, a cluster of genes that resembles the mating-type loci of other fungi. These derivatives were capable of mating after inoculation into a mammalian host. C. albicans is a diploid organism, but most of the mating products isolated from a mouse host were tetrasomic for the two chromosomes that could be rigorously monitored and, overall, exhibited substantially higher than 2n DNA content. These observations demonstrated that C. albicans can recombine sexually."
https://openalex.org/W2048411015,"Although the diploid fungus Candida albicans, a human pathogen, has been thought to have no sexual cycle, it normally possesses mating-type-like orthologs (MTL) of both of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating-type genes (MAT) a and alpha. When strains containing only MTLa or MTLalpha were constructed by the loss of one homolog of chromosome 5, the site of the MTL loci, MTLa and MTLalpha strains mated, but like mating types did not. Evidence for mating included formation of stable prototrophs from strains with complementing auxotrophic markers; these contained both MTL alleles and molecular markers from both parents and were tetraploid in DNA content and mononucleate."
https://openalex.org/W2057522454,"Electrophysiology and optical indicators have been used in vertebrate systems to investigate excitable cell firing and calcium transients, but both techniques have been difficult to apply in organisms with powerful reverse genetics. To overcome this limitation, we expressed cameleon proteins, genetically encoded calcium indicators, in the pharyngeal muscle of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. In intact transgenic animals expressing cameleons, fluorescence ratio changes accompanied muscular contraction, verifying detection of calcium transients. By comparing the magnitude and duration of calcium influx in wild-type and mutant animals, we were able to determine the effects of calcium channel proteins on pharyngeal calcium transients. We also successfully used cameleons to detect electrically evoked calcium transients in individual C. elegans neurons. This technique therefore should have broad applications in analyzing the regulation of excitable cell activity in genetically tractable organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2076762827,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a small serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role during development of the CNS. Cables, a novel protein, interacts with Cdk5 in brain lysates. Cables also binds to and is a substrate of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase. Active c-Abl kinase leads to Cdk5 tyrosine phosphorylation, and this phosphorylation is enhanced by Cables. Phosphorylation of Cdk5 by c-Abl occurs on tyrosine 15 (Y15), which is stimulatory for p35/Cdk5 kinase activity. Expression of antisense Cables in primary cortical neurons inhibited neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, expression of active Abl resulted in lengthening of neurites. The data provide evidence for a Cables-mediated interplay between the Cdk5 and c-Abl signaling pathways in the developing nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2166367688,"How the human brain processes the perception, discrimination, and recognition of odors has not been systematically explored. Cerebral activations were therefore studied with PET during five different olfactory tasks: monorhinal smelling of odorless air (AS), single odors (OS), discrimination of odor intensity (OD-i), discrimination of odor quality (OD-q), and odor recognition memory (OM). OS activated amygdala-piriform, orbitofrontal, insular, and cingulate cortices and right thalamus. OD-i and OD-q both engaged left insula and right cerebellum. OD-q also involved other areas, including right caudate and subiculum. OM did not activate the insula, but instead, the piriform cortex. With the exception of caudate and subiculum, it shared the remaining activations with the OD-q, and engaged, in addition, the temporal and parietal cortices. These findings indicate that olfactory functions are organized in a parallel and hierarchical manner."
https://openalex.org/W2122037734,"AMPA and NMDA receptors are coexpressed at many central synapses, but the factors that control the ratio of these two receptors are not well understood. We recorded mixed miniature or evoked synaptic currents arising from coactivation of AMPA and NMDA receptors and found that long-lasting changes in activity scaled both currents up and down proportionally through changes in the number of postsynaptic receptors. The ratio of NMDA to AMPA current was similar at different synapses onto the same neuron, and this relationship was preserved following activity-dependent synaptic scaling. These data show that AMPA and NMDA receptors are tightly coregulated by activity at synapses at which they are both expressed and suggest that a mechanism exists to actively maintain a constant receptor ratio across a neuron's synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2082562281,"Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system is mediated by ionotropic GABA or glycine receptors. Auditory outer hair cells present a unique inhibitory synapse that uses a Ca2+-permeable excitatory acetylcholine receptor to activate a hyperpolarizing potassium current mediated by small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. It is shown here that unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents at this synapse are mediated by SK2 channels and occur rapidly, with rise and decay time constants of ∼6 ms and ∼30 ms, respectively. This time course is determined by the Ca2+ gating of SK channels rather than by the changes in intracellular Ca2+. The results demonstrate fast coupling between an excitatory ionotropic neurotransmitter receptor and an inhibitory ion channel and imply rapid, localized changes in subsynaptic calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W2059381606,"At fast CNS synapses, the role of asynchronous release following initial synchronous release is poorly understood. We examined the contribution of asynchronous release to GABAergic transmission in the cochlear nucleus across a 40-fold range of electrical stimulus frequencies. Whereas quantal release was highly synchronized at low frequencies, it was largely continuous and desynchronized at high frequencies. Despite the change in release mode, intense and steady inhibitory transmission was virtually maintained. Experimental analyses and modeling studies indicated that this ""desynchronization"" process was dependent on presynaptic Ca2+ accumulation, facilitation of vesicle release, and short-term depletion of available vesicles. Asynchronous release at high frequencies may help generate a smooth inhibitory ""tone"" by minimizing the consequences of random timing of presynaptic action potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2086054038,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have multiple functions in the developing nervous system. A member of this family, BMP-9, was found to be highly expressed in the embryonic mouse septum and spinal cord, indicating a possible role in regulating the cholinergic phenotype. In cultured neurons, BMP-9 directly induced the expression of the cholinergic gene locus encoding choline acetyltransferase and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter and up-regulated acetylcholine synthesis. The effect was reversed upon withdrawal of BMP-9. Intracerebroventricular injection of BMP-9 increased acetylcholine levels in vivo. Although certain other BMPs also up-regulated the cholinergic phenotype in vitro, they were less effective than BMP-9. These data indicate that BMP-9 is a differentiating factor for cholinergic central nervous system neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2111954050,"The spindle checkpoint was characterized in meiosis of budding yeast. In the absence of the checkpoint, the frequency of meiosis I missegregation increased with increasing chromosome length, reaching 19% for the longest chromosome. Meiosis I nondisjunction in spindle checkpoint mutants could be prevented by delaying the onset of anaphase. In a recombination-defective mutant (spo11Delta), the checkpoint delays the biochemical events of anaphase I, suggesting that chromosomes that are attached to microtubules but are not under tension can activate the spindle checkpoint. Spindle checkpoint mutants reduce the accuracy of chromosome segregation in meiosis I much more than that in meiosis II, suggesting that checkpoint defects may contribute to Down syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1980902873,"Shaker-related or Kv1 voltage-gated K+ channels play critical roles in regulating the excitability of mammalian neurons. Native Kv1 channel complexes are octamers of four integral membrane α subunits and four cytoplasmic β subunits, such that a tremendous diversity of channel complexes can be assembled from the array of α and β subunits expressed in the brain. However, biochemical and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that only certain complexes predominate in the mammalian brain, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms exist that ensure plasma membrane targeting of only physiologically appropriate channel complexes. Here we show that Kv1 channels assembled as homo- or heterotetrameric complexes had distinct surface expression characteristics in both transfected mammalian cells and hippocampal neurons. Homotetrameric Kv1.1 channels were localized to endoplasmic reticulum, Kv1.4 channels to the cell surface, and Kv1.2 channels to both endoplasmic reticulum and the cell surface. Heteromeric assembly with Kv1.4 resulted in dose-dependent increases in cell surface expression of coassembled Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, while coassembly with Kv1.1 had a dominant-negative effect on Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 surface expression. Coassembly with Kvβ subunits promoted cell surface expression of each Kv1 heteromeric complex.

Studies in heterologous expression systems have shown that Shaker or Kv1 α and Kvβ subunits can assemble promiscuously into homo- and heterotetrameric complexes yielding a wide variety of biophysically and pharmacologically distinct channels (3Isacoff E.Y.

However, biochemical and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that specific Kv1 heteromeric complexes predominate in mammalian brain, and many other possible subunit combinations are not detected (7Koch R.O. Wanner S.G. Koschak A. Hanner M. Schwarzer C. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S. Garcia M.L. Knaus H.G. J. Biol.

Thus, despite the fact that all Kv1 α and Kvβ subunit combinations yield functional channels, and while promiscuous assembly and equivalent surface expression of all possible α and β subunit combinations expressed in mammalian neurons would generate a tremendous diversity of Kv1 channel structure and function, in fact only certain α/β subunit combinations are found on the neuronal cell surface. These observations suggest not only a functional importance for particular heteromeric channel complexes, but also that cellular mechanisms exist to restrict surface expression to only those channels with appropriate subunit composition. Since electrical signaling is exquisitely sensitive to subtle changes in Kv channel activity (12Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), it is not unexpected that neurons would have multiple mechanisms to regulate plasma membrane activity of these complicated multisubunit proteins at several posttranslational stages, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 export, intracellular trafficking, and surface expression. The mechanisms that regulate ER export, cell surface expression, and targeting of Kv1 channels in neurons remain to be elucidated. The rate-limiting step for surface expression of most membrane proteins is ER export (13Lodish H.F. Kong N. Snider M. Strous G.J. Nature. 1983; 304: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and export competence can be determined by diverse mechanisms (14Pelham H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Studies on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor biosynthesis have shown that ER export is controlled by ER chaperones that allow export of only properly folded and subsequently assembled α2βγδ receptors (15Green W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unassembled or misassembled KATP channel subunits display cytoplasmic RKR motifs that act as ER retention signals until complete heteromeric assembly occurs (16Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Similarly, T cell antigen receptor membrane-spanning subunits expose strong transmembrane retention/retrieval signals and are rapidly degraded unless appropriate heteromeric assembly with specific subunits occurs (17Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Klausner D. Cell. 1990; 63: 503-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, anterograde signals described for the vasopressin V2 receptor (18Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and KATP channel SUR1 subunits (19Sharma N. Crane A. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have been shown to be essential for ER export. However, unlike Kv1 channels, these well characterized membrane proteins function only as obligate heteromers of fixed subunit composition, and these mechanisms exist to absolutely ensure that nonfunctional or dysfunctional complexes of incorrect subunit composition are retained intracellularly and degraded. In contrast, all combinations of coassembled Kv1 α and Kvβ subunits tested to date have been found to yield functional channels, such that promiscuous assembly of Kv1 channel subunits could generate a tremendous diversity of neuronal channel function (20Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 415-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Pongs O. Semin. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 137-146Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inherent in these models is the assumption that channels formed using different component subunits would exhibit similar surface expression characteristics. Here we show that in fact dramatic difference exist in trafficking, biosynthetic processing, and surface expression of the major Kv1 α subunits (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4) expressed in rat and human brain, consistent with such posttranslational events as being important determinants of Kv1 channel cell surface abundance. In a wide variety of mammalian cells and in hippocampal neurons, coassembly of these Kv1 α subunits yields patterns of expression that suggest the presence of a potent dominant-negative regulator on some Kv1 α subunits and dominant-positive activity on others. Moreover, coexpression with the major brain cytoplasmic Kvβ subunit, Kvβ2, facilitates the surface expression of multiple heteromeric complexes. These data suggest that differential surface expression of Kv1 channels, as determined by α- and β-subunit composition, is a critical determinant of electrical activity in mammalian neurons.

Cells were seeded at 10% confluence (for biochemical analysis) or 1% confluence (for immunofluorescence) and grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. The calcium phosphate DNA mixture was added within 24 h of seeding, when cells were approximately twice the original plating density, and left for 18–24 h. The transfection medium was then removed, and after the addition of fresh medium, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 24 h. Cells expressing various combinations of Kv1 α and Kvβ subunits were stained 48 h posttransfection using a surface immunofluorescence protocol (25Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J.

Cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 and then fixed in the same buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked with Blotto (4% nonfat dry milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with mouse or rabbit ectodomain-directed antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with Blotto, cells were permeabilized with Blotto containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Blotto + T) for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by incubation with cytoplasmically directed antibodies (derived from the species distinct from that used for the ectodomain staining) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in Blotto + T, incubated with Texas Red-goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse antibody diluted in Blotto + T for 1 h, and washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% TX-100. For standard immunofluorescence staining, 0.1% TX-100 was included during fixation. Cells were viewed under indirect immunofluorescence on a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope. Surface versus total staining was scored under narrow wavelength fluorescein and Texas Red filter sets. One hundred randomly chosen transfected cells per coverslip were scored by eye for the relative level of green fluorescence signal arising from staining of the cell surface pool of expressed proteinversus the level of red fluorescence signal arising from staining of the total cellular pool of expressed protein. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of cells judged to be positive for surface staining as determined from three independent coverslips per treatment. Modeling of surface expression data was performed using the equation for a binomial distribution of channels (Fi) of a particular type, i, as follows.Fi=(n!(n−i)!i!)Ftest(n−i)Ftargeti(Eq. 1) Experimental data were normalized by adjusting maximum surface expression levels to 100% and graphed relative to theoretical data obtained from Equation 1. The following assumptions were made in order to use the binomial expression to calculate the percentage of channels predicted for each class of multimeric protein complex (see Refs. 31MacKinnon R.

To harvest cells and prepare detergent lysates, COS-1 cells were washed twice in ice cold PBS and then lysed in the dish for 5 min on ice in ice-cold lysis buffer solution (Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and a protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were harvested with a cell scraper, and incubated an additional 5 min on ice. The crude lysate was centrifuged in a refrigerated microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min at 14,000 × g to pellet nuclei and debris, and the resulting supernatant was saved for analysis. For all immunoblots, 20–40 μl of cleared lysate was added to an equal volume of 2× reducing SDS sample buffer, boiled, and fractionated on 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Lauryl sulfate (Sigma) was the SDS source used for all SDS-PAGE to accentuateMr differences between the different posttranslational isoforms of Kv1 α subunits (30Shi G. Kleinklaus A.K. Marrion N.V. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23204-23211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, the resulting blots were blocked in Blotto and incubated for 1 h in Blotto containing tissue culture preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies. Blots were then washed three times in Blotto for 30 min total, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution in Blotto) for 1 h, and washed in PBS three times for 30 min total. The blots were then incubated in substrate for enhanced chemiluminescence for 1 min and autoradiographed on preflashed (to A545 = 0.15) Fuji RX film. Densitometric measurements were obtained using a Bio-Rad model GS-670 imaging densitometer. Transfected COS-1 cleared cell lysates were digested with PNGase F (8 units/ml), endoglycosidase H (0.1 units/ml) or sialidase (Oxford Glycosystems) from Clostridium perfringens (0.25 units/ml in sodium acetate, pH 5.0) overnight at 37 °C. Digestion products were analyzed by immunoblot. For Proteinase K digestion (Sigma), transfected cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS.

Coverslips were placed in wells face up but did not contact the glia due to the presence of paraffin wax pedestals. Most (>85%) of the neurons in these cultures developed the characteristic morphology of hippocampal pyramidal cells.

Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 μg of DNA was diluted into 100 μl of serum-free transfection medium to which 10 μl of PLUS reagent was added, and the solution was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent was diluted into serum-free dilution medium in a second tube and mixed. Precomplexed DNA and diluted LipofectAMINE reagent were combined, mixed, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA-LipofectAMINE Plus reagent complexes were added to face up coverslips in individual wells of six-well tissue culture plates. Complexes were mixed into the medium gently and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h. To begin to address surface expression of Kv1 channels, we determined subcellular distributions and surface expression levels of homomeric channels using antibodies specific for extracellular and intracellular domains, respectively, of each Kv1 α subunit. COS-1 cells transfected with the appropriate rat Kv1 α subunit cDNA were fixed and stained with subtype-specific ectodomain-directed antibodies to assay for surface expression. These cells were then permeabilized and stained with cytoplasmically directed antibodies to detect total cellular pools of expressed Kv1 α subunits. We found that the vast majority (89.5 ± 0.9%) of Kv1.4-expressing cells had robust cell surface Kv1.4 staining (Fig.1 A), whereas only a small percentage (4.0 ± 0.8%) of Kv1.1-expressing cells had detectable surface Kv1.1 staining (Fig. 1 B). Kv1.2-expressing cells were heterogeneous, in that 19.0 ± 2.9% exhibited surface staining (Fig. 1 C). Increasing expression levels of the Kv1.1 or Kv1.4 α subunits in the transfected cells by increasing cDNA amounts in transfection mixtures did not alter the percentage of cells with surface staining (quantitative immunoblot analyses showed that increasing the amount of α subunit cDNA produced a similar increase in α subunit protein expression). However, increasing Kv1.2 expression yielded an increase in cells with detectable surface staining (not shown). To demonstrate that these differences in Kv1 α subunit surface expression were not unique to COS-1 cells, these rat Kv1 α subunits were expressed in a variety of mammalian cell lines of diverse origin. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) yielded identical patterns of Kv1 surface staining (TableI). Moreover, similar results were obtained in transfected primary rat hippocampal cultures (see below) and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (not shown). These results indicate that these observed differences in surface expression of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 are intrinsic properties of the Kv1 α subunits as they are recapitulated in diverse neuronal and nonneuronal cell backgrounds. COS-1 cells transfected with human Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 α subunits yielded surface staining patterns similar to those seen for rat Kv1 α subunits, showing that these inherent differences in surface expression were conserved across species (not shown).Table ISurface expression efficiency of homomeric Kv1 channels in transfected mammalian cellsKv1 α subunitCOS-1HEK-293MDCK%%%Kv1.14.0 ± 0.83.7 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.5Kv1.219.0 ± 2.917.7 ± 2.09.7 ± 0.5Kv1.489.5 ± 0.991.1 ± 0.992.3 ± 2.0Monkey kidney fibroblast cells (COS-1), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) were analyzed for surface expression as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Monkey kidney fibroblast cells (COS-1), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) were analyzed for surface expression as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To further analyze the subcellular localization of each Kv1 α subunit, we double-labeled COS-1 cells expressing Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv1.4 for these α subunits and for markers of the endomembrane compartments of the secretory pathway. For ER, cells were stained with antibodies against the resident ER protein BiP (37Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and the Golgi apparatus was stained with Lens culinaris lectin (38Hsu V.W. Shah N. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 625-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Any intracellular Kv1.4 staining colocalized with L. culinaris lectin staining in the Golgi apparatus (Fig.1 D), rather than BiP (not shown). In contrast, anti-BiP staining labeled a perinuclear compartment in COS-1 cells and colocalized with intracellular staining for Kv1.1 (Fig. 1 E) and Kv1.2 (Fig. 1 F). These latter two subunits did not colocalize with L. culinaris lectin (not shown). These results indicate that Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are localized to ER, whereas any minor intracellular accumulation of Kv1.4 occurs in the Golgi apparatus. These Kv1 α subunits contain a single N-linked glycosylation site located in the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments S1 and S2 (39Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar). Differences in processing ofN-linked oligosaccharide chains at these sites can be detected by shifts in Mr on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (40Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and by sensitivity to sialidase digestion. LowerMr forms of the Kv1 α subunits carrying simple high mannose chains correspond to ER pools, while higherMr forms carrying sialidated complex chains correspond to Golgi and plasma membrane pools (41Hubbard S.C. Ivatt R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 625-635Crossref Scopus (892) Google Scholar). We found the bulk of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 present in transfected cells in lowerMr forms (∼60–70 kDa) that were insensitive to sialidase treatment (Fig.2 A), consistent with their ER localization. However, a minor 86-kDa pool of Kv1.2 was found to be sialidase-sensitive (Fig. 2 A). Parallel analysis of Kv1.4-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A, right) showed that the major 110-kDa Kv1.4 pool was sialidase-sensitive, while the minor 90-kDa band was unaffected by sialidase digestion. These data are consistent with immunofluorescence staining and show that homotetramers composed of different Kv1 α subunits have different surface expression properties, with Kv1.4 localized to the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane domains and Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 localized to ER. To provide a direct biochemical correlate between these differences in oligosaccharide processing/Mr and cell surface expression, Kv1-transfected COS-1 cells were treated with external Proteinase K (PK), a relatively nonspecific protease that when externally applied cleaves the ectodomains of cell surface proteins (33Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 expressed in COS cells lacked detectable PK sensitivity, with the exception of the minor 86-kDa sialidase-sensitive Kv1.2 pool that was eliminated (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the bulk of the 110-kDa form of Kv1.4 was sensitive to PK digestion, while the 90-kDa form was unaffected. These data on sensitivity of homomeric Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 channels to sialidase and PK digestion are entirely consistent with the immunofluorescence staining and together show that Kv1 homotetramers have distinct surface expression characteristics, with Kv1.1 localized to ER, Kv1.4 predominantly on the cell surface, and Kv1.2 present in major intracellular and minor surface populations. Since most Kv1 α subunits in rat and human brain exist in heteromeric K+ channel complexes, we next addressed the effects of α subunit coassembly on surface expression by coexpressing Kv1 α subunit cDNAs in pairwise combinations. For these experiments, increasing amounts of “test” Kv1 α subunit cDNA were added to transfection mixtures containing a fixed amount of “target” Kv1 α subunit cDNA. Quantitative immunoblot analyses showed that increasing amounts of test cDNAs produced similar increases in test α subunit proteins with no effects on levels of target proteins (not shown). Immunofluorescence staining of cells expressing pairwise combinations of Kv1 α subunits revealed that coexpression of Kv1.1 as the test α subunit resulted in dramatic changes in distributions of target α subunits. In contrast to cells expressing Kv1.4 alone, cells coexpressing target Kv1.4 and saturating amounts of test Kv1.1 α subunits exhibited ER-localized Kv1.4 staining (Fig.3 A), a pattern never observed in cells expressing Kv1.4 alone. Conversely, coexpressing saturating amounts of test Kv1.4 with target Kv1.1 resulted in robust Kv1.1 surface staining not seen in cells expressing Kv1.1 homotetramers (Fig.3 B). These effects were specific for interacting Kv1 α subunits, since coexpression of Kv1.1 with noninteracting and surface-expressed Kv2.1 α subunits did not inhibit Kv2.1 surface expression, and coexpression of Kv1.4 with noninteracting and ER-localized Kv4.2 α subunits did not promote Kv4.2 surface expression (not shown). Systematically increasing amounts of test Kv1.1 cDNA added to transfection mixtures containing fixed amounts of either Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 target cDNAs resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the number of cells with detectable Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 surface staining (Fig. 4 A). The effects of Kv1.1 coexpression on Kv1.4 surface expression were most obvious, such that even in the presence of relatively low levels of Kv1.1 expression a significant decrease in the number of cells with surface Kv1.4 staining was observed (Fig. 4 A). We used a theoretical model for tetrameric Kv1 channel stoichiometry (31MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 32Ribera A.B. Pacioretty L.M. Taylor R.S. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to predict the Kv1 α subunit composition necessary for ER localization or surface expression of these heteromeric Kv1 channels. We found that our experimental data were consistent with a single Kv1.1 subunit being sufficient to cause significant ER localization of most Kv1.1/1.4 tetramers (Fig. 4 D, open squares), similar results were obtained for Kv1.1 effects on Kv1.2 surface expression (not shown). Thus, Kv1.1 coexpression resulted in potent and saturating inhibition of surface expression of both Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 α subunits and showed that the ER"

The center-surround properties of neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) may be important for signaling the relative motion between object and background. To test this, we microstimulated within MT and measured the effects on monkeys' eye movements to moving targets. We found that stimulation at ""local motion"" sites, where receptive fields possessed antagonistic surrounds, shifted pursuit in the preferred direction of the neurons, whereas stimulation at ""wide-field motion"" sites shifted pursuit in the opposite, or null, direction. We propose that activating wide-field sites simulated background motion, thus inducing a target motion signal in the opposite direction. Our results support the hypothesis that neuronal center-surround mechanisms contribute to the behavioral segregation of objects from the background."

https://openalex.org/W2063186078,"TRP and TRPL are two light-sensitive cation channel subunits required for the Drosophila photoresponse; however, our understanding of the identities, subunit composition, and function of the light-responsive channels is incomplete. To explain the residual photoresponse that remains in the trp mutant, a third TRP-related subunit has previously been proposed to function with TRPL. Here, we identify such a subunit, TRPγ. We show that TRPγ is highly enriched in photoreceptor cells and preferentially heteromultimerizes with TRPL in vitro and in vivo. The N-terminal domain of TRPγ dominantly suppressed the TRPL-dependent photoresponse, indicating that TRPγ-TRPL heteromultimers contribute to the photoresponse. While TRPL and TRPγ homomultimers are constitutively active, we demonstrate that TRPL–TRPγ heteromultimers form a regulated phospholipase C– (PLC-) stimulated channel."
https://openalex.org/W179352461,"The PDZ domain–containing proteins, such as PSD-95 and GRIP, have been suggested to be involved in the targeting of glutamate receptors, a process that plays a critical role in the efficiency of synaptic transmission and plasticity. To address the molecular mechanisms underlying AMPA receptor synaptic localization, we have identified several GRIP-associated proteins (GRASPs) that bind to distinct PDZ domains within GRIP. GRASP-1 is a neuronal rasGEF associated with GRIP and AMPA receptors in vivo. Overexpression of GRASP-1 in cultured neurons specifically reduced the synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors. In addition, the subcellular distribution of both AMPA receptors and GRASP-1 was rapidly regulated by the activation of NMDA receptors. These results suggest that GRASP-1 may regulate neuronal ras signaling and contribute to the regulation of AMPA receptor distribution by NMDA receptor activity."

The latest Cretaceous presence of these relatively derived members of the hyperdiverse leaf-beetle clade (Chrysomelidae, more than 38,000 species) implies that many of the adaptive radiations that account for the present diversity of leaf beetles occurred during the Late Cretaceous, contemporaneously with the ongoing rapid evolution of their angiosperm hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2069314031,"Sodium channels (NaChs) play a central role in action potential generation and are uniquely poised to influence the efficacy of transmitter release. We evaluated the effect of partial NaCh blockade on two aspects of synaptic efficacy First, we evaluated whether NaCh blockade accounts for the ability of certain drugs to selectively depress glutamate release. Second, we evaluated the contribution of NaChs to intraneuronal variability in glutamate release probability (p(r)). The antiglutamate drug riluzole nearly completely depresses glutamate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at concentrations that barely affect GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). NaCh inhibition explains the selective depression. Unlike other presynaptic depressants, partial NaCh blockade increases paired-pulse EPSC depression. This result is explained by selective depression of low-p(r) synapses. We conclude that local variations in the action potential contribute to p(r) variability among excitatory synapses."

In this manuscript we demonstrate that geranylgeranylation is required for the proper cellular localization of V14RhoA and for its ability to induce actin stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Furthermore, V14RhoA geranylgeranylation was also required for suppressing p21WAF transcription, promoting cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The ability of V14RhoA to induce focus formation and enhance plating efficiency and oncogenic Ras anchorage-dependent growth was also dependent on its geranylgeranylation. The only biological activity of V14RhoA that was not dependent on its prenylation was its ability to induce serum response element transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a farnesylated form of V14RhoA was also able to bind RhoGDI-1, was able to induce cytoskeleton organization, proliferation, and transformation, and was just as potent as geranylgeranylated V14RhoA at suppressing p21WAF transcriptional activity.

Hence, over the past decade the functional role of protein prenylation has been intensively studied for Ras, while a few studies took interest in the other proteins. It has been shown that geranylgeranylation of RhoA is required for its correct subcellular localization (23Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J.

However, although it was demonstrated that the prenylation of the highly homologous Rho protein, RhoB, is required for its cell transforming function but not its ability to activate serum response element-dependent transcription (29Lebowitz P.F.

It was only shown that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation by the GGTase I inhibitor, GGTI-298, resulted in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, induction of p21WAF transcription, programmed cell death, and disorganization of actin cytoskeleton (30Miquel K.

Hence, normal Ras function is critically dependent on modification by a farnesyl group, and a geranylgeranylated normal Ras protein appeared to be a potent inhibitor of cellular proliferation (35Cox A.

Thus an evaluation of the role of specific isoprenoid modification in the function of other prenylated protein such as Rho GTPase would be needful for a better understanding of the functional role for specific isoprenoid modification of a protein. In this manuscript, we determined whether RhoA prenylation is required for its activity on cytoskeleton organization, proliferation, transcription, and transformation. Furthermore, we also investigated whether the nature of the prenyl group (i.e. farnesylversus geranylgeranyl) influences the biological activities of RhoA. To this end, we generated RhoA mutants by deleting the CAAX sequence to produce an unprenylated protein as well as by mutating the CAAX box to produce farnesylated RhoA. Standard polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis techniques were used to generate plasmids coding for RhoA with the wild type (RhoA-CLVL), farnesylated, (RhoA-CVLS), or deleted (RhoA-Δ) CAAX sequence. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of pEXVmyc-tagWTRhoA and pEXVmyc-tagV14RhoA (a generous gift of A. Hall, London) were done with the forward primer (CCCAAGCTTGCGGCCGCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCC) and the reverse primers (RhoA-CLVL, GGAATTCGGATCCTCACAAGACAAGGCAACCAGA; RhoA-CVLS, GGAATTCGGATCCTCACGAAAGGACGCAACCAGATTTTTTCTTCCCACGTC; and RhoA-Δ, GGAATTCGGATCCTCAACCAGATTTTTTCTTCCCACGTCTAGC), respectively. The amplified fragments digested by NotI and BamHI were ligated with pCMV-intronA plasmid (a generous gift of Dr. J. Baar, Pittsburgh, PA) digested by NotI and BamHI, and an Ires-Zeo fragment obtained from a BamHI digestion of the plasmid pUTEMCV (Cayla S.A., Toulouse, France) was added. The coding region of RhoGDI-1 was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from human fibroblasts by using specific primers (forward primer, 5′-GCTAAGCTTGGGATCCGCTGAGCAGGAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CCGGAATTCGGCTCAGTCCTTCCAGTCCTTCTTGATG-3′) and subcloned into the bacterial glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression vector pGST-Parallel2 (generously provided by P. Sheffield) as anBamHI/EcoRI fragment. pSRE was provided by Dr. R. Jove (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL) and p21P containing the full-length sequence of p21WAFpromoter was provided by Dr. X.-F. Wang (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). pCMV-βgal was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS, at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. COS-7 cells and NIH-3T3 cell lines transiently and stably expressing, respectively, the RhoA mutants Ha-RasL61 or Ha-RasL61/V14RhoA were generated by transfection using LipofectAMINETM Reagent Plus method as indicated by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by selection for NIH-3T3 cell lines with 200 μg/ml of ZeocinTM (Cayla S.A.) for RhoA, 1 mg/ml of Geneticin® (Life Technologies, Inc.) for Ha-RasL61 and 200 μg/ml of ZeocinTM plus 1 mg/ml of Geneticin® for Ha-RasL61/RhoA. Cell clones were expanded into mass culture, and RhoA and Ha-RasL61 protein expression were analyzed by Western blotting (as described below). NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing the RhoA constructs were plated in DMEM, 10% FCS with 3 × 105 cells in 100-mm Petri dishes on day 1 and treated with either vehicle, 10 μm FTI-277 or 10 μmGGTI-298, on days 2 and 3. The cells were harvested on day 4 and lysed in lysis buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaVO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6.4 mg/ml phosphate substrate; Sigma 104®). 30 μg of the cleared lysates were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Gelman), and incubated with antibodies against RhoA (26-C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Rap1A/Krev-1 (C-065, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Ha-Ras (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Detection was performed using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) Cells were harvested in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-114, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. Membrane and cytosolic proteins were separated in two phases (pellet containing membranes and supernatant containing cytosolic proteins) by Triton X-114 partitioning at 30 °C as described by Bordier (43Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with antibodies against the Myc tag of RhoA proteins (mouse anti-c-Myc from Calbiochem). Detection was performed as described above. GST-RhoGDI-1 fusion protein expression and purification was done as described by Sheffield et al. (44Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). For in vitro interaction assay 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were preincubated with 100 μg of bacterial overexpressed GST-RhoGDI soluble extract for 2 h at 4 °C, washed with interaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl), then incubated with 100 μg of cell homogenates diluted in 500 μl of interaction buffer, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were next washed twice with interaction buffer and resuspended directly in Laemmli buffer. RhoA content was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot with anti-Myc antibodies. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips into six-well plates (Nunc) at a density of 8 × 104cells/well in DMEM 10% FCS. 48 h later cells were serum-starved for 48 h. Then cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized into 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Actin fibers were detected by incubation with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes). RhoA and vinculin were detected with anti-c-Myc (Calbiochem) or anti-vinculin antibodies (Sigma Immuno Chemical), respectively, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma Immuno Chemical). Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, and pictures were taken with a Princeton camera. NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at 2000 cells/well in a 96-well plates six times on day 0 in DMEM containing 10% or 2.5% FCS, and the amount of cells was evaluated on day 0 (6 h post-plating) and at the intervals indicated in the figure legends by a MTT test as described previously (45Berton M. Sixou S. Kravtzoff R. Dartigues C. Imbertie L. Allal C. Favre G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing the V14RhoA constructs were seeded at 25000 cells in a 25-cm2flask. Cell foci were scored 15 days after confluence after fixing with AFA (ethanol/formol/acetic acid, 75/20/5) and staining with crystal violet. For plating efficiency assays, NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at 400 cells/60-mm culture dishes in DMEM 10% or 2.5% FCS. Cell plating efficiency was scored 10 or 15 days later, respectively, by fixing with AFA and staining with crystal violet. Cells were seeded at 16,000 cells/well in 12-well plates in triplicate in 0.3% agar over a 0.6% agar layer as described elsewhere (46Lerner E.A. Zhang T.-T. Knowles D.B. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cells were fed twice weekly until colonies grew to a suitable size for observation (about 12 days). Colonies were photographed after 4 h of incubation with 1 mg/ml MTT in DMEM at 37 °C. The growth of colonies of cell lines expressing V14RhoA or Ha-RasL61/V14RhoA constructs was compared with the control colonies expressing Ha-RasL61. NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at 2 × 105/well in six-well plates. 24 h later they were transfected with 0.5 μg of pSRE or p21WAF, 0.2 μg of pCMV-βgal and 1 μg of pCMV-V14RhoA-CLVL, pCMV-V14RhoA-CVLS, or pCMV-V14RhoA-Δ using LipofectAMINETM Reagent Plus as indicated by the supplier. 15 h after transfection, the cells were replenished with fresh growth medium. For p21WAF promoter activity analysis cells were harvested 30 h later and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). For SRE activity analysis, 24 h after transfection cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS during the next 24 h, before harvesting and lysis. Cell extracts were used for β-galactosidase (CLONTECH) and luciferase (Promega) assays. To evaluate the role of prenyl group and of its nature (C15 farnesyl or C20 geranylgeranyl) in RhoA functions we generated RhoA mutants by altering the CAAX sequence to render RhoA a substrate either of geranylgeranyltransferase I or farnesyltransferase or not prenylated. Using standard polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, the CLVL sequence of RhoA (Rho-CLVL) was either replaced by the CAAX box of the farnesylated Ha-Ras protein (RhoA-CVLS) or deleted (RhoA-Δ). The plasmids encoding these RhoA mutants were transfected in the murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Expression of RhoA was controlled by Western blot in 10 different clones picked for each construction. Representative clones with similar expression level to each other were selected (Fig.1). We determined the prenylation status of each V14RhoA mutant by using FTI-277 and GGTI-298, specific inhibitors of FTase and GGTase I, respectively. NIH-3T3 cells expressing either V14RhoA-CLVL or V14RhoA-CVLS were treated with FTI-277 or GGTI-298, and the lysates were analyzed for inhibition of prenylation of Ha-Ras (exclusively farnesylated control), Rap1A (exclusively geranylgeranylated control), RhoA-CLVL, and RhoA-CVLS, by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, treatment with FTI-277 resulted in inhibition of farnesylation of Ha-Ras but had no effects on the geranylgeranylation of Rap1A (Fig. 1). Similarly, GGTI-298 inhibited the geranylgeranylation of Rap1A without any effects on the farnesylation of Ha-Ras. Fig. 1 also shows that FTI-277 inhibited the prenylation of RhoA-CVLS but not RhoA-CLVL, whereas GGTI-298 inhibited the prenylation of RhoA-CLVL but not RhoA-CVLS. These results suggest that RhoA-CVLS is exclusively farnesylated, whereas RhoA-CLVL is exclusively geranylgeranylated. The prenylation status of a protein being important for its proper subcellular localization (23Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we checked the localization of the RhoA mutants by immunofluorescence. V14RhoA-CLVL cells displayed a diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig.2 A) with an increased staining in the perinuclear area of some cells. RhoA-CVLS cells showed a similar pattern of fluorescence (Fig. 2 A). In contrast RhoA-Δ staining was not confined to a specific subcellular compartment but was rather spread throughout the whole cell (Fig. 2 A). This pattern was also observed when all of RhoA mutants were treated with lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of prenylation (data not shown), confirming that prenylation is essential for proper protein subcellular localization. We next analyzed the subcellular localization of RhoA mutants by Western blot after separation of cell homogenates in cytosol and membrane proteins by Triton X114 partitioning as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2 Bunprenylated V14RhoA was essentially associated with the cytosolic fraction, whereas prenylated RhoA, either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated, was distributed in both fractions. About 40% of prenylated V14RhoA expressed in NIH-3T3 cells was observed in membrane fraction. When analyzed in COS-7 cells after transient expression, prenylated V14RhoA display a similar subcellular distribution, whereas wild type RhoA was essentially found in cytosol fraction (data not shown), illustrating the shift toward the membrane of RhoA GTPase after activation but only when prenylated. These results together confirmed that prenylation is essential for proper protein subcellular localization and also indicated that farnesyl can substitute for geranylgeranyl without any dramatic effect on RhoA subcellular localization. Although it was well established that isoprenoid modification of RhoA is required for interaction with RhoGDI (24Hori Y. Kikuchi A. Isomura M. Katayama M. Miura Y. Fujioka H. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar, 47Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it is still not known whether prenylation of RhoA has to be specific. To assess the role of isoprenoid the in vitro interaction of RhoA mutants with GST-RhoGDI-1 was examined. Because it was described that RhoGDI-1 binds poorly RhoA-GTP (48Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Yamamoto J. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9373-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used COS-7 cells transfected transiently with wild type RhoA bearing or deleted of the different CAAX boxes. We found as expected that nonprenylated RhoA was unable to bind GST-RhoGDI-1 (Fig.3). In contrast geranylgeranylated as well as farnesylated RhoA strongly interacted with GST-RhoGDI-1. As illustrated by the quantitation of the signal of precipitated RhoA normalized by the signal of total RhoA on Western blot, GST-RhoGDI-1 appeared to bind equal levels of both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated RhoA (Fig. 3). The Rho protein family whose members include RhoA has been shown to influence a number of cellular processes including actin stress fiber organization, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and transformation. We next determined whether prenylation and moreover the nature of the added prenyl group play a role on RhoA implication on actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. We observed that whereas NIH-3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the empty vector (mock) or V14RhoA-Δ have conserved a typical fibroblast morphology, V14RhoA-CLVL and V14RhoA-CLVS expressing cells were smaller and displayed a more epithelial-like morphology (Fig.4 A). Similar changes of cell size were observed in Swiss 3T3 cells microinjected with active RhoA (3Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just J. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) as well as in murine tumor cells (50Ghosh P.M. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Moyer M.L. Mott G.E. Thomas C.A. Foster B.A. Greenberg N.M. Kreisberg J.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4120-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the V14RhoA mutants on stress fibers and focal adhesions, the cells were serum-starved for 48 h before analysis. Indeed removal of growth factors and LPA (a well known stimulator of RhoA functions) from culture medium led to the reduction of actin stress fiber content in mock and V14RhoA-Δ cells (Fig.4 B). In contrast, under these conditions V14RhoA-CLVL and V14RhoA-CLVS cells displayed well preserved stress fibers (Fig.4 B). In parallel experiments, vinculin immunostaining showed that in V14RhoA-CLVL and V14RhoA-CLVS but not V14RhoA-Δ expressing cells a retention of numerous focal adhesions in the absence of serum (Fig. 4 B). These results would indicate that prenylation is required for RhoA implication in stress fibers and focal adhesions and that geranylgeranylation could be substituted for by farnesylation. We next assessed the role of the prenylation of RhoA on cell growth. Mock-transfected NIH-3T3 cells and those expressing V14RhoA-CLVL, V14RhoA-CVLS, or V14RhoA-Δ maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS displayed similar growth rate (Fig.5 A). However, in lower serum concentration (2.5%), V14RhoA-CLVL and -CVLS cells showed a significantly higher growth rate than mock and V14RhoA-Δ cells (Fig.5 B), indicating that prenylated V14RhoA expression reduced the serum requirement of the NIH-3T3 cells as described by Peronaet al. (9Perona R. Esteve P. Jimenez B. Ballestero R.P. Ramon y Cajal S. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar). We next determined whether the ability of RhoA to transform cells depends on its geranylgeranylation and whether farnesylated RhoA remains transforming. To this end, we have compared various V14RhoA mutants in focus formation, plating efficiency, and anchorage-independent growth assays. For the focus formation assay, NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing V14RhoA mutants were seeded at 25,000 cells/25-cm2 flask, and cell foci were scored 12 days later. Whereas mock and V14RhoA-Δ cells grew in a monolayer, V14RhoA-CLVL or CVLS cells grew at higher density and forme"
https://openalex.org/W2012495949,"We previously identified intersectin, a multiple EH and SH3 domain-containing protein, as a component of the endocytic machinery. Overexpression of the SH3 domains of intersectin blocks transferrin receptor endocytosis, possibly by disrupting targeting of accessory proteins of clathrin-coated pit formation. More recently, we identified mammalian Sos, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, as an intersectin SH3 domain-binding partner. We now demonstrate that overexpression of intersectin's SH3 domains blocks activation of Ras and MAP kinase in various cell lines. Several studies suggest that activation of MAP kinase downstream of multiple receptor types is dependent on endocytosis. Thus, the dominant-negative effect of the SH3 domains on Ras/MAP kinase activation may be indirectly mediated through a block in endocytosis. Consistent with this idea, incubating cells at 4 °C or with phenylarsine oxide, treatments previously established to inhibit EGF receptor endocytosis, blocks EGF-dependent activation of MAP kinase. However, under these conditions, Ras activity is unaffected and overexpression of the SH3 domains of intersectin is still able to block Ras activation. Thus, intersectin SH3 domain overexpression can effect EGF-mediated MAP kinase activation directly through a block in Ras, consistent with a functional role for intersectin in Ras activation.

Through its SH3 domains, Grb2 interacts with proline-rich sequences in mSos, and through its SH2 domain, Grb2 interacts with SHC or activated growth factor receptors, thereby recruiting mSos to the membrane where it can activate Ras (7Aronheim A.

Activated Ras initiates a phosphorylation cascade culminating in phosphorylation and activation of the p42/p44 MAP kinases (Erk-1 and Erk-2).

Chem. 1999; 274: 15671-15677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we were able to identify an intersectin/mSos complex that could be partially purified from Grb2 (19Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These data suggest that intersectin may function as a scaffold for protein components of both the endocytic machinery and signal transduction pathways. We were thus interested to study the link between intersectin and activation of the Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of intersectin's five SH3 domains blocks EGF-dependent activation of Ras and MAP kinase in HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells. SH3 domain overexpression also blocks NGF-dependent activation of Ras in PC12 cells. For many receptors that signal through the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, active endocytic function has been suggested to be a pre-requisite for MAP kinase activation (20Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L.

Overexpression of intersectin's SH3 domains blocks endocytosis (18Simpson F. Hussain N.K. Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and thus, their effect on the activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway could be mediated indirectly through blocking endocytosis. Therefore, we examined the activation of this pathway in cells in which EGF receptor endocytosis was blocked and found that, although MAP kinase activation was attenuated, Ras activation was not affected. Interestingly, overexpression of the SH3 domains of intersectin blocked Ras activation under these conditions, suggesting that they have a direct role in disrupting Ras activation, likely through binding to mSos. Thus, in addition to its role in endocytosis, intersectin may also function in Ras/MAP kinase signaling and may provide an important link between these two processes. Polyclonal antibodies against MAP kinase (Erk-1 and Erk-2) and against activated, phosphorylated MAP kinase, were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. A monoclonal antibody against Ras was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Recombinant adenoviruses encoding GFP or the five tandem SH3 domains of intersectin fused to GFP (GFP-SH3) were generated as described (19Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To generate adenovirus encoding the 170-kDa isoform of synaptojanin (synaptojanin170) (28Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol.

The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XhoI andHindIII and subcloned into the synaptojanin cDNA following a complete XhoI and partial HindIII digest (HindIII site at nucleotide 4015). The resulting clone was digested with KpnI and XhoI, and the insert, encoding synaptojanin170, was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pAdTrack-CMV (30He T.-C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T., Yu, J.

The resulting plasmid, which allows for the expression of synaptojanin170 and GFP from separate cytomegalovirus promoters, was recombined with pAdEasy-1 in BJ5183 cells and recombinant plasmids were selected on kanamycin and identified by EcoRI and BstXI digests (30He T.-C.

Recombinant adenovirus was produced, amplified, and subsequently purified on CsCl2 gradients as described (30He T.-C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). The viruses were used to infect HEK-293, COS-7, or PC12-6-24 (31Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) cells, which had been plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 10-cm2 dishes. For HEK-293 cells, the cells were exposed to virus for 2 h at a multiplicity of infection of 100 before the medium was changed. Following an additional 48-h incubation, the cells were transferred into serum-free media for 5 h and then challenged with EGF as described in the figure legends. For COS-7 and PC12-6-24 cells, the viruses were used at a multiplicity of infection of 100–200 and were incubated with the cells for 24 h before the media was changed to serum-free media. Following an additional 24-h incubation, the cells were transferred into fresh serum-free media and challenged with EGF or NGF as described in the figure legends. In some cases, cells were treated with 50 μm PD-098059 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) or 10 μm phenylarsine oxide (PAO, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for the last hour or last one-half hour, respectively, of the serum-free treatment. The drugs were also included in the media at the same concentration during the time of growth factor addition. In other experiments, similar treatments were performed on non-infected cells. In all cases, cells were washed in PBS, collected by scrapping, and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold Ras assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium flouride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The extracts were centrifuged at maximal speed for 3 min, and the bulk of the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads complexed with approximately 25 μg of a GST fusion protein encoding the Ras-GTP binding domain of Raf-1 (32de Rooij J. Bos J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar,33Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Following a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold Ras assay buffer, and bound material was eluted with gel sample buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE, along with aliquots of starting material and unbound material. The samples were processed for Western blots with the monoclonal antibody against Ras. Various cells lines, plated on poly-l-lysine substrate in 6-well multi-well culture dishes, were left uninfected, or were infected with recombinant adenovirus and then treated with EGF and various drugs as described above. In all cases, the cells were then washed in PBS (20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The samples were collected and centrifuged at maximal speed for 5 min before the supernatants were collected, assayed for protein, and prepared for Western blot analysis with an antibody against the active, phosphorylated form of MAP kinase. COS-7 cells, plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, were left untreated or were treated with PAO as described above. At the appropriate time, the cells were washed with serum-free media and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml Texas Red-labeled EGF (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were then washed into 37 °C serum-free media and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C or were left at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were washed briefly in PBS, fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 3.5% paraformaldehyde, washed, mounted on glass slides, and observed by epifluorescence microscopy. The endocytic scaffolding molecule, intersectin, displays SH3 domain-dependent interactions with the Ras guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, mSos1, and overexpression of the SH3 domains of intersectin blocks Ras activation in HEK-293 cells (19Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To further investigate the potential role of intersectin in Ras function, we examined the effect of overexpressing the five SH3 domains of intersectin on Ras activation in EGF-stimulated HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells as well as NGF-stimulated PC12-6-24 cells (31Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we measured the levels of Ras-GTP in cells by performing Ras pull-down assays with a GST-Raf-1 fusion protein that has an increased affinity for Ras-GTP versus Ras-GDP (32de Rooij J. Bos J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 33Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In non-stimulated (0 EGF), serum-starved HEK-293 cells, infected with the green fluorescence protein (GFP), with GFP fused to the five tandem SH3 domains of intersectin (GFP-SH3), or with a virus encoding the 170-kDa isoform of synaptojanin (synaptojanin170) (28Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), little binding of Ras to GST-Raf-1 was observed (Fig.1 A). However, following treatment of GFP-overexpressing cells with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min, a dramatic increase in Ras binding to GST-Raf-1 was observed, indicative of an increase in the cellular levels of the GTP-bound form of Ras (Fig. 1 A). A similar increase is seen in cells overexpressing synaptojanin170 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, cells infected with GFP-SH3 show much lower levels of active Ras following EGF treatment (Fig. 1 A). To quantitate this effect, Western blots from multiple experiments were scanned and the density of Ras reactivity in the bead lanes was expressed as a ratio of reactivity in the starting materials (relative activation; Fig.1 B). Although EGF stimulated cells overexpressing GFP alone demonstrated an average ratio of 5.34 ± 0.98 (mean ± S.E.,n = 9), cells overexpressing GFP-SH3 demonstrated an average ratio of 1.65 ± 0.35. This 3.2-fold decrease in Ras activation caused by GFP-SH3 overexpression was significant with ap value of 0.001 in a two-tailed paired t test. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the levels of active Ras following EGF treatment between cells overexpressing GFP and cells overexpressing synaptojanin170 (mean ± S.E. for synaptojanin = 5.15 ± 0.45, n = 7) (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, cells overexpressing GFP-SH3 also appeared to have slightly lower levels of active Ras than cells overexpressing GFP in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 1 A). The values for relative Ras activation (mean ± S.E.,n = 11) were 1.09 ± 0.22 for GFP and 0.71 ± 0.12 for GFP-SH3. The p value for significance between these two groups was 0.06. These data suggest that SH3 domain overexpression lowers the basal level of active Ras. Interestingly, intersectin and mSos are associated at the membrane in the absence of stimulation in brain (19Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the -fold activation induced by EGF is still greater for GFP-infected cells (4.9-fold) than for GFP-SH3-infected cells (2.3-fold), suggesting an additional role for intersectin following EGF stimulation. We next sought to examine the effect of the overexpression of intersectin's SH3 domains on Ras activation in different cell lines. Serum-starved PC12-6-24 cells and COS-7 cells have little active Ras when left unstimulated but demonstrate increased Ras activation upon stimulation with NGF or EGF, respectively (Fig.2). As for HEK-293 cells, overexpression of GFP-SH3 attenuates Ras activation in both PC12-6-24 cells and COS-7 cells. For all of the Ras assay experiments, the levels of Ras in the crude cell lysates (starting material) were approximately the same in any given cell line under the various infection conditions, indicating that the decreases in the amount of activated Ras following ligand stimulation in the SH3 domain expressing cells is not due to changes in the cellular levels of Ras. We next sought to explore the potential role for intersectin in MAP kinase activation. Overexpression of the SH3 domains of intersectin with an epitope-tagged MAP kinase construct in a co-transfection system reveals that the SH3 domains of intersectin can attenuate EGF-dependent MAP kinase activation (34Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of the SH3 domain of the GTPase accelerating protein, p120RasGAP, had no effect on MAP kinase activation in the same system (34Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize this result, and to extend it to our system, we examined the activation of endogenous MAP kinase in HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells infected with GFP or GFP-SH3. At 10 or 100 ng/ml, EGF treatment strongly activates MAP kinase in GFP-infected cells as determined by Western blots with an antibody against the active, phosphorylated form of Erk-1/2 (PO4 MAPK) (Fig.3). In contrast, MAP kinase activation is greatly reduced at both EGF concentrations in the GFP-SH3-infected cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore, GFP-SH3 domain overexpression attenuates MAP kinase activation in response to 10 ng/ml EGF stimulation of COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). In all cases, the levels of MAP kinase under the various treatments were the same as determined by Western blots with an antibody that recognizes non-phosphorylated Erk-1/2 (MAPK) (Fig.3). Several lines of investigation have suggested that, for several classes of receptors, endocytosis is necessary to couple receptor stimulation to MAP kinase activation. For example, both the EGF receptor and the TrkA NGF receptor appear to require endocytic function to activate MAP kinase (20Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 21Riccio A. Pierchala B.A. Ciarallo C.L. Ginty D.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the isolated SH3 domains of intersectin blocks transferrin receptor endocytosis (18Simpson F. Hussain N.K. Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and EGF receptor endocytosis (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that the attenuation of growth factor-stimulated MAP kinase activation seen following intersectin SH3 domain overexpression is due to a block in endocytosis. To examine this issue further, we decided to investigate the activation of Ras and MAP kinase under conditions where endocytosis is blocked. To block endocytosis, we incubated cells at 4 °C or at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm PAO, a well established inhibitor of EGF receptor endocytosis (35Hertel C. Coulter S.J. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12547-12553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kato Y. Sato H. Ichikawa M. Suzuki H. Sawada Y. Hanano M. Fuwa T. Sugiyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8507-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.4, both of these treatments effectively block endocytosis of the EGF receptor as determined by examining the uptake of Texas Red-labeled EGF, which appears in vesicular endosomal structures within the cells at 37 °C but remains on the surface at 4 °C or at 37 °C in the presence of PAO. We then examined Ras and MAP kinase activity under these conditions. In the continuous presence of EGF at 100 ng/ml and at 37 °C, Ras and MAP kinase are activated at 2 min, but the levels of the active forms of both proteins are significantly lower at 10 min (Fig.5). The attenuation of Ras activity at 10 min appears to be due to a MAP kinase kinase (MEK)-dependent feedback inhibition of Ras activation as the addition of PD-098059, a known inhibitor of MEK (37Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Briges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar), prevents this affect (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with previously published data from several laboratories demonstrating that MEK-dependent feedback phosphorylation of mSos, either via MAP kinase or other MEK-dependent kinases, causes Ras desensitization by inducing mSos to dissociate from Grb2 (38Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.J. Guan K.L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have also observed that mSos phosphorylation causes a decrease in the mSos1/intersectin interaction (data not shown). At 4 °C, EGF appears to stimulate Ras to the same extent as it does at 37 °C (Fig. 5). As is the case with PD-098059, treatment of cells at 4 °C completely blocks MAP kinase activation and prevents the attenuation of Ras activity seen after 10 min of EGF treatment at 37 °C (Fig. 5). Finally, in cells treated with PAO, Ras is fully active at 2 and 10 min, yet MAP kinase activation is strongly attenuated (Fig. 5). Thus, under conditions where endocytosis is blocked, Ras can be activated without a subsequent activation of MAP kinase. Endocytosis appears to be important for the ability of multiple receptor types, including the EGF receptor, TrkA NGF receptor, insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors, β2-adrenergic receptor, delta opioid receptor, and m1-muscarinic receptor to activate MAP kinase in response to ligand (20Vieira A.V.

However, other receptors and receptor subtypes, including the α2a-, α2b-, and α2c-adrenergic receptors, the m3-muscarinic receptor, and the kappa-opioid receptor, appear endocytosis-independent in terms of MAP kinase activation (44Li J.G.

Whether these differences are due to specificity in receptor signaling or are reflections of distinct experimental systems is not known. Recently, Kranenburg et al. (48Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35301-35304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have suggested that, at least in the case of the EGF receptor, endocytosis of activated MEK, rather than endocytosis of activated receptor, is necessary for ligand-stimulated MAP kinase activation. This observation may help to resolve some of the discrepancies in the above studies. Our results, which suggest that endocytosis is necessary at a step between Ras activation and MAP kinase phosphorylation by MEK, are consistent with those of Kranenburget al. (48Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35301-35304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Given our observations that Ras remains active under conditions where endocytosis is blocked, we were able to examine if overexpression of the SH3 domains of intersectin have a direct effect on Ras activation. Overexpression of GFP-SH3 in cells at 4 °C or in cells at 37 °C in the presence of PAO led to a significant reduction in Ras activation relative to cells infected with GFP alone, identical to the result seen at 37 °C in the absence of additional treatment (Fig.6). Thus, the SH3 domains of intersectin are able to block EGF activation of Ras independent of their ability to block endocytosis of the EGF receptor. This effect may result by preventing mSos targeting to Ras and is consistent with a model in which intersectin plays a role in mSos membrane targeting. However, we have previously demonstrated that intersectin and Grb2 compete for binding to mSos (19Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that the effect of SH3 domain overexpression on Ras activation in non-neuronal cells is due to disruption of Grb2/mSos complexes. However, in brain, a stable complex of mSos with intersectin can be partially separated from Grb2 (19Tong X.-K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R.

Furthermore, intersectin is expressed in HEK-293 cells (data not shown) as well as COS-7 and PC12 cells (16Hussain N.K. Yamabhai M. Ramjaun A.R. Guy A.M. Baranes D. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. Kay B.K.

Thus, intersectin may have a direct function in Ras activation via interactions with mSos. Intersectin is concentrated at clathrin-coated pits in both neurons and in non-neuronal cells (16Hussain N.K. Yamabhai M. Ramjaun A.R. Guy A.M. Baranes D. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. Kay B.K.

In response to ligand binding, the cytoplasmic tails of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the EGF receptor, autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues and interact with signaling complexes (49van der Geer P. Hunter T. Linberg R.A. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The receptors are also rapidly targeted to clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways (50Haigler H.T. McKanna J.M. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Perhaps intersectin plays a role in EGF-stimulated Ras activation specifically at clathrin-coated pits. This is especially interesting in light of the fact that active EGF receptor signaling complexes undergo endocytosis and can continue to signal on endosomes (51Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.-J.

Furthermore, it has been recently demonstrated that signaling complexes composed of Raf-1 and activated Erk-1/2, linked to clathrin-mediated endocytic vesicles through β-arrestin, are critical in regulating the subcellular localization of MAP kinase activation downstream of the Gαq-coupled proteinase-activated receptor (54DeFea K.A.

https://openalex.org/W2019015783,"SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) forms a complex with sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and escorts them from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex where proteases release transcriptionally active segments of SREBPs, which enter the nucleus to activate lipid synthesis. The NH2-terminal segment of SCAP contains eight transmembrane helices, five of which (TM2–6) comprise the sterol-sensing domain. This domain responds to sterols by causing the SCAP·SREBP complex to be retained in the ER, preventing proteolytic release and reducing transcription of lipogenic genes. Here, we use transfection techniques to overexpress a segment of SCAP containing transmembrane helices 1–6 in hamster and human cells. This segment does not interfere with SCAP·SREBP movement to the Golgi in the absence of sterols, but it prevents sterols from suppressing this movement. This block is abolished when SCAP(TM1–6) contains a point mutation (Y298C) that is known to abolish the activity of the sterol-sensing domain. We interpret these findings to indicate that sterols cause the SCAP·SREBP complex to bind to an ER retention protein through an interaction that involves the sterol-sensing domain. The SCAP(TM1–6) segment competes with the SCAP·SREBP complex for binding to this putative retention protein, thereby liberating the SCAP·SREBP complex so that it can move to the Golgi despite the presence of sterols. These studies provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the ability of sterols to block SCAP·SREBP movement from the ER and thereby to control lipid synthesis in animal cells.

Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). SREBPs are membrane-bound transcription factors whose NH2-terminal domains must be released proteolytically to enter the nucleus. For proteolysis to take place, the SREBPs must be transported from their site of synthesis in the ER to their site of proteolysis in the Golgi complex (2DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.-P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This transport is accomplished by SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein), a membrane-bound protein that forms a complex with SREBPs in the ER and escorts them to the Golgi complex. SREBPs are tripartite membrane proteins of ∼1150 amino acids in length (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of ∼480 amino acids contains a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper motif that allows it to bind DNA and activate transcription. This domain is followed by a membrane attachment domain of ∼80 amino acids consisting of two transmembrane helices separated by a short hydrophilic loop that projects into the lumen of the ER. The COOH-terminal domain of ∼590 amino acids performs a regulatory function. The SREBPs are oriented in the membrane in a hairpin fashion with the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains projecting into the cytoplasm (3Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SCAP is a polytopic membrane protein with two distinct domains (4Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of ∼550 amino acids consists of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic sequences that are believed to form eight membrane-spanning helices. The COOH-terminal domain of ∼725 amino acids is hydrophilic and projects into the cytoplasm. This domain contains five copies of a WD-40 repeat sequence that is found in many proteins and mediates protein/protein interactions (5Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Indeed, immediately after its synthesis, SCAP forms a complex with SREBPs that is mediated by an interaction of the WD-40 repeat domain of SCAP and the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of the SREBPs (6Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L.

When cells are depleted of sterols, the SCAP·SREBP complex travels from the ER to the Golgi, where it encounters two proteases that act in sequence to release the NH2-terminal domain of SREBP into the cytoplasm (2DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.-P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 8Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Scheek S.

The first enzyme, designated Site-1 protease, cleaves the SREBP in the luminal loop, thereby separating the two transmembrane helices (9Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This allows Site-2 protease to cleave the first transmembrane helix within the plane of the membrane, releasing the NH2-terminal domain with three hydrophobic amino acids attached (10Duncan E.A. Davé U.P. Sakai J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17801-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This domain travels to the nucleus where it activates transcription of multiple genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids as well as their uptake from plasma lipoproteins through the low density lipoprotein receptor (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). Movement of SREBP to the Golgi absolutely requires SCAP. In SCAP-deficient mutant cell lines, the SREBPs fail to move to the Golgi complex, and they are not released proteolytically from membranes. As a result, SCAP-deficient cells are cholesterol auxotrophs (11Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The SCAP·SREBP transport process is controlled by cholesterol. When sterols build up in cells, the SCAP·SREBP complex fails to bud from ER membranes and it never reaches the Golgi. 2Nohturfft, A., Yabe, D., Goldstein, J. L., Brown, M. S., and Espenshade, P. J. (2000) Cell 102, 315–323. As a result, the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids is reduced. This sterol-regulated transport mechanism modulates the cholesterol content of cell membranes. The sterol-sensing function in the SREBP system has been traced to a portion of the membrane domain of SCAP encompassing transmembrane helices 1–6 (TM1–6). This region contains sequences that are shared with three other proteins that are postulated to interact with sterols (12Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This segment has therefore been termed “the sterol-sensing domain” (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Point mutations at two conserved residues within this domain (Y298C and D443N) abolish the sterol-sensing function of SCAP (12Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These mutant forms of SCAP form complexes with SREBPs that are transported to the Golgi normally, but they can no longer be blocked by sterols.2 As a result, cells bearing these SCAP mutations overproduce cholesterol and fail to shut-off cholesterol synthesis when intracellular sterol levels rise. A crucial question relates to the mechanism by which SCAP is retained in the ER in sterol-overloaded cells. Two mechanisms must be considered. The first model postulates that the SCAP·SREBP complex leaves the ER constitutively and that sterols cause the complex to bind to a molecule, presumably a protein, that actively retains it in the ER. The alternative hypothesis states that ER retention of the complex represents the constitutive state. For the SCAP·SREBP complex to leave the ER, it must interact with a protein that carries it to the Golgi. This interaction would occur only in sterol-depleted cells. The current studies were designed to distinguish between these two possibilities. For this purpose, we transfected cells with cDNAs encoding a portion of the transmembrane domain of SCAP that includes the sterol sensor. Overexpression of this domain abolished the ability of sterols to suppress SCAP movement and SREBP cleavage. This effect was not observed when the transmembrane domain contained the Y298C mutation. These findings support the model in which the SCAP·SREBP complex is retained in the ER through an interaction between the transmembrane domain and an unidentified retention protein. The overexpressed transmembrane domain competes for this interaction and allows the SCAP·SREBP complex to move constitutively even in the presence of sterols.

Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the membrane topology of SCAP, denoting the two segments of SCAP that were produced by the cDNAs used in these studies. The positions of the various epitopes, the three N-linked glycosylation sites, and the Y298C mutation are also shown. The sterol-sensing domain of SCAP comprises transmembrane helices 2–6 (shaded in Fig.1). Fig. 2 shows an experiment in which cultured human cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding SREBP-2 with an epitope tag at the NH2 terminus. The cells were also transfected with cDNAs encoding a portion of the membrane domain of SCAP (transmembrane helices 1–6) tagged with an Xpress (Xp) epitope. The encoded protein contained either the wild-type sequence or the Y298C mutation. The cells were incubated in the absence of sterols or in the presence of increasing concentrations of a mixture of 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol, after which nuclear extracts and membrane fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with antibodies against either the HSV-tag on SREBP-2 or the Xpress-tag on the truncated SCAP. When the cells expressing HSV-SREBP-2 alone were incubated in the absence of sterols, the SREBP was cleaved, and the NH2-terminal segment was found in the nuclear extract (top panel,lane 2). The addition of sterols abolished cleavage and the nuclear segment disappeared (lanes 3–5). Expression of the truncated wild-type Xp-SCAP(TM1–6) did not affect SREBP cleavage in the absence of sterols (lane 6), but it prevented suppression of cleavage by sterols (lanes 7–9). When the Xp-SCAP(TM1–6) protein bore the Y298C mutation, it lost the ability to block sterol suppression (lanes 10–13). The bottom panel of Fig. 2 shows that the wild-type and Y298C-truncated SCAP proteins were expressed at equal levels in the cells. The experiment of Fig. 3 Ashows that the abolition of sterol suppression required the first six transmembrane helices of SCAP. Transfection of cDNAs encoding smaller segments that included transmembrane segments 1–5 failed to abolish sterol suppression (lanes 10 and 11). Suppression was abolished only when the construct contained transmembrane domains 1–6 (lanes 12 and 13). In the experiment of Fig. 3 B, we transfected cells with a cDNA encoding a truncated form of SCAP that extends from amino acids 1 to 1195. This construct encodes all eight transmembrane helices plus the bulk of the cytosolic WD-40 domain (see Fig. 1). However, it is truncated at a position that is 80 amino acids from the COOH terminus of the protein. Recent studies have shown that this truncated protein does not interact with SREBPs as determined by a failure of coimmunoprecipitation, nor does it restore SREBP cleavage to SCAP-deficient cells. 3A. Nohturfft, J. L. Goldstein, and M. S. Brown, unpublished observations.As seen before, when we transfected the cells with HSV-SREBP-2 alone, sterols suppressed cleavage (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–4). When we cotransfected SCAP(1–1195), sterol suppression was abolished (lanes 5–7). The effect of this truncated SCAP was eliminated when we deleted transmembrane helices 3–6 (lanes 8–10), supporting the idea that these transmembrane helices were required for this effect. The bottom panel of Fig.3 B shows that comparable amounts of the SCAP(1–1195) construct and the transmembrane 3–6 deletion were expressed in the cells. The membrane domain of SCAP contains three N-linked carbohydrate chains that are attached to loops that project into the ER lumen (see Fig. 1) (4Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP moves to the Golgi complex where the carbohydrates are processed by enzymes that render them resistant to digestion by endo H (8Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Scheek S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). When cells are grown in the presence of sterols, the SCAP·SREBP complex is trapped in the ER, and the N-linked sugars remain in their unprocessed, endo H-sensitive state. To detect the changes in electrophoretic mobility upon endo H treatment, we first treat intact membrane vesicles with trypsin to reduce the size of the glycosylated fragment thereby permitting clear discrimination between glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms (8Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Scheek S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One of the trypsin-resistant fragments contains two of the N-linked carbohydrate chains, and this fragment can be visualized by immunoblotting with an antibody against an epitope on this fragment (see Fig. 1). Fig. 4 shows an experiment designed to explore the glycosylation state of endogenous SCAP in cells that were transfected with cDNAs encoding truncated SCAP. This experiment was possible, because Xp-SCAP(TM1–6) does not contain the trypsin-resistant segment that is glycosylated, and it does not react with the antibody against the glycosylated epitope. Thus, the antibody specifically visualizes the trypsin-resistant fragment from endogenous SCAP. When the cells were transfected only with HSV-SREBP-2 and incubated in the absence of sterols, the trypsin-resistant SCAP fragment retained either one or two N-linked carbohydrate chains after treatment with endo H, indicating that the molecules were largely endo H-resistant (Fig. 4, lane 2). When the cells were incubated in the presence of sterols, the N-linked sugars on SCAP were sensitive to endo H digestion, and the digested protein migrated at a position corresponding to zero sugar chains (lane 3). When we cotransfected the cDNA encoding Xp-SCAP(TM1–6), there was no effect on endogenous SCAP in the absence of sterols (lane 4). However, in the presence of sterols the SCAP molecules remained endo H-resistant (lane 5), indicating that some of the endogenous SCAP continued to traffic to the Golgi complex. When Xp-SCAP(TM1–6) contained the Y298C mutation, it had no effect on the behavior of endogenous SCAP either in the absence or presence of sterols (compare lanes 6 and 7with lanes 2 and 3). This experiment demonstrates that the wild-type SCAP(TM 1–6) segment prevents sterols from blocking the movement of endogenous SCAP from ER to Golgi. The results of Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 support the hypothesis that the SCAP(TM 1–6) segment interacts with a putative protein that retains endogenous SCAP in the ER in the presence of sterols. This interaction displaces the endogenous SCAP·SREBP complex from the retaining protein, thereby allowing it to travel to the Golgi even in the presence of sterols. The experiment of Fig. 5 was conducted to determine whether functional SCAP activity could be reconstituted in SCAP-deficient cells by coexpression of SCAP(TM1–6) (residues 1–448) plus a second cDNA encoding the remainder of the protein (residues 449–1276). When the cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding wild-type SREBP-2 in the absence of SCAP, there was no processing to the nuclear form (upper panel, lane 2). Transfection of the SCAP(449–1276) segment did not restore cleavage (lane 3), nor did transfection of a cDNA encoding the NH2-terminal segment with either the wild-type sequence (lane 4) or the Y298C mutation (lane 5). Cleavage was restored only when we expressed SCAP(449–1276) together with SCAP(1–448) containing either the wild-type sequence (lane 6) or the Y298C mutation (lane 7). The specificity of this effect was documented by the demonstration that no combination of SCAP segments could achieve cleavage of the R519A mutant of SREBP-2, which is not recognized by Site-1 protease (lanes 8–13) (9Sakai J.

Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The two bottom panels of Fig. 5 show that the various segments of SCAP were expressed in the transfected cells as determined by immunoblotting with the anti-Xp, which recognizes the NH2-terminal segment, or anti-SCAP, which recognizes the COOH-terminal segment. The positive result in Fig. 5 suggests that the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments of SCAP are able to interact so as to restore SCAP activity even though they are expressed as separate proteins. To study this interaction directly, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 6). SCAP-deficient SRD-13A cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the COOH-terminal segment of SCAP(449–1276) together with the NH2-terminal segment () containing either the wild-type or Y298C sequence. Membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Xp, which recognizes only the NH2-terminal segment. The supernatant and pellet fractions from the immunoprecipitations were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-Xp or with anti-SCAP, which detects the COOH-terminal segment. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6, a fraction of the COOH-terminal segment was found in the pellet after precipitation with the antibody against the NH2-terminal segment (lanes 3–6), indicating that these two segments were physically associated. The coimmunoprecipitation was the same in the absence and presence of sterols. If the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal segments of SCAP can physically interact when transfected into cells, then they should be able to restore the growth of SCAP-deficient SRD-13 cells, which are auxotrophic for cholesterol (11Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The experiment of Fig.7, in which SRD-13 cells were transfected with various SCAP segments and grown for 14 days in the absence of cholesterol, indicates that this was indeed the case. The current experiments demonstrate that overexpression of a portion of the transmembrane domain of SCAP (transmembrane helices 1–6) abolishes the ability of sterols to cause the retention of the SCAP·SREBP complex in the ER. Instead, the SCAP·SREBP complex moves to the Golgi complex where the carbohydrates of SCAP are processed to an endo H-resistant form and where SREBP is cleaved by the Site-1 and Site-2 proteases to liberate the transcriptionally active NH2-terminal segment. When the SCAP(TM1–6) segment contains the Y298C mutation, its ability to block sterol repression of SCAP·SREBP movement is markedly reduced. The simplest hypothesis to explain these results postulates that the SCAP(TM1–6) segment competes with the endogenous SCAP·SREBP complex for binding to a protein that retains the complex in the ER in the presence of sterols. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the Y298C mutation in the SCAP(TM1–6) segment abolishes this effect. The Y298C mutation in full-length SCAP has already been shown to render the protein unresponsive to sterols (12Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, SCAP(TM1–6)/Y298C does not compete for the retention protein either because tyrosine 298 of SCAP is essential to bind sterols, which in turn triggers binding to the retention protein, or, alternatively, SCAP(TM1–6)/Y298C may continue to bind sterols, but it cannot bind to the retention protein. Either of these mechanisms would explain the failure of SCAP/Y298C to be regulated by sterols as well as the finding that SCAP(TM1–6)/Y298C does not compete with endogenous SCAP·SREBP for the retention protein in the presence of sterols. SCAP(TM1–6) includes the sterol-sensing domain (TM2–6) that is shared with three other proteins (reviewed in Ref. 13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). It will be important to learn whether the sterol-sensing domains in these proteins interact with the same protein that retains SCAP and whether SCAP(TM1–6) will interfere with the actions of these proteins. One of these proteins is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis that is bound to ER membranes (14Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Sterols accelerate the degradation of this enzyme in an action that requires the sterol-sensing domain (18Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19Kumagai H. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19107-19113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We are currently conducting experiments to determine whether overexpression of SCAP(TM1–6) will interfere with the ability of sterols to accelerate the degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Another important finding in these studies is that the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of SCAP, expressed separately, can reconstitute the SREBP transport function of SCAP in SCAP-deficient hamster cells. This reconstitution was apparently attributable to the ability of these two segments to form a complex that was susceptible to coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 6). The COOH-terminal segment that we employed contains three distinct regions: 1) TM segments 7 and 8; 2) the large intraluminal loop that connects these segments; and 3) the cytoplasmic WD-repeat domains. One or more of these regions must be capable of binding to the TM1–6 segment, thereby restoring the function of SCAP. If the proposed mechanism of SCAP(TM1–6) activity is correct, this protein segment should provide a powerful tool for isolating the postulated ER retention protein with which it interacts.

https://openalex.org/W2051802466,"In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding an enzyme that exhibits catalytic characteristics of a 3(α→β)-hydroxysteroid epimerase (3(α→β)-HSE). The enzyme overexpressed in human 293 embryonic kidney cells transforms androsterone into epi-androsterone in two steps: the oxidation of androsterone to 5α-androstane-3,17-dione, followed by the reduction of the latter to epi-androsterone. The reverse reaction, 3(β→α)-hydroxysteroid epimeration, is approximately 10-fold weaker. These results are confirmed by Vmax/Kmdetermination, which shows that the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of androsterone to 5α-androstane-3,17-dione and the reduction of 5α-androstane-3,17-dione to epi-androsterone more efficiently than the reverse reactions. The selective catalysis of the reaction following the 3(α→β) direction is also observed in intact transfected cells in culture, which better reflect physiological conditions. In vitro assays reveal that the recombinant enzyme prefers NAD+ and NADH as cofactors and could recognize both C-19 and C-21 3α-hydroxysteroids as substrates. DNA sequence analysis predicts a protein of 317 amino acids. Tissue distribution analysis using RT-PCR reveals that the mRNA of the enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including liver, brain, prostate, adrenal, and uterus, with the most abundant expression in the liver. Because active hydroxysteroids generally exert their effect in a stereo-specific manner, 3(α→β)-HSE could thus potentially play an important role in regulating the biological activities of various steroids.

One of the best known human epimerases is the human UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2), which catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose into UDP-galactose and has been found to be associated with the disease called galactosemia (5Daude N.

Lindlau M. Breuer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The activity that transforms 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-diol) into its 3β-epimer in the rat ovary was also reported, although it was speculated that the conversion was due to the combined actions of 3α-HSD and 3β-HSD1 (10Eckstein B. Springer C. Endocrinology. 1970; 89: 347-352Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An ecdysone 3-epimerase from the midgut of Manduca sexta (L.) was partially purified and was shown to act on position 3 to yield the 3-epimer of ecdysone (11Mayer R. Durrant J.L. Holman G.M. Weirich G.F. Svoboda J.A. Steroids. 1979; 34: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, epimeric conversion of corticosteroids has also been documented for both human and hamster liver preparations (12Monder C. Martin K.O. Bogumil J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7192-7198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the past few decades have seen rapid progress in the area of steroidogenesis at the molecular level, few reports can be found in recent literature on the cloning and characterization of steroid epimerases.The biological activity of steroid hormones and their metabolites is often associated with the stereo conformation of the molecule. A well documented example of this is the neuroactive steroid 5α-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one (allo-pregnanolone), one of the most abundant naturally occurring neuroactive steroids. It has been reported that this neurosteroid can play a role in the modulation of the reproductive function by suppressing the release of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone in female rats (13Genazzani A.R. Palumbo M.A. de Micheroux A.A. Artini P.G. Criscuolo M. Ficarra G. Guo A.-L. Benelli A. Petraglia F. Purdy R.H. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 133: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, a recent report has demonstrated that its 3β-epimer, 5α-pregnane-3β-ol-20-one (iso-pregnanolone), is ineffective in regulating the hypothalamic activities (14Calogero A.E. Palumbo M.A. Bosboom A.M.J. Burrello N. Ferrara E. Palumbo G. Petraglia F. D'Agata R. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recent findings have also suggested that this molecule might be, at least in part, responsible for the premenstrual syndrome (15Smith S.S. Gong G.H. Hsu F.-C. Markowitz R.S. French-Mullen J.M.H. Li X. Nature. 1998; 392: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Another example of inactivation of steroids via carbon-3 (C-3) epimeration is that of the secosteroid hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which, when converted to 1α,25-epi-dihydroxyvitamin D3, becomes biologically much less active (16Siu-Caldera M.-L. Sekemoto H. Brem A.S. Bina R.B. Reddy G.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 23: S426Google Scholar, 17Siu-Caldera M.-L. Sekemoto H. Weiskopf A. Vouros P. Muralidharan K.R. Okamura W.H. Bishop J. Norman A.W. Uskokovic M.R. Schuster I. Reddy G.S. Bone ( NY ). 1999; 24: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These examples illustrate well the importance of C-3 epimeration in regulating the biological activities of steroid hormones.In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of a human cDNA encoding a 3(α→β)-hydroxysteroid epimerase (3(α→β)-HSE), which catalyzes the transformation of C-19 and C-21 steroids. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization of a mammalian 3(α→β)-HSE reported to date.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding an enzyme possessing 3(α→β)-HSE activity. Our results clearly indicate that the epimeration reaction is the result of catalysis by a single enzyme possessing both oxidative and reductive activities. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the overall reaction is composed of two steps, the oxidation of a 3α-hydroxy group to a 3-keto group, followed by the reduction of this 3-keto group into a 3β-hydroxy group. The 3-ketosteroid conformation is thus an intermediate in the 3(α→β)-hydroxysteroid epimeration. To our knowledge, this is also the first observation of an enzyme possessing stereo-selectivity for the oxidative and reductive reactions. Except for the 17 amino acids located from positions 158–174, and 2 amino acid substitutions at positions 63 and 105 (E63D and G105R) (Fig. 2), the sequence of our clone is identical to that of the RoDH-like human oxidative 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, previously reported by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It is interesting to observe that the deletion and insertion of a G, respectively, at positions 467 and 520 relative to ATG in the sequence reported by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), will transform these 17 different amino acid residues into the ones reported here.To further understand the effect of these differences on the activity of the enzyme and to compare the epimerase activity reported here with the RoDH-like oxidative 3α-HSD activity reported by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we performed site-directed mutagenesis and examined the activities of each as described in Table II. The E63D substitution, which does not affect 3(α→β) activity, is probably due to polymorphism. On the other hand, because the enzyme described by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) is an active one, the G105R substitution and the differing 17 amino acid residues (resulting from the deletion and the insertion of a G at positions 467 and 520, respectively) can probably be explained by sequencing errors. Further evidence that the sequence described by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) contains sequencing errors is a sequence submitted by Kedishvilli to GenBank™ under the accession number AF016509. This sequence is almost identical to ours except for two nucleotides located at positions 18 and 133 downstream from the ATG initiation codon. These changes do not alter the amino acid sequence. In addition, this sequence is probably obtained by PCR amplification, because it does not contain the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region. Therefore, the possibility that the difference of two nucleotides is due to amplification error is not to be excluded. Under the experimental conditions described by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), when the period of incubation is very short, only one reaction can be detected and the direction of this reaction is determined by the added cofactor. Although this is a regular procedure used to analyze enzyme activities in vitro, it is not suitable for this particular enzyme, which catalyzes both the oxidative and the reductive reactions in a stereo-selective manner. This explains why these authors failed to associate both activities into one epimeration reaction. Although anin vitro assay using purified enzyme or preparations of subcellular fractions is a common procedure for performing kinetic or ligand binding studies, we believe that transfected intact cells are more suitable to characterize enzyme activities in living cells, especially for oxidoreductases. This way, the preferred reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, either oxidation or reduction, can be clearly identified (29Luu-The V. Zhang Y. Poirier D. Labrie F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and unstable or labile enzymes can be studied with certainty (19Dufort I. Rheault R. Huang X.-F. Soucy P. Luu-The V. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the present study, using intact transfected cells in culture without the addition of exogenous cofactors, a system which better reflects the actual physiological conditions, we demonstrated clearly that 3(α→β)-HSE possesses an epimerase activity capable of converting a 3α-hydroxysteroid into its 3β-hydroxy epimer (Fig.5). This is further confirmed by in vitro assays in the presence of both NAD+ and NADH as cofactors (Fig. 4).The physiological significance of the conversion of 3α-hydroxysteroid by the epimerase has been demonstrated by recent findings regarding the differential biological activities of some stereoisomers of steroids. In fact, 3α-diol and 3β-diol have long been considered as breakdown products of androgens. However, recent studies provided evidence that 3α-diol, but not its 3β-epimer, might be an active hormone required for parturition in the rat (31Mahendroo M.S. Cala K.M. Russell D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore,allo-pregnanolone, readily formed from progesterone in the brain, is one of the most potent neuroactive steroids. It can suppress the release of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone via the γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor, whereas its 3β-epimer does not exert the same effect (14Calogero A.E. Palumbo M.A. Bosboom A.M.J. Burrello N. Ferrara E. Palumbo G. Petraglia F. D'Agata R. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Allo-pregnanolone is strongly suspected of being involved in the premenstrual syndrome (15Smith S.S. Gong G.H. Hsu F.-C. Markowitz R.S. French-Mullen J.M.H. Li X. Nature. 1998; 392: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The conversion of 3α-diol and allo-pregnanolone into their respective 3β-isomers by 3(α→β)-HSE could inactivate these molecules. The detection of expression of the epimerase transcript in the brain provides evidence for the possible involvement of the epimerase in the regulation of allo-pregnanolone levels and, therefore, the possible implication of the epimerase in regulating hormonal changes in the brain. Epimeration reactions have been shown to play important roles in both bacterial and mammalian systems (1Meier-Dieter U. Starman R. Barr K. Mayer H. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13490-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Keppler O.T. Hinderlich S. Langner J. Schwartz-Albliez R. Reutter W. Pawlita M. Science. 1999; 284: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the most studied epimerases are nucleotide-sugar epimerases of bacterial or fungal origin (2Keppler O.T.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 57-72Google Scholar). Only a few human epimerases have been characterized at the molecular level. One of the best known human epimerases is the human UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2), which catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose into UDP-galactose and has been found to be associated with the disease called galactosemia (5Daude N.

Genet. 1999; 64: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The first report of a hydroxysteroid epimerase activity in animal systems was made several decades ago: a 16-epimerase acting on estriol and 16-epi-estriol in the human placenta was documented in 1968 (9Dahm K. Lindlau M. Breuer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The activity that transforms 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-diol) into its 3β-epimer in the rat ovary was also reported, although it was speculated that the conversion was due to the combined actions of 3α-HSD and 3β-HSD1 (10Eckstein B. Springer C. Endocrinology. 1970; 89: 347-352Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An ecdysone 3-epimerase from the midgut of Manduca sexta (L.) was partially purified and was shown to act on position 3 to yield the 3-epimer of ecdysone (11Mayer R. Durrant J.L. Holman G.M. Weirich G.F. Svoboda J.A. Steroids. 1979; 34: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, epimeric conversion of corticosteroids has also been documented for both human and hamster liver preparations (12Monder C. Martin K.O. Bogumil J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7192-7198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the past few decades have seen rapid progress in the area of steroidogenesis at the molecular level, few reports can be found in recent literature on the cloning and characterization of steroid epimerases. The biological activity of steroid hormones and their metabolites is often associated with the stereo conformation of the molecule. A well documented example of this is the neuroactive steroid 5α-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one (allo-pregnanolone), one of the most abundant naturally occurring neuroactive steroids. It has been reported that this neurosteroid can play a role in the modulation of the reproductive function by suppressing the release of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone in female rats (13Genazzani A.R. Palumbo M.A. de Micheroux A.A. Artini P.G. Criscuolo M. Ficarra G. Guo A.-L. Benelli A. Petraglia F. Purdy R.H. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 133: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, a recent report has demonstrated that its 3β-epimer, 5α-pregnane-3β-ol-20-one (iso-pregnanolone), is ineffective in regulating the hypothalamic activities (14Calogero A.E. Palumbo M.A. Bosboom A.M.J. Burrello N. Ferrara E. Palumbo G. Petraglia F. D'Agata R. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recent findings have also suggested that this molecule might be, at least in part, responsible for the premenstrual syndrome (15Smith S.S. Gong G.H. Hsu F.-C. Markowitz R.S. French-Mullen J.M.H. Li X. Nature. 1998; 392: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Another example of inactivation of steroids via carbon-3 (C-3) epimeration is that of the secosteroid hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which, when converted to 1α,25-epi-dihydroxyvitamin D3, becomes biologically much less active (16Siu-Caldera M.-L. Sekemoto H. Brem A.S. Bina R.B. Reddy G.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 23: S426Google Scholar, 17Siu-Caldera M.-L. Sekemoto H. Weiskopf A. Vouros P. Muralidharan K.R. Okamura W.H. Bishop J. Norman A.W. Uskokovic M.R. Schuster I. Reddy G.S. Bone ( NY ). 1999; 24: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These examples illustrate well the importance of C-3 epimeration in regulating the biological activities of steroid hormones. In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of a human cDNA encoding a 3(α→β)-hydroxysteroid epimerase (3(α→β)-HSE), which catalyzes the transformation of C-19 and C-21 steroids. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization of a mammalian 3(α→β)-HSE reported to date. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding an enzyme possessing 3(α→β)-HSE activity. Our results clearly indicate that the epimeration reaction is the result of catalysis by a single enzyme possessing both oxidative and reductive activities. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the overall reaction is composed of two steps, the oxidation of a 3α-hydroxy group to a 3-keto group, followed by the reduction of this 3-keto group into a 3β-hydroxy group. The 3-ketosteroid conformation is thus an intermediate in the 3(α→β)-hydroxysteroid epimeration. To our knowledge, this is also the first observation of an enzyme possessing stereo-selectivity for the oxidative and reductive reactions. Except for the 17 amino acids located from positions 158–174, and 2 amino acid substitutions at positions 63 and 105 (E63D and G105R) (Fig. 2), the sequence of our clone is identical to that of the RoDH-like human oxidative 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, previously reported by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It is interesting to observe that the deletion and insertion of a G, respectively, at positions 467 and 520 relative to ATG in the sequence reported by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), will transform these 17 different amino acid residues into the ones reported here.To further understand the effect of these differences on the activity of the enzyme and to compare the epimerase activity reported here with the RoDH-like oxidative 3α-HSD activity reported by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we performed site-directed mutagenesis and examined the activities of each as described in Table II. The E63D substitution, which does not affect 3(α→β) activity, is probably due to polymorphism. On the other hand, because the enzyme described by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) is an active one, the G105R substitution and the differing 17 amino acid residues (resulting from the deletion and the insertion of a G at positions 467 and 520, respectively) can probably be explained by sequencing errors. Further evidence that the sequence described by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) contains sequencing errors is a sequence submitted by Kedishvilli to GenBank™ under the accession number AF016509. This sequence is almost identical to ours except for two nucleotides located at positions 18 and 133 downstream from the ATG initiation codon. These changes do not alter the amino acid sequence. In addition, this sequence is probably obtained by PCR amplification, because it does not contain the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region. Therefore, the possibility that the difference of two nucleotides is due to amplification error is not to be excluded. Under the experimental conditions described by Biswas and Russell (21Biswas M.G. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), when the period of incubation is very short, only one reaction can be detected and the direction of this reaction is determined by the added cofactor. Although this is a regular procedure used to analyze enzyme activities in vitro, it is not suitable for this particular enzyme, which catalyzes both the oxidative and the reductive reactions in a stereo-selective manner. This explains why these authors failed to associate both activities into one epimeration reaction.

These proteins, although they have high sequence homology, show distinct developmental expression patterns. The function(s) of each small heat shock protein is unknown. DmHsp22 is shown to localize in mitochondria both in D. melanogaster S2 cells and after heterologous expression in mammalian cells. Fractionation of mitochondria indicates that DmHsp22 resides in the mitochondrial matrix, where it is found in oligomeric complexes, as shown by sedimentation and gel filtration analysis and by cross-linking experiments. Deletion analysis using a DmHsp22-EGFP construct reveals that residues 1–17 and an unknown number of residues between 17–28 are necessary for import. Site-directed mutagenesis within a putative mitochondrial motif (WRMAEE) at positions 8–13 shows that the first four residues are necessary for mitochondrial localization. Immunoprecipitation results indicate that there is no interaction between DmHsp22 and the other small heat shock proteins.

Members of the Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp60 families have been shown to act as molecular chaperones in protein folding or refolding following aggregation, and some assist protein translocation through a number of cellular membrane systems. Their chaperone activities are ATP-dependent, and the process is often assisted by co-chaperones. The sHsps comprise a more diverse and less conserved group of proteins, the number and sequences of which vary between and within species. They share a common structural domain in their C termini that shows high homology to the αA- and αB-crystallins (1de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A. Voorter C.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence for a chaperone-like activity of some sHsps in vitro, where they have been shown to interact with nonnative proteins in an ATP-independent manner (2Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ehrnsperger M. Buchner J. Gaestel M. Fink A. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins.

However, sHsps seem to be rather inefficient chaperones, and they have been suggested to act as reservoirs of nonnative refoldable proteins, which can be refolded in collaboration with other chaperones, such as Hsp70 (6Ehrnsperger M.

Hickey E. Weber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of human Hsp27 could protect cells from the adverse effects of heat, a phenomenon referred to as thermotolerance. One of the sHsps of Drosophila melanogaster, DmHsp27, also conferred thermal resistance in the same assay (9Rollet E. Lavoie J.N. Landry J. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Res. 1983; 147: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showing that induction of the Drosophila sHsps by the molting hormone ecdysone was sufficient to confer a thermostable phenotype to fruit flies. The cellular mechanisms by which these sHsps protect cellsin vivo remain debated. Hamster Hsp27 has been proposed to protect the actin cytoskeletal network making it more resistant to disruption by stress (11Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Webber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Mehlen et al. (13Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Préville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) suggested that sHsps protected cells through modulation of their glutathione levels. Although the chaperone-like activity of sHsps in vitro has been proposed to protect cells by helping the refolding of unfolded proteins in cooperation with other cellular chaperones (2Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), evidence for a chaperone activity in vivo is still lacking. Although the role of sHsps in stress tolerance attracted attention for many years, there are other studies suggesting that these proteins may have other function(s) in vivo within unstressed cells. In addition to their action on microfilament organization in avian and mammalian cells (11Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), sHsps have been reported to modulate apoptosis mediated by the Fas/Apo1 death receptor (15Arrigo A.P. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar) and to be involved in cell growth and differentiation (16Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Godet J. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31657-31665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, sHsps have been shown to be individually expressed in a tissue-, cell-, and development-specific manner (see Refs. 17Arrigo A.P. Tanguay R.M. Hightower L. Nover L. Heat Shock and Development. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 106-119Google Scholar and 18Michaud S. Marin R. Tanguay R.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar for reviews). In this organism, there are four main sHsps (DmHsp22, DmHsp23, DmHsp26, and DmHsp27), the genes of which are localized in a cluster of seven heat-inducible genes at locus 67B (19Aymé A. Tissières A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2949-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These fours sHsps show sequence homology in the α-crystallin-like domain of ∼100 amino acids at the C terminus. At the N terminus, there is a hydrophobic region of 15 amino acids common to three sHsps but absent from DmHsp22 (20Ingolia T. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 21Southgate R. Aymé A. Voellmy R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Why there are four distinct albeit highly structurally similar sHsps in this organism is unknown. Studies of sHsp expression during embryogenesis in D. melanogaster have shown that each member of this family is expressed in a cell-specific and developmental stage-specific manner and that this pattern of expression is uncoordinated in contrast to the heat shock situation when all sHsps are coordinately induced (22Pauli D. Tonka C.H. Tissières A. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 817-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Marin R. Valet J.P. Tanguay R.M. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Marin R. Tanguay R.M. Chromosoma. 1996; 105: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Michaud S. Marin R. Westwook J.T. Tanguay R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like that of the other three sHsps, DmHsp22 expression is developmentally regulated. Hsp22 mRNA reaches a peak in late third instar larvae and disappears in early pupae, whereas the other sHsps are expressed during pupation and in young flies (26Mason P. Hall L. Gausz J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 194: 73-78Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Sirotkin K. Davidson N. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Dubrovsky E. Dretzen G. Bellard M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DmHsp22 was recently reported to be the most abundantly expressed heat shock protein in aging D. melanogaster (29Wheeler J. Bieschke E. Tower J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10408-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30King V. Tower J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In young adults, low amounts of DmHsp22 mRNA are found in the thorax. In aged flies, the level of DmHsp22 expressed in the head is higher than that found after a heat shock treatment (30King V. Tower J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that DmHsp27 localizes mainly to the nucleus in cultured cells (31Beaulieu J.F. Arrigo A.P. Tanguay R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 29-36PubMed Google Scholar) and in female and male gonads (24Marin R. Tanguay R.M. Chromosoma. 1996; 105: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Michaud S. Marin R. Westwook J.T. Tanguay R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DmHsp26 and DmHsp23 are both localized in the cytosol, where they can form large multimeric complexes. Little is known about the localization, the native state, and the function(s) of the smallest member of this family, DmHsp22. Here, we report that DmHsp22 is a mitochondrial protein that localizes to the mitochondrial matrix. Using deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the first 28 amino acids at the N terminus end and, in particular, the first four residues WRMA of the motif WRMAEE at positions 8–13 are important for intramitochondrial localization. Sedimentation and gel filtration data along with cross-linking experiments provide evidence that this small mitochondrial Hsp is present as an oligomer within this organelle. The lung Chinese hamster cell line CCL39 was transfected with pRcCMV-Hsp22 (pRcCMV; Invitrogen) containing the full-length Hsp22 cDNA from D. melanogaster. A stable cell line (CCL39–22C5), expressing DmHsp22, was grown in special Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Immunocorp Sciences), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 4 μg/ml Geneticin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.) for plasmid selection. CV1, HeLa, or COSm6 cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells in exponential growth were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostic), LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), or Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Schneider cell line 2 (S2 cells) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1963) and was grown in suspension at 25 °C as described previously (32Joanisse D.R. Inaguma Y. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For heat shock, S2 cells were incubated at 35 °C for 1 h and allowed to recover for 2 to 12 h at 25 °C. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed using standard methods. Briefly, cells grown on plastic or cover glasses were fixed for 20 min in ice-cold methanol (S2, CV1, and CCL39) or in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4·H2O, 1.5 mmKH2PO4) for 20 min at room temperature (COSm6) and processed for immunofluorescence staining. Antibodies against DmHsp22 were produced in rabbits by immunization using a bacterial DmHsp22 fusion protein in the pET3 vector (Novagen). The primary antibodies used were the anti-DmHsp22 (diluted 1:1,000) or mouse monoclonal antibodies against cytochrome oxidase (diluted 1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or against cytochrome c (diluted 1:25, Pharmingen). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Alexa-, or Texas Red-conjugated goat secondary antibodies against mouse or rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) were used. Cells were examined on a fluorescence microscope (LEITZ DMR) or on a laser scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview, Olympus). Mitochondria were isolated from cells essentially as described by Enrı́quez and Attardi (33Enrı́quez J. Attardi G. Attardi G. Chomyn A. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 183-196Google Scholar) with two extra washes of mitochondria. Briefly, cell membranes were lysed by hypotonic shock (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, KCl 10 mm, 0.15 mm MgCl2), sucrose was added (final concentration, 0.25 m), and mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. After removing nuclei, mitochondria were pelleted at 8100 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Isolated mitochondria from CCL39–22C5 cells were digested with trypsin as described by McMullin and Hallberg (34McMullin T. Hallberg R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both the pellet and the released proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Two different mitochondrial fractionation methods were used to localize DmHsp22. In the first, pelleted mitochondria from CCL39–22C5 cells were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 to yield a mitochondrial soluble fraction (matrix and soluble mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) material) and an insoluble membrane fraction comprising both the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) and the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM). Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in four pellet volumes of lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The solution was centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed of a IEC/Micro Max centrifuge. All steps were done at 4 °C. The second technique used digitonin for mitochondrial fractionation to separate the mitoplasts (matrix and MIM) from the combined MOM and IMS fractions (35Schnaitman C. Erwin V. Greenawalt J. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 719-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 36Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer and separated on 12 or 18% SDS-PAGE gels as described (23Marin R. Valet J.P. Tanguay R.M. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with the rabbit anti-DmHsp22 (antibody 36, diluted 1:10,000), an anti-cytochrome c (diluted 1:250, Pharmingen), an anti-cytochrome oxidase (diluted 1:2500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a rabbit anti-TOM20 (diluted 1:5000, a gift from Dr. J. N. Lavoie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec), or an anti-Hsp60 (diluted 1:10,000 (37Laplante A.F. Moulin V. Auger F.A. Landry J. Hui L. Morrow G. Tanguay R.M. Germain L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)). Anti-rabbit or mouse peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used with chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations (BM chemiluminescence, Roche Diagnostics). DmHsp22 was fused with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in two constructs. pEGFP-Hsp22(1–174) contains the entire DmHsp22 coding sequence fused at the C terminus of EGFP. The DmHsp22 cDNA in pRcCMV-Hsp22 was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) at the corresponding sites. In pHsp22(1–174)-EGFP, the DmHsp22 coding sequence is located at the N terminus of EGFP. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI andBamHI and inserted into pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) at the corresponding sites. Deletion mutants were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification using pHsp22(1–174)-EGFP or pRcCMV-Hsp22 as a template. Using combinations of primers, regions corresponding to the nucleotides 1–51, 1–86, and 16–173 were prepared and ligated to the pEGFP-N1 plasmid as described above. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the WRMAEE region was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on the pHsp22(1–174)-EGFP plasmid. Each mutated insert was sequenced. The deleted or mutated constructs were transfected in COSm6 or CV1 cells respectively. 24 h posttransfection, the expressed mutated proteins were visualized by EGFP fluorescence or by indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-DmHsp22. The native state of DmHsp22 was determined by density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration. Cell extracts were prepared from heat-shocked S2 (1 h at 35 °C + 2 h recovery at 25 °C) or from CCL39–22C5. S2 cells were washed twice in hybridoma phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4.7H2O, 5 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 0.2% dextrose, 0.001% phenol red) and twice in wash buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (see Isolation and Fractionation of Mitochondria) at a final concentration of 50 × 106 cells/ml. The suspension was vortexed for 9 min and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant applied to the top of the gradient. For CCL39–22C5 cells, a mitochondrial fraction was first prepared as described above. Mitochondria were lysed in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the soluble extract applied to the gradient. Sucrose was diluted in isolation buffer (200 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) to final concentrations of 10 and 40%. Gradients (12 ml) were made in Sorval TH641 ultracentrifuge tubes with a Biocomp Gradient Master 105 settled at 81.5° for 108 s at speed 17 and allowed to cool down at 4 °C. After a 39,600 rpm ultracentrifugation (Beckman, L8–70M) of 22 h at 4 °C, fractions of nine drops were collected from the bottom of the gradient, and refraction indexes measured on an Erma refractometer (Optical Works). Gel filtration was performed on Sepharose CL-6B columns as described (38Préville X. Schultz H. Knauf U. Gaestel M. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Proteins from 2.5-ml fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%), incubated for 15 min at 40 °C, and washed in 5% trichloroacetic acid and in 99% ice-cold acetone. Dried pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Sedimentation constants calculations were done as described by McEwen (39McEwen C. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 114-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was performed on Nonidet P-40 soluble fraction of CCL39–22C5 mitochondria by varying the amount of freshly prepared glutaraldehyde added to the samples as described by Lambert et al. (40Lambert H. Charette S. Bernier A. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Samples were run on a 10% SDS gel (41Thomas J. Kornberg R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Cross-linked DmHsp22 species were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-DmHsp22 antibody. Immunoprecipitations were done as described by Faure et al. (42Faure R. Vincent M. Dufour M. Shaver A. Posner B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 389-401Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) on a soluble extract from S2 cells. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates and the corresponding supernatants were analyzed on SDS gels. Antibodies used for the experiments were two polyclonal anti-DmHsp22 antibodies (antibodies 36 and 798) and an unrelated antibody. Polyclonal antibodies raised against DmHsp22 were specific for this sHsp, as shown by immunoblot of heat-shocked S2 cells and of the CCL39–22C5 clone expressing DmHsp22 (Fig.1, CCL) and do not recognize the other sHsps of Drosophila (Fig. 5 A). To determine the pattern of expression of DmHsp22 and its stability in cells following heat shock, S2 cells were shocked 1 h at 35 °C and allowed to recover at 25 °C for 2 to 12 h. Immunoblot analysis reveals that DmHsp22 expression began rapidly following heat shock, reaching a maximum after 6 h of recovery (Fig. 1). The level of DmHsp22 then decreased, but it was still present after 12 h.Figure 5Hsp22 is present as an oligomer in vivo. A, left, Western blot of immunoprecipitates with anti-DmHsp22 antibodies. S2 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using two different DmHsp22 antiseras (antibodies 36 and 798) and an unrelated serum.

A Nonidet P-40 soluble extract of heat-shocked S2 cells (top) was layered on a 10–40% sucrose and fractions immunoblotted with an anti-DmHsp22. The Nonidet P-40 soluble fraction of isolated CCL39–22C5 mitochondria (bottom) was analyzed as above. S, soluble cell extract; P, Nonidet P-40 insoluble mitochondrial fraction. C, cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Mitochondria from CCL39–22C5 cells were isolated and lysed in Nonidet P-40. Aliquots were cross-linked with increasing glutaraldehyde concentrations. Samples were analyzed on 10% SDS gels, and cross-linked species were revealed by Western blot with an anti-DmHsp22 antibody. D, Western blot analysis of gel filtration fractions. HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the full-length DmHsp22 (pRcCMV-Hsp22). The lysed cell extract was loaded on a Sepharose CL-6B column, and fractions were analyzed on SDS gels by immunoblotting using an anti-DmHsp22.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Staining of heat-shocked S2 cells with the anti-DmHsp22 shows a cytoplasmic labeling with a punctate appearance. This pattern is similar to that seen when cells are stained with Mito Tracker Red (CM-H2XRos) or with the mitochondrial vital stain rhodamine 123 (data not shown). Fixed cells were doubly stained for DmHsp22 and mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome c (S2), or cytochrome oxidase (CCL39–22C5). In S2 cells, the cytoplasmic dot-like structures were labeled by both antibodies (Fig.2 A, a–c), and merging of the two pictures reveals an exact colocalization of the two proteins. In the CCL39–22C5 clone, DmHsp22 shows a localization identical to that of cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 2 A, d–f). The mitochondrial localization of DmHsp22 is observed in different transfected mammalian cell lines (HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary, data not shown). These results indicate that DmHsp22 is a mitochondrial protein and that the signals involved in its localization are recognized in mammalian cells. To investigate whether DmHsp22 is located at the mitochondrion outer face (exposed to cytosol), mitochondria isolated from CCL39–22C5 cells were incubated with trypsin in the absence or presence of SDS, which disrupts membranes. Immunoblotting was performed on proteins from the treated mitochondrial pellet and from the supernatant of each sample (Fig. 2 B). Lanes 1 and5 of Fig. 2 B show that DmHsp22 is found in the pellet of intact mitochondria. When mitochondrial membranes are broken down by SDS treatment, DmHsp22 is released in the supernatant (Fig.2 B, lanes 2 and 6). In intact mitochondria, DmHsp22 is protected from trypsin digestion (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), whereas it is degraded when the mitochondrial membranes are destroyed by SDS (lanes 4 and 8). Identical results were obtained using the S2 cells (data not shown). From this experiment, we conclude that DmHsp22 is located within mitochondria as it is not accessible to external proteases. The submitochondrial localization of DmHsp22 was next examined by means of two distinct fractionation methods (Fig. 2 C). First, mitochondria were treated with the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40, which breaks down mitochondrial membranes to release a soluble fraction (matrix and IMS) and an insoluble fraction (MIM and MOM) of membranes. The identity and purity of each submitochondrial fraction was monitored using antibodies against mitochondrial markers, Hsp60 (a matrix protein (34McMullin T. Hallberg R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)), cytochrome oxidase (MIM), cytochrome c (IMS), and TOM20 (MOM (Ref. 43Künkele K. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 44Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar)). In the Nonidet P-40 fractionation method, Hsp60 fractionates with the soluble fraction as expected for a matrix protein, whereas TOM20 is associated with the membrane insoluble fraction. From this fractionation, we conclude that the majority of DmHsp22 is localized in the mitochondrial Nonidet P-40 soluble fraction. To distinguish between a matrix or an IMS localization, a digitonin fractionation method was used in which digitonin solubilizes the outer membrane, leaving the inner membrane with the matrix intact (mitoplasts). The localization of TOM20 with mitoplasts likely indicates that TOM20 remained attached to the mitochondrial pore system, as this protein is a component of the channel between the inner and outer membranes. In this fractionation, DmHsp22 is largely located in the mitoplasts fraction (Fig.2 C). This result and the data from the Nonidet P-40 treatment are consistent with a localization of DmHsp22 in the mitochondrial matrix. Immunoblot or [35S]methionine labeling experiments performed in S2 cells failed to provide any evidence for a precursor form of DmHsp22 (data not shown). Deletion and mutational experiments were designed to identify sequences involved in the mitochondrial localization of this sHsp. To easily follow DmHsp22 in mammalian cells, DmHsp22 was fused either at the C or the N terminus of EGFP. Only the DmHsp22-EGFP construct showed a mitochondrial localization (compare Fig. 3,A–C), suggesting that the target signal of DmHsp22 is at its N terminus. To identify the motif involved in targeting, deletion mutants were generated on the DmHsp22-EGFP construct (Fig. 3,D–F). Fusion constructs with residues 1–58 (not shown) and 1–28 (Fig. 3 D) localized to mitochondria. Deleting amino acids 18–174 (1–17, Fig. 3 E) or the first five amino acids (6–58, Fig. 3 F) resulted in the lost of the mitochondrial localization. Mutants containing residues 10–58, 14–58, or 17–58 failed to localize to mitochondria (data not shown). These experiments indicate that the mitochondrial target signal of DmHsp22 is located at the N terminus. Residues 1–17 and others between 17 and 28 are necessary for import in the organelle. Analysis of DmHsp22 using the PSORT program (63Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) revealed an N terminus motif that might be implicated in its mitochondrial localization. The motif (WRMAEE) is located at amino acid residues 8–13 (Fig. 4 C). Each residue within this motif was substituted by mutagenesis, and the localization of the mutated proteins was monitored by EGFP fluorescence after transfection. Expression of DmHsp22-EGFP in CV1 c"

To define the mechanisms triggering the execution phase of apoptosis we developed and utilized a model in which culture of human neutrophils at 15 °C for 20 h arrested apoptosis and subsequent warming to 37 °C triggered a synchronous burst of apoptosis. Treatment of 15 °C cultured neutrophils with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk just before warming to 37 °C inhibited the morphological changes associated with apoptosis, but did not prevent the insertion of the proapoptotic protein Bax into mitochondria nor the inhibition of secretion and the externalization of phosphatidylserine, indices of neutrophil apoptosis. In both intact neutrophils and a cell-free extract, cytochrome c released from mitochondria induced proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3. At 15 °C the binding of Bax to mitochondria was uncoupled from Bax insertion into the mitochondrial membrane required for the release of cytochrome c. Apoptosis was also inhibited by low pH during warming to 37 °C, suggesting that changes to the conformation of Bax, necessary for membrane insertion, were being inhibited. Bax insertion was only sensitive to zVAD-fmk when added at the start of the 15 °C culture period, suggesting that a cytoplasmic substrate of the effector caspases may mediate in the mechanism of Bax insertion into mitochondria.

Bax insertion was only sensitive to zVAD-fmk when added at the start of the 15 °C culture period, suggesting that a cytoplasmic substrate of the effector caspases may mediate in the mechanism of Bax insertion into mitochondria. benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone apoptosis protease activating factor poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase fluorescein isothiocyanate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1,4-piperazinediethane sulfonic acid 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid terminal deoxynucleotydyl transferase (tdt)-mediated dUTP-FITC nick end labeling bovine serum albumin mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 seminaphthorhodafluor-1 Successful resolution of the inflammatory response requires that granulocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils, trigger an intracellular program for “silent” self-destruction called apoptosis (1Wyllie A.H.

If cell-death occurs by necrosis the cytotoxic cargo of granulocyte molecules is released, inducing tissue damage and chronic inflammation and stimulating the release of proinflammatory macrophage products to promote inflammation by other routes. The apoptotic program induces the morphological hallmarks of apoptosis, nuclear condensation and cell shrinkage, and shuts down the secretory potential of granulocytes (3Whyte M.K.B. Meagher L.C.

Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) has also been shown to induce the release of cytochrome c. The mechanism by which cytochrome c is translocated from mitochondria into the cytoplasm is controversial (41Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). However, once in the cytoplasm cytochrome c complexes with apoptosis-protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9 (26Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar) to form a protein complex the “apoptosome” (42Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). In the presence of dATP this complex induces the proteolytic cleavage and activation of procaspase-3 that triggers a downstream cascade of caspase activity (43Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H-G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). It has been reported that after differentiation and maturation neutrophils have a reduced number of phenotypically atypical mitochondria, obtaining ATP predominantly by glycolysis (10Moulding D.A. Quayle J.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 2495-2502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, whether mitochondria play a role in triggering neutrophil apoptosis remains to be established. Here we show that peripheral blood neutrophils cultured in vitro at 15 °C for 20 h failed to induce the execution phase of apoptosis until warmed to 37 °C, when they showed a synchronous burst of apoptosis. In temperature-arrested neutrophils endogenous Bax showed peripheral binding to mitochondria but failed to induce activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. On warming to 37 °C Bax inserted into the neutrophil membranes with concomitant proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3 and induction of apoptosis. In both intact neutrophils and cell-free neutrophil extracts we show that the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3 is induced by translocation of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Analysis of plasma membrane events showed that externalization of phosphatidylserine and the inhibition of secretion were uncoupled from the activation of caspase-3, when the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk)1 was added to 15 °C cultured neutrophils before warming them to 37 °C. Under these conditions the caspase inhibitor did not prevent Bax insertion into mitochondria when the cells were warmed from 15 to 37 °C. However, surprisingly, Bax insertion was inhibited if zVAD-fmk was added to neutrophils at the start of their incubation at 15 °C. This experimental model of apoptosis has provided insights into the molecular mechanisms that trigger the execution phase of neutrophil apoptosis. Neutrophils were purified on gradients of Percoll™ from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Bucks, United Kingdom) (44Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J.

Culture at 15 °C was in growth medium containing: 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7, 0.2% (w/v) endotoxin-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. BSA and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Neutrophil preparations were 98% pure with <2% eosinophil contamination (16Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G. Fujihara S. Farrow S.N. Haslett C.

Neutrophils (5 × 104 cells) in 100 μl of Hank's buffered saline, supplemented with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm glucose, 0.2% (w/v) BSA, and 10 μmSNARF-1/AM from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Intracellular SNARF-1 was excited at 488 nm and emission was measured at 575 and 670 nm using linear amplifiers and data plotted as forward scatter versus fluorescence ratio (FL2/FL3). The intracellular pH (pHi) was determined by comparing mean 575/670 nm fluorescence ratio values of histograms, to a calibration curve of histograms from fresh neutrophils. The pH was clamped between 5.6 and 7.8, with overlapping 0.2 pH unit intervals, in 20 mm Mes, Pipes, and Hepes buffers and 2 μg/ml nigericin, in a high-potassium medium containing: 110 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% (w/v) BSA. Neutrophils (5 × 108; <5% apoptotic after 20 h at 15 °C) were sedimented at 1,500 ×g av at 4 °C. They were washed twice in 50 ml of homogenization buffer: 15 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a 1:1000 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture: 87 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 160 mg benzamidine, and 10 mg of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 5 mg each of bestatin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin A solubilized in 1 ml of Me2SO. Neutrophils were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer then broken with 20–30 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle in a glass Dounce homogenizer from Wheaton (Millville, NJ), until 80% of the nuclei stained with trypan blue. Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 350 ×g av for 5 min at 4 °C. Post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 17,000 ×g av in a TLA 100.3 rotor from Beckman (High Wycombe, Bucks, UK) for 10 min to remove secretory granules and mitochondria and the supernatant centrifuged at 541,000 ×g max for 15 min in a TLA 100.3 rotor to yield a membrane-free cytosol. Cytosol (200 μl) was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were assayed by the bicinchonic acid protocol from Pierce & Warriner Ltd. The immunoprecipitation procedure, with a monoclonal antibody to a native cytochromec epitope (6H2.B4, PharMingen), was as described previously (46Pryde J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3425-3436PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-free mixtures for the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3 contained: 10 μl of 15 °C cytosol (50 mg of protein/ml) and 10 μl of an assay dilution buffer containing: 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with dATP (20 μm) and inhibitors where appropriate. Incubations were stopped by transferring samples to ice and adding 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.4 m NaCl, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, containing protease inhibitor mixture (lysis buffer) for 0.5 h. Rat liver was washed in 10 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture then forced through a stainless steel sieve (150 μm aperture; Endecotes Ltd., London) to break cells (46Pryde J.G.

The mitochondria were isolated from a post-nuclear supernatant as described previously and washed in the assay dilution buffer described above (47Nicholson D.W. McMurray W.C. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Assay samples (40 μl), treated with ice-cold lysis buffer for 0.5 h (40 μl) were solubilized with 80 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (46Pryde J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3425-3436PubMed Google Scholar) at 95 °C for 10 min, then treated with 1 mm dithiothreitol, cooled, and treated with 10 mm iodoacetamide. The proteins were separated on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (46Pryde J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3425-3436PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies to procaspase-3 (clone 19) and procaspase-7 (clone 51) from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and monoclonal antibodies to procaspase-8 (clone B9-2), procaspase-9 (clone B40), cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12), and polyclonal human Bax (13666E) all from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), at dilutions of 1:500–1:1000. A hybridoma supernatant to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), used at 1:500 dilution, was a gift from Said Aoufuchi (Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs from Kirkegaard & Perry Labs (Gaithersburg, MA) were used at 1:4000 dilution for 0.5 h and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (46Pryde J.G.

Tubulin and actin were assayed with anti-bovine α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (236-10501) from Molecular Probes and a monoclonal antibody to actin; a gift from Simon Brown (Center for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh). Neutrophils (105 cells in 100 μl of medium) were cytocentrifuged (300 rpm for 3 min) onto 1.5 × 22 × 22-mm glass coverslips and fixed in methanol-free 3% (w/v) p-formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (46Pryde J.G.

The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and nonspecific binding sites blocked for 1 h with 0.2% (w/v) fish skin gelatin and 20% (v/v) sheep serum in phosphate-buffered saline. A monoclonal antibody to mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHSP70) from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. (Golden, CO) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to ubiquinol-cytochrome coxidoreductase (complex III) produced by Herman Schagger (University of Frankfurt-am-Main), were used at 1:200 dilution to stain mitochondria. The polyclonal antibody to human Bax was used at 1:200 dilution. The secondary antibodies used at 1:400 dilution were Alexa™ 488 (green) goat anti-mouse IgG (highly cross-adsorbed) and Alexa™ 568 (red) goat anti-rabbit (highly cross-adsorbed) and the nucleic acid stain TOPO-3™ (8 μm), from Molecular Probes. Cells were observed using a ×63 water immersion objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.2 on a Leica TCS NT confocal laser scanning microscope system (Heidelberg, GMBH). Single optical sections of the images captured with Leica TCS software were digitally processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.02 and Paint Shop Pro 4. Neutrophils from peripheral blood can be maintained in culture at 37 °C for several hours in autologous serum before asynchronously undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1 A, closed squares).

Dividing cells, for example, blocked at cell cycle checkpoints provide an homogeneous cytosol (49Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Although neutrophils are terminally differentiated (post-replicative) cells, we synchronized their commitment to the execution phase of apoptosis by exposure to low temperature. Low temperature blocks intracellular pathways that rely on membrane fission and fusion, as exemplified by vesicular transport (50Tartakoff A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 51Manara F.S. Schneider D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In neutrophils (Fig. 1 A, open circles) or eosinophils (data not shown) cultured at 15 °C, apoptosis was arrested suggesting that a membrane-associated event required for apoptosis was inhibited. In contrast, culture of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells at 15 °C induced apoptosis (data not shown) as described previously for these and many other dividing mammalian cells (52Shimura M. Ishizaka Y. Yuo A. Hatake K. Oshima M. Sasaki T. Takaku F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be cell-type or differentiation state-dependent pathways for apoptosis. The rate of neutrophil apoptosis at 37 °C was accelerated by treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 1 A, closed circles). In addition to preventing the translation of new proteins in the cytoplasm, cycloheximide can induce apoptosis through FADD-dependent mechanisms downstream of cell-surface Fas death receptors (53Tang D. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, when we cultured neutrophils at 15 °C with cycloheximide there was no increase in the rate of apoptosis (Fig.1 A, open circles). Treatment of 15 °C cultured neutrophils with tumor necrosis factor α (16Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G. Fujihara S. Farrow S.N. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4309-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) did not induce apoptosis (data not shown), suggesting that the block to the induction of the execution phase of apoptosis was downstream of these plasma membrane-associated events. The low temperature arrest of neutrophil apoptosis was reversed by re-warming neutrophils, cultured for 20 h at 15 °C, to 37 °C. There was reorganization of the cytoskeleton associated with cell polarization (shape-change), monitored by flow cytometry, that showed cytoskeletal integrity had been maintained at 15 °C (data not shown). This polarization of the neutrophils was followed by a burst of synchronous apoptosis (Fig. 1 B, closed circles). The initial rate of apoptosis was 10-fold greater than the rate of constitutive apoptosis in neutrophils maintained at 37 °C (Fig. 1 A, closed squares), and by 2 h after warming 80–90% of the cells were apoptotic (Fig.1 B, closed circles). Neutrophils maintained for a further 2 h at 15 °C showed no shape change and no increase in their rate of apoptosis (Fig. 1 B, open circles). By culturing neutrophils in medium containing BSA and cycloheximide we removed experimental variables induced by serum factors and translation of mRNA into new protein. The accelerated rate of neutrophil apoptosis at 37 °C, following preincubation at 15 °C, depended on the period of time neutrophils had been cultured at 15 °C. It was not a cold-shock response, as previously shown for lymphocytes (54Gregory C.D. Milner A.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We demonstrated this by maintaining cells at 15 °C for increasing periods of time before warming them to 37 °C and estimating the initial rate of apoptosis over a 1.5-h period as shown in Fig. 1 B (closed circles). For the first 6 h in culture there was no increase in the initial rate of apoptosis (Fig. 1 C). However, as the cells were cultured for longer periods at 15 °C there was an increase in the initial rate of apoptosis on warming (Fig.1 C). These data suggested that there was a time- and temperature-dependent accumulation of a proapoptotic factor at the site of the temperature arrest that led to a synchronization of apoptosis when the cel"

We applied our previously developed strategy of dimeric peptidomimetics to address the hypothesis that loop 4 small molecule dimeric mimetics would activate TrkA-related signal transduction and mimic NGF neurotrophic effects in a structure-specific manner. A loop 4 cyclized peptide dimer demonstrated NGF-like neurotrophic activity, whereas peptides with scrambled sequence, added or substituted residues, or cyclized in monomeric form were inactive. Activity was blocked by the TrkA inhibitors K252a and AG879 but not by NGF p75 receptor blocking antibody. Dimeric, but not monomeric, peptides partially blocked NGF activity. This profile was consistent with that of a NGF partial agonist. ERK and AKT phosphorylation was stimulated only by biologically active peptides and was blocked by K252a. The ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked the neurite- but not the survival-promoting activity of both NGF and active peptide. These studies support the proof of concept that small molecule NGF loop 4 mimetics can activate NGF signaling pathways and can mimic death-preventing and neurite-promoting effects of NGF.

These actions suggest that NGF agonists or antagonists might be useful in regulating these processes (6Yuen E.C. Howe C.L. Li Y. Holtzman D.M. Mobley W.C.

Factors limiting therapeutic applications of the NGF protein include restricted penetration of the central nervous system and the poor medicinal properties characteristic of most proteins (9Poduslo J.F. Curran G.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 10Saltzman W.M. Mak M.W. Mahoney M.J. Duenas E.T. Cleland J.L. Pharm. Res. 1999; 16: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The development of small molecule mimetics with favorable chemical properties that function as agonists or antagonists that mimic or inhibit NGF functions in the appropriate biological context will be critical in advancing potential in vivo applications of NGF. Moreover, in settings in which NGF might contribute to neuronal death, pain, or inflammatory mechanisms, NGF antagonists may be particularly relevant. Creation of single domain NGF mimetics will also constitute a powerful approach for linking specific NGF domains with specific patterns of intracellular signal transduction. A NGF mimetic (agonist or antagonist) would be expected to contain structural determinants of one or more NGF active sites that interact with NGF receptors. Multiple techniques have been used to deduce which domains of the NGF protein interact with NGF receptors (11Bradshaw R.A. Murray-Rust J. Ibanez C.F. McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1901-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A peptide mapping approach in which synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to specific NGF regions were tested for their ability to inhibit NGF activity pointed to residues 29–35 as a key active site (12Longo F.M. Vu T.K. Mobley W.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subsequent NGF crystallography and molecular modeling studies revealed that NGF contains three surface hydrophilic β-hairpin loops (loops 1, 2, and 4) that are likely candidates for receptor interaction sites (13McDonald N.Q.

Loop 1 consists of the previously mapped residues 29–35, and subsequent studies confirmed that region 29–35 synthetic peptides inhibited NGF activity and NGF p75 receptor binding (16LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B.F. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (; correction (1995) J. Biol. Chem.271, 1249): 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recombinant substitution studies indicated that residues Lys32 and Lys34 (17Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H.

The NGF sites interacting with TrkA have also been derived via chemical modification (11Bradshaw R.A. Murray-Rust J. Ibanez C.F. McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Blundell T.L.

Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that TrkA binding sites consist of residues in NGF loop 2 (residues 40–49), loop 4 (residues 91–97), the N terminus (residues 1–8), and the C terminus (residues 111–115). We have established that synthesis of peptide derivatives mimicking single NGF domains provides an approach for deriving the proof of concept that mimetics of a given single-site domain can function as NGF antagonists or agonists (12Longo F.M. Vu T.K. Mobley W.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This approach has demonstrated that a cyclized dimer, but not linear or cyclized monomer peptides, corresponding to NGF loop 1 can function as a NGF agonist to prevent neuronal death via a p75-dependent, Trk kinase-independent signaling mechanism (25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The establishment of this proof of concept for NGF loop 1 along with the emerging role of peptidomimetics as a key intermediate-stage strategy in small molecule drug design (8Hughes R.A. O'Leary P.D. Drug Devel. Res. 1999; 46: 268-276Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26McInnes C. Sykes BD. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 339-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Kieber-Emmons T. Murali R.

Biol. 1997; 7: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) will contribute to rational screening and design programs for producing potent NGF small molecule mimetics with agonist activity. Our NGF dimeric peptidomimetic strategy has been further encouraged by the synthesis of small peptides mimicking the 34-kDa dimeric protein erythropoietin and the finding that erythropoietin receptor activation by peptidomimetics also requires the dimeric form (30Wrighton N.C. Balasubramian P. Barbone F.P. Kashyap A.K. Farrell F.X. Jolliffe L.K. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These erythropoietin peptidomimetics have served as starting points for the design of erythropoietin small molecule compounds (31Johnson D.L. Farrell F.X. Barbone F.P. McMahon F.J. Tullai J. Hoey K. Livnah O. Wrighton N.C. Middleton S.A. Loughney D.A. Stura E.A. Dower W.J. Mulcahy L.S. Wilson I.A. Jolliffe L.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3699-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Using strategies derived from our development of a NGF loop 1 dimeric peptidomimetic with agonist activity, we tested the hypothesis that dimeric peptidomimetics corresponding to NGF loop 4 can function as NGF agonists to mimic NGF biological activity and activate well established NGF signaling intermediates. Studies describing the biological activity of the present loop 4 mimetics have been published in abstract form (63Xie Y. Longo F.M. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23 (abstr.): 1701Google Scholar). Methods for peptide synthesis, purification and characterization were conducted as described previously (25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized in the C-terminal amide form by Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA) following our specifications. The amide form was chosen to reduce susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage. Peptide conformation was stabilized by cyclization (32Pelton J.T. Gulya K. Hruby J.V. Duckles S.P. Yamamura H.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Hruby V.J. Al-Obeidi F. Kazmierski W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Cysteine or penicillamine (β,β-dimethylcysteine) residues were added to each end of the linear sequence to provide sulfhydryl groups for oxidative peptide cyclization. Penicillamine has been found to facilitate cyclization and to provide greater conformational constraint relative to cysteine-cysteine cyclization (33Hruby V.J. Al-Obeidi F. Kazmierski W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 34Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17294-17298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were cyclized into monomeric or dimeric forms via oxidative formation of disulfide bonds by the addition of K3Fe(CN)6 to peptides solubilized in water at either low (monomeric cyclization) or high (dimeric cyclization) concentrations (34Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17294-17298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After cyclization, peptides were lyophilized and then purified by reversed-phase HPLC (12Longo F.M. Vu T.K. Mobley W.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Analytical HPLC was used to confirm a purity of >98%. One aliquot from each purified HPLC fraction was used for quantitative amino acid analysis to confirm peptide composition and to determine concentration. The composition and cyclized state of each peptide was further confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry to determine molecular mass (AnaSpec Inc., San Jose, CA). Before each bioassay, peptide aliquots were lyophilized and resuspended to known concentrations in culture media. Dorsal root ganglia were dissected from embryonic day 8 chick embryos and placed in calcium and magnesium-free Dulbecco's balanced salt solution on ice. Ganglia were then resuspended and incubated for 20 min in 2.5 ml of 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C, washed once with 4 ml of culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H21 with glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 3.0 g/liter glucose, 3.7 g/liter H2CO3, and 10% fetal calf serum) and dissociated in 1.5 ml of culture medium by gentle trituration (10–15 times) through a 1-mm-diameter flamed glass pipette. The resulting cell suspension was diluted to 7 ml in culture medium and added to a 100-mm-diameter plastic tissue culture dish (Falcon) and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air, resulting in a supernatant containing ∼80% neurons. For 96-well plate studies (Costar A/2, 0.16 cm2/well), wells were pre-coated with 50 μl/well polyornithine (Sigma; 0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h followed by 50 μl/well laminin (Life Technologies, Inc., 10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 3 h to provide a substrate permissive for neurite outgrowth. Following laminin coating each well received 25 μl of peptide serially diluted in culture medium and 25 μl of cell suspension (60,000 cells/ml, 1500 neurons/well). Control cultures performed with each assay included serial dilutions of NGF to generate NGF dose-response curves and cultures without NGF or peptides to determine background survival. Background survival was typically 5–15% that seen with optimal concentrations of NGF. Mouse submaxillary βNGF, generously provided by Dr. William Mobley, was purified via 7 S NGF. For 6-well plate studies (Costar 9.5 cm2/well) wells were pre-coated with 1.0 ml/well of polyornithine and 1.0 ml/well of laminin at the concentrations listed above. Highly purified neuronal preparations were obtained by incubating DRG cell mixtures in 100-mm diameter plastic tissue culture dishes coated with type I rat tail collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products) (35McCarthy K.D. Partlow L.M. Brain Res. 1976; 114: 391-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air and shaken for 30 s every 10–15 min, resulting in a supernatant containing >95% neurons. Each well in 6-well plates then received 1.0 ml of cell suspension (60,000 cells/ml) and a final concentration of 10 ng/ml NGF or 125 μm peptide in a total final volume of 2.0 ml. Neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth were assessed by a combination of morphological criteria and the MTT colorimetric assay (25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MTT was added to cultures 20 h or 68 h after cell plating, and cells were fixed at 24 h or 72 h with glutaraldehyde (4% in H2O), respectively. Under phase contrast microscopy, the number of surviving neurons per area was determined using a combination of MTT staining and morphological criteria (25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For 96-well plate assays, horizontal and vertical strips of each well were examined, and the number of surviving cells (defined as large intact cells without fragmented cell membrane or accumulations of vesicles and containing blue MTT product) were counted. For each peptide or NGF concentration, duplicate wells were counted in each bioassay, and four values (two strips counted/well) were averaged. For 6-well plate assays, a vertical strip encompassing 12 microscopic fields was assessed. The number of surviving neurons in each field was counted, and the average of the 12 counts was determined for each well. In the presence of NGF, 25–45 surviving neurons per field were counted. Antiserum (antibody 9561) directed against the third and fourth cysteine-rich repeats of the extracellular domain of mouse p75 was generously provided by Dr. Moses Chao. This antibody inhibits NGF neurotrophic activity by interfering with NGF-p75 interaction (36Huber L.J. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Antiserum and control non-immune sera were tested at final dilutions of 1:100 in the presence of NGF or peptide. The Trk inhibitors K252a (Calbiochem) or AG879 (Calbiochem) were added to cultures at final concentrations of 100 nm and 10 μm, respectively. K252a or AG879 were added concomitantly with NGF or P92. ERK inhibitor UO126 and its inactive control UO124 (Calbiochem) were prepared as a 500 μm solution in culture medium with 2.5% Me2SO and added to cultures to a final concentration of 50 μm. DRG cultures were place in serum-free medium and pretreated for 1 h with 50 μm ERK inhibitor U0126 or its control before the addition of NGF or P92. Neuron-enriched cell suspensions were plated in 6-well plates under the same conditions as described for bioassays, except that the number of cells plated per well was increased by approximately 2-fold. Two hours after plating, NGF or peptides were added. For K252a experiments, neurons were pre-incubated for 10 min with K252a at a final concentration of 100 nm before the addition of NGF or peptide. After 10 min, 30 min, or 3 h of culture, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C (10,000 × g for 10 min). Supernatant protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were mixed with electrophoresis sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue containing 100 mm dithiothreitol), boiled for 5 min, and applied to 7.5% acrylamide gels with a 5% stacking gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 100 V. Filters were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm, 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 μg/ml monoclonal phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody or 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal phospho-AKT (Ser473) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Blots were washed five times with TBST (5 min/wash), incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed again with TBST, and then processed with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL detection kit. After exposure to x-ray film, blots were stripped and processed again using a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal p44/p42 MAPK antibody or 1:500 dilution of polyclonal AKT antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Chemiluminescence autoradiographs in the linear range were densitometrically scanned. In previous studies we determined that dimerization via cysteine and penicillamine residues was required for activity of NGF loop 1 peptidomimetics (25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, an analogous approach was applied to NGF loop 4 peptides (Fig.1 A). In a first series of assays the effects of peptide P92 and various control peptides on neuronal survival were determined using a standard 24-h assay of NGF survival-promoting activity (25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). P92 contains NGF loop 4 residues Thr92, Asp93, Glu94, Lys95, and Gln96 (TDEKQ). Residues Glu94, Lys95, and Gln96 have been shown to mediate TrkA binding and activation (21McDonald N.Q. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19669-19672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Kullander K. Kaplan D. Ebendal T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9300-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Dimeric peptide P92 promoted neuronal survival at a level 3-fold higher than base-line survival levels and 10–15% of the maximum survival promoted by NGF (Fig. 1 B). This effect was dose-dependent over a range of 8–125 μm. In separate studies, doses up to 250 μm showed no further increase in survival promoting effect, suggesting that P92 was functioning as a NGF partial agonist rather than full agonist. The term partial agonist is used in the present study to describe a ligand producing a maximum response lower than the maximum response produced by the full or native (i.e. NGF) agonist (37Bourne H.R. Katzung B.G. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1998: 9-33Google Scholar). Structure-function studies based on P92 variants were conducted (Fig.1, B–D). The monomeric form of P92 had no activity, indicating that the survival-promoting effect of P92 was dimer-dependent. The activity of P92 was lost entirely if residues were scrambled (P92S) or if the amide terminus cysteine was substituted with a penicillamine residue (P92P). For peptide P90, amino acid residues were added at either end in order to flank the cysteine and penicillamine moieties and further restrain peptide conformation. This approach for additional structural constraint led to increased potency for cyclic RGD-containing fibronectin peptides (34Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17294-17298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the P92 peptide, activity was lost entirely when flanking residues were added. These structure-function studies demonstrated that the activity of P92 was highly sequence- and structure-dependent. To further characterize the partial agonist nature of P92 and further establish its interaction with NGF receptors, P92 in either monomeric or dimeric form was added to cultures in the presence of a fixed concentration of NGF. By definition, a partial agonist functioning at the same receptor as the native ligand would be expected to compete with and, thus, partially inhibit the effect of the native ligand (37Bourne H.R. Katzung B.G. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1998: 9-33Google Scholar, 38Pliska V. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 597-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 E, P92 dimer but not P92 monomer inhibited NGF activity by approximately 40% in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect began to be clearly detectable over the concentration range of 32 to 64 μm. This pattern of inhibition of NGF by P92 dimer was consistent with P92 functioning as a NGF partial agonist and also consistent with previous work showing that cyclized peptides corresponding to loop 4 block NGF binding to TrkA over a similar concentration range (16LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B.F. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (; correction (1995) J. Biol. Chem.271, 1249): 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The absence of inhibitory activity by the P92 monomer further indicated that the P92 dimer activity profile was structure-dependent. In long term DRG cultures (greater than 24 h), NGF promotes both neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth (39Snow D.M. Letourneau P.C. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether P92 activity also resembled that of NGF beyond the 24-h period, assays underwent two key modifications. Highly purified preparations of neurons were obtained so that the presence of proliferating non-neurons would be minimized. In addition, 6-well plates were used, allowing neurons to be plated at very low densities, allowing greater area for neurite outgrowth. Under these conditions, assessment of the number of surviving neurons per area showed that P92 supported survival at levels 2-fold greater than background and at 38% of the NGF maximum survival activity in both 1-day and 3-day cultures (Fig. 2). This level of activity, measured as a percentage of the NGF effect, was more than 2-fold higher than the 10–15% range observed using the standard 96-well assays. Monomeric and scrambled forms of P92 had no activity, again demonstrating that P92 NGF mimetic activity was structure- and sequence-dependent. The morphological features of DRG cultures supported by NGF and peptides are shown in Fig.3. Gross cellular morphology and overall neurite outgrowth patterns appeared similar in NGF- and P92-treated cultures. In 6-well plate cultures, essentially all NGF- and P92-supported surviving neurons were associated with neurites. This pattern was in marked contrast to NGF loop 1 peptidomimetics, which primarily promoted neuronal survival with relatively less effect on neurite outgrowth (25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Figure 3P92 promotes survival and neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons. DRG neurons were cultured in the presence of control culture medium (A), NGF at 400 pg/ml (B), P92 scrambled at 125 μm (C), and P92 at 125 μm (D). MTT was added to cultures 4 h before fixation, and cultures were fixed after 3 days. The addition of P92, but not P92 scrambled, was associated with surviving, intact neurons containing MTT product and extensive neurite outgrowth.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibitors of the TrkA and p75 receptors known to block NGF activity were used to further test the hypothesis that P92 acts via NGF signaling mechanisms. Although no inhibitor entirely specific for TrkA is available, K252a is relatively specific for TrkA (40Koizumi S. Contreras M.L. Matsuda Y. Hama T. Lazarovici P. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 715-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Berg M.M. Sternberg D.W. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Knuse B. Hefti F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and would be expected to block activity of P92 if its action were TrkA-dependent. Similarly, the TrkA inhibitor AG879 (43Ohmichi M. Pang L. Ribon V. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Saltiel A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4650-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) would also be expected to block P92. Since the tyrosine kinase targets of K252a and AG879 are partially non-overlapping (41Berg M.M. Sternberg D.W. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ohmichi M. Pang L. Ribon V. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Saltiel A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4650-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), inhibition of P92 by both compounds would further support the hypothesis that P92 acts via TrkA. As shown in Fig.4, the TrkA inhibitor K252a blocked NGF activity by 66% and blocked P92 activity by 49%. AG879 blocked NGF by 85% and blocked P92 activity by 66%. In contrast, p75 receptor antibody partially blocked NGF as previously established (25Longo F.M. Manthorpe M. Xie Y. Varon S. J. Neurosci.

In this study we show that the induction of apoptosis by flavopiridol is largely independent of Bcl-2. This is indicated by the observation that neither overexpression nor the antisense oligonucleotide-mediated down-regulation of Bcl-2 had any effect on flavopiridol-induced cell killing. Our results suggest that flavopiridol can induce apoptosis through different pathways of caspase activation with caspase 8 playing a pivotal role. In human lung carcinoma cells, which contain high levels of endogenous Bcl-2 and lack procaspase 8, flavopiridol treatment leads to mitochondrial depolarization in the absence of cytochrome c release, followed by the activation of caspase 3 and cell death. These results clearly differ from observations made with other anti-tumor drugs and might explain, at least in part, the unusual anti-tumor properties of flavopiridol.

Strasse R.A. Harris A.W. Adams J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1685s-1692sPubMed Google Scholar). Defects of the apoptotic machinery are also a major obstacle in cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is believed to kill malignant cells mainly through the induction of programmed cell death, including apoptosis (4Deigner H.P. Kinscherf R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 399-414PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying drug induced-apoptosis are still ill defined, but p53-mediated mitochondrial damage seems to play a major role in this process (4Deigner H.P. Kinscherf R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 399-414PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases, a growing family of cysteine proteases that cleave specific substrates at aspartic acid residues, have also been identified as major components of this pathway (5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 6Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes that must be activated by proteolytic cleavage at specific aspartate residues. A well characterized pathway of caspase activation involves release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria that together with APAF-1 and ATP leads to the proteolytic cleavage and activation of procaspase 9 (5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 6Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The downstream effector proteases include caspase 3, whose activation leads to the typical hallmarks of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing. The cytochrome c-triggered pathway is modulated by pro-apoptotic as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (7Reed J. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1996; 97: 72-100PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kroemer Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 9Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). These proteins act at mitochondria where they are believed to regulate the PTP1 and the release of cytochrome c (9Crompton M. Biochem.

Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell surface receptor molecules such as CD95 (APO-1/Fas) are also involved in drug-induced apoptosis (11Friesen C. Herr I. Kramme R.P.H. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA-damaging agents can induce expression of the CD95/Fas ligand system (12Müller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L. Galle P.R. Stremmel W. Oren M. Krammer P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 13Faris M. Latinis K.M.

Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). This triggers the recruitment of procaspase 8 to the receptor complex leading to its autocatalytic cleavage (16Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Active caspase 8 in turn effects the activation of the executioner caspases, such as caspase 3, followed by the proteolysis of a plethora of target proteins, and ultimately cell death. Caspase 8 can also activate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid through proteolytic cleavage (17Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar,18Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar). Bid has been shown to be able to trigger the release of cytochromec from mitochondria, which may involve the interaction with the pro-apoptotic Bax protein followed by the induction of an altered conformation or the oligomerization of Bax (19Desagher S.

Sausville E.A. Senderowicz A.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 458-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise molecular mechanisms remain largely obscure. Intriguingly, flavopiridol-induced apoptosis is refractory to various genetic alterations commonly found in human tumors, for example loss of p53 (29Shapiro G.I. Koestner D.A. Matranga C.B. Rollins B.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2925-2938PubMed Google Scholar) or overexpression of multi-drug resistance genes, such as mrp-1 (36Hooijberg J.H. Broxterman H.J. Scheffer G.L. Vrasdonk C. Heijn M. de Jong M.C. Scheper R.J. Lankelma J. Pinedo H.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Another frequent mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy is the overexpression of Bcl-2 (7Reed J. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1996; 97: 72-100PubMed Google Scholar), but its role in flavopiridol-induced cell killing is unclear. Bcl-2 blocks the release of cytochromec, thereby preventing the activation of caspase 9 and its downstream caspases, which usually renders the cell insensitive to drug-induced apoptosis. Flavopiridol has been reported to down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 in human cancer cell lines (31Konig A. Schwartz G.K. Mohammad R.M. Al-Katib A. Gabrilove J.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this finding could not be confirmed by others (28Schrump D.S. Matthews W. Chen G.A. Mixon A. Altorki N.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2885-2890PubMed Google Scholar, 33Byrd J.C. Shinn C. Waselenko J.K. Fuchs E.J. Lehman T.A. Nguyen P.L. Flinn I.W. Diehl L.F. Sausville E. Grever M.R.

Slater, unpublished observation. The role of Bcl-2 in flavopiridol-triggered apoptosis is therefore unclear.In the present study, we present compelling evidence that flavopiridol is able to kill tumor cells that are normally resistant to chemotherapeutic agents due to Bcl-2 overexpression or the absence of caspase 3 or 8. We also show that Bcl-2 blocks flavopiridol-triggered cytochrome c release, but not mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent caspase 3 activation. These observations suggest that flavopiridol can induce apoptosis through multiple pathways, which appear to include novel mechanisms, and might provide an explanation for the unusual anti-tumor potency of flavopiridol.DISCUSSIONThe goal of the present study was to elucidate the pathways that convey the cytotoxic signal induced by flavopiridol to the death machinery and to investigate the influence of Bcl-2 on this process. Our data clearly show that caspases are instrumental in flavopiridol-induced apoptosis and that multiple pathways are used, allowing flavopiridol to escape from certain resistance mechanisms, such as Bcl-2 overexpression. Interestingly, flavopiridol not only uses “classical” pathways of drug-induced apoptosis, but also seems to trigger hitherto unidentified mechanisms.Apoptotic Pathways Involving Caspase 8In HeLa cells, which contain low levels of Bcl-2 and a normal set of procaspases, flavopiridol triggers the early cleavage of procaspase 8, the delayed activation of caspase 3, and a partial, late cleavage of caspase 9. The activation of caspase 3 in response to flavopiridol has also been reported by others (33Byrd J.C. Shinn C. Waselenko J.K. Fuchs E.J. Lehman T.A. Nguyen P.L. Flinn I.W. Diehl L.F. Sausville E. Grever M.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 3804-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Motwani M. Delohery T.M. Schwartz G.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1876-1883PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with the inhibitor studies,i.e. inhibition of cell killing by IETD and crmA, it is likely that caspase 8 plays an essential role. Although the downstream caspase 3 is activated, it does not seem to be essential, since PARP cleavage and cell death continued to occur in the presence of DEVD. In agreement with this conclusion, flavopiridol efficiently induces cell death in the human breast carcinoma line MCF-7 (data not shown), which lacks caspase 3 (44Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). This suggests that another unidentified caspase (subsequently referred to as caspase X) transmits the signal from activated caspase 8 (or caspase 8 itself) to the apoptotic machinery, a mechanism that does not operate after camptothecin treatment. Even though the identity of caspase X is unclear, it is unlikely to be one of the recently described family members involved in apoptosis, such as caspase 2 (48Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and caspase 12 (49), which are located in the Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. This assumption is also supported by the fact that caspase 12 is not inhibited by crmA (49Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar).The activation of caspase 9 in flavopiridol-treated HeLa cells is likely to occur via the caspase 8-Bid-mitochondria pathway, which leads to cytochrome c release, followed by cleavage of procaspase 9. It is unlikely that flavopiridol efficiently triggers a caspase 8-independent signaling pathway leading to the release of cyctochromec from mitochondria, since IETD had a dramatic effect on the induction of apoptosis. In agreement with this notion is the observation that caspase 3, the only known effector caspase downstream of caspase 9, is largely dispensable in flavopiridol-induced apoptosis (as discussed above).On the basis of these findings, it would seem that the caspase 8/caspase 3 or caspase X pathway is of particular relevance for the induction of cell death by flavopiridol (see model in Fig.11), which contrasts with the observations made with camptothecin. Apoptosis induced by the latter drug seems to involve predominantly the caspase 8-independent release of cytochrome c. At present, we do not know how flavopiridol leads to the activation of the initiator caspase 8. In many other systems of drug-induced apoptosis, the CD95/Fas ligand system plays an important role in triggering this pathway. However, the implication of p53 in the drug-induced activation of CD95 (12Müller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L. Galle P.R. Stremmel W. Oren M. Krammer P.H.

Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) could make this less likely in view of the p53 independence of flavopiridol-induced apoptosis (29Shapiro G.I. Koestner D.A. Matranga C.B. Rollins B.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2925-2938PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases by other means, such as p16 overexpression (50Sandig V. Brand K. Herwig S. Lukas J. Bartek J. Strauss M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) or down-regulation of cyclin D1 by antisense (51Sauter E.R. Nesbit M. Litwin S.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4876-4881PubMed Google Scholar) can also result in apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms are also unknown.Clearly, tumor cells usually overexpress numerous proteins that are endowed with potentially pro-apoptotic properties, such as Myc or E2F. These proteins can induce apoptosis when cell cycle progression is stalled, as for instance in response to DNA-damage or a metabolic blockade (2Fanidi A. Harrington E.A. Evan G.I. Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 52Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). The fact that this apoptotic pathway involves the release of cytochrome c and the CD95/Fas ligand system has provided a first link between the cell cycle and one of the commonly used apoptotic pathways (53Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In the case of flavopiridol, this could also explain in part the tumor cell specificity of the drug. It will be interesting to investigate whether defined oncoproteins or other altered regulators of the cell cycle play a role in flavopiridol-induced cell death.Apoptotic Pathways in Cells Expressing High Levels of Bcl-2 and Lacking Procaspase 8SW2 cells express a very high level of Bcl-2, which blocks the release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspase 9. These cells also lack procaspase 8, but nevertheless caspase 3 is activated in response to flavopiridol. In contrast to the situation in HeLa cells, this activation of caspase 3 is essential. What is the mechanism leading to the caspase 3 activation? At present, we can only speculate, but the available information allows for the discussion of possible mechanisms.It is unlikely that flavopiridol itself mediates procaspase 3 cleavage, since the caspase 8 inhibitors IETD and crmA block apoptosis by flavopiridol in HeLa cells. It seems more likely that a mitochondrial pathway is involved, even though cytochrome cis not released (see model in Fig. 11). This hypothesis is based on the observation that depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane is efficiently induced by flavopiridol and is an early event. This depolarization is followed by a clear increase in the ADP/ATP ratio, which presumably is a consequence of impaired ATP synthesis, since the mitochondrial ATP synthetase is dependent on the maintenance of an intact membrane potential. That cytochrome c release and depolarization are separable is conceivable in view of published data (54Li P.-F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. EMBO J. 1999; 21: 6027-6036Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar), although the precise molecular mechanisms are not clear. It has been suggested that cytochrome c release is mediated by Bax through the formation of pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, but the role of the PTP in this process remains unclear (9Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Kluck R.M. Esposti M.D. Perkins G. Renken C. Kuwana T. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldberg M. Allen T. Barber M.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that bongkrekic acid, an inhibitor of the PTP (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was unable to prevent mitochondrial membrane depolarization in flavopiridol-treated cells, although it did inhibit depolarization and apoptosis in response to camptothecin. Therefore, flavopiridol either induces mitochondrial permeability not involving the PTP or it directly interferes with the function of PTP.It has been reported previously that hypericin-photo-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization is also refractory to the action of bongkrekic acid, which appears to be the result of direct drug damage of the mitochondrial membrane (56Chaloupka R. Petit P.X. Israel N. Sureau F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This, however, seems to a specific property of hypericin, which in conjunction with light is a powerful generator of free radicals. Similar properties are not known for flavopiridol. On the other hand, chemical compounds affecting the PTP are known, such as cyclosporin and bongkrekic acid itself (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, different members of the Bcl-2 family, like Bax, Bcl-2, and BclXL, have been reported to interact with components of the PTP, i.e. the voltage-dependent anion channel and/or the adenine nucleotide translocase (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It may be possible that flavopiridol acts at similar targets, and thereby contributes to the induction of apoptosis. In agreement with such a hypothesis would be the observation that Bcl-2 was unable to block flavopiridol-triggered mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which is an unusual finding compared with the observations made with other apoptotic stimuli (8Kroemer Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Finally, it remains unknown how mitochondrial membrane depolarization translates to caspase 3 activation, although such a link has not formally been proven. It may be possible that cytoplasmic acidification by protons released from the mitochondria may trigger events in the cytoplasm leading to caspase activation. One might also speculate that mitochondrial permeability leads to the release of apoptogenic molecules other than cytochrome c that can trigger caspase activation. That such molecules exist has been demonstrated by the discovery of apoptosis inducing factor (57Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3431) Google Scholar) and the release of active caspases from mitochondria (58Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar).Although we do not understand the effects of flavopiridol on mitochondrial permeability at present, a thorough investigation of the underlying mechanisms may provide a key to elucidating flavopiridol's unusual mechanism of action.Implications for Cancer TherapyOur findings also have relevance for cancer therapy. We have shown that flavopiridol-induced apoptosis is not blocked by Bcl-2 overexpression, one of the most common problems encountered with cancer cells. In addition, flavopiridol could trigger apoptosis in the absence of caspase 3 or caspase 8, since it can utilize alternate pathways for the induction of cell death. These caspases are also lacking in certain human tumors, which could render them resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Taken together with the previously reported p53 independence and refractoriness to multi-drug resistance, flavopiridol could make an invaluable contribution to clinical oncology. In this context, the strong synergism of flavopiridol with other drugs, such as taxol (47Motwani M. Delohery T.M. Schwartz G.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1876-1883PubMed Google Scholar), might be of particular importance. Malignant growth results not only from enhanced cell proliferation, but also from decreased programmed cell death (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Cancer Surv. 1992; 15: 119-141PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fanidi A. Harrington E.A. Evan G.I. Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 3Cory S. Vaux D.L. Strasse R.A. Harris A.W. Adams J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1685s-1692sPubMed Google Scholar). Defects of the apoptotic machinery are also a major obstacle in cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is believed to kill malignant cells mainly through the induction of programmed cell death, including apoptosis (4Deigner H.P. Kinscherf R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 399-414PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying drug induced-apoptosis are still ill defined, but p53-mediated mitochondrial damage seems to play a major role in this process (4Deigner H.P. Kinscherf R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 399-414PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases, a growing family of cysteine proteases that cleave specific substrates at aspartic acid residues, have also been identified as major components of this pathway (5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 6Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes that must be activated by proteolytic cleavage at specific aspartate residues. A well characterized pathway of caspase activation involves release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria that together with APAF-1 and ATP leads to the proteolytic cleavage and activation of procaspase 9 (5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 6Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The downstream effector proteases include caspase 3, whose activation leads to the typical hallmarks of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing. The cytochrome c-triggered pathway is modulated by pro-apoptotic as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (7Reed J. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1996; 97: 72-100PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kroemer Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 9Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). These proteins act at mitochondria where they are believed to regulate the PTP1 and the release of cytochrome c (9Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface receptor molecules such as CD95 (APO-1/Fas) are also involved in drug-induced apoptosis (11Friesen C. Herr I. Kramme R.P.H. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA-damaging agents can induce expression of the CD95/Fas ligand system (12Müller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L. Galle P.R. Stremmel W. Oren M. Krammer P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 13Faris M. Latinis K.M. Kempiak S.J.

Oncol. 1999; 11: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) or effect clustering of CD95 in the plasma membrane through other mechanisms (15Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). This triggers the recruitment of procaspase 8 to the receptor complex leading to its autocatalytic cleavage (16Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Active caspase 8 in turn effects the activation of the executioner caspases, such as caspase 3, followed by the proteolysis of a plethora of target proteins, and ultimately cell death. Caspase 8 can also activate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid through proteolytic cleavage (17Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar,18Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar). Bid has been shown to be able to trigger the release of cytochromec from mitochondria, which may involve the interaction with the pro-apoptotic Bax protein followed by the induction of an altered conformation or the oligomerization of Bax (19Desagher S.

Each 0.5-ml aliquot of the COS cell extracts was incubated with 200 pmol of various GST fusion proteins fixed on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. After the beads were washed with 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, the proteins on the beads were detected with the immunoblotting using the anti-Myc antibody. COS cells were transfected with pClneo PAPIN with either pClneo p0071–1 or -3. The urea/detergent extracts of COS cells were prepared as described above. Each 0.5-ml aliquot was incubated with the anti-p0071 antiserum or the preimmune serum fixed on protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads. After the beads were washed, the proteins in the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the anti-PAPIN antibody. NRK cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 15 min, incubated in 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. For immunohistochemistry, adult rats were perfused with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. The fixed samples were treated with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS and washed with PBS. After being blocked with 10% (v/v) goat serum, the cells were incubated with various first antibodies and visualized with the rhodamine- or fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibodies. The images were obtained by a confocal microscopy (Olympus FV300-BX). The subcellular fractionation of rat brain, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and determination of protein concentrations were performed as described (16Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J.

Western and Northern blottings were performed using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH), respectively. To identify a NPRAP/δ-catenin-interacting protein, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using various bait constructs of NPRAP/δ-catenin. From 1 × 106 transformants, only one positive clone, pPrey 5001, was obtained. The sequence analysis of pPrey 5001 revealed that it contained three PDZ domains. To obtain a full-length clone, we screened a random-primed rat brain cDNA library using the insert from pPrey 5001 as a probe. No single clone contained both of a putative initiation methionine and a termination codon, but from the analysis of several overlapping clones, we tentatively identified a protein composed of 2766 amino acids (Fig.1 A). We have named this protein PAPIN. PAPIN has four PDZ domains in the N-terminal region and two PDZ domains in the C-terminal region. The middle region between the fourth and fifth PDZ domains did not show any significant homology to known proteins (Fig. 1 B, a). pPrey 5001 contained the amino acids 231–811 covering the second to fourth PDZ domains (Fig.1 A, underlined). A clone, p5001–52, had an insert of 52 amino acids between the second and third PDZ domains (Fig.1 B, b). Another clone, p5001–61, also had an insert and a termination codon after the fourth PDZ domain (Fig. 1 B, c). pPrey 5001 interacted only with pBTM116 δ-catenin-1 and not with pBTM116 δ-catenin-3 or -4, which did not contain the C-terminal region of NPRAP/δ-catenin (data not shown) (9Paffenholz R. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M. Ho C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains of PAPIN were speculated to bind the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of NPRAP/δ-catenin. Actually, the GST fusion protein containing the first and second PDZ domains of PAPIN interacted with the native NPRAP/δ-catenin from rat crude synaptosomes (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, we confirmed that PAPIN was enriched in the synaptic plasma membrane and postsynaptic density fractions as well as NPRAP/δ-catenin in the rat brain subcellular fractionations (Fig. 2 B). Next, we performed Northern blot analysis using various rat tissues. The messages with 12 kilobase pair were detected in heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis (Fig.3 A). The tissue distribution of the messages of PAPIN was similar to that of p0071 (Fig.3 B), but not that of NPRAP/δ-catenin, which was specifically expressed in brain as previously reported (data not shown and Ref. 10Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M. Ho C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In the hybridization with the probe of β-actin, all the lanes gave similar signals (data not shown). p0071 has a PDZ-binding motif similar to that of NPRAP/δ-catenin, although the motif is not the C terminus of p0071 (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that p0071 may also interact with PAPIN. To confirm this possibility, we tested whether PAPIN interacted with the PDZ-binding motif of p0071 in COS cells. For this purpose, we prepared various constructs of p0071 (Fig. 4 B). p0071–1 contained the full-length of p0071 (Fig.4 B, a). p0071–2 lacked the C terminus but contained the PDZ-binding motif (Fig. 4 B, b). p0071–3 lacked the PDZ-binding motif (Fig. 4 B, c). First, we overexpressed PAPIN with either p0071–1 or -3 in COS cells and immunoprecipitated p0071. PAPIN was coimmunoprecipitated with p0071–1 but not with p0071–3 (Fig. 4 C). We also examined the interaction of GST-PAPIN and various Myc-tagged constructs of p0071. The products of pClneo Myc p0071–1 and -2 interacted with the GST fusion protein containing the first and second PDZ domains of PAPIN, whereas that of pClneo Myc p0071–3 did not (Fig. 4 D). These results indicate that PAPIN interacts with the PDZ-binding motif of p0071. To determine which PDZ domain of PAPIN is involved in the interaction with p0071, we prepared various Myc-tagged constructs of PAPIN (Fig.5 A). The products of pClneo Myc PAPIN-2 with the first and second PDZ domains and pClneo Myc PAPIN-9 with the second and third PDZ domains bound to the GST fusion protein containing the C terminus of p0071 (Fig. 5 B,b and e). The products of pClneo Myc PAPIN-1 with the first PDZ domain and pClneo Myc PAPIN-11 with the third and fourth PDZ domains did not bind (Fig. 5 B, a andf). These data suggest that the second PDZ domain of PAPIN is the p0071-binding domain. Finally, we compared the localizations of p0071 and PAPIN in vivo. The anti-PAPIN antibody recognized a protein with a molecular mass of about 300 kDa in NRK cells (Fig.6 A). In the immunocytostaining of NRK cells, both PAPIN and p0071 were localized at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 6 B). Because the message of PAPIN was detected remarkably in the lung, we examined the localization of PAPIN in rat lung. PAPIN and p0071 were detected similarly in bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 7, A andB). Both proteins were localized at cell-cell contacts, although the signals were also detected at the apical side of bronchial epithelial cells.Figure 7Localization of PAPIN with p0071 in rat bronchial epithelial cells. Rat lung was fixed and immunostained with either the anti-PAPIN or the anti-p0071 antibody. A, the anti-PAPIN antibody. B, the anti-p0071 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this paper, we have identified a novel multiple PDZ domain-containing protein, PAPIN, through the yeast two-hybrid screening using NPRAP/δ-catenin as a bait. PAPIN interacts with NPRAP/δ-catenin and its ubiquitous isoform, p0071, in vitro and in transfected cells. We could not directly show the interaction of endogenous PAPIN and p0071, because the endogenous p0071 was highly resistant to the detergent extraction and even the detergent/urea extraction. However, because PAPIN and p0071 are localized similarly at cell-cell junctions of NRK cells, both proteins are likely to interact with each other in vivo. The interaction of PAPIN with NPRAP/δ-catenin or p0071 is mediated by the second PDZ domain of PAPIN and the PDZ-binding motif of NPRAP/δ-catenin or p0071. The PDZ domain is a protein-interacting module and was initially reported to bind the C terminus of various proteins (19Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). However, the PDZ domain of DrosophilaINAD protein binds to the PDZ-binding motif of TRP, which is localized inside the sequence (20Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The second PDZ domain of PAPIN similarly binds to the PDZ-binding motif of p0071, which is localized inside the sequence. Many junctional proteins, such as PSD-95/SAP90, SAP97/human Discs-large, synaptic scaffolding molecule, membrane-associated guanylate kinase-1/brain angiogenesis inhibitor-associated protein 1, ZO-1, glutamate receptor-interacting protein/(±)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor-binding protein, and channel-interacting PDZ domain protein, have more than one PDZ domains (17Hirao K.

The multiple PDZ domain-containing proteins are considered to bind various ligands via distinct PDZ domains and provide a scaffold for these ligands (reviewed in 32–34). PAPIN may also interact with various molecules besides NPRAP/δ-catenin and p0071 via the PDZ domains. NPRAP/δ-catenin and p0071 belong to a family of p120ctn containing 10armadillo repeats. The functions of NPRAP/δ-catenin and p0071 are not clear, but both proteins are localized at cell-cell junctions, suggesting that they play roles as components of cell-cell junctions like p120ctn (3Reynolds A.B.

Adenomatous polyposis coli gene product interacts with PSD-95/SAP90 and SAP97/human Discs-large tumor suppressor gene (36Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G-H. Kawahara T.

Deguchi M. Hirao K. Yao I. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and NPRAP/δ-catenin and p0071 bind to PAPIN. Because both the PDZ domain-containing protein family and the armadillorepeat-containing protein family are localized at cell-cell junctions, these interactions may be important in the architecture of cell-cell junctions. Presenilin 1 is reported to interact with the armadillorepeats of β-catenin, p0071, and NPRAP/δ-catenin (37Levesque G., Yu, G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L., Yu, H. Xu D. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.

We screened the factors that can interact with the RGG domain of Npl3p only in the presence of Hmt1p with the two-hybrid system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An isolated clone, YIL079, encodes a novel RING finger protein that was not directly bound to Npl3p but associated with the N terminus of Hmt1p. Thus, we designated the gene product Air1p (arginine methyltransferase-interactingRING finger protein). Air1p inhibited the Hmt1p-mediated methylation of Npl3p in vitro. Overexpression of Air1p repressed the Hmt1p-dependent growth of cells. Since homology searches indicate that the YDL175 gene product has significant identity (45%) with Air1p, we designated the geneAIR2. Air2p also has a RING finger domain and was bound to Hmt1p. Although single disruption of either gene gave no effect on the cell growth, cells lacking Air1p and Air2p grew at an extremely slow rate with accumulated poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus.

A potential role of protein methylation as a post-translational modification in signal transduction, however, has not been explored with the same breadth and intensity that protein phosphorylation has enjoyed in recent years. The methyl group, donated by SAM,1 is transferred to carboxyl groups or to the side chain nitrogens of the amino acid lysine, arginine, or histidine (1Aletta J.M. Cimato T.R. Ettinger M.J.

In addition to the ability of RNA recognition motifs, the RGG box domain (or RGG domain) has been shown to mediate RNA-protein interactions (16Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 17Mears W.E. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and arginine methylation typically occurs within the regions with the RGG domain in hnRNP A1 and Npl3p (6Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 9Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Several other potential substrates for the enzyme including fibrillarin and nucleolin have a similar RGG methylation consensus: (G/F)GGRGG(G/F) (19Najbauer J. Johnson B.A. Young A.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10501-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the significance of arginine methylation in the RGG domain has not been revealed fully, Shen et al. (20Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) recently reported that Npl3p cannot exit the nucleus efficiently in cells lacking a major arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1p/Rmt1p, and overexpression of Hmt1p enhances Npl3p export. The export of another RNA-binding protein known to shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, Hrp1p, is also impaired when HMT1 is missing (20Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,21Kessler M.M. Henry M.F. Shen E. Zhao J. Gross S. Silver P.A. Moore C.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2545-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the efficient export of at least two shuttling hnRNPs implicated in RNA processing and export requires arginine methylation in the RGG domain.These findings gave us the idea that unidentified protein(s) may interact with the RGG domain in a methylation-dependent manner as a regulator of the hnRNP shuttling. In support of this possibility, Michael et al. (22Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) reported that a part of C-terminal RGG domain is sufficient for its nuclear export when hnRNP A1 shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In this report, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening with the C-terminal region (amino acids 281–414) of Npl3p as a bait and isolated several clones.DISCUSSIONSince the post-translational methylation of protein arginine residues was revealed (2Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), their activity has been researched (46Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type I protein arginine N-methyltransferases methylate protein arginine residues to formN G,N G-dimethylarginine residues (asymmetric). Hmt1p/Rmt1p was isolated from S. cerevisiae as a protein arginine methyltransferase that catalyzes both the N G-monomeric andN G,N G-asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues (4Henry M.F. Silver P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Gary J.D. Lin W.-J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Hmt1p may be the one and only type I protein arginine N-methyltransferase present in the yeast, because the mutation of the gene of S. cerevisiaeeliminates manyN G,N G-dimethylarginine residues (5Gary J.D. Lin W.-J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast to the yeast, at least two active type I arginine N-methyltransferases, PRMT1 and PRMT3, have been identified in mammals (6Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F.

One of the fundamental observations reported in recent years, as mentioned in the Introduction, is the possibility of facilitating mRNA export from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the process of the revelation of mRNA export, we cloned HMT1 and AIR1 using Npl3p as a bait in the two-hybrid screening. An in vitro binding assay showed that Air1p interacts with the RGG domain of Npl3p bridged by Hmt1p. McBrideet al. (48McBride A.E. Weiss V.H. Kim H.K. Hogle J.M. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3128-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal E18V substitution of Hmt1p affected methylation of Npl3p but not of other substrates and suggested that Glu18 is involved in substrate binding or positioning. In support of this finding, the N-terminal deletion mutant of Hmt1p used in this study, Δ2 (residues 56–348), could not methylate Npl3p in vitro (data not shown).The inhibitory effect of Air1p on the enzyme activity of Hmt1p was detected by in vitro methylation assay of Npl3p. The methylation of Npl3p is blocked by Air1p in a dose-dependent manner, and overexpression of Air1p inhibited the Hmt1p-dependent growth in vivo. In this case, it is possible that Air1p suppresses the expression of Hmt1p followed by the elimination of the rescue by Hmt1p in annpl3–17 strain. However, since overproduction of Air1p did not affect the amount of exogenous Hmt1p introduced by a high copy plasmid, the suppression of Hmt1p-dependent rescue by overproduction of Air1p is not due to the reduced expression of Hmt1p. Hmt1p has been shown to facilitate the export of Npl3p in nucleocytoplasmic transport (20Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our observation that growth and mRNA transport were affected in cells lackingAIR1 and AIR2 suggests to us that the regulated methylation of Npl3p may be crucial for mRNA transport. When we checked the localization of the GFP-Npl3p in wild type and air1 air2 double disruptant, GFP-Npl3p was localized in the nucleus in both strains, and any difference of the expression pattern was not observed (data not shown). The regulatory mechanism of Air1p and Air2p on mRNA transport should be further elucidated.It should be noted that Liu and Dreyfuss (9Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) reported that arginine methylation was not observed in yeast extracts when recombinant hnRNP A1 was used as a substrate, the contrary to the extensive in vivo methylation of hnRNPs in HeLa cells. The inconsistent observations could be explained by the presence of endogenous inhibitory factors like Air1p and Air2p in yeast. An unidentified signal transduction system could be involved in the regulation of protein methylation mediated by Hmt1p as suggested in mammalian cells (1Aletta J.M. Cimato T.R. Ettinger M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 89-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PRMT1 has been reported to interact with interferon receptor and to affect the proliferation induced by interferon (49Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). PRMT1 also interacts with TIS21 and BTG1, which are immediate early genes and have an antiproliferative effect, and the methylation activity was modulated by the interaction (6Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).Air1p and Air2p have sequence similarity, especially in their N-terminal RING finger domain. The RING finger domain consisting of the amino acid sequence Cys-X 2-Cys-X 9–39-Cys-X 1–3-His2–3-Cys-X 2-Cys-X 4–48-Cys-X 2-Cys is a cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain ubiquitous in species ranging from plants to mammals and has been found in several proteins, which have important physiological roles in various biological phenomena (44Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The RING finger domain is now believed to be a motif for protein-protein interaction. We could not detect any homologous proteins in data bases of other species, but some proteins have conserved cysteine and histidine over the RING finger domain. Identification of the mammalian homologues of Air1p or Air2p may pave the way to understand the signal-mediated regulation of methyltransferases in mammals. Various types of protein modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, and myristoylation, are now recognized in a number of eukaryotic proteins, and their functional significance has been exhibited. A potential role of protein methylation as a post-translational modification in signal transduction, however, has not been explored with the same breadth and intensity that protein phosphorylation has enjoyed in recent years. The methyl group, donated by SAM,1 is transferred to carboxyl groups or to the side chain nitrogens of the amino acid lysine, arginine, or histidine (1Aletta J.M. Cimato T.R. Ettinger M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 89-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Evidence for the post-translational methylation of arginine residues in proteins was first provided by the presence of radioactive species chromatographing at positions near that of arginine in acid hydrolysates of isolated calf thymus nuclei incubated with [methyl-14C]SAM (2Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The products of the methylation reaction were determined to beN G-monomethylarginine andN G,N G-dimethylarginine (3Lee H.W. Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Type I protein arginine methyltransferases methylate arginine residues to form asymmetricN G,N G-dimethylarginine residues, and type II enzymes catalyze the formation of symmetricN G,N′G-dimethylarginine residues. Genes encoding type I methyltransferases have been identified in yeast (4Henry M.F. Silver P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Gary J.D. Lin W.-J.

Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), although type II protein arginine methyltransferases have not been cloned. In addition to these classical members, a coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) was recently cloned as a binding protein to p160 coactivators that include SRC1, GRIP/TIF2, and pCIP/RAC3/ACTR/AIB1/TRAM1 by using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a mouse embryo cDNA library (8Chen D.

Although histones and myelin basic proteins were initially used as substrates to determine the arginine methyltransferase activity, hnRNPs are now known to be more efficient for substrates (9Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). hnRNPs are abundant RNA-binding proteins, and more than 20 different hnRNPs, designated A–U, have been identified (10Dreyfuss G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). hnRNPs are associated with nascent polymerase II transcripts and involved in many steps of mRNA processing and nuclear transport (10Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 11Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin.

InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, temperature-sensitive mutants of one such protein, Npl3p, display defects in export of mRNA from the nucleus (13Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A.

One of the fundamental observations reported in recent years, as mentioned in the Introduction, is the possibility of facilitating mRNA export from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the process of the revelation of mRNA export, we cloned HMT1 and AIR1 using Npl3p as a bait in the two-hybrid screening. An in vitro binding assay showed that Air1p interacts with the RGG domain of Npl3p bridged by Hmt1p. McBrideet al. (48McBride A.E. Weiss V.H. Kim H.K. Hogle J.M. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3128-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal E18V substitution of Hmt1p affected methylation of Npl3p but not of other substrates and suggested that Glu18 is involved in substrate binding or positioning. In support of this finding, the N-terminal deletion mutant of Hmt1p used in this study, Δ2 (residues 56–348), could not methylate Npl3p in vitro (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of Air1p on the enzyme activity of Hmt1p was detected by in vitro methylation assay of Npl3p. The methylation of Npl3p is blocked by Air1p in a dose-dependent manner, and overexpression of Air1p inhibited the Hmt1p-dependent growth in vivo. In this case, it is possible that Air1p suppresses the expression of Hmt1p followed by the elimination of the rescue by Hmt1p in annpl3–17 strain. However, since overproduction of Air1p did not affect the amount of exogenous Hmt1p introduced by a high copy plasmid, the suppression of Hmt1p-dependent rescue by overproduction of Air1p is not due to the reduced expression of Hmt1p. Hmt1p has been shown to facilitate the export of Npl3p in nucleocytoplasmic transport (20Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our observation that growth and mRNA transport were affected in cells lackingAIR1 and AIR2 suggests to us that the regulated methylation of Npl3p may be crucial for mRNA transport. When we checked the localization of the GFP-Npl3p in wild type and air1 air2 double disruptant, GFP-Npl3p was localized in the nucleus in both strains, and any difference of the expression pattern was not observed (data not shown). The regulatory mechanism of Air1p and Air2p on mRNA transport should be further elucidated. It should be noted that Liu and Dreyfuss (9Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) reported that arginine methylation was not observed in yeast extracts when recombinant hnRNP A1 was used as a substrate, the contrary to the extensive in vivo methylation of hnRNPs in HeLa cells. The inconsistent observations could be explained by the presence of endogenous inhibitory factors like Air1p and Air2p in yeast. An unidentified signal transduction system could be involved in the regulation of protein methylation mediated by Hmt1p as suggested in mammalian cells (1Aletta J.M. Cimato T.R. Ettinger M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 89-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PRMT1 has been reported to interact with interferon receptor and to affect the proliferation induced by interferon (49Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). PRMT1 also interacts with TIS21 and BTG1, which are immediate early genes and have an antiproliferative effect, and the methylation activity was modulated by the interaction (6Lin W.-J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Air1p and Air2p have sequence similarity, especially in their N-terminal RING finger domain. The RING finger domain consisting of the amino acid sequence Cys-X 2-Cys-X 9–39-Cys-X 1–3-His2–3-Cys-X 2-Cys-X 4–48-Cys-X 2-Cys is a cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain ubiquitous in species ranging from plants to mammals and has been found in several proteins, which have important physiological roles in various biological phenomena (44Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The RING finger domain is now believed to be a motif for protein-protein interaction. We could not detect any homologous proteins in data bases of other species, but some proteins have conserved cysteine and histidine over the RING finger domain. Identification of the mammalian homologues of Air1p or Air2p may pave the way to understand the signal-mediated regulation of methyltransferases in mammals. We thank P. A.

https://openalex.org/W2052000957,"Brain fatty acid-binding protein (B-FABP) is expressed in the radial glial cells of the developing central nervous system as well as in a subset of human malignant glioma cell lines. Most of the malignant glioma lines that express B-FABP also express GFAP, an intermediate filament protein found in mature astrocytes. We are studying the regulation of the B-FABP gene to determine the basis for its differential expression in malignant glioma lines. By DNase I footprinting, we have identified five DNA-binding sites located within 400 base pairs (bp) of the B-FABP transcription start site, including two nuclear factor I (NFI)-binding sites at −35 to −58 bp (footprint 1, fp1) and −237 to −260 bp (fp3), respectively. Competition experiments, supershift experiments with anti-NFI antibody, and methylation interference experiments all indicate that the factor binding to fp1 and fp3 is NFI. By site-directed mutagenesis of both NFI-binding sites, we show that the most proximal NFI site is essential for B-FABP promoter activity in transiently transfected malignant glioma cells. Different band shift patterns are observed with nuclear extracts from B-FABP(+) and B-FABP(−) malignant glioma lines, with the latter generating complexes that migrate more slowly than those obtained with B-FABP(+) extracts. All bands are converted to a faster migrating form with potato acid phosphatase treatment, indicating that NFI is differentially phosphorylated in B-FABP(+) and B-FABP(−) lines. Our results suggest that B-FABP expression in malignant glioma lines is determined by the extent of NFI phosphorylation which, in turn, is controlled by a phosphatase activity specific to B-FABP(+) lines.

There is an inverse relationship between the number of GFAP-positive cells and aggressive behavior in glioma tumors. Glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive glioma, often have low GFAP expression, while low grade astrocytomas usually have high levels of GFAP (1Eng L.F. Rubinstein L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2Russell D.S. Rubinstein L.J. Pathology of Tumours of the Nervous System.

Dahl D. Roessmann U. Gambetti P. Cancer. 1980; 45: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In vitro studies directly correlate GFAP expression with a less aggressive behavior (5Murphy K.G. Hatton J.D. Sang H. J. Neurosurg. 1998; 89: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transfection of a GFAP expression vector into GFAP(−) malignant glioma cells results in decreased cell proliferation and decreased growth in soft agar (6Rutka J.T. Smith S.L. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3624-3631PubMed Google Scholar, 7Toda M. Miura M. Asou H. Sugiyama I. Kawase T. Uyemura K. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conversely, transfection of a GFAP antisense vector into a GFAP(+) line results in undetectable GFAP expression and increased proliferation rate, anchorage-independent growth, and invasiveness (8Rutka J.T. Hubbard S.L. Fukuyama K. Matsuzawa K. Dirks P.B. Becker L.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3267-3272PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that GFAP(+) malignant glioma lines express a second glial cell marker, brain fatty acid-binding protein (B-FABP) (9Godbout R. Bisgrove D.A. Shkolny D. Day III, R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Of 15 malignant glioma lines tested, 5 co-expressed B-FABP and GFAP, 8 expressed neither gene, while 2 had low levels of B-FABP and undetectable levels of GFAP. B-FABP is a 15-kDa protein normally found in the radial glial cells of the developing central nervous system as well as in select glial cell populations of the adult brain including glia limitans cells and Bergmann glial cells (10Feng L. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 895-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 11Kurtz A. Zimmer A. Schnütgen F. Brüning F. Spener F. Müller T. Development. 1994; 120: 2637-2649PubMed Google Scholar). B-FABP expression has been implicated in the establishment of the radial glial fiber system which serves to guide immature migrating neurons to their correct location in the central nervous system (10Feng L. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 895-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar,12Hatten M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 511-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Addition of anti-B-FABP antibody to primary cultures of cerebellar cells prevents both the extension of radial glial processes and the migration of neuronal cells along these processes, suggesting a role for B-FABP in relaying inductive signals required for glial cell differentiation. It is generally believed that radial glial cells are converted into astrocytes once neuronal migration in the developing brain is complete (13Schmechel D. Rakic P. Anat. Embryol. 1979; 156: 115-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Co-expression of GFAP and B-FABP in the same malignant glioma cells (9Godbout R. Bisgrove D.A. Shkolny D. Day III, R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) therefore suggests that these tumors are derived from cells that have the potential of expressing proteins that are normally produced at different stages in the glial differentiation pathway. We are studying the regulation of the B-FABP gene in order to identify transcription factors involved in the regulation of glial genes in malignant glioma and understand the basis for the variation in B-FABP expression in different malignant glioma lines. By sequencing and DNase I footprinting, we have identified two NFI-binding sites in the promoter region of the B-FABP gene. We present evidence that a phosphatase specifically expressed in B-FABP(+) cells is responsible for differential expression of the B-FABP gene in malignant glioma lines. Isolation of the human B-FABP gene has been previously described (9Godbout R. Bisgrove D.A. Shkolny D. Day III, R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A 3-kb EcoRI fragment containing exons I, II, and 1.8 kb of 5′-flanking DNA was subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced. The B-FABP transcription start site was mapped by primer extension using primer 5′-CTCTTTAGAGACAGGAGCGGGGATC-3′ located at position +43 to +67 bp in the 5′-untranslated region. A series of constructs with different amounts of 5′-flanking DNA (1.8 kb, 1.2 kb, 660 bp, 240 bp, and 140 bp) were linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and introduced into the U251 malignant glioma line by calcium phosphate-mediated DNA transfection. Cells were harvested 60 h after transfection and CAT activity measured using the protocol supplied by Promega. To control for plate to plate variation in transfection efficiency, Hirt DNA was isolated and quantitated by densitometric scanning of Southern blots (14Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Samples generating a greater than 2-fold variation in transfection efficiency based on Hirt DNA analysis were discarded. Site-directed mutagenesis of the fp1 and fp3 NFI DNA-binding sites was carried out by the method of Hemsley et al. (15Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To introduce mutations in the fp1 NFI-binding site, inverse polymerase chain reaction was performed on pCAT-240 using pfupolymerase (Stratagene) and the head-to-head mutagenic primer set 5′-ATCACTAAATTTTTGCCCACCCTC-3′ and 5′-TTAAATTGCAAACACACCCC-3′ (the NFI-binding site is in bold, underlined nucleotides represent the GG to AA mutation). After gel purification and recircularization, mutagenesis of the NFI-binding site was confirmed by automated sequencing (ABI Prism 310). A 190-bp XhoI/XbaI fragment containing the mutagenized fp1 NFI-binding site was exchanged for the corresponding wild type fragment in pCAT-1.8 to generate pCAT1.8(fp1*). To introduce mutations in the fp3 NFI-binding site (pCAT-1.8(fp3*)), we used mutagenic primers 5′-AGCCCCAT AA AATCCCTGCCGAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGGCAGGGAACGGGAAAATGAG-3′. The double mutant construct (pCAT-1.8(fp1*3*)) combines both the fp1 and fp3 mutations and was obtained by replacing the 1629-bp wild type EcoRI/XhoI fragment of pCAT1.8(fp1*) with the corresponding region of pCAT-1.8(fp3*). DNA probes labeled at one end were produced by linearizing plasmids containing either a 228-bp AluI fragment (−13 to −240 bp) or a 281-bp EcoO109I/XhoI fragment (−138 to −418 bp) with XbaI or HindIII (enzymes that cut in the polylinker region), respectively, and filling-in with Klenow polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Radiolabeled DNA fragments were released by digesting with either HindIII or XbaI, respectively, and purifying the DNA by gel electrophoresis and electroelution. The G + A chemical sequencing reaction was according to Belikov and Wieslander (16Belikov S. Wieslander L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 310Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from malignant glioma cell lines as described (17Roy R.J. Gosselin P. Guérin S.L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was carried out as described previously except that polyvinyl alcohol was omitted from the binding buffer (18Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled DNA probe (10 fmol) was incubated with the indicated malignant glioma nuclear extracts (20 μg) in binding buffer for 15 min on ice, followed by 2 min at room temperature. An equal volume of 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2 was added, followed by DNase I (Worthington, DPFF code) to 1 μg/ml. The samples were digested for 1 min and the reaction stopped with 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mmEDTA, 1% SDS. The DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were resuspended in formamide loading buffer and denatured at 90 °C for 3 min prior to electrophoresis through an 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The gel shift assay was carried out as described by O'Brien et al. (19O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.-C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotides (Scheme I) were annealed and radiolabeled by filling-in with Klenow polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dATP. Nuclear extracts (4 μg) were preincubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min at room temperature. When included, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added during the preincubation stage. AP-2, CTF/NFI, and Sp1 oligonucleotides were purchased from Promega. For supershift experiments, 2 μl of either anti-NFI antibody (rabbit polyclonal antiserum shown to react with the C-terminal half of NFI, obtained from Dr. Naoko Tanese, NYU Medical Center, NY) or anti-AP-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included in the binding reaction. Labeled probe DNA (25 fmol) was added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE. Dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts using potato acid phosphatase (PAP) was carried out by incubating 4 μg of T98 or U251 nuclear extracts with the indicated amount of PAP (Sigma) in 0.1 mMES buffer (pH 6.0) at room temperature for 30 min. To detect endogenous phosphatase activity, nuclear extracts were dialyzed in phosphate-free buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min prior to the gel shift assay. Where indicated, 50 mmK2PO4, pH 7.4, was added as a phosphatase inhibitor. The protein-DNA binding reaction (described under “Gel Shift Assay”) was scaled up 5-fold using partially methylated fp1 oligonucleotide probe labeled on either the coding or non-coding strands. DNA methylation and methylation interference assay were as described by Garabedian et al.(20Garabedian M.J. LaBaer J. Liu W.-H. Thomas J.R. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1993: 243-291Google Scholar). Briefly, bound and free DNA were excised from the mobility shift gel, eluted overnight in 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Eluted DNA was cleaved with piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min and residual piperidine removed by lyophilization. The DNA was resuspended in formamide loading buffer, denatured at 90 °C for 3 min, and resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Nuclear extracts (25 μg) prepared from B-FABP(+) and B-FABP(−) malignant glioma lines were electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gel followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose. For the dephosphorylation experiments, nuclear extracts (20 μg) from either U251 or T98 were treated with PAP in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, for 20 min at 30 °C. Filters were incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of anti-NFI antibody and the primary antibody detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We have previously shown that the human B-FABP gene is contained within a 4.5-kb region on chromosome 6q22–23 (9Godbout R. Bisgrove D.A. Shkolny D. Day III, R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To study the regulation of B-FABP transcription, we first mapped the transcription initiation site by primer extension. The human B-FABP gene start site is located 81 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon (data not shown) within three nucleotides of that reported for murine B-FABP (11Kurtz A. Zimmer A. Schnütgen F. Brüning F. Spener F. Müller T. Development. 1994; 120: 2637-2649PubMed Google Scholar, 21Feng L. Heintz N. Development. 1995; 121: 1719-1730PubMed Google Scholar). There is a putative TATA box (AATAAGA) at position −22 to −28 bp (Fig. 3). To determine the location of B-FABP regulatory elements in malignant glioma, we tested CAT reporter constructs containing different amounts of B-FABP 5′-flanking DNA (Fig.1 A). These constructs were introduced into U251, a malignant glioma line that expresses B-FABP. As shown in Fig. 1 B, a 2-fold increase in CAT activity was observed with 240 bp of 5′-flanking DNA (pCAT-240). Additional 5′-flanking DNA, to −660 and −1800 bp produced 6- and 8-fold increases in basal CAT activity, respectively. These results indicate that there are multiple positive regulatory elements in the −140 to −1800-bp region of the B-FABP gene. To identify DNA-protein interaction sites proximal to the B-FABP gene, we carried out DNase I footprinting analysis using two overlapping DNA fragments spanning the region from −13 to −418 bp: probe 1, from −13 to −240 bp, and probe 2, from −138 to −418 bp. Probe 1 or probe 2, labeled at one end, were incubated with nuclear extracts from both B-FABP(+) (M016, U251) and B-FABP(−) (T98) malignant glioma lines and partially digested with DNase I followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2 A, two DNase I protected regions were detected using probe 1: footprint 1 (fp1) from −35 to −58 bp and fp2 from −155 to −174 bp. Probe 2 identified three additional protected regions, from −237 to −260 bp (fp3), −303 to −328 bp (fp4), and −340 to −359 bp (fp5) (Fig. 2 B). Identical results were obtained with both B-FABP-positive and -negative nuclear extracts. These data are summarized in Fig.3. The sequences of the five footprints were analyzed using the Transfac program (22Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) and by visual inspection to identify known DNA binding motifs. Fp1, fp2, and fp3 all contained putative NFI-binding sites based on similarity to the NFI consensus binding site TGGA/C(N5)GCCAA (23Gronostajski R.M. Adhya S. Nagata R.A. Guggenheimer A. Hurwitz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 964-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Rosenfeld P.J. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 48: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 25Nagata K. Guggenheimer R.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6177-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The fp1 region contained the sequence TGGA(N5)GCCCA, fp2 TGGC(N4)GCCAA, and fp3 TGAA(N5)GCCGA. We used the mobility shift assay to determine whether a double-stranded oligonucleotide with a consensus NFI-binding site could effectively compete for protein binding to either fp1 or fp3. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to fp1 or fp3 were incubated with extracts from either B-FABP(−) T98 cells or B-FABP(+) U251 cells, along with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled fp1, fp2, fp3, AP-2, NFI, or Sp1 oligonucleotides. One major DNA-protein complex was observed with T98 nuclear extract using either the fp1 or fp3 probes (Fig.4). This complex was specifically competed out by fp1, fp3, and consensus NFI oligonucleotides, indicating that the factor bound to fp1 and fp3 is NFI or NFI-like. The inability of fp1, fp3, and NFI oligonucleotides to compete with fp2 indicates that fp2 does not represent a bona fide NFI-binding site, as suggested by the N-4 (as opposed to the N-5) spacing between the NFI half-sites. In contrast to T98, three major shifted complexes were detected with B-FABP(+) U251 nuclear extracts using either fp1 or fp3 as the probe. The intensity of all three bands was reduced upon addition of excess unlabeled fp1, fp3, and NFI oligonucleotides. These data suggest that, while generating different gel shift patterns, NFI or NFI-related proteins bind to the fp1 and fp3 regions of B-FABP promoter in both B-FABP(+) and B-FABP(−) malignant glioma lines. Antibody supershift experiments were carried out to determine whether the factor(s) bound to the fp1 region was recognized by a pan-specific anti-NFI antibody. Nuclear extract from B-FABP(−) T98, B-FABP(+) U251, or B-FABP(+) M016 was incubated with anti-NFI antibody prior to the addition of labeled fp1 oligonucleotide. A supershifted band (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 5) was observed with all three extracts. Of note, the intensity of the protein-DNA complexes was greatly reduced upon addition of anti-NFI antibody suggesting disruption of the complex upon binding of the antibody. No supershifted band or reduction in band intensity was observed with control anti-AP-2 antibody. The methylation interference assay was used to identify the purine residues in fp1 involved in DNA-protein interaction. Partially methylated fp1 oligonucleotide, radiolabeled on either the coding or non-coding strand, was isolated from the most abundant T98 gel shift complex and from the three major U251 complexes, and subjected to piperidine cleavage followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 6, methylation of G residues located at −52, −51, and −44 bp on the coding strand, and −43 and −42 bp on the non-coding strand interfered with the formation of the T98 and U251 DNA-protein complexes. Identical methylation interference patterns were obtained for both T98 (B) and U251 (B1, B2, and B3) complexes, indicating that the same or a similar recognition sequence is involved in their formation. The observed methylation interference pattern is consistent with that of several known NFI-binding sites (26De Vries E. van Driel W. van der Heuvel S.J.L. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Raymondjean M. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Together, the competition assays, supershift experiments and methylation interference experiments indicate that the NFI factor binds to the fp1 and fp3 regions. To assess the biological role of the fp1 and fp3 NFI-binding sites, we transfected U251 with pCAT-1.8 constructs containing mutations in one or both NFI core recognition sequences. The mutations introduced in fp1 (pCAT-1.8(fp1*)), fp3 (pCAT-1.8(fp3*)), or both fp1 and fp3 (pCAT-1.8(fp1*fp3*)) are indicated in Scheme I. We first verified that the introduced mutations would eliminate DNA-protein interaction using the gel shift assay. As shown in Fig. 7 A, mutant fp1* was unable to compete with normal fp1 for the formation of T98 and U251 DNA-protein complexes. Similar results were obtained with mutated fp3*. When introduced into U251 cells, the parent construct pCAT-1.8 produced an 8-fold increase in CAT activity compared with the pCAT-basic construct (Fig. 7 B). Mutation of the fp1 NFI-binding site reduced transcriptional activity to near background levels (1.4-fold increase over pCAT-basic). Mutation of the fp3 NFI-binding site did not significantly affect CAT activity, generating a 9-fold increase over pCAT-basic. CAT activity with the double mutant construct (pCAT-1.8(fp1*3*)) was 2.9-fold higher than with pCAT-basic. Based on these results, we conclude that the fp1-binding site is essential for B-FABP promoter activity. In contrast, the fp3 NFI-binding site does not appear to be critical for B-FABP promoter activity using this assay. The differences in the gel shift patterns observed with T98 and U251 nuclear extracts suggest differences in the NFI isoforms expressed in these cells. We tested 8 additional malignant glioma lines, four positive for B-FABP and four negative for B-FABP, to see if there was a correlation between gel shift patterns and B-FABP expression. The four B-FABP(−) lines (A172, CLA, M021, and U87) all gave rise to one or two major complexes with a slow migration rate, similar to the pattern obtained with T98 (Fig. 8). Nuclear extracts from 4/5 B-FABP(+) lines (M049, M103, U373, and U251) generated multiple complexes with faster migration rates than those observed with the B-FABP(−) lines. The M016 gel shift pattern varied with different nuclear extract preparations, often appearing as a hybrid of the two patterns, suggesting that this line may include a mixture of B-FABP(−) and B-FABP(+) cells. These results indicate that there is a correlation between B-FABP expression in malignant glioma cells and gel shift patterns, likely reflecting the presence of different forms of NFI in B-FABP(+) and B-FABP(−) cells. The different migration rates of the NFI protein-DNA complexes in B-FABP(+) and B-FABP(−) lines could be due to differential expression of the NFI genes in malignant glioma lines, alternative gene products from a single gene and/or post-translational modification of the NFI protein. NFI protein expression in malignant glioma lines was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NFI antibody. Although raised against NFI-C, this anti-NFI antibody cross-reacts with the NFI proteins produced from all four NFI genes (28Ortiz L. Aza-Blanc P. Zannini M. Cato A.C.B. Santisteban P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15213-15221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Two sets of bands, migrating at approximately 50 and 60 kDa, were observed in malignant glioma lines, in agreement with the reported molecular masses of known NFI family members, which range from 52 to 66 kDa (29Rosenfeld P.J. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1398-1408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most obvious difference between B-FABP(+) and B-FABP(−) lines was the ratio of the 50- and 60-kDa bands: in B-FABP(+) cells, the 50-kDa bands were predominant with relatively minor amounts of the 60-kDa bands, while in B-FABP(−) cells, the ratio of 50 to 60 kDa bands was approximately equal (Fig. 9 A). These results provide further evidence that B-FABP(+) and B-FABP(−) cell lines express distinctive subsets of NFI proteins or isoforms. Phosphorylation of NFI has been shown to modulate its transcriptional activity (30Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Yang B. Gilbert J.D. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3093-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether NFI was phosphorylated in our malignant glioma lines. Nuclear extracts from U251 and T98 were treated with PAP and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NFI antibody. The NFI proteins expressed in both U251 and T98 were converted to faster migrating species with PAP treatment (Fig. 9 B). The proteins migrating at ∼60 kDa, predominant in T98, were almost completely converted to faster migrating forms. The slower migrating component of the bands at ∼50 kDa also underwent an increase in mobility with phosphatase treatment. The migration pattern of T98 and U251 NFI proteins appeared virtually identical when nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.5 unit of PAP (compare lanes 4 and 10). Addition of sodium orthophosphate, a phosphatase inhibitor, resulted in complete inhibition of dephosphorylation at low concentrations of PAP and partial inhibition at high concentrations of PAP. These results indicate that a major difference in the NFI isoforms expressed in U251 and T98 is their phosphorylation state, with T98 NFI isoforms being hyperphosphorylated compared with U251 isoforms. The gel shift assay was carried out using labeled fp1 oligonucleotide and PAP-treated and -untreated nuclear extracts from T98 and U251. Increasing amounts of PAP resulted in a stepwise increase in the migration rate of NFI-DNA complexes, culminating in the appearance of a single major band where only a weak signal was previously obtained (indicated by the arrow in Fig.10). These results provide further evidence that the NFI isoforms present in T98 are hyperphosphorylated compared with the U251 isoforms. When we prepared T98 and U251 nuclear extracts in phosphate-free buffer, we noticed that U251 nuclear extracts contained a phosphatase activity capable of dephosphorylating NFI that was absent from T98 extracts. As shown in Fig. 11, incubation of these U251 nuclear extracts at 30 °C for 30 min prior to carrying out the gel shift assay resulted in complete dephosphorylation of NFI (lane 3). In contrast, no dephosphorylation activity was observed with T98 nuclear extracts (lane 1). This phosphatase activity was inhibited by the addition of 50 mm PO42−(compare lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, incubation of the T98 nuclear extract with an equal amount of U251 nuclear extract resulted in dephosphorylation of the hyperphosphorylated T98 NFI (compare lanes 1, 3, and 5). Addition of PO42− effectively inhibited this activity (lane 6). These results indicate that a phosphatase activity, present in B-FABP(+) cells but not in B-FABP(−) cells, may underlie differential NFI phosphorylation in malignant glioma. In a previous study, we showed that the subset of malignant glioma lines that expresses GFAP also expresses B-FABP (9Godbout R. Bisgrove D.A. Shkolny D. Day III, R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). GFAP is a marker of mature astrocytes and its expression in malignant glioma correlates with a less aggressive phenotype (2Russell D.S. Rubinstein L.J. Pathology of Tumours of the Nervous System.

https://openalex.org/W2081892234,"Previous evidence suggests multiple anesthetic binding sites on human serum albumin, but to date, we have only identified Trp-214 in an interdomain cleft as contributing to a binding site. We used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, photoaffinity labeling, amide hydrogen exchange, and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate the importance to binding of a large domain III cavity and compare it to binding character of the 214 interdomain cleft. The data show anesthetic binding in this domain III cavity of similar character to the interdomain cleft, but selectivity for different classes of anesthetics exists. Occupancy of these sites stabilizes the native conformation of human serum albumin. The features necessary for binding in the cleft appear to be fairly degenerate, but in addition to hydrophobicity, there is evidence for the importance of polarity. Finally, myristate isosterically competes with anesthetic binding in the domain III cavity and allosterically enhances anesthetic binding in the interdomain cleft.

Finally, myristate isosterically competes with anesthetic binding in the domain III cavity and allosterically enhances anesthetic binding in the interdomain cleft. human serum albumin wild type HSA recombinant wild type HSA double mutant (W214L/Y411W) HSA Serum albumin is the most prevalent soluble protein in humans, and it has a remarkable ability to bind a wide variety of metabolites, toxins, and pharmaceuticals (1Peters T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar). We have shown that binding of the inhaled halocarbon anesthetics to this protein correlates surprisingly well with their pharmacodynamics, suggesting that the binding sites may share features with important targets in the central nervous system (2Eckenhoff R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 610-615PubMed Google Scholar). Because the identity of those targets is still unrevealed (3Eckenhoff R.G. Johansson J.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 343-367PubMed Google Scholar), we have used serum albumin as a surrogate to explore the molecular features underlying inhaled anesthetic binding. We have previously reported that bovine serum albumin binds halothane with dissociation constants of about 1 mm and that human serum albumin binds with about 3–5-fold lower affinity (4Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Eckenhoff R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Photolabeling and fluorescence quenching allowed localization of halothane binding to the immediate vicinity of the two tryptophan residues of bovine serum albumin (Trp-214 and Trp-135). HSA1 has a leucine residue at the analogous 135 position, so the lower affinity of HSA may in part be due to the lack of this tryptophan. However, because both of the experimental approaches used in those studies may overrepresent interactions with tryptophan residues, there may be other halothane binding sites in the two albumin molecules that control the overall effect. Indeed, estimates of binding stoichiometry from photolabeling,19F NMR, or differential scanning calorimetry studies suggest 3–5 binding sites at saturation, although some of these may be of very low affinity (6Tanner J.W. Eckenhoff R.G. Liebman P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Ueda I. Yamanaka M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1812-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8DuBois B.W. Evers A.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One candidate for an anesthetic binding site is a large hydrophobic cavity in domain III that contains tyrosine-411 as a lining residue (9Sugio S. Kashima A. Mochizuki S. Noda M. Kobayashi K. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). In order to explore this cavity as a new binding site for inhaled anesthetics and compare it to the known interdomain site (Trp-214) also shown in Fig. 1, we used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, hydrogen exchange, fluorescence spectroscopy, and photolabeling. [14C]Halothane (51 mCi/mmol) from NEN Life Science Products was stored as a gas in the dark at room temperature. It was condensed and diluted immediately into buffer to make a 7 mm solution immediately before use. Isoflurane (1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) was obtained from Anaquest (Liberty Corner, NJ), and halothane (1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane) was obtained from Halocarbon Laboratories (Hackensack, NJ). 3HOH was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech at 100 mCi/mmol. The anesthetic (1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (F3))/nonanesthetic (1, 2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (F6)) pair was obtained from PCR Chemical (Gainesville, FL). All other chemicals were reagent grade or better and were obtained from Sigma. For our studies, we synthesized recombinant wild type HSA (rwtHSA), two single mutants (W214L and W214E), and one double mutant (W214L/Y411W, hereafter called dmHSA). In this latter mutant, placing the tryptophan fluorophore in the 411 cavity permitted monitoring of anesthetic binding by fluorescence quenching (4Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and also is expected to enhance halothane photolabeling. Specific mutations were introduced into the HSA-coding region in a plasmid vector containing the entire HSA coding region as described previously (10Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Mandel M. Bhagavan N.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Jameson D.M. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7012-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The experimental methods consist of the following steps. With human liver cDNA as template, the entire coding region of the HSA gene, including the native signal sequence, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, MA). The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the plasmid vector pHiL-D2 (Invitrogen Corp.) using standard cloning techniques. PHil-D2 is a shuttle vector that can be manipulated by cloning in Escherichia coli and that can also be used to introduce genes into the yeast species Pichia pastoris (Invitrogen Corp.) by homologous recombination. Specific mutations were introduced into the HSA coding region by using site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (10Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Mandel M. Bhagavan N.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Each pHiL-D2 expression plasmid contained a methanol-inducible promoter upstream of the HSA coding region. For each expression plasmid, a yeast clone that contained the expression cassette stably integrated into the yeast chromosomal DNA was isolated. The native HSA signal sequence, which was left on the HSA coding region, directed high level secretion of mature HSA into the growth medium. The total genomic DNA from each P. pastoris clone used to produce a particular HSA species was isolated using standard techniques. The genomic DNA isolated from each clone was used as template to amplify the entire HSA coding region by polymerase chain reaction. For each clone, the entire HSA coding region was sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination technique, and the translation product corresponding to this sequence matched a previously published cDNA HSA at all amino acid positions except for the mutation introduced into a particular HSA mutant. The secreted HSA was isolated from growth medium as follows. The medium was brought to 50% saturation with ammonium sulfate at room temperature. The temperature was then lowered to 4 °C, and the pH was adjusted to 4.4, the isoelectric point of HSA. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in distilled water. Dialysis was carried out for 48 h at 4 °C against 100 volumes of distilled water, followed by 24 h against 100 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 40 mm phosphate, pH 7.4). The solution was loaded onto a column of Cibacron blue immobilized on Sepharose 6B (Sigma). After washing the column with 10 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, the HSA was eluted with 3 mNaCl. The eluent was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline and passed over a column of Lipidx-1000 (Packard Instruments) to remove hydrophobic ligands possibly bound to the HSA (13Glatz J.F.C. Veerkamp J.H. J. Biophys. Methods. 1983; 8: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The resulting protein migrated as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Stock solutions of HSA (4–10 mg/ml) were diluted to ∼0.1 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. All photolabeling buffers were first equilibrated with 100% argon. To investigate competitive binding interactions, some samples contained saturating myristate (10-fold molar excess over HSA), and others contained 7 mm isoflurane, an inhaled anesthetic of the ether class. To the protein solution in 2 ml, 0.5-mm-path length quartz cuvettes was added enough [14C]halothane to make a ∼0.2 mm solution. This last addition eliminated any gas space from the cuvette, which was then tightly sealed with Teflon stoppers. After ∼2 min of mixing equilibration (the myristate-containing samples were incubated for 30 min), cuvettes were exposed to 254 nm light at 5 mm from an Hg(Ar) pencil calibration lamp (Oriel Instruments Inc.) for 30 s, with constant mixing by enclosed microstir bars. Protein was concentrated and washed in Centricon 10-kDa cutoff filters, diluted, lyophilized, and suspended in 70% formic acid with CNBr, 1:1 with protein by mass. After 24 h, this suspension was lyophilized again, suspended in sample buffer, heated, and the CNBr fragments were separated by 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Stained, dried gels were placed on Amersham Hyperfilm to prepare autoradiograms. Incorporated label was normalized to protein mass using a ratio of optical density (autoradiogram) to reflective density (stained gel). These inhaled anesthetics contain heavy atoms that can quench tryptophan fluorescence if bound in the immediate vicinity (<5Å) (4Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, in order to determine whether the various inhaled anesthetics can gain access to and exhibit selectivity for the tryptophan-containing regions of the rwtHSA or the dmHSA, increasing concentrations of these compounds (from stock buffer solutions) were added to 4-ml fluorescence cuvettes containing ∼2 μm protein, with or without a 10-fold molar excess of myristate, and examined in a Shimadzu RF 5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer using 295 nm excitation and emission scanning. Care was taken to eliminate all air from the cuvette with the last addition. Amide hydrogen-tritium exchange was used to measure binding of anesthetics to HSA (15Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1994; 20: 4-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 16Englander S.W. Englander J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), because it is a very sensitive measure of shift in the folded/unfolded equilibria, and therefore the effect of an added ligand on the magnitude of the equilibrium was constant. Specific binding to the native tertiary structure will shift the equilibrium toward the native conformer, exposing internal amide hydrogens less often and therefore slowing hydrogen exchange with water, whereas nonspecific binding will shift the equilibrium toward less folded conformers, resulting in more rapid exchange of the normally protected amide hydrogens with water hydrogens. For these measurements, protein solutions (10 mg/ml) were incubated with ∼5 mCi of 3HOH in 1 m GdnCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.5, for at least 18 h at room temperature. The GdnCl increased exposure of protected hydrogens to solvent, and the elevated pH increased the rate of chemical hydrogen exchange; both conditions were intended to ensure equilibration of all exchangeable hydrogens in the protein prior to initiation of exchange-out. Free 3HOH was removed and the buffer was exchanged with a PD-10 gel filtration column (Sigma), and exchange-out was thereby initiated. After recovery from the column, the protein solution was immediately transferred to prefilled Hamilton (Reno, NV) gas-tight syringes containing 7.0 mm halothane or isoflurane concentration and solvent conditions and equipped with repeaters (see figure legends). Aliquots were precipitated with 2 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid at timed intervals over at least 6 h. The precipitated protein was rapidly vacuum filtered through Whatman GF/B filters and washed with 8 ml of ice-cold 2% trichloroacetic acid. 3H retained by the protein was determined by liquid scintillation counting as above. Exchange-out buffer conditions were adjusted to allow focus on the last 5–10% of hydrogens over a 6-h period, to ensure that global unfolding events were being monitored. Protection factor ratios were determined by dividing the time required for a given hydrogen to exchange-out under the control condition by that required for the same hydrogen of the mutant or anesthetic condition, and ΔΔG was determined using the equation ΔΔG = RT ln(protection factor ratio). As expected, total label incorporation into the mutant HSA proteins depended on the presence of a tryptophan residue (Table I). In the rwtHSA, dominant labeling was observed in CNBr-21, the fragment containing Trp-214, and to a lesser degree in CNBr-14, the fragment containing Tyr-411 (Table I and Fig. 2). On transferring the tryptophan from 214 to the 411 position in the dmHSA, there is a clear shift of labeling to this fragment, demonstrating the presence of halothane in this cavity. Labeling of the 14-kDa fragment was clearly inhibited by the presence of saturating myristate more than the 21-kDa fragment was in both the rwtHSA and the dmHSA (TableII). Surprisingly, isoflurane also inhibited labeling of the 411-containing fragment more than that containing 214.Table ILabel distribution in intact HSA and CNBr fragmentsHSAIntactCNBr 21 (214)CNBr 14 (411)rwtHSA100 ± 9100 ± 14100 ± 10W214E53 ± 1018 ± 276 ± 11W214L57 ± 730 ± 472 ± 3DmHSA112 ± 1237 ± 7168 ± 10Numbers are % ± S.E. of wild type ratios of reflective density (gel) to absorbance (autoradiogram) of the indicated gel band (n = 3).

With 295 nm excitation, the fluorescence emission of rwtHSA was maximal at 342 nm and was >90% quenched by halothane with a IC50 of 3.9 mm in accordance with previous results (4Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (TableIII and Fig.3). Isoflurane and F3 also quenched about half of the rwtHSA fluorescence emission (IC50 = 15.2 and 5.4 mm, respectively), but even saturating concentrations of F6 (∼200 μm) produced a mean emission decrease of only 10.5 ± 1.0% (Figs. 4and 5). Halothane shifted the emission maxima from 342 to 330 nm, but isoflurane and F3 only shifted it to 337 and 340 nm, respectively, and F6 produced no shift at all. In dmHSA, the fluorescence maxima in the absence of any anesthetic occurred at a significantly shorter wavelength (332 nm) as compared with the rwtHSA, confirming the predicted more hydrophobic nature of this internal cavity as compared with the 214 cleft. Similar to Trp-214, the Trp-411 signal in dmHSA was ∼80% reduced by halothane, with an IC50 of 3.4 mm, and a blue shift of only 2 nm (Fig. 3). Maximal concentrations of isoflurane reduced emission intensity by only 30%, with no significant shift in wavelength and an IC50 of about 3.1 mm (Fig. 4). F6 also decreased intensity by ∼30% with no wavelength shift, but IC50 could not be reliably calculated (Fig. 5). In contrast, F3 increased fluorescence emission by 20% (Fig. 5). To determine whether the F3 cyclobutane is binding in this 411 cavity in a nonquenching orientation (because it has only a single Cl atom), we examined its ability to reduce quenching by halothane in a competition experiment. Fig. 6 shows that 7.5 mm F3 was able to inhibit more than 50% of the quenching produced by 2.5 mm halothane in the dmHSA, confirming that F3 binds in this cavity in a nonquenching orientation. The reduced quenching of Trp-411 by isoflurane (also containing a single Cl atom) as compared with Trp-214 may also be due to suboptimal quenching orientation in the cavity, so the relationship between IC50and KD may be shifted.Table IIISigmoid fit parameters for wtHSA and W214L/Y411W (dmHSA)Molecule, ligandSlope ± S.E.IC50, 95% CIMaximum quenching%wtHSA, halothane−1.4 ± 0.13.9, 3.4–4.51003-aBottom values held constant at this value in fit.wtHSA, isoflurane−1.2 ± 0.112.0, 10.9–13.2873-aBottom values held constant at this value in fit.wtHSA, F3−1.9 ± 0.15.4, 4.4–6.661wtHSA, myristate, halothane−1.0 ± 0.14.9, 4.2–5.81003-aBottom values held constant at this value in fit.wtHSA, myristate, isoflurane−1.1 ± 0.16.8, 4.8–9.787dmHSA, halothane−1.1 ± 0.23.4, 1.9–6.178dmHSA, isoflurane−2.0 ± 0.32.9, 2.3–3.728Sufficient quenching to produce a reliable fit was not possible for wtHSA with F6 and DM with F3, F6, or any anesthetic with myristate.

As expected, in the W214L and W214E mutants, total fluorescence intensity (280 nm excitation) was much reduced, now predominantly arising from the 18 tyrosine residues. This signal was not significantly altered by up to 10 mm halothane, demonstrating that halothane binding is not so widespread, or the resulting structural changes so large, that tyrosine fluorescence is affected. Myristate increased the intensity of the fluorescence signal by 33% and shifted the emission maxima from 342 to 333 nm in rwtHSA (Table IIIand Fig. 3). Halothane was still able to quench Trp-214 fluorescence in the presence of myristate, as shown in Fig. 3, with an essentially unaltered IC50. Isoflurane, on the other hand, quenched the 214 signal more effectively in the presence of myristate, as shown in Fig. 4. Myristate binding enhanced the fluorescence intensity of Trp-411 in the dmHSA by 81% but with no accompanying shift in emission maxima. In contrast to the 214 position, the ability of halothane or isoflurane to quench Trp-411 was essentially eliminated by myristate (Fig. 3). As compared with bovine serum albumin (2Eckenhoff R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 610-615PubMed Google Scholar), the exchange rate of the human protein under the same conditions was about 2-fold slower, suggesting that rwtHSA is more stable than bovine serum albumin by ∼0.5 kcal/mol. All three HSA mutants were less stable than the wild type, in the order of wtHSA > W214E > W214L > dmHSA, with the largest difference being about 0.9 kcal/mol (Fig.7). The effect of 7 mmhalothane on the folded/unfolded equilibrium was similar for the rwtHSA and the three mutant proteins, but some differences were noted (TableIV). Both of the single mutants were stabilized by halothane more than was rwtHSA, with W214E > W214L (Fig. 8). The dmHSA was also well stabilized by halothane, to a small but significantly greater degree than expected from the W214L mutant itself, perhaps indicating improved interactions in the 411 cavity. The halogenated methyl ethyl ether, isoflurane, stabilized all of the HSA proteins similarly, but less so than halothane.Table IVEffect of anesthetic on HSA global stabilityHSAHalothane (7 mm)Isoflurane (7 mm)Wild type1.06 ± 0.24-aValues are ΔΔG, mean ± S.E.

The apparent KD values are within an order of magnitude of clinical EC50 values, suggesting that these serum albumin sites may bear some resemblance to those linked to anesthetic action. The binding sites show a modest degree of selectivity for the different compounds. In order of decreasing affinity, the 214 site binds halothane > F3 > isoflurane; and the 411 site binds isoflurane = halothane > F3. Although halothane binds similarly to the two sites, both the fluorescence quenching potency and photolabeling experiments show that isoflurane prefers the 411 cavity to the 214 cleft. This does not appear to depend on the presence of tryptophan, because isoflurane also protected photolabeling of the Tyr-411 fragment in the wild type protein more than Trp-214. Because the 214 pocket is more polar than the 411 cavity (based on tryptophan emission maxima), and because isoflurane is somewhat less hydrophobic than halothane, the basis for this preference is not clear but may relate to a more optimum size of the 411 cavity, providing for better van der Waals interactions. Also, F3 binds only in a nonquenching position in the 411 cavity, whereas it can effectively quench the 214 tryptophan. We interpret this to indicate that the 411 cavity is smaller and F3 is more sterically constrained, whereas a larger 214 pocket allows F3 mobility and hence a greater probability of a quenching orientation, but the necessarily weaker van der Waals interactions should result in lower affinity (higher IC50). We could not confirm this because we could not obtain reliable fluorescence data for F3 binding to the double mutant. Isoflurane may behave more similarly to F3, as reflected by the lower IC50and degree of Trp-411 quenching, than to Trp-214. F6, the nonanesthetic cyclobutane, minimally occupies either binding site, at least in part due to its exceedingly low solubility in water. In addition to the obvious requirement for hydrophobicity, these results point out the importance of at least two general features of inhaled anesthetic binding sites, volume and polarity. It is conceivable that the presence of tryptophan in the 411 cavity changes binding energetics relative to wtHSA. Indeed, slight enhancement of stabilization, as reflected by the amide hydrogen exchange results, is consistent with this possibility. However, the similarity of inhibition of photolabeling by halothane and isoflurane in both the dmHSA and wtHSA indicate that the differences are not large and that, even in the presence of the smaller tyrosine, binding in this cavity clearly occurs in the wtHSA. Based on recent x-ray diffraction studies, myristate has five binding sites on HSA (PDB code 1BJ5), two of which are proximal to the 411 cavity (17Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). This predicts that myristate should competitively reduce anesthetic binding to this cavity, which both the fluorescence and photolabeling experiments confirm. This is additional strong evidence that places the anesthetics in this cavity and is consistent with the possibility that some components of anesthetic action may be based on competitive interactions with native ligands (18Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Although myristate binding produces allosteric effects to the 214 environment, as shown by the fluorescence blue-shift, there is no significant effect on halothane binding in this cleft. Isoflurane binding, on the other hand, is enhanced in the presence of myristate. Such cooperative binding equilibria may occur in physiologically relevant anesthetic targets. Anesthetic enhancement of agonist binding is thought to underlie the potentiation of inhibitory ligand gated channel activity, and a coupled equilibria dictates that in the presence of agonist, anesthetic binding affinity should also be increased (19Harris B.D. Moody E.J. Basile A.S. Skolnick P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Raines D.E. Zachariah V.T. Anesthesiology. 1999; 90: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have confirmed this prediction using autoradiography of photolabeled rat brain slices (21Eckenhoff M.F. Eckenhoff R.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 371-376PubMed Google Scholar). Also, we and others have previously reported a similar enhancement of anesthetic binding in firefly luciferase on binding ATP/Mg, 2R. G. Eckenhoff, J. W. Tanner, and P. Liebman, submitted for publication. (22Moss G.W.J. Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but the structural basis for neither instance is yet clear. The finding of another instance of cooperative binding with a native ligand in this study suggests that this might be a widespread feature of anesthetic interactions with proteins. The hydrogen exchange results are consistent with the above data in that the folded state is significantly stabilized by low concentrations of these compounds. It is remarkable that the three different residues in the 214 pocket have such small effects on the stabilization of the folded state by anesthetics. This could be due to this binding site contributing only a small influence to the overall stabilization, or it could be that the replaced residues do not significantly alter the favorable interactions within this pocket. The former seems unlikely, because the hydrogen exchange data (using ΔΔG =nRTln(1 + [halothane]/KD), where n is the number of sites) suggests an averagehalothane/HSA KD of ∼10 mm, whereas the apparent halothane KD for either the 214 or 411 site is estimated to be less than 4 mm from the fluorescence quenching results. Thus, it is more likely that the interactions necessary for halothane binding in the 214 pocket are fairly degenerate and can be provided by either the leucine or glutamate. It is also possible that the 214 residue does not interact with the bound anesthetic at all, but this is unlikely because heavy atom fluorescence quenching is thought to be a close-range event (<5 Å) (4Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and removal of the tryptophan 214 residue in the double mutant dramatically reduces photolabeling of the CNBr fragment containing position 214. A final possibility is that the small destabilization of the protein by these mutations may improve access for halothane to other cavities, through increased dynamics and cavity volume distribution, but this seems unlikely because isoflurane stabilization was not similarly enhanced by the mutations. Given the hydrophobicity of halothane and other inhaled anesthetics, it is somewhat surprising that glutamate provides a more favorable interaction between halothane and HSA as reflected by the hydrogen exchange results. This may indicate a necessity for polarity in the otherwise hydrophobic cavity/cleft, because most potent inhaled anesthetics are known to have an asymmetric distribution of “acidic hydrogens” and a small dipole moment (24Scharf D. Laasonen K. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1996; 256: 276-282Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the wild type protein, several approaches suggest that the CBrClH end of halothane interacts with the π electrons of the tryptophan residue (25Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar), leaving the trifluoromethyl end to interact with the multiple positively charged residues in this cavity. The glutamate may therefore replace the partial negative charges of the indole ring with a full charge, perhaps providing for improved immobilization of the halothane molecule as compared with the uncharged leucine residue. The F3 and F6 cyclobutanes were included here in an attempt to further distinguish between the two binding sites and to provide some pharmacodynamic relevance. Both F3 and F6 are hydrophobic and would be expected to produce anesthesia based on the well known correlation of hydrophobicity and potency. Although F3 produces anesthesia in rodents, F6 does not, even at saturating concentrations (∼102lower than F3) (26Koblin D.D. Chortkoff B.S. Laster M.J. Eger E.I. Halsey M.J. Ionescu P. Anesth. Analg. 1994; 79: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because F6 is far less polar than F3, we expected to observe selectivity for these two binding sites, because, clearly, the 411 cavity is less polar than the 214 pocket. In agreement with this prediction, F6 produced some fluorescence quenching of Trp-411, suggesting partial occupancy, but almost no quenching in the more polar 214 site. The anesthetic cyclobutane F3, as well as the clinical anesthetics isoflurane and halothane, bound reasonably well to both the 214 and 411 sites, perhaps with a subtle preference for the cavity. It seems likely that the lack of anesthetic potency in F6 is due to a thermodynamic limitation of binding site occupancy, rather than steric limitations (23Eckenhoff R.G. Tanner J.S. Johansson J.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In summary, at least two distinct binding sites for inhaled anesthetics exist on human serum albumin, one an internal cavity and the other a deep hydrophobic pocket. These sites show low millimolar affinity, are selective for the different inhaled anesthetics, and bind the nonimmobilizer F6 poorly. Occupancy of these sites stabilizes the native conformation of the molecule. The features necessary for binding in the pocket appear to be fairly degenerate, but in addition to hydrophobicity, there is evidence for the importance of polarity. Finally, myristate isosterically competes with anesthetic binding in the internal cavity and allosterically enhances anesthetic binding in the cleft. We are indebted to Kin Chan for expert technical assistance, to Maryellen Eckenhoff for reviewing the manuscript and assistance with the figures, and to Qing Feng Zhong for preparation of the HSA figure."
https://openalex.org/W2113273012,"Human psychophysical studies have demonstrated that, for stimuli near the threshold of visibility, detection of motion in one direction is unaffected by the superimposition of motion in the opposite direction. To investigate the neural basis for this perceptual phenomenon, we recorded from directionally selective neurons in macaque visual area MT (middle temporal visual area). Contrast thresholds obtained for single gratings moving in a neuron's preferred direction were compared with those obtained for motion presented simultaneously in the neuron's preferred and antipreferred directions. A simple model based on probability summation between neurons tuned to opposite directions could sufficiently account for contrast thresholds revealed psychophysically, suggesting that area MT is likely to provide the neural basis for contrast detection of stimuli modulated in time."

By controlling or gating the transition between their open and closed states, specific cellular functions can be produced (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992: 472-503Google Scholar). Several membrane and cytosolic mechanisms are involved in the channel gating. For instance, a voltage-gated ion channel can be activated by depolarization; intra- and extracellular ligands can retain a ligand-gated ion channel to the open or closed state. The gating of inward rectifier K+(Kir)1 channels is carried out by membrane-bound and cytosolic molecules including G proteins, nucleotides, and protons (2Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The gating of Kir channels by protons may allow cells to produce corresponding responses to a change in intra- and extracellular pH seen under a number of pathophysiological conditions. Several members in the Kir family are regulated by intra- and extracellular protons (3Tsai T.D. Shuck M.E. Thompson D.P. Bienkowski M.J. Lee K.S. Am. J.

Channels activity is completely shut off by acidification, whereas full channel openings are achieved with an increase in the pH level. In Kir1.1, Lys80 is a critical player in channel gating by intracellular protons, although several other residues are also involved (5Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Lys80 may become protonated at acidic pH by its interactions with other protein domains, leading to a closure of the channel (9Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S.

In Kir2.3 (HIR), we have previously identified a short motif in the N terminus that is crucial in the gating of this channel by intracellular protons (11Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y. Yang J. Cui N.R. Li Y.

Unlike Kir1.1, there is no proton-binding site within or nearby to this motif in HIR. Thus, it is possible that protons interact with other intermediate sites that subsequently act on this short motif and close the channel. Recent studies have shown that a large number of residues in the channel proteins are involved in the gating process by pH (5Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y.

A potential mechanism is that proton binding initiates a cascade of events involving consequential interactions of the proton-binding sites with other protein domains, leading to a rearrangement of protein conformation and a switch of channel activity. To test this hypothesis, we studied the gating of Kir by intracellular protons (8Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol.

Thus, the gating site seems to be separate from the proton-sensing sites in this channel. Our results indicate that interactions of different parts of channel proteins occur during the gating process, demonstrating a novel channel-gating mechanism of K+ channels by intracellular protons. Kir2.3 (HIR) and Kir2.1 (IRK1) cDNAs were generously provided by Carol A. Vandenberg and Lily L. Jan, respectively. These cDNAs were inserted into pcDNA3.1, a eukaryotic expression vector that allows expression of its insert gene in eukaryotic cells without injecting it into the nucleus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, NM). Chimerical constructs were prepared by the overlap extension at the junction of the interested domains using polymerase chain reaction (Pfu DNA polymerase, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Junction sites of all chimeras were chosen where there were conserved amino acid residues. Thus, none of the chimeras had missing or additional residues at the junction sites. Site-specific mutations were made using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Orientation of the constructs and correct mutations were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Oocytes were surgically removed from adult frog (Xenopus laevis) and treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Type I, Sigma) in the OR2 solution (82 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and HEPES, pH 7.4) for 90 min at room temperature (∼25 °C). After three washes with OR2 solution, cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 vector (40–50 ng in 50 nl of double-distilled water) was injected into the oocytes. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in ND-96 solution containing (in mm) NaCl 96, KCl 2, MgCl2 1, CaCl21.8, HEPES 5, and sodium pyruvate 2.5, plus 100 mg/liter geneticin (pH 7.4). Xenopus oocytes were placed in a semi-closed recording chamber (Medical System, Greenvale, NY), where perfusion solution bathed both the top and bottom surfaces of the oocytes. The perfusate and the superfused gas entered the chamber from the inlet at one end and flowed out at the other end. There was a 3 × 15-mm gap on the top cover of the chamber, which served as the gas outlet and as access to the oocytes for recording microelectrodes. The perfusate (KD 90) contained 90 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). At baseline, the chamber was ventilated with atmospheric air. Exposure of the oocytes to CO2 was carried out by switching the superfused air to a gas mixture containing CO2 (15%) balanced with 21% O2 and N2. The high dissolvability of CO2 resulted in a detectable change in intra- or extracellular acidification in as fast as 10 s in these oocytes (11Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y. Yang J. Cui N.R. Li Y. Chanchevalap S.

Whole-cell currents were studied on the oocytes 2–4 days after injection. Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using an amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (∼25 °C). The extracellular solution contained 90 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were impaled using electrodes filled with 3 m KCl. One of the electrodes (1.0–2.0 megaohms) served as voltage and the other electrode (0.3–0.6 megaohms) was used for current recording. Current records were low-pass-filtered (Bessel, 4-pole filter, 3 dB at 5 kHz), digitized at 5 kHz (12-bit resolution), and stored on computer disc for later analysis (pClamp 6, Axon Instruments). Patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature as described (8Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Yang Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 520: 921-927Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, fire-polished patch pipettes (0.5–2.0 megaohms) were made from 1.2-mm borosilicate capillary glass. The oocyte vitelline membranes were mechanically removed after exposing hypertonic solution (400 mosm) for 5 min. The stripped oocytes were placed in FVPP solution (in mm: 40 KCl, 75 potassium gluconate, 5 potassium fluoride, 0.1 sodium vanadate, 10 potassium pyrophosphate, 1 EGTA, 0.2 adenosine diphosphate, 10 PIPES, pH 7.4, 10 glucose, and 0.1 spermine) for giant inside-out patch preparation. The same solution was applied to the pipette. Macroscopic current recordings were performed using FVPP solutions containing equal concentrations of K+applied to both sides of the patch membranes. In a control experiment, we found that macroscopic currents recorded from giant inside-out patches showed less than 10% reduction over a 17-min period of recordings in FVPP solution. Current records were low-pass filtered (2000 Hz, Bessel 4-pole filter, −3 dB), digitized (10 kHz, 12-bit resolution) and stored on computer disc for later analysis (PCLAMP 6, Axon Instruments). Junction potentials between bath and pipette solutions were appropriately nulled before seal formation. A parallel perfusion system was used to administer agents to patches at a rate of ∼1 ml/min with no dead space (8Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Yang Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 520: 921-927Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Low pH exposures were carried out using FVPP solutions that had been titrated to various pH levels as required. DNA fragments encoding the sequences of N- or C-terminal regions of HIR (HIRn, AA 1–50; HIRc, AA 171–445) were synthesized using polymerase chain reaction. The N-terminal region was fused to glutathionineS-transferase (GST) in pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by insertion of a polymerase chain reaction fragment of the HIRn at BamHI and XhoI restriction sites created with primers. Immediately following the BamHI site was the first methionine residue of the HIRn, so that there was no additional residue introduced. At the C-terminal end of the GST-HIRn, however, there were seven additional residues (LERPHRD) coming along with the vector before the stop codon in the plasmid. The HIRn was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 cells (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by transformation using 0.25 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 25–30 °C for 3–5 h. Bacteria were lysed with a French pressure cell in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, or PIPES, pH 6.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. Soluble proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 17,000 × g. The fusion proteins were purified with glutathionine-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The FLAG epitope was fused to HIRc using polymerase chain reaction. At the N-terminal end, a methonine residue was added with the Kozak sequence, followed by Ile171 of HIR. The FLAG sequence was introduced to the C-terminal end by removing the stop codon. Thus, there was no other residue missing in the HIRc peptide. The construct was then cloned into pcDNA3.1 and expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293, ATCC, Manassas, VA). 48 h after transfection, proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (pH 7.4 or 6.6). Glutathionine-Sepharose beads that had been pre-linked to GST fusion proteins were mixed with HEK cell extracts in lysis buffer (pH 7.4 or 6.6) rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Similar amounts of GST fusion proteins were used for each assay. Beads were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with 0.7 ml of lysis buffer (pH 7.5 or 6.6). After a final wash, beads were heated in sample buffers for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and bound proteins were separated with 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). After transferring the protein to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, binding to GST fusion proteins were detected by an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). Color development was completed with an alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Interaction assays were repeated two to four times to determine their reproducibility. Mutation analyses were performed on HIR and IRK1. Chimerical recombinations of intracellular N and C termini were presented using three letters, with the first and last representing the originations of N and C termini and the middle letter for the source of the rest sequence, e.g. HIH, C and N termini of the mutant were from HIR and the rest from IRK1; HII, the N terminus was from HIR and rest from IRK1. Chimerical mutants within the C or N terminus were named with two pieces of information: 1) the channel in which mutations were constructed, such XXXHIR, XXXIRK, and HIHXXX (mutants were made based on HIR, IRK1, and HIH, respectively); 2) the location of the mutations, such as N1–50HIH, amino acids from 1 to 50 in HIH were mutated to a corresponding sequence in IRK1; IRK179–238C, residues from 179 to 238 were mutated to those in HIR. Site-specific mutations were described using single-letter amino acids symbols, e.g. H191A, histidine at position 191 was mutated to alanine. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n ≥ 4). Differences in means were examined with the Student's ttest or an analysis-of-variance test and were accepted as significant if p ≤ 0.05. Whole-cell currents were studied inXenopus oocytes that had received an injection of HIR cDNA or one of its mutants. In the two-electrode voltage clamp mode, inward rectifying currents as large as 20 μA were seen in most oocytes. These currents were sensitive to micromolar concentrations of Ba2+ and Cs+ (8Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y. Yang J. Cui N.R. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Exposure of the oocytes to 15% CO2 for 4–5 min produced a fast and reversible inhibition of these inward rectifying currents (Fig.1 A). The inhibition of HIR currents by CO2 was mediated by decreases in pH, since selectively lowering intra- and extracellular pH (pHi, pHo) to the corresponding levels (pHi 6.6, pHo6.2) seen during 15% CO2 exposure inhibited the HIR currents to the same degree as hypercapnia (8Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.R. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y. Yang J. Cui N.R. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Macroscopic currents recorded in excised patches were similarly inhibited (Fig.1 B). The consistent pH sensitivity seen in whole-cell recordings and excised patches suggests that proton-mediated channel inhibition is independent of other cytosolic factors. The IRK1 channel, however, did not respond to 15% CO2 and pHi6.0–7.4 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Dependence of the CO2/pH sensitivity on certain parts of the HIR channel protein. A, because HIR responds to hypercapnia (15% CO2) but Kir2.1 (IRK1) does not, chimeras were constructed between these two channels to identify the intracellular pH-sensing domain. Whole-cell currents were studied in two-electrode clamp. Their sensitivity to 15% CO2 was examined as described for Fig. 1 A and are presented as percentage inhibition of the currents. The HIH carrying both the N (AA 1–50) and C termini (AA 171–445) from HIR and the rest of its structures from IRK1 (AA 87–178) showed CO2 sensitivity almost identical to the wild-type HIR. In IHH, the entire HIR N-terminal region (AA 1–50) was substituted with its counterpart in IRK1 (AA 1–86). The IHH lost sensitivity to CO2. When IRK1 N-terminal domain (AA 1–86) was replaced with the corresponding sequence in HIR (AA 1–50), the mutant channel (HII) became CO2-sensitive. Extension of the mutation to include the N terminus through the M2 region of HIR (HHI; AA 171–445 in HIR were replaced with AA 179–428 in IRK1) did not significantly change the CO2sensitivity. B, concentration-dependent inhibition of K+ currents by acidic pH in inside-out patches. Currents were studied in inside-out patches under conditions described in Fig. 1 B. The current amplitude can be expressed as a function of pHi using the Hill equation:y = 1/[1 + (pK a/x) h ], where pK a (apparent pK) is the midpoint pH value for channel inhibition, and h is the Hill coefficient. Although HIR currents showed strong pHi sensitivity with pK a 6.76 (h = 3.1), IRK1 and IHH had almost no response to a pHi change from 7.4 to 5.8 (pK a 4.95, h 0.9, and pK a5.25, h 0.9, respectively). Although its pHi sensitivity decreased (pK a 6.45,h 2.2), HII responded to pHi changes more like HIR than IRK1. With both N and C termini from HIR and the rest of the sequences from IRK1, HIH had almost identical pH sensitivity (pK a6.77, h 3.1) to HIR. Data are presented as means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of CO2 and pH on HIR currents depended on certain portions of the channel protein. A substitution of the N terminus of HIR (HIRn) with that of IRK1 (IHH, see “Materials and Methods” for nomenclature) completely abolished the CO2/ pHi sensitivities (Fig. 2), whereas a replacement of the N terminus of IRK1 (IRKn) with HIRn rendered the mutant channel (HII) substantial CO2/ pHi sensitivities, indicating that the pH-dependent gating mechanism is related to the N terminus. Although the recombinant HIR-IRK channels with the N terminus from HIR remained pH-sensitive, the apparent pK (pH value for 50% channel inhibition, pK a) value of the HII was ∼0.3 pH units lower than that of the wild-type HIR (Fig. 2 B). Thus, it is possible that other parts of the HIR protein are also involved in the pH sensing. To test this possibility, we extended the recombinant channel to include the N terminus as well as the M1, H5, and M2 regions of HIR (HHI). When this construct was expressed, we did not see any significant increase in CO2 sensitivity over the HII (Fig.2 A). A chimera (HIH) was then constructed which contained both HIRn and the C terminus of HIR (HIRc) and other sequences (M1 through M2) from IRK1. This mutant expressed inward rectifying currents with the amplitude and rectification comparable with those of HIR. When the HIH was exposed to 15% CO2 or acidic pH, we found that this channel was inhibited to exactly the same degree as the wild-type HIR (Fig. 2). The function of the HIRc in pH sensing was not simply contributive, because introducing the HIRc alone to the IRK1 (IIH, IHH) failed to produce any CO2/ pHi sensitivity (Fig.2). Thus, the HIRc is also required for pH sensing, although its role strictly depends on the presence of HIRn. The requirement of both the N and C termini for pHi sensing suggests that the channel gating may result from interactions of both the C and N termini. If the N and C termini can interact in pH sensing, there should be amino acid sequences critical for the interaction. To locate the sequences, several N-terminal mutants were constructed based on HIH and IRK1. We chose to use HIH rather than HIR, because the extracellular pH sensor was removed in this mutant (4Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y. Yang J. Cui N.R. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) without affecting baseline currents or the pHi sensitivity, as mentioned above. HIRn and IRKn were divided into three segments at two conserved areas. Each chimera carried one or two segments from HIR and the rest from IRK1. The pHi sensitivity was then studied (Fig.3). If an area is not involved in interactions with the HIRc, mutation of this sequence should not affect the distinct pH sensitivity of channels carrying HIRc or IRKc as shown in Fig. 2 B (HIH versus HII); if it is involved, on the other hand, substitution of this sequence with that in IRK1 should produce a channel with identical pH sensitivity regardless of the presence of HIRc or IRKc. When a short sequence near the M1 domain was mutated to that in IRK1, the pH sensitivity of this mutant channel could no longer be enhanced by HIRc with a marked reduction in pH sensitivity (N51–60HIH versus N1–76IRK, Fig.3 A). This short motif contained about 10 amino acids with only three residues (TYM) different from those in IRK1. In contrast, mutations of other N-terminal domains did not eliminate the effect of HIRc in augmenting pH sensitivity although decreases in pH sensitivity were also observed (Fig. 3, B–D). These results suggest that the TYM motif that we described previously (11Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y. Yang J. Cui N.R. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) is indeed the N-terminal interaction site. The C terminus of HIR has 275 amino acids with a number of feature structures. At its C-terminal end, there is a potential PDZ-binding sequence. Immediately before this sequence, there are a cluster of negatively charged residues and a proline-rich motif. To determine whether these structures are involved in CO2 and pH sensing, several deletions of the C-terminal sequences were created by introducing a stop codon at positions 361, 381, or 393 (Fig.4 A). However, the CO2 sensitivity of these C-truncated HIR channels did not show any significant difference from the wild-type HIR (Fig.4 B), indicating that these structures are not necessary for the CO2 sensing. Several chimeras were constructed using C-terminal segments of HIR and IRK1, shown in Fig. 4 A. CO2 and pH sensitivities of these chimeras were then compared with those of HIH and HII. The substitution of a sequence from position 231 or 261 to the end of the C terminus (HIH231–445C, HIH261–445C) had no effect on the CO2 and pHi sensitivities of the mutant channels, which remained identical to HIH (Fig. 4, B andC). A chimera with sequence 196–445 replaced by that in IRK1 showed CO2 and pHi sensitivities similar to the HII, suggesting that the region between 196 and 230 is critical in CO2/ pHi sensing (Fig. 4, B andC). In region 196–230, there are only six residues that differ between HIR and IRK1, with four of them (PYMQ) clearly in contrast with their counterparts. Mutations of all four of these residues to those in IRK1 (HIH-SRIS) completely eliminated the C-terminal effect on enhancing pH sensitivity (Fig. 4, B andC). Introducing these four residues to HII significantly increased the CO2/ pHi sensitivity of the mutant channel over the HII (HII-PYMQ, Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest, therefore, that the C-terminal domain for the N/C-terminal interaction is located at the PYMQ motif. Simultaneous mutations of both the N-terminal TYM and C-terminal PYMQ sequences (TYM-PYMQ) rendered the mutant channel the pHisensitivity identical to that of N51–60HIH (Fig. 4 C), suggesting the mutual dependence of these two motifs. Although the TYM and PYMQ motifs are critical in channel gating, there is no titratable residue within them. Apparently, the proton-binding sites are located in areas other than these two motifs. If protons mediate the N/C-terminal interaction, there should be proton-binding sites in the channel protein. Histidine has a pK value 6.04 in its side chain, which is close to the physiological pH level. This property makes the histidine residue the highly promising proton-binding site (10Chanchevalap, S., Yang, Z. J., Cui, N. R., Qu, Z., Zhu, G. Y., Liu, C. X., Giwa, L.

Because of its functional importance and the fact that the 5 S rRNA interacts specifically with several ribosomal proteins (4Horne J. Erdmann V.A. Mol. Gen.

Nearly 1000 different prokaryotic and eukaryotic 5 S rRNA sequences have been determined so far. The predicted secondary structure (5Specht T. Wolters J. Erdmann V.A.

The size of the 5 S rRNA limits the possibility of its three-dimensional structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Therefore, in the past, we tried to crystallize several 5 S rRNA species (6Lorenz S. Betzel C. Raderschall E. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Erdmann V.A. J. Mol.

These crystals, however, diffract only to about 0.75 nm resolution and are extremely sensitive to radiation, even under cryogenic conditions. The intrinsic flexibility of the whole 5 S rRNA molecule and small differences in the primary structure seem to influence significantly the quality of the crystals. The T. flavus 5 S rRNA was then divided into five domains, A through E, and these domains were chemically synthesized and crystallized for x-ray analysis (8Lorenz S. Perbandt M. Lippmann C. Moore K.

The 70 S ribosomes were isolated by previously described extraction and centrifugation steps (2Erdmann V.A. Fahnestock S. Higo K. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2932-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The intact ribosomes were dissociated into their 30 and 50 S subunits at magnesium concentrations below 5 mm (1Nomura M. Erdmann V.A. Nature. 1970; 228: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The 5 S rRNA was separated from the large ribosomal subunit by saccharose gradient, phenol extraction and subsequently purified by Sephadex G150 gel chromatography as well as hydrophobic affinity interaction chromatography. In addition T. flavus 5 S rRNA was produced by in vitro transcription. Because of large yields of up to 5 mg/ml, sufficient RNA material can be generated at low cost and within a short time compared with the conventional isolation procedure. The reconstitution of ribosomal proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus with 5 S rRNA of different species resulted in functionally intact 50 S subunits active in polypeptide synthesis (3Hartmann R.K. Vogel D.W. Walker R.T. Erdmann V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3511-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This finding emphasizes that the three-dimensional structure of the ribosomal 5 S RNA is highly conserved, making it possible to replace the 5 S rRNA from E. coli by that from T. flavus. Two synthetic DNA oligonucleotides coding for the 5′ and 3′ regions of T. flavus 5 S rRNA with an overlapping area of 25 bases were annealed by stepwise cooling from 70 to 54 °C within 17 min. A double-stranded template was generated by elongation withPfu polymerase for 10 min. Restriction sites and T7 promotor were introduced by primers used in the following polymerase chain reaction. The product was blunt end-ligated into the vector pUC18 (2686 base pair) and transformed into E. coli JM109 cells sensitive to blue/white screening. The correct sequence of the insert was checked by sequencing the isolated plasmids from several clones. After plasmid linearization with EcoRV (NEB), the wild-type 5 S rRNA of T. flavus was synthesized during run off transcription in the RiboMAX system (Promega). The RNA was purified by phenol extraction and gel filtration. The samples were concentrated by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 5 mmMgCl2 buffer. Purity and homogeneity of the product were analyzed by UV spectroscopy, denaturating urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6Lorenz S. Betzel C. Raderschall E. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Erdmann V.A. J.

The scattering curves at the solute concentrations 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 mg/ml were measured at sample detector distances of 3.5 and 1.4 m, covering the momentum transfer ranges 0.25 < s < 1.8 nm−1 and 0.40 < s < 5.5 nm−1, respectively (s = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 0.15 nm is the x-ray wavelength). The data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam corrected for the detector response, the scattering of the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled for concentration using the program SAPOKO. 2D.

Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). The final composite scattering curve was obtained by merging the extrapolated low angle data with the curve recorded at higher angles at 10 mg/ml. The maximum dimension D max of the 5 S rRNA was estimated from the experimental data using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (21Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The radii of gyration R g at different concentrations were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (10Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I.

The latter program was also used to compute the distance distribution functionp(r). Prior to the shape analysis, a constant was subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity at higher angles decays as s−4 following Porod's law (24Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) for homogeneous particles. The value of this constant is determined automatically by the shape determination program DAMMIN (described under “Shape Determination”) from the outer part of the curve by drawing a straight line in coordinates s4 I(s) versuss4. This procedure reduces the contribution from scattering due to the internal particle structure and yields an approximation of the “shape scattering” curve (i.e. scattering from the excluded volume of the particle filled by constant density). The Porod volume V p (24Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering.

The shape of the 5 S rRNA was restored from the experimental data using an ab initio method (12Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). A sphere of diameter D max is filled by a regular grid of points corresponding to a dense hexagonal packing of small spheres (dummy atoms) of radius r 0 ≪D max. The structure of the dummy atoms model (DAM) is defined by a configuration vector X assigning an index to each atom (0 corresponds to solvent and 1 to the solute particle). The scattering intensity I(s) from the DAM is evaluated as I(s)=2π2∑l=0∞ ∑m=−ll Alm(s)2,Equation 1 where the partial amplitudesA lm(s) are as follows.Alm(s)=il2/π νa ∑j jl(srj)Ylm*(ωj)Equation 2 Here, the sum runs over the dummy atoms withX j = 1 (particle atoms), rj, ωj are their polar coordinates,v a = (4πr 03/3)/0.74 is the displaced volume per dummy atom, j l(x) and Y lm(ω) denote the spherical Bessel function and the spherical harmonics, respectively. In keeping with the low resolution of the solution scattering data, the method searches for a compact interconnected configuration X, minimizing the discrepancy χ between the calculated and the experimental curves,χ=1N−1 ∑j=1NI(sj)−Iexp(sj)ς(sj)2Equation 3 where N is the number of the experimental points andI exp (s k) andς(s k) are the experimental intensity after a constant subtraction and its standard deviation in thek-th point, respectively.

The atomic coordinates of the theoretical model of the 5 S rRNA from Xenopus laevis (26Westhof E. Romby P. Romaniuk P.J. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Mol.

The solution scattering curve from this model was computed using a modified version of the program CRYSOL (28Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl.

The models of the 5 S rRNA were displayed on a SUN SPARC-20ZX work station using the program ASSA (32Kozin M.B. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 811-815Crossref Google Scholar) and on a SGI O2 work station using the program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The apparent radius of gyration of the 5 S RNA in solution decreases with concentration (Fig.2 a), which is typical for solutions with repulsive interactions. The value R g= 3.46 ± 0.05 nm is obtained after extrapolation to infinite dilution. The composite SAXS curve from the 5 S rRNA extrapolated to zero concentration is presented in Fig. 2 b. The maximum dimension and the radius of gyration of the particle are 12.0 ± 0.5 and 3.44 ± 0.05 nm, respectively, in good agreement with the values reported in earlier solution scattering studies (34Müller J.J. Zalkova T.N. Zirwer D. Misselwitz R. Gast K. Serdyuk I.N. Welfle H. Damaschun G. Eur. Biophys. J. 1986; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Österberg R. Sjoberg B. Garrett R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The distance distribution function p(r) in Fig.2 c is typical for an elongated particle. The shape scattering curve after a constant subtraction (Fig. 2 b, curve 2) yields the Porod volume of 37 ± 2 nm3. This volume corresponds well to the dry volume of the 5 S RNA (38.8 nm3) computed from its molecular mass, assuming the partial specific volume of 0.53 cm3/g (36Serdyuk I.N. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 59: 750-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The above results confirm that the solutions of the 5 S rRNA are monodisperse and that the shape scattering curve can be used for the shape analysis. Ten independent ab initio shape determinations were performed starting from different random configurations within a spherical search volume with the diameterD max = 12 nm. Different packing radii of the dummy atoms were used (r 0 = 0.4, 0.35, and 0.32 nm, corresponding to the numbers of dummy atomsM = 2550, 3660, and 4897, respectively). The independently restored models had the radius of gyration of 3.49 ± 0.05 nm, volume 36.7 ± 1.0 nm3 and the maximum dimension 11.7 ± 0.3 nm; they all provided nearly identical fits to the data illustrated in Fig. 2 b (curve 3) with the discrepancy χ = 0.42. As the method yields models at an arbitrary orientation and handedness, the models were appropriately rotated and shifted for comparison. The overall appearance of the models displayed in Fig.3 a for five restorations was very similar; all of them were bent elongated particles with a cross-section diameter of about 2 nm as expected for an RNA strand. However, differences were observed in finer structural details. Given that the independently restored models yield nearly identical scattering patterns, the ambiguity illustrated in Fig. 3 ahad to be attributed to the low resolution of the scattering data. Analysis of the results of independent restorations permits one to further refine the solution and to build the most probable model of the 5 S rRNA. For this process, all of the restored configurations rotated to best match each other were remapped onto a grid of densely packed spheres with r 0 = 0.3 nm. It is conceivable that the overlap of the 10 models in Fig. 3 bencloses the actual shape of the 5 S rRNA in solution. Already a visual inspection of this overlap displayed as semitransparent spheres in Fig.3 c reveals the most probable shape of the particle as a darker core formed by the dummy atoms with highest repetition rates. To build the final model, the shape determination was performed using the overlap in Fig. 3 b (M = 705 dummy atoms) as a search volume instead of the spherical one. The shape of the 5 S rRNA thus obtained (Fig. 4 a) is very similar to the probable shape represented in Fig. 3 b. Independent restorations using the overlap in Fig. 3 b as the search volume yielded only minor rearrangements of several dummy atom indices on the particle border compared with the final configuration in Fig. 4 a. The appearance of the ab initio model is rather similar to that of the theoretically predicted structure of the 5 S rRNA fromX. laevis by Westhof et al. (26Westhof E. Romby P. Romaniuk P.J. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) inasmuch as both models consist of two elongated arms (helices). This agreement was unexpected, as the integral parameters of the Westhof model (R g = 3.82 nm, D max = 14.0 nm) differed significantly from the experimental values, and the calculated scattering profile (Fig. 2 b, curve 4) yielded a poor fit to the experimental curve with χ = 5.1. Previous models of the free 5 S rRNA derived from SAXS data (34Müller J.J. Zalkova T.N. Zirwer D. Misselwitz R. Gast K. Serdyuk I.N. Welfle H. Damaschun G. Eur. Biophys. J. 1986; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Österberg R. Sjoberg B. Garrett R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) supported a Y configuration with two shorter and one longer helix. In contrast, our data indicate that the 5 S rRNA in solution consists of two longer and one shorter helix. The obtained shape permits one to build a tentative model of the entire 5 S rRNA using the atomic models of its fragments. The structure of the separated and extended section including domains A, D, and E (Fig. 1) was available from Correll et al. (29Correll C.C. Freeborn B. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 705-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and the rest of the molecule (domains B and C) was taken from the Westhof theoretical model (26Westhof E. Romby P. Romaniuk P.J. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These two fragments were interactively fitted into the low resolution model as displayed in Fig. 4 a. The surface representation of the final model of the free 5 S rRNA in solution thus obtained is displayed in Fig. 4 b. According to the sampling theorem (37Shannon C.E. Weaver W. The Mathematical Theory of Communication. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL1949Google Scholar, 38Moore P.B. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1980; 13: 168-175Crossref Google Scholar), the number of degrees of freedom associated with the scattering curve in Fig. 2 Ais N s =D max s max/π ≈ 20. As the search models nominally contain M ≈103parameters (indices of dummy atoms), a natural question arises whether the information content in the scattering data justifies the ab initio restoration. First, it should be stressed here that the DAMs in Figs. 3 and 4a are still low resolution models, despite the small radii of the dummy atoms used (from 0.3 to 0.4 nm). The resolution of a DAM, and thus that of the final model in Fig.4 a, is defined solely by the range of the data fitted (2π/s max ≅ 1.3 nm); this is best illustrated by the models in Fig. 3 a, which provide roughly the same degree of detail despite different packing radii used. On one side, the variety of models in Fig. 3 a yielding identical scattering curves in the fitting range demonstrates that the solution of theab initio shape determination problem is ambiguous. On the other side, all of these models display similar gross structure and differ only in the finer details. This situation resembles, to some extent, particular problems of NMR spectroscopy, where different chain configurations yield virtually the same discrepancy with the experimental data. The refined shape in Fig. 4 a may be considered an analogue of the averaged structure provided by the NMR technique. The successful alignment of the atomic models of the 5 S rRNA fragments into this shape adds further credit to the ab initio model. Earlier cross-linking experiments with phenyldiglyoxal between residues 41 and 72 (39) suggested that tertiary interactions exist between domains E and C. According to our model (Fig. 4, a andb), these domains are well separated in the unbound 5 S rRNA in solution. Fig. 4 c displays our model of the free 5 S rRNA along with the recent protein-RNA map of the 50 S ribosomal subunitE. coli obtained from x-ray and neutron scattering (15Svergun D.I. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14432-14439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The region of interest is at the top of the subunit, where an RNA fragment is complexed with three ribosomal proteins. This fragment is identified as a bound 5 S rRNA and the lower protein as L25 (15Svergun D.I. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14432-14439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The orientation of the free 5 S rRNA molecule in Fig. 4 c was selected to have the domain E bound to L25 (40Stoldt M. Wohnert J. Ohlenschläger O. Gorlach M. Brown L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6508-6521Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 41Lu M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This comparison of the free and bound 5 S rRNA indicates that the 5 S rRNA becomes essentially more compact when forming a complex with specific ribosomal proteins. A conceivable structural rearrangement involves rotation of the domain B-C toward A-B-E (by about 60° clockwise in the plane of Fig.4 c). Such a rotation would also bring domains E and C closer together and enable the cross-links observed in former studies (39Hancock J. Wagner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Yet more information on the mechanism of the complex formation would be revealed by comparison with a bound 5 S rRNA expected to be identified in the x-ray crystallographic maps of the 50 S subunit (42Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The present ab initio model of a free 5 S rRNA provides a basis for further crystallographic molecular replacement studies and also for the analysis of RNA-protein complexes in solution and in crystals."

However, the mechanisms underlying the diverse responses of cells remain unknown. We show here that HGF promoted chemokinesis of rat primary astrocytes through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase without any influence on mitogenesis of the cells. Under the same condition, phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), which is another signal mediator of c-Met, was not tyrosine-phosphorylated during HGF stimulation. However, treatment of the cells with orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, restored the HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1. A tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, was associated with both PI3-kinase and PLCγ1 before HGF stimulation, but it was dissociated only from PI3-kinase after the stimulation. Furthermore, transfectants of catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 showed tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and mitogenic responses to HGF, and the mitogenic response was blocked with U73122, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC, and calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C downstream of the PLCγ1. These results indicate that PLCγ1 is selectively prevented from being a signal mediator by constitutive association of SHP-1, and that this selective inhibition of PLCγ1 may determine the cellular response of astrocytes to HGF.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1573-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). All these physiological activities are initially mediated by c-Met tyrosine kinase, the receptor for HGF (3Naldini L. Vigna E. Narshiman R.P. Guadino Gs. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 501-504PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M. -L Kmiecik T.E.

Previous studies have shown that, upon tyrosine phosphorylation, c-Met is associated with a number of SH2-containing signal mediators, such as GTPase-activating protein for Ras, p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, phospholipase C (PLC)γ1, and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Src family (5Bardelli A.

It has been revealed that PI3-kinase is involved in HGF-induced migration of mIMCD cells (7Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J.G. Nigam S.K. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (8Royal I. Park M. J. Biol.

Mizuno K. Osada S. Nakamura T. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PLCγ1 is considered to participate in cell migration, since activation of protein kinase C, the downstream effector of PLCγ1, mimics HGF-induced membrane ruffling in KB cells (10Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and R308 cells (11Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kato M. Yamochi W. Kuroda S. Nakamura T. Takeichi M. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the biological significance of HGF in peripheral organs and cells, various effects of HGF on cells of the central nervous system have also been reported (12Honda S. Kagoshima M. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1995; 32: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Hamanoue M. Takemoto N. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Nakajima K.

We have previously found that HGF promotes neurite outgrowth of cultured rat embryonic neocortical explants (13Hamanoue M. Takemoto N. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Nakajima K. Kohsaka S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this system, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was critical for the neurite outgrowth, whereas PI3-kinase was not phosphorylated during the stimulation (16Machide M. Kamitori K. Nakamura Y. Kohsaka S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that two major downstream effectors of c-Met, PI3-kinase, and PLCγ1 were not necessarily co-activated, but rather differentially regulated in neuronal cells. In the present study, we analyzed the activation of PI3-kinase and PLCγ1 by HGF stimulation in rat primary astrocytes, a species of glial cells of the central nervous system. We found that HGF specifically stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3-kinase, not PLCγ1 in the cells. Furthermore, HGF caused rapid dissociation of a tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, a mammalian homologue ofDrosophila Csw (17Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), from PI3-kinase, while the phosphatase still bound to PLCγ1, which may be a biochemical mechanism accounting for the selective activation of PI3-kinase with HGF. Furthermore, PLCγ1 was phosphorylated with tyrosine in the cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of SHP-1, and the cells showed mitogenic responses to HGF. Our study revealed that SHP-1 plays an important role in both selective activation of PI3-kinase and prevention of phosphorylation of PLCγ1 during the stimulation with HGF, and contributes to induction of the novel neurotrophic functions of HGF to the glial cells.

Chemotaxis chambers and the filters (pore size, 5 μm) were from Neuro Probe. Unless otherwise provided, other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Astrocytes were prepared from postnatal 0-day-old Wistar rats by the method reported previously (18Yoshida K. Kohsaka S. Nii S. Idei T. Otani M. Toya S. Tsukada Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 70: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More than 98% of the cells were positive for GFAP staining. The cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated plastic culture dishes or glass slides at a cell density of 1 × 105/cm2. The cells were grown to semiconfluence and starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) for 10 h. The serum-starved cells were unstimulated or stimulated with 0.5 nm HGF or 10% serum, and labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 2 h before stimulation or 3 or 5 h after stimulation. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 70% ethanol. The samples were further treated with 2 n HCl for 15 min and neutralized with 0.1 msodium tetraborate for 30 min. The cells were treated by double staining with anti-GFAP and anti-BrdUrd antibodies, and respectively probed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin and Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. The number of the cells stained positively for both BrdUrd and GFAP was counted. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Actin cytoskeletal structures were visualized with Texas Red-labeled phalloidin. The images were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Molecular Dynamics). When specified, 50 nmwortmannin was added during the cell culture. The serum-starved cells were stimulated with 0.5 nm HGF for 0, 30, 60, and 90 min, and harvested in a detergent-free buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were disrupted with a Teflon homogenizer (clearance, 0.2 mm), and the soluble cytosolic fractions were prepared from the supernatants after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The fractions were subjected to Western blotting with anti-actin antibodies for detection of globular actin (G-actin). The actin content was determined by the densitometric analysis of the band. Motile responses of astrocytes were quantified by using a modified Boyden chamber as described previously (19Stoker M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DMEM containing 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 nm HGF was added to the lower compartment of chamber, which was overlaid with a collagen-coated filter (pore size, 5 μm). The serum-starved cells were then seeded on the upper compartment. Involvement of PI3-kinase and PLCγ1 in the cell migration was examined by addition of 50 nm wortmannin or 0.5 μmU73122 to both upper and lower compartments. To determine whether the migration was chemotaxis or chemokinesis, the same concentration of HGF was added to both upper and lower compartments (20Yokomizo T Izumi T Chang K Takuwa Y Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the filter was fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% formaldehyde, and the cells were stained with crystal violet. The upper surface of the filter was wiped with a cotton applicator, and the number of the cells on the lower surface was counted. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin (buffer A), and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml with buffer A. Antibodies (anti-c-Met, PLCγ1, or PI3-kinase) were incubated with the lysates for 2 h, and the immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A- or G-Sepharose. Mouse IgG or rabbit IgG was used as a control for anti-PLCγ1 antibody and anti-PI3-kinase antibody, respectively (Fig.6). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting using the antibodies indicated in figures and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Figure 6Differential association of SHP-1 with PLC γ1 and PI3-kinase.

The PI3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was determined according to the methods reported by Fixman et al. (21Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated lipids were analyzed with Fujix Bio-imaging Analyzer (Fuji Film). Protein-tyrosine phosphatases were monitored by an in-gel assay according to the methods, which have been reported by Burridge and Nelson (22Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with some modifications, briefly, tyrosine residues on poly(Glu·Tyr) peptides were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and purified c-Src. Either the whole lysates of the cells unstimulated or stimulated with 0.5 nm HGF for 2 min or the immunoprecipitates from the lysates with anti-PI3-kinase or anti-PLCγ1 antibodies were run on an 8% gel for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which contained the 32P-phosphorylated peptides. The gel was washed by a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20% isopropyl alcohol to remove SDS, denatured by a guanidine hydrochloride buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA), and renatured in the guanidine hydrochloride-free buffer. The gel was incubated in a buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 h to allow tyrosine phosphatase reactions, and analyzed by means of BAS2000. Rat cDNA of SHP-1 and SHP-2 were prepared, and mutations were introduced to replace cysteine residues, which are essential for their activities, with serine residues (23Bouchard P. Zhao Z.

The mutation (Cys → Ser mutation) inactivates the phosphatase catalytically (25Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Cys → Ser mutants were tagged with Flag epitope at their COOH termini and inserted into the pEF-BOS vector (26Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). As a control vector, the carboxyl-terminal 58-amino acid fragment of SHP-1, which was devoid of any functional domain, were tagged with Flag epitope and inserted into pEF-BOS. Furthermore, wild-type SHP-1 was tagged with Flag epitope, and inserted with pEF-BOS. Transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE and PLUS reagent. The cells were allowed to express the phosphatases for 20 h in DMEM containing the 10% fetal bovine serum, and starved for 10 h in serum-free medium. The cells were unstimulated or stimulated with 0.5 nm HGF for 5 min, and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was examined by Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies to immunoprecipitates of PLCγ1. To estimate the level at which the mutant phosphatases would be expressed, the whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting with anti-Flag antibodies. The possibility of SHP-1 being involved in the mitogenic responses of the cells was determined by stimulation of transfectants of inactive and wild-type SHP-1 and the control vector with 0.5 nm HGF for 7 h after serum-starvation. They were labeled with BrdUrd for last 2 h of the stimulation, and subjected to the immunostaining with anti-BrdUrd and anti-Flag antibodies. The same experiments were performed in the presence of 0.5 μmU73122, 50 nm wortmannin, or 50 nm calphostin C. To explore the function of HGF in astrocytes, we examined first the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met during HGF stimulation. Serum-starved astrocytes were stimulated with various concentrations of HGF for 5 min (Fig.1 A) or with 0.5 nmHGF for the indicated periods of time (Fig. 1 B). The cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation for c-Met, which was followed by Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. c-Met β-chain (145 kDa) was phosphorylated with tyrosine after stimulation with 0.1–10 nm HGF (Fig. 1 A). In the time-course experiment, c-Met was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated within 2 min, and thereafter the phosphorylation level was sustained (Fig.1 B). When the same immunoblots were reprobed with anti-c-Met antibodies, c-Met showed the almost equal recovery in each maneuver of immunoprecipitation. These observations indicated that functional c-Met was expressed in astrocytes. Since HGF promotes proliferation of various types of cells, we examined effects of HGF on the cell growth of astrocytes. Astrocytes were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd for 2 h, and the number of the cells positive for both BrdUrd- and GFAP-immunostainings was counted. As shown in Fig.2 A, stimulation with 0.5 nm HGF had no influence on any mitogenic response, while BrdUrd-positive cells increased by 7 h of incubation with the medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Based on the reports showing that various types of cells exhibit morphological changes or motile responses to HGF, which accompany cytoskeletal reorganization (1Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 2Brinkmann V. Foroutan H. Sachs M. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1573-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), changes in the actin structures were then examined by staining with Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (Fig.2 B). Evident stress fiber-like structures (F-actin) were clearly observed in most unstimulated cells; however, the structures disappeared 30 min after HGF stimulation. Simultaneously with the disappearance of the actin cytoskeletal structures, the amount of actin in the soluble cytosolic fraction (G-actin) was increased by the stimulation (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that HGF causes conversion of F-actin into G-actin. These morphological and biochemical changes were suppressed by 50 nm wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase (Fig. 2, B and C), or 50 μm LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, which was structurally unrelated to wortmannin (data not shown), suggesting that the actin reorganization is enhanced by the activation of PI3-kinase. The HGF-induced changes in actin structures were reminiscent of cell migration. These profiles of migration were assessed by a modified chemotaxis chamber (Fig. 2 D). When HGF was supplied to the lower compartment of the chamber, cells that migrated from the upper to the lower side were significantly increased. Then, the cell migration was evaluated by the addition of the same concentration of HGF to both upper and lower compartments. This treatment also increased the number of the cells that migrated toward the lower compartment, indicating that HGF did not function as a chemoattractant but accelerated the cell migration toward random directions (chemokinesis). This HGF-induced motile response was inhibited with 50 nm wortmannin. It has been suggested that PLCγ1 is a potential signal mediator for HGF-promoted cell migration (10Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kato M. Yamochi W. Kuroda S. Nakamura T. Takeichi M. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar); however, U73122, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC did not affect the migration of astrocytes. These results suggest that the chemokinetic response of astrocytes to HGF is induced by the activation of PI3-kinase but not PLC. It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85-kDa subunit of PI3-kinase is an initial step for the recruitment of PI3-kinase into the signal cascades mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors. We therefore monitored tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase during the stimulation of astrocytes with HGF. As shown in Fig.3 A, tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3-kinase was detected within 2 min and it was gradually enhanced until 10 min after the stimulation with 0.5 nm HGF. Furthermore, several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with PI3-kinase from the stimulated cells. Then, the catalytic activity of PI3-kinase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was determined in vitro (Fig. 3 B). The generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate, a product of PI3-kinase, was readily detected from the phosphoproteins immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) antibody after 2 min stimulation, and the level of phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate was increased up to 10 min after the stimulation. These observations were in agreement with the enhanced phosphorylation of the 85-kDa subunit. The measurement performed in the presence of 50 nm wortmannin revealed efficient suppression of the activity. These results demonstrated that PI3-kinase is involved in intracellular signaling of HGF in astrocytes. Second, the involvement of PLCγ1 in c-Met-mediated signal cascades was investigated. Although PLCγ1 was expressed in astrocytes, its tyrosine phosphorylation was never detected following HGF stimulation (Fig. 4 A). However, when the cells were pretreated with orthovanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, PLCγ1 was significantly phosphorylated by HGF stimulation (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that PLCγ1 is a potential signal mediator of c-Met, although its phosphorylation was suppressed by tyrosine phosphatase(s) in astrocytes. To investigate the involvement of tyrosine phosphatase(s) in the suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1, we examined the association of phosphatase(s) with PLCγ1 by in-gel tyrosine phosphatase assays. The tyrosine phosphatase activities of the whole lysates from stimulated and unstimulated astrocytes could be detected as bands at molecular mass units of 50, 65, and 120 kDa (Fig.5 A). When the same analysis was carried out by using anti-PLCγ1 immunoprecipitates, only the 65-kDa phosphatase was detected (Fig. 5 B). This phosphatase was constitutively associated with PLCγ1 regardless of HGF stimulation. In addition, the 65-kDa tyrosine phosphatase was associated with PI3-kinase in unstimulated cells. However, the tyrosine phosphatase was clearly dissociated from PI3-kinase after the stimulation. In consideration of the molecular weight of the tyrosine phosphatase and the binding abilities to PLCγ1 and PI3-kinase (27Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), SHP-1 and the related molecule, SHP-2, are regarded as possible candidates for the association with PLCγ1 and PI3-kinase. The possibility was assessed by blotting the immunoprecipitates of PLCγ1 and PI3-kinase with antibodies to SHP-1 and SHP-2. Fig.6 (A and B) shows that SHP-1 was associated with both PLCγ1 and PI3-kinase in unstimulated cells. After HGF stimulation, however, SHP-1 was immediately dissociated from PI3-kinase, and not from PLCγ1. However, SHP-1 could not be detected when normal mouse IgG or rabbit IgG was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6, C and D). The profiles of the association of SHP-1 with PLCγ1 and PI3-kinase were consistent with those of the 65-kDa phosphatase detected in gel assays. By contrast, SHP-2 was not associated with PLCγ1, PI3-kinase (Fig. 6, E and F), or c-Met (data not shown), regardless of HGF stimulation. To determine the possibility of PLCγ1 becoming the physiological target for SHP-1, the inactive mutants (Cys → Ser mutant) of SHP-1 and SHP-2 were constructed by substitution of the essential cysteine residue with serine, and transfected into astrocytes. PLCγ1 was overtly tyrosine-phosphorylated in the cells transfected by inactive SHP-1 even before HGF stimulation, and the phosphorylation was further enhanced by 5 min of HGF stimulation (Fig. 7 A). However, transfection of the control vector and wild-type SHP-1 did not enhance the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 before and after the stimulation by HGF. Likewise, transfection of the Cys → Ser mutant of SHP-2 did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 (Fig. 7 A), despite the mutant protein having been abundantly expressed as compared with the mutant of SHP-1 (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that SHP-1 is a critical phosphatase suppressing the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 following HGF stimulation. Based on the report showing that activation of PLCγ1 is required for epidermal growth factor- and platelet-derived growth factor-promoted cell proliferation (33Wang Z. Gluck S. Zhang L. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 590-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), prevention of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by SHP-1 may be attributed to lack of mitogenic response of astrocytes to HGF. Accordingly, we examined the possibility of the transfectants of mutant SHP-1 being used (Fig.8). HGF did not enhance the proliferation of astrocytes which were transfected with the control vector or wild-type SHP-1, as in the case shown in Fig. 2 A. However, the mutant SHP-1-transfectants exposed to HGF exhibited the increasing mitogenic response after the stimulation (Fig. 8 A). The effect of mutant SHP-1 was inhibited with suboptimum concentration (0.5 μm) of U73122, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC and 50 nm wortmannin, indicating that simultaneous activation of PLCγ1 and PI3-kinase is essential for the mitogenic response to HGF in astrocytes (Fig.8 A). Furthermore, calphostin C, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol-specific protein kinase C (PKC), which is a downstream effector of PLCγ1, also inhibited the mitogenic response emerged by mutant SHP-1 (Fig. 8 B). These results strongly suggest that PLCγ1 is a potential signal mediator for HGF-induced cell proliferation, which was constitutively suppressed by SHP-1 in astrocyte. This article describes how HGF promotes actin reorganization and chemokinetic migration of astrocytes (Fig. 2), which is the first demonstration of the effects of HGF on glial cells as well as neuronal cells of the central nervous system. Promotion of cell motility is a typical activity of HGF observed in various types of cells of peripheral organs (1Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). With regard to the intracellular signaling underlying the biological effect, PLCγ1 and its downstream effector(s), PKC(s) (10Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y.

Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar, 8Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) have been reported to function as mediators in this process. However, it has not been clarified whether the activation of both PLCγ1 and PI3-kinase is necessary for HGF-induced cell migration. Our results clearly indicated that HGF selectively induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PI3-kinase and not PLCγ1 in astrocytes, and that the activation of PI3-kinase was essential for the HGF-induced cell migration. This selective activation of PI3-kinase by HGF is unique to astrocytes, since both PI3-kinase and PLCγ1 are activated in most of the cell types (6Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the selective activation of PI3-kinase determines the cellular response of astrocytes to HGF. PLCγ1 is also an essential signal mediator for the mitogenesis promoted by various growth factors (33Wang Z. Gluck S. Zhang L. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 590-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through the experiment, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 or mitogenic response could not be detected in astrocytes stimulated with HGF (Figs. 2 A and4 A). In the cells treated with Na3VO4, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, however, PLCγ1 was significantly tyrosine-phosphorylated as in other types of cells (Fig.4 B). This observation led us to identify SHP-1 as a PLCγ1-associated protein-tyrosine phosphatase (Figs. 5 and6 A). The association was sustained during HGF stimulation up to 10 min of examination (data not shown). Furthermore, transfection of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by HGF (Fig. 7), and the cells showed a mitogenic response to HGF (Fig. 8). This mitogenic response was inhibited by an inhibitor of PLC. The inhibitor could not suppress astrocytic migration stimulated by HGF (Fig. 2 D), indicating that the cells were viable under the treatment. These results indicated that PLCγ1 was prevented from being activated by SHP-1 during HGF stimulation, and the prevention was considered to have been responsible for the lack of mitogenic response to HGF in astrocytes. Furthermore, astrocytes showed enhanced mitogenic response even 5 h after stimulation with 10% serum (Fig. 2 A), which is much shorter than that generally observed in many other cell types. The same profile of mitogenic response was also observed in astrocytes carrying the mutant SHP-1 by the stimulation of HGF (Fig. 8). The rapid mitogenic response of astrocytes may be explained by the fact that primary astrocytes continue to proliferate slowly even in the serum-deprived condition. Thus, it is possible that molecules, except for PLCγ1, involved in progression of cell cycle may be constitutively active in the serum-starved astrocytes and activation of PLCγ1 may led the cells to immediate response to the mitogenic stimuli. In contrast to PLCγ1, PI3-kinase was activated by HGF, which in turn induced cell chemokinesis. In the process, activation of PLCγ1 is not essential, since the cells treated by U73122 still showed chemokinetic response to HGF (Fig. 2 D). SHP-1 was also associated with PI3-kinase before HGF stimulation, but was dissociated from PI3-kinase immediately after HGF stimulation (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that the dissociation of SHP-1 is responsible for the selective activation of PI3-kinase. The activation of PI3-kinase may also contribute to cell proliferation as well as chemokinesis, since wortmannin treatment also inhibited HGF-promoted mitogenic response emerged by mutant SHP-1 (Fig.8 A). These results indicated for the first time that SHP-1 selectively regulates PI3-kinase and PLCγ1 and may determine the astrocyte-specific response to HGF. The rapid dissociation of SHP-1 from PI3-kinase after HGF stimulation contrasts with general observations showing that their association is promoted after stimulation with various cytokines or growth factors (28Imani F.

Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), has been reported to be associated with PI3-kinase (30Craddock B.L. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29281-29289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Gesbert F. Guenzi C. Bertoglio J. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the expression of SHP-2 predominated over that of SHP-1 in astrocytes (data not shown). However, SHP-2 may not be involved in the selective inhibition of PLCγ1, because that SHP-2 was not associated with PLCγ1 or PI3-kinase in astrocytes (Fig. 6, E and F), and that Cys → Ser mutant of SHP-2 did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 (Fig. 7 A). Our results suggest that the selective activation (or suppression) of universal signal mediators, such as PI3-kinase and PLCγ1, is responsible for cell type-specific responses to HGF. As another example of the selective activation of the signal mediators, we have previously reported that HGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and not PI3-kinase in rat primary neocortical neurons (16Machide M. Kamitori K. Nakamura Y. Kohsaka S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since PI3-kinase was not tyrosine-phosphorylated even in the cells treated with sodium orthovanadate (data not shown), the tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3-kinase was prevented in a manner independent of tyrosine phosphatase. With regard to the differential activation of PI3-kinase by c-Met in COS-7 cells, it has been reported that serine phosphorylation in the juxtamembrane domain of c-Met abolished the binding of PI3-kinase to the receptors and that spliced variant of c-Met lacking this domain facilitated the recruitment of PI3-kinase to c-Met (35Lee C.C. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19457-19461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lee C.C. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 507-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, only the full-length form was detected in astrocytes and neurons (data not shown). Multiple mechanisms may contribute to the selective activation of PLCγ1 and PI3-kinase according to the cell types. Our observations revealed the biochemical bases for the selective activation of PI3-kinase and the constitutive suppression of PLCγ1 in astrocytes. However, multiple, cell type-specific mechanisms accounting for the selective activation of diverse subsets of signal mediators may function to exert the pleiotropic effects of HGF. Further studies in this regard may shed light on the understanding of diverse biological responses of cells to HGF. We are grateful to Dr. Seisuke Hattori, Department of Biochemistry and Cellular Biology, National Institute of Neuroscience, for valuable discussion and comments."

Although it is well established that one allele of certain imprinted genes is silenced through methylation, this does not appear to be the case for all imprinted genes.

https://openalex.org/W1972009593,"A translating eye receives a radial pattern of motion that is centered on the direction of heading. If the eye is rotating and translating, visual and extraretinal signals help to cancel the rotation and to perceive heading correctly. This involves (1) an interaction between visual and eye movement signals and (2) a motion template stage that analyzes the pattern of visual motion. Early interaction leads to motion templates that integrate head-centered motion signals in the visual field. Integration of retinal motion signals leads to late interaction. Here, we show that retinal flow limits precision of heading. This result argues against an early, vector subtraction type of interaction, but is consistent with a late, gain field type of interaction with eye velocity signals and neurophysiological findings in area MST of the monkey."

Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The identification of the Tetrahymena p55 acetyltransferase as the yeast Gcn5 homologue underlined the importance of acetylation in transcriptional regulation (5Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6Brownell J.E. Zhou J.X. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Afterward, a number of transcription factors and coactivators had been identified as acetyltransferases (7Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 9Grant P.A. Berger S.L. Semin.

Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The majority of these enzymes function in multiprotein complexes and provide a mechanism of specifically targeting acetylation to active promoters to confer a localized acetylation state of the chromatin (10Brown C.E. Lechner I. Howe I. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Recently, the elongation factor Elp3 has been shown to possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT)1 activity (12Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument- Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and could acetylate the core histones as the transcription complex passes along the template. A more widespread role for acetylation was indicated by our studies with the chicken β-globin domain. In these experiments, we found that high levels of the modification were not restricted to the transcribed genes but were spread throughout the domain spanning some 33 kilobases of DNA. This hyperacetylation was found to correlate closely with the boundaries of the domain as defined by generalized DNase I sensitivity (13Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and the 5′-insulator element at the boundary (14Chung J. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1993; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). At the human β-globin locus, acetylation of histones H3 and H4 marks a broad open chromatin region with a peak of H3 acetylation at the upstream locus control region and at the active β-globin gene (15Schubeler D. Francastel C. Cimbora D.M. Reik A. Martin D.I. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, widespread H3/H4 acetylation peaking at the locus control region has also been reported in the human growth hormone locus (16Elefant F. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13827-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Histone H4 hyperacetylation over a chromatin region spanning 120 kilobases upstream of the Xist somatic promoter was also found in female mouse embryonic stem cells (17O'Neill L.P. Keohane A.M. Lavender J.S. McCabe V. Heard E. Avner P. Brockdorff N. Turner B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2897-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These experiments imply that acetylation, in addition to a role in transcription, may also be involved in establishing or maintaining the transcriptionally competent chromatin conformation. It is possible that the domain-wide acetylation we had previously observed in the chicken β-globin domain may not be achieved through the same enzyme mechanisms that were used for the specific targeting of acetylation to the promoters. We, therefore, investigated whether chromatin preparations enriched in active gene sequences contained novel acetyltransferases, which could have a role in this type of acetylation. We report that chromatin, released from embryonic chicken erythrocyte nuclei by micrococcal nuclease and subsequently salt fractionated, contains enriched levels of both active DNA sequences and elevated levels of acetylated core histones. Significantly, this chromatin also contains at least four different HAT molecules, three of which are much smaller than previously described acetyltransferases. These acetyltransferases have been further separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation into free and chromatin-bound populations. Our data suggest that these molecules have a role in active chromatin. In particular, it is possible that one or more of the chromatin-bound molecules could have a role in domain-wide acetylation. Nuclei were prepared from 15-day-old chicken embryos as described previously (4Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) but by using 10 mm NaCl in cell lysis and nuclear wash buffers. Nuclei were washed three times in a digest buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine) and resuspended at a concentration of 5 mg/ml DNA. The nuclei were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min and then digested with 200 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) for 4 min at 37 °C. The digestion was terminated with 10 mm Na3EDTA and the suspension was chilled on ice. Nuclei were centrifuged at 4000 ×g for 2 min, and the supernatant S1 was retained. The pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (5 mmNa3EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine), incubated on ice for 60 min, and centrifuged as above retaining supernatant S2. The pellet was then resuspended in 0.25 mm Na3EDTA, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C before centrifuging and retaining the supernatant S3. For salt fractionation, the chromatin-containing supernatants were combined. 1 m NaCl was added to the released chromatin to a final concentration of 100 mm, and the sample was incubated in ice for 10 min to allow H1-containing chromatin to precipitate. The precipitate was removed by centrifuging at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, and the salt-soluble chromatin in the supernatant was retained. Salt-soluble chromatin was then either dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.25 mm Na3EDTA, 0.1 mmPMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine or was loaded directly onto a 5–25% linear sucrose gradient in the same buffer and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman sw 41ti rotor for 14 h at 4 °C. To assay for chromatin-bound acetyltransferase activity in chromatin samples or across sucrose gradients, 50 μl of each sample was taken and made into a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm sodium butyrate. To this buffer, 0.1 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (2–10 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The samples were spotted onto glass fiber filters that were incubated in 20% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min followed by two 15-min washes in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Filters were then incubated in acetone and ethanol (1:1) for 10 min and air-dried. Scintillant was applied to the filters before counting. To test for acetyltransferases in the subnucleosomal regions of sucrose gradients, HAT assays were performed as above except that 20 μg of calf thymus total histone (Worthington) was added. In gel HAT activity assays were performed essentially as described by Brownell and Allis (5Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Samples from salt-soluble chromatin, subnucleosomes, and mono-dinucleosomes were concentrated and digested with 10 units of DNase I (Worthington) at 3 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were made to 1× SDS-loading buffer and electrophoresed through 13% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels, with either the calf thymus total histone at 0.1 mg/ml or no substrate (autoacetylation) polymerized into the resolving gels. For immunodepletion assays, 5 μg of sucrose gradient purified mononucleosomes from salt-soluble chromatin were used. Either 20 μl of pan acetyl-lysine or 10 μl of H4 antiserum was preincubated with 100 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose and washed three times in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.25 mmNa3EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mmbenzamidine. The chromatin and protein A-antibody were combined in a volume of 200 μl and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation. After incubation, the resin was pelleted at 4000 ×g for 2 min, the supernatant was retained, and the samples were taken and assayed for HAT activity. DNA was recovered from the immunoprecipitates after washing the resin three times in the above buffer and eluting in 1.5% SDS. DNA was recovered from equal proportions of the supernatant and immunoprecipitate fractions by phenol/chloroform extraction before hybridization analysis. Proteins from all chromatin fractions were isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction as previously described (4Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide acetic acid/urea/Triton gels as described by Bonner et al. (18Bonner W.M. West M.H.P. Stedman J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE. DNA extracted from released, salt-insoluble, and salt-soluble chromatin fractions was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and loaded directly onto 1.2% agarose gels. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated in 0.5m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl for 30 min and the DNA transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× SSC. After transfer, the membranes were rinsed in 2× SSC, blotted dry, and baked at 80 °C for 30 min. Hybridizations were performed by using 50 ng of genomic probes for D, B, βρ-globin, and βA-globin probes (13Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), labeled by random priming to specific activities of 4−8 × 108 dpm/μg. Filters were prehybridized for 60 min and hybridized for 2 h using QuickHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 65 °C. After hybridization, filters were washed as follows: twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 65 °C, once with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C, once with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C, and finally twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 65 °C. All hybridization and washing procedures were performed in bottles in a hybridization oven (Hybaid, Franklin, MA). Filters were blotted dry and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nuclei were prepared from 15-day-old chicken embryo erythrocytes and subsequently digested with micrococcal nuclease and lysed with EDTA to release approximately 50% of the DNA content into the supernatant. This chromatin-containing supernatant was further fractionated into salt-soluble (≈30% of released) and salt-insoluble (≈70% of released) fractions by the addition of 1 m NaCl to 100 mm as described previously (19Ridsdale J.A. Davie J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1081-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This technique, which fractionates chromatin on the basis of H1-mediated aggregation and differential acetylation, has been extensively used to prepare chromatin enriched in both active DNA sequences and in acetylated core histones (20Ridsdale J.A. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether both the released and the aggregation-resistant, salt-soluble chromatins contained HAT activities, the two samples were dialyzed, and equal proportions were assayed for HAT activities by incubating in the presence of [3H]acetyl-CoA using the chromatin itself as a substrate. Fig. 1 a gives the initial characterization of the chromatin. The ethidium bromide-stained gel shows that the salt-soluble chromatin comprises mainly mononucleosomes and dinucleosomes, but larger oligonucleosomes are also present in lower amounts. This contrasts with the distribution of chromatin released from the nuclei, which contains a broad distribution of fragments. When tested for HAT activities, similar counts were recorded for both the released and salt-soluble chromatins, despite the higher quantity of material in the released fraction. Chromatin released by micrococcal nuclease, therefore, contains significant levels of HAT activity, which is largely retained in the salt-soluble fraction. To show the principal targets of the acetyltransferase activity, proteins from the released and salt-soluble chromatins were extracted, and equal proportions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and fluorography was performed. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel shows that the salt-soluble chromatin is depleted in the linker histones H1/H5 but retains a full complement of core histones. In both released and salt-soluble chromatins, the fluorograph shows that histones H4, H3, and to a lesser extent H2A are the principal targets for acetylation. No acetylation of the linker histones is observed in the released chromatin. To test the distribution of active and inactive DNA sequences in the different fractions, DNA was recovered from the released, salt-insoluble pellet and salt-soluble supernatant. Equal proportions were electrophoresed and Southern blots were performed. Filters were then hybridized with probes from inside and outside the β-globin domain. The results of the hybridizations are shown in Fig.1 b. Quantitation of the blots shows that for the inactive chromatin, probe D, approximately 75% of the sequences present in the released chromatin are found in the salt-insoluble chromatin fraction and 25% in the soluble fraction. This fragment is located immediately outside the globin domain and is contained within DNase I-resistant chromatin, which is not highly acetylated (13Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of the sequences from within the globin domain B, βρ-globin, and βA-globin are present in the salt-soluble fraction (65–80% of released). The blots also show the relative size distribution of the different sequences in each fraction. Sequences from within the domain are relatively evenly distributed from the monomer through to higher oligonucleosomes, despite the bias of the DNA toward the shorter fragments that are evident in the soluble fraction. The majority of the inactive sequences, however, are found in the higher oligonucleosomes. Such a distribution of active and inactive sequences has been previously documented by Davie and co-workers (19Ridsdale J.A. Davie J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1081-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots also show the contrast between active and inactive chromatin in the definition of the nucleosomal ladders. The inactive chromatin D has a well defined nuclease ladder. In contrast, the nucleosomes from within the domain are less well defined, and the spacing between monomer and dimer is reduced. The reduced spacing of the active globin gene is similar to that previously described (22Sun Y.L. Xu Y.Z. Bellard M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Taken together the data demonstrate that significant HAT activities are present in the salt-soluble chromatin, which is also enriched in DNA sequences from within the active β-globin domain. Previous studies have shown that salt-soluble chromatin is enriched in acetylated histones (20Ridsdale J.A. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Ridsdale J.A. Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the acetylation levels of released and salt-soluble chromatin to determine whether the HAT activities present preferentially acetylate particular histone isoforms. Histones were extracted from the released and salt-soluble chromatins before and after acetylation and analyzed by AUT-PAGE. These results are given in Fig. 2. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel in Fig. 2 a demonstrates that the salt-soluble chromatin contains an elevated level of H4 acetylation when compared with the bulk-released chromatin. The nonhistone proteins HMG14 and HMG17 are also enriched. The densitometry traces in Fig. 2 b show the relative levels of the different acetyl H4 species. Particularly striking is the depletion of H4 Ac-0 in the salt-soluble chromatin compared with the released chromatin where the Ac-0 species are relatively abundant. Also evident is the increased proportion of H4 Ac-2 and Ac-3, indicating that the salt-soluble chromatin contains levels of H4 acetylation over and above that of the bulk-released chromatin. Acetylation of the chromatin by the associated HAT activities does not significantly alter the bulk acetylation levels of either the released or salt-soluble chromatins. The densitometry traces for the Coomassie Blue-stained H4 are similar for both the unlabeled and labeled samples. However, the fluorograph of the labeled histones shows the distribution of the newly incorporated acetyl groups among the different histones. The labeling of the salt-soluble chromatin is more intense than it is for the released chromatin reflecting the higher ratio of HAT activities to chromatin. As indicated in Fig. 1, histones H4, H3, and H2A are all labeled. For H4, the Ac-2 and Ac-3 are the most heavily labeled species, which is confirmed by the densitometry traces. Some labeling of Ac-1 and Ac-4 is also evident at a lower level. This labeling pattern may well be influenced by the high base-line level of acetylation of the chromatin. However, it could not be altered by pulse-chase labeling experiments or by preparing chromatin in the absence of sodium butyrate (data not shown). This pattern of acetylation suggests a specific targeting of acetylation to H4 resulting in the diacetyl and triacetyl species. To determine the number and size of any acetyltransferase molecules present in the salt-soluble chromatin, we used the in gel HAT activity assay essentially as described by Brownell and Allis (5Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Salt-soluble chromatin was prepared, concentrated, and digested with DNase I to remove the DNA that interferes with the assay. Proteins were then separated through denaturing SDS gels containing either histone or no substrate polymerized into the resolving gel. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed from the gel, and the proteins were treated with 8m urea before renaturing. The gel was then incubated in the presence of [3H]acetyl-CoA to allow any renatured HAT molecules present in the sample to transfer [3H]acetyl groups to the histones polymerized into the gel matrix. After washing, the gel was dried and fluorography was performed. The results of the assay are given in Fig. 3. For this assay, approximately 30 μg of chromatin were used per track. Gels were electrophoresed such that the core histones were run off the bottom. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel shows a number of different proteins present in the salt-soluble chromatin not seen on a normal loading of 2–3 μg (see Fig. 1 a). The fluorograph shows the presence of four bands that have acetyltransferase activity classified by approximate molecular mass; there are a 47-kDa HAT, two similarly sized acetyltransferases 33- and 32-kDa HAT, and a smaller 28-kDa HAT. In the case of the small 33-, 32-, and 28-kDa HAT molecules, the individual bands cannot readily be identified because of the abundance of residual linker histones running in the same region of the gel. It is important to note that the in gel HAT activity assay only reveals the size of HAT molecules and not the native size of any complex of which they might be a component. In addition to the in gel HAT activity assay with histones cast into the gel matrix, we also performed a duplicate assay without histones in the gel to test for autoacetylation activities. This assay shows that the 47-kDa HAT does not autoacetylate whereas the 33-, 32-, and 28-kDa HATs do autoacetylate. The intensity of the autoacetylation for all of the acetyltransferases is weaker than the corresponding histone acetylation. This activity is not unique because PCAF is able to autoacetylate (23Herrera J.E. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a feature we have also observed with a chicken PCAF-HAT domain using this assay (data not shown). Of the acetyltransferase molecules identified to date, the Tetrahymena p55 (yeast Gcn5 homologue) has been identified as part of a stable complex with chromatin isolated from sucrose gradients (5Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Previous studies also demonstrated that an acetyltransferase activity sedimented with mononucleosomes isolated from bovine lymphocytes (24Bohm J. Schlaeger E.J. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether any of the four acetyltransferase molecules present in the salt-soluble chromatin interacted directly with nucleosomes. Salt-soluble chromatin was taken and centrifuged through a sucrose gradient to separate the chromatin from free proteins. Fractions throughout the sucrose gradient were analyzed for HAT activity by incubating with [3H]acetyl-CoA, either with or without the addition of exogenous histones. Fig. 4 ashows a sucrose gradient separation of salt-soluble chromatin together with the HAT activity profiles. When the chromatin is used as a substrate, HAT activity is found throughout the mono-tetranucleosomes. The HAT activity sediments slightly ahead of the bulk chromatin, which is most clearly seen at the leading edge of the mononucleosomal peak. Although a high proportion of the HAT activity is associated with the mononucleosomes, the HAT-activity per unit of chromatin is significantly higher in the di-tetranucleosomes where the quantity of chromatin is less. This finding is consistent with the strength of βA, βρ-globin, and B sequences found hybridizing throughout the different chromatin lengths (see Fig. 1). To test for free HAT activities in the subnucleosomal region of the gradient, HAT assays were performed but with the addition of exogenous calf thymus histones. This process shows a broad peak of HAT activity that can be attributed to HAT molecules which are not intimately associated with the chromatin fragments. To determine the acetylation patterns for the different histones, proteins were extracted from the chromatin sample (monomer-dimer) and from the subnucleosomal region, and they were electrophoresed and fluorography was performed. In addition, samples from both the chromatin and subnucleosomal regions of the gradient were taken and analyzed by in gel HAT activity assays. The results of the analyses are given in Fig. 4 b. For the subnucleosomal region of the gradient, the fluorograph of the labeled histones shows H3 and H4 acetylation. The in gel HAT activity assay shows the presence of the 47- and 33-kDa HAT molecules. For the chromatin sample, labeled histones were extracted and resolved by both SDS and AUT-PAGE, and fluorography was performed. The fluorograph of the SDS gel shows that histone H4 and to a lesser extent H2A are labeled, but the H3 activity seen in the sample before separation on sucrose gradient is no longer present (see Figs. 1 and 2). The Coomassie Blue-stained acetic acid urea gel shows that the gradient-purified chromatin contains a similar level of acetylated histone to the bulk salt-soluble chromatin, notably the reduced level of H4 Ac-0. The nonhistone proteins HMG14 and HMG17 are also evident. The fluorograph of this gel shows that for H4, Ac-2 and Ac-3 are the major species labeled at ratios similar to those in the bulk salt-soluble chromatin (see Fig. 2). The in gel HAT activity assay of this chromatin reveals the presence of the 32- and 28-kDa HAT molecules. There is also some 33-kDa HAT present in the chromatin sample, although the majority of this acetyltransferase is found in the subnucleosomal region of the gradient. To further test the stability of the interaction of the acetyltransferases with the chromatin, salt-soluble chromatin was prepared and treated with buffers containing NaCl up to 400 mm before separation by sucrose gradient. This treatment did not remove the HAT activity from the chromatin, indicating that chromatin/HAT interaction is stable (data not shown). In these experiments it has not been possible to assign the histone acetyltransferase to specific bands in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels. For example, the majority of the 33-kDa HAT, which runs in the same region as the linker histone H1 in the salt-soluble chromatin (Fig. 3), is found in the subnucleosomal region of the sucrose gradient (Fig.4 a). Although this region does not contain any linker histones, the band cannot be clearly identified because of the number of proteins with similar molecular masses (Fig. 4 b). Similarly the 28-kDa acetyltransferase cannot be identified because of the presence of H5 in either the salt-soluble or the sucrose gradient-purified chromatin (Figs. 3 and 4 b). An in gel HAT activity assay of purified monomers using a higher percentage gel is able to partially separate a number of bands from the H5, but the HAT molecule cannot unambiguously be identified (data not shown). The separation of the salt-soluble chromatin by centrifugation through sucrose gradients allows a distinction between free and chromatin-bound HAT molecules to be made. This experiment indicates that the 28- and 32-kDa HAT molecules are primarily associated with chromatin whereas 47- and 33-kDa HAT molecules are not. Given that the interactions between the HAT molecules and the chromatin survive salt treatments and the forces of centrifugation, it is a possibility that the molecules are specifically associated with chromatin derived from active chromosomal locations. To test whether the HAT activity in the salt-soluble monomer is associated with the acetylated, active chromatin, monomers from the first half of the peak containing the highest HAT activity were taken and incubated with either the pan acetyl-lysine antibodies, which are highly specific for active acetylated chromatin (4Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 13Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 25Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Clayton A.L. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), or with H4 antibodies as control. After the removal of antibody-chromatin complexes, the resulting supernatants were assayed for residual HAT activity. The results of the immunodepletion are given in Fig. 5. The HAT activity in the chromatin incubated with H4 antibodies is similar to that of the input sample incubated with the buffer alone, and it shows little or no depletion of activity. In contrast, the pan acetyl-lysine antibodies almost completely deplete the HAT activity from the chromatin, strongly indicating that chromatin-bound HAT molecules are associated with the active fraction. In these experiments, although we were unable to detect HAT activities in the antibody-chromatin complexes, probably because of antibody binding to the histone tails and thus preventing acetylation, we were able to recover the DNA from the immunoprecipitates for hybridization analysis. This DNA along with the DNA from the chromatin supernatants was hybridized to the active βA-globin and inactive D probes, shown in Fig. 5. The Southern blots show that the chromatin incubated with the pan acetyl-lysine antibodies is severely depleted in the βA-globin sequences, whereas the chromatin incubated with H4 antibodies has a similar level to untreated chromatin. In contrast, the inactive probe D sequences are found largely in the supernatants of both chromatin samples. The DNA recovered from the pan acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitate contains the majority of the βA-globin and little or no inactive D sequences, confirming the selectivity of the antibodies for active chromatin. The H4 immunoprecipitate shows a small hybridization signal for both βA-globin and D. This level of hybridization would be expected because the antibodies only precipitate a small proportion of the chromatin, as revealed by the ethidium bromide gel. The immunodepletion of the HAT activity with the pan acetyl-lysine antibodies strongly implies a role for the chromatin-bound acetyltransferases in active chromatin. We have examined chromatin released from 15-day-old chicken embryo erythrocytes by micrococcal nuclease digestion for acetyltransferase activities. This chromatin was found to contain significant acetyltransferase activities directed toward histones H4, H3, and H2A. These activities were retained in the salt-soluble chromatin, which is enriched in DNA sequences from the transcriptionally active β-globin domain. We have previously shown that the chromatin within the domain carries high levels of acetylated core histones and is preferentially sensitive to general DNase I digestion (13Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This soluble chromatin fraction also contains elevated levels of acetylated core histones and is enriched in the nonhistone proteins HMG14 and HMG17, in line with previously described preparations (19Ridsdale J.A. Davie J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1081-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Dorbic T. Wittig B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been reported that HMG17 can be acetylated by PCAF (23Herrera J.E. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although we do not detect HMG17 acetylation in these experiments. The in gel HAT activity assay revealed that the salt-soluble chromatin contains four different HAT molecules classified by approximate molecular masses (47-, 33-, 32-, and 28-kDa HAT molecules). The 47-kDa HAT is similar in size to a number of previously identified HATs,e.g. Tetrahymena p55, the yeast Gcn5 homologue (6Brownell J.E. Zhou J.X. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), the short form of Gcn5 at 60 kDa (27Xu W. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Esa-1 at 53 kDa (28Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3561-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and the elongation factor Elp3 at 60 kDa (12Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument- Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The remaining acetyltransferases are significantly smaller at 33-, 32-, and 28-kDa HATs and represent uncharacterized HAT molecules, the identity of which remains to be determined. Centrifugation of the salt-soluble chromatin through sucrose gradients revealed that two of the acetyltransferases, the 32- and 28-kDa HATs, were chromatin-associated, whereas the 33- and 47-kDa HATs were not. To date, the majority of HATs have been found in multiprotein complexes (7Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Brown C.E. Lechner I. Howe I. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We have considered the possibility that the chromatin-associated acetyltransferase molecules could simply be co-sedimenting within the gradients. If this were the case, then we would expect to see discrete peaks of HAT activity. Our finding that the activity is distributed throughout the chromatin fragments suggests that the activities are chromatin-associated (Fig. 4). However, because the in gel HAT activity assay disrupts multiprotein interactions, we do not know whether the HAT molecules bind chromatin individually or are part of a small complex, which only slightly affects the sedimentation characteristics of the chromatin. Because of the overlap of different HAT activities it has not been possible to assign a particular histone target to an individual HAT molecule. We note, however, that the H3 activity present in the salt-soluble chromatin before centrifugation (see Figs. 1 and 2) is not present on the purified mono-dinucleosomes. This finding indicates that the activity could reside on either the 47- or 33-kDa HAT molecules. The predominant HAT activity associated with the chromatin targets H4 to give diacetyl and triacetyl species. Although we cannot assign the activity to either the 32- or 28-kDa molecules, these data indicate a specific role for the diacetyl and triacetyl species of H4 in active chromatin. These data are further supported by the ability of the pan acetyl-lysine antibodies to immunodeplete the salt-soluble mononucleosomes of HAT activity (Fig. 5). These antibodies are highly specific for acetylated, active chromatins (4Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Our previous experiments have shown that chromatins precipitated by these antibodies are highly enriched in sequences within the β-globin domain and also contain all acetylated isoforms of H4 (4Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 13Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The experiments described here reveal the presence of a number of different acetyltransferases in a chromatin fraction enriched in active sequences including those of the β-globin domain. The data do not show whether the different HAT molecules actually operate within the globin domain because the chromatin preparation contains more than one specific subset of active genes. Future experiments will identify these HAT molecules and test whether any of them play roles in the domain-wide acetylation we have previously observed.

An inhibitor of the enzyme, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, free in solution and bound in its complex with the enzyme has been studied by Raman difference spectroscopy. By using isotopically labeled 7,8-dihydrobiopterin and normal mode analyses based on ab initio quantum mechanic methods, we have positively identified some of the Raman bands in the enzyme-bound inhibitor, particularly the important N5=C6 stretch mode. The spectrum of the enzyme-bound inhibitor shows that the p Ka of N5 is not significantly increased in the complex. This result suggests that N5 of 7,8-dihydroneopterin is not protonated before the bond cleavage of 7,8-dihydroneopterin during the DHNA-catalyzed reaction as has been suggested. Our results also show that the N5=C6 stretch mode of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin shifts 19 cm−1 upon binding to DHNA. Various possibilities on how the enzyme can bring about such large frequency change of the N5=C6 stretch mode are discussed.

Various possibilities on how the enzyme can bring about such large frequency change of the N5=C6 stretch mode are discussed. dihydroneopterin aldolase dihydrofolate reductase Dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA)1 catalyzes the conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin and glycolaldehyde (Scheme FSI). This enzyme is an important link in the pathway of folate biosynthesis in most microbes. It and the other enzyme important to folate pathway, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), are important potential drug targets for antibacterial chemotherapy. Recently, the x-ray crystal structures of 7,8-dihydroneopterin aldolase from Staphylococcus aureus and its complex with 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin were determined (1Hennig M. D'Arcy A. Hampele I.C. Page M.G.P. Oefner C. Dale G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There are several key residues at the active site that interact directly with bound substrate. These are Glu-74, Lys-100, Glu-32, a structural water molecule close to N5 of the pterin ring, Val-52, and several main chain amino groups as shown in Scheme FSI. All these factors can result in substantial distortions of the ground state electronic properties of bound substrates; some are important to binding and others are important to catalytic turnover. The vibrational spectrum of a molecule reports on the bonds orders of molecular bonds and is very sensitive to the small changes in the distribution of electrons within bonds that come about when an enzyme binds its substrate. The changes are a fingerprint of the enzyme-substrate interactions that exist in the ground state. Raman difference spectroscopy is well suited for the measurement of the Raman spectrum of a ligand bound to an enzyme (2Callender R. Deng H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 215-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we have applied the technique to the DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin (Scheme FSII) enzyme-substrate complex. Previous studies have shown that 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is an inhibitor to the DHNA-catalyzed conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin, and it also promotes the formation of enzymic tetramer, an inactive form of the enzyme, from the active octamer. 2Glenn E. Dale, unpublished observations. In addition, our current studies show that 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is a poor substrate of DHNA. It is converted to a not as yet fully characterized species but at a reaction rate slow enough so that Raman difference spectroscopy is feasible. Since 7,8-dihydrobiopterin and 7,8-dihydroneopterin (the normal substrate of dihydroneopterin aldolase) are very similar structurally, particularly with regard to the pterin ring and close to the bond breaking point in the catalyzed reaction and also undergo enzymic catalysis, we use bound 7,8-dihydrobiopterin as a mimic for the Michaelis complex of this enzyme. The binding site structure of DHNA around the pterin ring of the substrate is very much like that of dihydrofolate reductase (3Kraut J. Matthews D.A. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies: Active Sites of Enzymes. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 1-72Google Scholar, 4Bystroff C. Oatley S.J. Kraut J.

For example, the N2—C2—N3 moiety of the dihydropterin ring forms hydrogen bonds to Glu-74, similar to those found for the structurally conserved Asp in dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR). This, other structural similarities, and chemical considerations prompted the suggestion that the reaction mechanism of DHNA may be similar in some respects to DHFR (1Hennig M. D'Arcy A. Hampele I.C. Page M.G.P. Oefner C. Dale G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been postulated that the electron flow out of the C–C bond that is broken by DHNA (Scheme FSI) could be stabilized by protonation of N5 of the pterin ring. A recent study using Raman difference spectroscopy of the electronic structure of substrates bound to Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase showed that the p Ka of N5 is raised from 2.6 in solution to 6.5. This can be determined in titration studies using vibrational spectroscopy since the N5=C6 stretch “marker” band is located near 1650 or 1675 cm−1 for unprotonated or protonated N5, respectively, exhibiting then easily measured and well separated bands (6Chen Y.-Q. Kraut J. Blakley R.L. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Hence, a particular focus of this investigation is the protonation state of N5 in the pterin ring for substrate bound to DHNA. We found little, or no, protonation of N5 when 7,8-dihydrobiopterin binds to DHNA. However, other unusual binding-induced changes to the electronic structure of the substrate within the pterin ring are observed. 7,8-Dihydroneopterin, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, and [5-15N]7,8-dihydrobiopterin were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. B. Schircks (Jona, Switzerland). DHNA was prepared according to the published procedures (1Hennig M. D'Arcy A. Hampele I.C. Page M.G.P. Oefner C. Dale G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The sample was then stored at −80 °C in 20 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 5% glycerol. The sample for spectroscopic measurements was prepared by extensive dialysis of the DHNA sample in 25 mmTris at pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl buffer, followed by concentration with a Centricon 30 centrifuge concentrator (Amicon, Lexington, MA) to the desired concentration. The concentrations of DHNA and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin were determined spectroscopically, using a molar extinction coefficients of 83000m−1 cm−1at 280 nm for the DHNA octamer and 6170m−1 cm−1at 330 nm (7Maharaj G. Selinsky B.S. Appleman J.R. Perlman M. London R.E. Blakley R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4554-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for 7,8-dihydrobiopterin. The binary complex of DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin was prepared by mixing DHNA and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in a molar ratio of 1:1. Typical concentration of the DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin complex for UV-visible absorption studies was approximately 0.05–0.5 mn (active site) and for Raman studies was about 4 mm. The Raman spectra were measured using an optical multichannel analyzer system. The optical multichannel analyzer system uses a Triplemate spectrometer (Spex Industries, Metuchen, NJ) with a model DIDA-1000 reticon detector connected to an ST-100 detector (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). Details of the system can be found elsewhere (2Callender R. Deng H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 215-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The 514.5 nm line from an argon ion laser (model 165, Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) was used to irradiate the sample (∼100 milliwatts). Separate spectra for enzyme and enzyme-inhibitor complexes in solution, approximate concentration of 4 mm, were measured using a special split cell (the volume of each side being about 30 μl) and a sample holder with a linear translator as described previously (2Callender R. Deng H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 215-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The spectrum from one side of the split cuvette is taken, the split cell is translated, and the spectrum from the other side is taken. This sequence is repeated until sufficient signal to noise is obtained. A difference spectrum is generated by numerically subtracting the sum of the spectra obtained from each side. In general, the two summed spectra do not subtract to zero, as judged by the subtraction of well know protein marker bands (for example, the amide-I, amide-III, and the 1450 cm−1 bands, the latter band being especially useful since it is generally not affected by protein conformational changes). These protein marker bands are determined from their bandwidths (generally much broader than those from spectra of bound substrates) and their characteristic positions. Hence, one summed spectrum is scaled by a small numerical factor, generally between 1.05 and 0.95, which is adjusted until the protein bands are nulled (see e.g. Ref. 8Deng H. Kurz L. Rudolph F. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4968-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The same control procedures were performed on all the difference spectra results herein. Resolution of the spectrometer is 8 cm−1 for the present results. A spectral calibration is done for each measurement using the known Raman lines of toluene, and absolute band positions are accurate to within ±2 cm−1. None of the spectra presented here have been smoothed. The ab initio calculations were carried out on the models by Hatree-Fock method with the 6–31 g** basis set, as implemented in Gaussian 98. The geometries of the model compound of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin were first optimized energetically, and then the vibrational normal modes were calculated using the same basis set. True local minimum on the potential surface of the complexes for the geometry-optimized complexes was verified from the vibrational frequency calculations in which no imaginary frequency was found. In all cases, a stable structure of the model compound is achieved without any geometry constraint. When 7,8-dihydrobiopterin binds to DHNA, it slowly undergoes product formation. Fig. 1 shows the UV-visible absorption measurements of the DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin complex at 1-, 10-, 25-, 55-, 80-, 120-, 150-, 180-, and 360-min time intervals, respectively, after mixing. The sample pH was 7.8, and the temperature was set to 32 °C. The initial spectrum has a λmax of 332 nm, slightly red-shifted from the 328 nm λmax of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in solution at the same pH. DHNA then slowly converts 7,8-dihydrobiopterin into a new species, which has an absorption band at 423 nm. Separate kinetic experiments of this complex at various pH values indicate that the reaction rate is lowered by about 2.5-fold for pH 6.5. The intensity increase of the 423 nm absorption band can be fitted with a first order exponential function. Based on this result and the observation of a clear isosbestic point found in the absorption spectra of complex at various stages of the reaction (Fig. 1), it is reasonable to conclude that only one product is formed. A similar spectral change occurs for 7,8-dihydroneopterin, the normal substrate of DHNA. However, no isosbestic point was found, and the kinetics cannot be fitted with a single exponential function. This product of the reaction of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is not due to protonation of N5 of the pterin ring; the red shift is much too large. Titration studies of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in solution show that when N5 of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is protonated, a new absorption band at ∼365 nm appears. If protonated 7,8-dihydrobiopterin has a similar absorption in DHNA, we can estimate the percentage of this form in the DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin complex from its absorption spectrum taken just after mixing. On this basis, less than 10% of N5 is of the protonated form in the enzyme·7,8-dihydrobiopterin complex. Furthermore, there is no detectable increase of this form when the sample pH is changed to 6.5. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in solution at pH 6.5. The p Ka of N5 is 2.6 (6Chen Y.-Q. Kraut J. Blakley R.L. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) so that N5 of pterin ring is unprotonated in the spectra of Fig. 2. There are four major peaks above 1400 cm−1 evident in Fig. 2 a, at 1480, 1559, 1605, and 1636 cm−1, respectively. The band at 1636 cm−1 can be assigned to the C6=N5 stretch based on its 17 cm−1 down shift in the15N5-labeled compound spectrum (Fig. 2 b) (6). The other three bands have not been assigned before. However, with the aid of ab initio frequency calculations at the HF/6-31 g** level performed on a model compound for 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, preliminary assignments of these bands can be made. Here we need to point out that the chemical bond lengths, especially the double bonds which contain oxygen or nitrogen, are underestimated by ab initio methods at the Hatree-Fock level compared with those observed values. This is due to the neglect of electron correlation forces in the calculations, the limited basis set, and also that the calculations are “gas phase” which do not treat the interactions with solvent. Consequently, the calculated stretch frequencies of these bonds are typically overestimated (15–20%) compared with the observed values. Nevertheless, the overestimation of the calculated frequency differences compared with experimentally determined values tends to remain constant. Hence, by applying a uniform scaling to the calculated frequencies, reasonably accurate normal mode assignments can be made based on the calculations. Our previous experience on such calculations suggests that, in many cases, the calculations provide a reasonable description of the normal modes and their response to isotopic labeling or to environmental change around the molecule (9Deng H. Wang J. Callender R.H. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10972-10979Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Deng H. Callender R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7730-7737Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Wang J.H. Xiao D.G. Deng H. Webb M.R. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11106-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is well known that the Raman bands in the spectral region between 1400 and 1700 cm−1 consist of normal modes mainly due to C=C, C=O, and C=N stretch motions and CH bending motions. For 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, there are four double bonds, and thus we expect to observe at least four Raman bands in these region, although some of the modes may contain more than one double bond stretch characters. According to the ab initio frequency calculations on an isolated 7,8-dihydrobiopterin molecule, there are five vibrational modes that have relatively strong Raman intensities in this region. The calculations predict that the band with lowest frequency in this region, at 1480 cm−1 in Fig.2 a, which is not sensitive to the 15N5 labeling but shifts down by 6 to 1474 cm−1 when the exchangeable protons of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin are deuterated as occurs for solution samples in D2O (panels b and c of Fig. 2, respectively), is likely due to the in-plane bending mode of the C7H2 group of the dihydropterin ring. There are two ways to make assignments of the two bands at 1559 and 1605 cm−1. The first is to assign the 1559 cm−1 band to a C=C ring stretch which also contains contribution from N8H bend. This mode is not sensitive to the15N5 labeling (Fig. 2 b) but shifts down 38 cm−1 for deuterated samples (Fig.2 c) which removes coupling to NH bending motions because of the large down shift of a ND bend. In this case, the 1605 cm−1 band in Fig. 2 a is assigned to the C1=N2 stretch with contributions from N2H and N3H bending motions. In D2O, the frequency of this mode would down shift to 1577 cm−1 as observed (Fig. 2 c) because its coupling with the NH bending is removed. A second way to assign these two modes that is compatible with the calculations is that the C1=N2 stretch and C=C stretch of the dihydropterin ring are coupled to form an in-phase and an out-of-phase pair. The in-phase mode has a higher Raman intensity and lower frequency, the 1559 cm−1 band in Fig. 2 a can be assigned to this mode. The out-of-phase mode has a lower Raman intensity and higher frequency, and the 1605 cm−1 band in Fig. 2 a can be assigned to this mode. Since both of these modes have contributions from the ring NH bending motions, significant frequency shifts are predicted for deuterated samples, which is consistent with experimental observations. The ab initio calculations also predict that the two highest frequency modes in this region are due to the C6=N5 and C4=O stretch modes. The C6=N5 stretch mode is predicted to have the highest Raman intensity and its frequency is insensitive to NH deuteration (unless N5 is protonated, which is not the case here). Such predictions are in very good agreement with the experimental observations (see Fig. 2,a and c). The calculations also predict that the frequency of the C4=O stretch mode, predicted to have significantly lower (0.2–0.1 times) Raman intensity than that of C6=N5 mode, is very sensitive to the strength of hydrogen bonding to the C4=O oxygen. In vacuum, its frequency is higher than the C6=N5 stretch but, if a hydrogen-bonded water molecule is included in the calculations, its frequency is comparable to the C6=N5 stretch mode. This prediction is supported by the observation of the Raman and IR spectra of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in Me2SO (data not shown). The C6=N5 stretch shifts down by 6 only cm−1 for 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in Me2SO compared with its value in water, whereas a new Raman band is observed at 1658 cm−1 that is insensitive to 15N5 labeling (data not shown). Based on this and the fact that the 1658 cm−1 band is very strong in IR, the 1658 cm−1 band can be easily assigned to C=O stretch for 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in Me2SO. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the C4=O stretch mode of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in water is hidden somewhere under the intense C6=N5 stretch mode at 1636 cm−1 in Fig. 2 a. Our calculations also predict that, under certain conditions, the C4=O stretch and C6=N5 stretch can be mixed. It this case, the Raman intensity of the C4=O becomes significantly higher by borrowing intensity from the C6=N5 stretch. Such results provide a rationale for the observation of the doublet at 1623/1638 cm−1 in 7,8-dihydrobiopterin in D2O (Fig. 2 c). Apparently, this doublet is due to the coincidental mixing of the two stretch modes so that the intensity of the C4=O mode becomes much stronger. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that only a single band is observed at 1614 cm−1 (data not shown) for the15N5-labeled compound in D2O. The band at 1623 cm−1 can be assigned to the C4=O stretch, whereas that at 1638 cm−1 can be assigned to the C6=N5 stretch since the former is strong in the IR spectrum compared with the latter (data not shown). Since 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is slowly converted to product during the Raman measurements, the difference spectrum between DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin complex and DHNA obtained in the usual way (see “Materials and Methods”) will contain Raman bands from the bound enzyme product of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin. Thus, an extra Raman spectrum of DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin complex was taken after the reaction completed, as monitored by UV-visible absorption. Since it has been shown that there is just one product (see above and Fig. 1) and the product has characteristic Raman bands that are distinct from those of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (data not shown), it is possible to remove all of the peaks of the enzyme product from the Raman difference spectrum. This was achieved by obtaining two difference spectra between DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin complex and DHNA as follows: the first was from the freshly prepared DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin, and the was second from the DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin complex 3 h later after the reaction was completed. An appropriate amount of the second difference spectrum is subtracted from the first to remove the Raman peaks due to the enzyme product. The results of this procedure are presented in the difference spectra of Fig. 3. In these spectra the major bands are from bound 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, and the minor bands are either from unbound 7,8-dihydrobiopterin or from DHNA itself since protein Raman bands are slightly affected by binding ligands (2Callender R. Deng H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 215-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The major bands at 1482, 1559, 1605, and 1655 cm−1in the Fig. 3 a spectrum can be assigned to the bound 7,8-dihydrobiopterin since corresponding bands in the solution spectrum of solution 7,8-dihydrobiopterin can be readily found (Fig.2 a). The spectral features of the small band at 1679 cm−1 in Fig. 3 a and the dip at its low frequency side are likely due to incompletely nulled protein peaks in the difference spectrum. The 1679 cm−1 peak does not shift upon 15N5 labeling of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (Fig. 3 b) or deuteration of the sample (Fig. 3 c); thus it does not arise from the protonated C6=N5 stretch. It is interesting to note that the bands at 1482, 1559, and 1605 cm−1 are all within 2 cm−1 of their corresponding position in aqueous solution, thus they can be assigned to the C7H2 bending, C=C stretching, and C2=N1 stretching modes, respectively. The 1655 cm−1 band in Fig. 3 a, assigned to the C6=N5 stretch based on its 18 cm−1 down shift upon 15N5 labeling (Fig. 3 b), shifts up by 19 cm−1 relative to its solution value (Fig.2 a). Since this band remains at 1655 cm−1 when the sample is deuterated (Fig.3 c), N5 of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is not protonated when bound to DHNA. Thus, on the basis of the Raman results, no significant amount of protonated N5 of bound 7,8-dihydrobiopterin can be detected under our experimental conditions. Similar experiments performed at pH 6.5 yield the same results (data not shown). We tentatively assign the 1615 cm−1 band observed in Fig. 3 c to the C4=O stretch because it is near its position at 1623 cm−1 found in the solution spectrum (Fig.2 c) and has about the right Raman intensity for this band. The apparent small 7 cm−1 down shift of the C4=O stretch upon binding is consistent with a small amount of bond polarization that is often observed for keto groups bound to proteins. Such a bond polarization comes about from increased hydrogen bonding in the protein relative to water (2Callender R. Deng H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 215-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the influence of the binding pocket on the C6=N5 stretch frequency, we have conducted additional ab initio calculations on a series of model systems of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, including its complex with a carboxyl group in contact with N2H2 and N3H, a water molecule hydrogen-bonded to the C=O or OH groups in various configurations, and different orientations of the OH group of the chain relative to the N5. The results show that the addition of a carboxyl group has a relatively large effect on the C6=N5 stretch mode, causing a shift of this mode by about 10 cm−1 but toward lower frequency. The hydrogen bonding on the OH or C=O by a water molecule does not have significant effect on the C6=N5 stretch, causing less than 5 cm−1 shift. On the other hand, the orientation of the first OH group of the arm on C6 has a significant effect on the C6=N5 stretch. When the orientation of this OH changes from anti (relative to N5) to a syn conformation, the C6=N5 stretch is predicted to shift by about 10 cm−1 toward higher frequency. The substrate-binding site of DHNA near the pterin ring bears a strong similarity to the binding of folate substrates to dihydrofolate reductases. For example, the carboxyl of Glu-74 in the DHNA binding pocket is positioned very similarly to that of the strictly conserved Asp group (Asp-27 in E. coli DHFR) in the reductases. A structural water molecule is also found in E. coli DHFR (12McTigue M.A. Davies J.F., II Kaufman B.T. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7264-7273Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in some of the crystallographic structures in a place similar to that in the DHNA-binding site (see Scheme FSI). In the dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate reaction, N5 of the pterin ring is protonated. It is often supposed that the conserved Asp groups of DHFRs either donate the proton to N5 via active site structural water molecules or stabilize the positive charge on protonated N5 (4Bystroff C. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 13Benkovic S.J. Fierke C.A. Naylor A.M. Science. 1988; 239: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,14Stone S.R. Morrison J.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2753-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that the pterin ring C=O bond is polarized (5Lee H. Reyes V.M. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7012-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and this is consistent with a proton relay system from Asp-27 to N5 via binding site water molecule(s). It has been shown that the p Ka of N5 of dihydrofolate bound to E. coli DHFR is raised from its solution value of 2.6 to 6.5, and this structural attribute can be a major factor in the activity of this enzyme. Asp-27 is essential for enzymic activity in DHFR (17Howell E.E. Villafranca J.E. Warren M.S. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Science. 1986; 231: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) as well as structurally necessary for raising the p Ka of N5 in situ (6Chen Y.-Q. Kraut J. Blakley R.L. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given these structural similarities, it is reasonable to compare the structures of the bound pterin ring in DHFR to that in DHNA. Our UV-visible and Raman studies indicate that, in the Michaelis complex of DHNA·7,8-dihydrobiopterin, more than 90% of N5 is unprotonated. Furthermore, there is no detectable change in its UV-visible and Raman spectra when the sample pH is changed from 7.8 to 6.5, suggesting that no significant amount of protonated N5 is present. The results place the p Ka of N5 of bound 7,8-dihydrobiopterin to be less than around 5. The kinetic data on the DHNA-catalyzed reaction on 7,8-dihydrobiopterin shows that the optimal pH for the DHNA-catalyzed reaction is about 9, similar to that for the 7,8-dihydroneopterin, consistent with the argument that protonated N5 is not required in the ground state or in the transition state of the reaction. We also find that the C=O group of the pterin ring of bound 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is apparently not particularly polarized from its solution value. All of this is in contrast to DHFR where the p Ka of N5 is 6.5 and the pH profile for hydride transfer has its half-maximum also near this value (15Fierke C.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 16Morrison J.F. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5499-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus the effect on the pterin ring by binding to DHNA is quite different than that found for dihydrofolates bound to (E. coli) DHFR despite the similarities in the structure of the binding pocket. The pterin ring binding pocket of DHNA would appear to be the design for binding of the ring and not for promotion of the catalyzed reaction. This notion is strongly reinforced in studies of mutant DHNA whereby only a small decrease (to 25% of the wild type) in activity is found for enzymes that lack the active site Glu-74.2 It needs to be pointed out here that our preliminary results suggest that the product from DHNA-catalyzed conversion of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is not the same as that from 7,8-dihydroneopterin, the natural substrate of DHNA. Thus, the terminal OH group in 7,8-dihydroneopterin plays a crucial role in the reaction, since its presence does not only dictate the reaction rate but also the reaction pathway. On the other hand, the unprotonated state of N5 in 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is unlikely the reason for the slow turnover rate compared with 7,8-dihydroneopterin since both of these molecules have similar pH reaction profiles, as mentioned above. The only significant observed change in the electronic structure of pterin ring of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin bound to DHNA relative to its solution form observed by our study is within the C6=N5 bond. The C6=N5 stretch increases 19 cm−1 upon binding. This is an unusual change and is difficult to bring about. As outlined under “Results,” our calculations indicate that none, i.e.Glu-74, the active site water molecule, Lys-100 (see Scheme FSI), of the active site polar groups can bring about the increased electron density in the C6=N5 bond through electrostatic interactions (i.e.hydrogen bonding) that would result in the increased frequency of the C6=N5 stretch. This is particularly surprising with regard to the hydrogen bonding of the NH2 group of Lys-100 to substrate that certainly participates in enzymic catalyzed C–C bond breaking. This leaves steric interactions at the active site that change the conformation and electron distribution of the pterin ring through geometry changes and/or imposition of strain on the bound substrate. For example, there is a substantial upward shift in frequency (although only about half that observed) for a C6=N5 bond that is synto the adjacent N6–C(OH)– group compared with the anticonformation (see Table 2 in Ref. 10Deng H. Callender R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7730-7737Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is certainly possible that the enzyme imposes strain on the alcoholic alkane “arm” of the bound biopterin which brings about sufficient electron delocalization to increase the electron density in the C6=N5 bond, hence increasing the C6=N5 stretch."

We have identified three different human COT mRNAs and the 5′ region flanking the transcription initiation site of the COT gene. We also provide evidence that T cell activation up-regulates the levels of the three COT kinase mRNAs and increases the transcriptional activity of the human COT gene promoter through the JNK/SAPK signal transduction pathway.

Genomic DNA was obtained as described previously (23Blin N. Stafford D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar). A 6.1-kb DNA fragment containing the 5′ region flanking the translation initiation site of COT kinase was obtained with the human genomic DNA PromoterFinderTM DNA walking kit (CLONTECH), using two specific reverse primers deduced from the sequence of the first COT coding exon. Different DNA fragments of the 5′ flanking region of the COTgene were generated by PCR with different direct primers (−8D, −7D, −6D, −5D, −4D, −3D, −2D, and −1D) and PR as reverse primer. The −778Δ PCR product was performed with −7D and upTATA primers. Purified PCR products were cloned in pMOS Blue T-vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Single clones were selected, and their sequences were compared with the original template. From these constructs, the KpnI/HindIII fragments were cloned in the pGL3-Basic Luc-reporter vector (Promega). Sequencing, using specific oligonucleotides and Sequenase (U. S.

Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and ethanol was precipitated. RNA was extracted from the pellets by using the SV total RNA isolation system kit (Promega). By using Ultraspec (Biotecx Laboratories), 20 μg of total RNA was extracted from Jurkat cells stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDBu, 0.25 μmcalcium ionophore, and 100 nm okadaic acid for different times. RNA was electrophoresed and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Nytran, NY 13N, Renner GmbH).

Multiple tissue human poly(A)+ RNA Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with different probes as described above. Stripping was performed by boiling the membrane for 30 min in 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS. Control autoradiographs were performed after each stripping.

The autoradiograph was exposed for 7 days at −70 °C. Two μg of total RNA treated with 2.5 units of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) as in Ref.9Ballester A. Velasco A. Tobeña R. Alemany S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14099-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One μl of this reaction was used for PCR analysis. Control samples treated with DNase I and not exposed to RT were also subjected to PCR. To perform the RT-PCRs from leukocyte mRNA, 1 μl of human leukocyte Marathon-ready cDNA library (CLONTECH) was used. Controls without a template, with genomic DNA as a template, and with one single primer were performed. Seven pmol of the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide PE, complementary to nt 123–140 of the three COT transcripts, was annealed to 7 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from PDBu- and calcium ionophore-stimulated Jurkat cells, and a RT reaction was carried out. After synthesis, nucleic acids were precipitated, and reaction products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 murea. A 434-nt labeled RNA probe (50–80 × 104 cpm/fmol), of which 409 nt were complementary to nt 5820–6229 of COT-1that corresponds to a region of the coding sequence, was obtained using the Maxiscript kit (Ambion). RNase A protection assay was performed with the radioimmune precipitation buffer II kit (Ambion). Dried gels were exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C for 2 days. For the S1 nuclease analysis a radiolabeled DNA probe (probe D (589–2784 nt), 10–30 × 105 cpm/fmol) was obtained using the Prime-A-Probe kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that 0.9% alkaline agarose gels were used to purify the labeled probe. Nuclease S1 protection assay was performed with the Multi-NPA kit (Ambion). Agarose gels (0.9%) were exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C for 4 days. Hybridization of a leukocyte poly(A)+ RNA Northern blot with a codingCOT probe yielded two hybridization signals at 3.0 and 7.3 kb (Fig. 1 A). To investigate whether the occurrence of these transcripts was due to the different length of the 5′ UTR, we cloned and sequenced a 6.1-kb DNA genomic fragment containing the 5′ flanking region of the COTtranslation initiation site. Several probes from this region were generated by PCR (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of the poly(A)+ RNA Northern blot with these probes revealed a hybridization signal only at 7.3 kb (Fig. 1 A), indicating that this COT mRNA species has a large 5′ UTR. To determine the sequence of the 5′ UTR of the different COTmRNAs, RT-PCR analysis was performed. The direct and reverse primers used were deduced from the sequence of the 6.1-kb genomic fragment containing the 5′ flanking region of the COTtranslation initiation site. PCR of overlapping fragments was performed using as a template reverse transcribed mRNA of Jurkat cells. Different PCRs were performed with the combinations of each direct primer and all the different 3′-located reverse primers. Control samples treated with DNase I and not exposed to RT were also subjected to PCR. Controls without a template, with genomic DNA as a template, and with one single primer were also performed. The different PCR products obtained (Fig. 1 B) were analyzed by restriction mapping and by sequencing (data not shown). The same overlapping PCR products were obtained when human leukocyte cDNA was used as a template (data not shown). This analysis revealed that theCOT gene is transcribed with three different 5′ UTRs. The transcription start site of these three 5′ UTRs was delimited to the same 30-nt region by PCR analysis, using as a template cDNA from Jurkat cells as well as human leukocyte cDNA (data not shown). (See “Determination of the Transcription Start Site of the Human COT Gene” for the location of the exact start transcription site.) To establish the 5′ UTR of COT-1 by a method other than RT-PCR, S1 nuclease analysis was performed. A DNA probe (probe D) complementary to the 589–2784-nt sequence of the 5′ UTR ofCOT-1 was hybridized with RNA obtained from Jurkat cells and incubated with nuclease S1 (Fig. 1 C). This probe contains the entire sequence of probe B and is extended to the DNA sequence of probe A. The intron/exon boundaries of the three different 5′ UTRs of COT transcripts are shown in TableI.Table IIntron-exon organization of the 5′ region of the human COT genemRNAExonSizentSequence at intron-exon junctionSplice acceptorSplice donorntCOT-1150841–5084ATTAAACATGgttagtttctCOT-21a1921–192AAGGCCGCAGgtaatccagg1b2292984–3212ttgttttagATGCAATCTTCACCTCATGAGgtaggtgctg1c3594726–5084tctttcctagACTCTCCAGATATTAAACATGgttagtttctCOT-31a1921–192AAGGCCGCAGgtaatccagg1c3594726–5084tctttcctagACTCTCCAGATATTAAACATGgttagtttctPositions have been designated according to their location in the COT-1 transcript.

Open table in a new tab Positions have been designated according to their location in the COT-1 transcript. Exon sequences are shown in uppercase letters; intron sequences are shown in lowercase letters. We also investigated the possibility of alternative splicing in the coding sequence and 3′ UTR of COT transcripts. RT-PCR analysis revealed no alternative splicing in these regions. The coding sequence and 3′ UTR region of COT transcripts have a size of 2.5 kb (data not shown). Considering the length of the 5′ UTR of the three COT transcripts, the 7.3-kb COTmRNA species detected in the leukocyte poly(A)+ RNA Northern blot (Fig. 1 A) should correspond toCOT-1, and the 3.0-kb signal should correspond toCOT-2 and COT-3. The three COTtranscripts were detected by RT-PCR in all human tissues tested (Fig.1 D), indicating that none of the different COTtranscripts is tissue-specific, although the relative amounts seem to vary between the different tissues. When the PCRs were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 D, the ratio ofCOT-2 to COT-1 oscillated between 0.5 for liver or pancreas and 1.6 for muscle. The ratio of COT-3 toCOT-2 varied from 9.8 for lung to 1.2 for pancreas. The transcription start site of the COT gene was delimited by RT-PCR analysis to a 30-nt region (data not shown). The exact transcription start site of the COT gene was determined by primer extension on poly(A)+ RNA from stimulated Jurkat cells with a primer complementary to primer 1D (PE primer). This sequence is complementary to the three COTtranscripts. As shown in Fig. 2, a single product corresponding to a 140-base extended fragment was detected. The first transcribed base has been designated +1, to facilitate numbering of the different COT transcripts. Sequence analysis revealed a putative TATA box located at position −20 nt (Figs. 2 and 3 A), which is in agreement with the preferred position occupied by this element in a typical eukaryotic promoter (26Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar).Figure 3Nucleotide sequence and putative regulatory elements of the 5′ flanking region of the human COTgene and determination of its transcriptional activity. A, the sequence is numbered relative to the transcription start site, which is referred to as +1. The putative regulatory elements are indicated in bold letters belowunderlined sequences. B, Jurkat cells were transfected with the pGL3, pGL3–778 (5′-3′), pGL3–778Δ, and pGL3–778 (3′-5′) constructs (20 μg/0.8 ml). The graph shows the value of LRU/mg of protein (prot.) performed three times in duplicate. A schematic representation of the different constructs is also shown. The nomenclature of the different constructs is denoted relative to the transcription initiation site (position +1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the DNA region 5′ flanking the defined transcription start site of the human COT gene has promoter activity, transient expression experiments with the pGL3-Luc basic vector linked to different fragments of this DNA region were carried out. Jurkat cells were transfected with pGL3, pGL3–778 (5′-3′), and pGL3–778Δ as well as with the pGL3–778 (3′-5′) construct, and luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 3 B). The pGL3–778 (5′-3′) construct, containing nt −778 to +115 of the COTgene, exhibited a transcriptional activity 20-fold higher than that of the empty pGL3 vector. The −30 to +115-nt region is essential in maintaining this increase, because deletion of the −30 to +115-nt fragment, in the pGL3–778Δ construct, resulted in transcriptional activity similar to pGL3. No promoter activity over background levels was detected with the pGL3–778 (3′-5′) construct, indicating that this region contains the transcription start site of the COT gene and not only cis-response elements. To further study the transcriptional activity of the 5′ flanking region of theCOT gene, transient expression experiments were conducted in Jurkat cells with pGL3 plasmids containing 1082 bp of theCOT gene 5′ flanking region (Figs. 3 and4 A) as well as 5′ deletion fragments (Fig. 4 A). Comparison of the relative promoter activities of the different constructs indicated that the progressive removal of 5′ sequences up to −650 did not significantly affect the COT promoter activity in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4 B). Deletion of the −466 to −650 DNA fragment significantly decreased the transcriptional activity. Further deletion of nt −340 to −229 further decreased the activity of the COT promoter (Fig. 4 B). However, the pGL3–229 and pGL3–102 constructs still exhibited a transcriptional activity 7-fold higher than vector pGL3 (data not shown). To determine whether COT promoter activity is regulated by T cell-activating signals, Jurkat cells were transfected with the different COT promoter-derived constructs and stimulated with PDBu (50 ng/ml) and calcium ionophore (0.25 μm) or with αCD3 (10 μg/ml) and PDBu (50 ng/ml). Comparison of the luciferase activities produced by each different plasmid in unstimulated and stimulated cells showed that deletion of the sequences located between positions −1082 to −340 did not significantly affect the 3-fold induction relative to the unstimulated activity of each construct. Further removal of the sequences from position −340 to −229 abolished the 3-fold induction by these signals (Fig.4 B). One AP-1 binding site (27Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar, 28Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) is found at position −327 nt of the 5′ flanking region of the COT gene (Fig. 3 A). The AP-1 transcription factor is up-regulated in T lymphocytes activated with PDBu and calcium ionophore or with αCD3 and PDBu, and the JNK/SAPK signal transduction pathway mediates its activation. To determine whether this signal transduction pathway regulates, at least in part, activation of the COT promoter, Jurkat cells were cotransfected with pGL3–340 or pGL3–788 together with the dominant negative form of JNK kinase, DN-SEK-2 (MKK7-KL), that inhibits the activation of c-Jun. Cells were stimulated or not with PDBu (50 ng/ml) and calcium ionophore (0.25 μm) or with αCD3 (10 μg/ml) and PDBu (50 ng/ml). As shown in Fig. 4 C, the expression of the DN-SEK-2 abolished the increase of the promoter-driven transcription of the pGL3–340 and pGL3–778 constructs by T-cell activating signals. To further analyze the signal transduction mechanism by which theCOT promoter is activated, transient transfection experiments with the pGL3–340 construct were performed. Addition of PDBu or calcium ionophore by itself did not increase the luciferase activity, indicating that an integration of both signals has to occur to activate COT promoter-driven transcription (Fig.4 D). Transfected cells were also incubated with different inhibitors or activators of protein kinases or protein phosphatases. The transfected cells were incubated with PDBu (50 ng/ml) and calcium ionophore (0.25 μm) in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A (100 ng/ml), MEK inhibitor (20 μm), HOG inhibitor (20 μm), okadaic acid (100 ng/ml), or 8-Br-cAMP (0.5 mm) at doses that have already been reported to regulate the activation of Jurkat T cells (9Ballester A. Velasco A. Tobeña R. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14099-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because addition of PDBu and calcium ionophore to Jurkat T cells increases the phosphorylation state of many proteins involved in the signal transduction mechanism, the addition of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, to these activated Jurkat cells could induce a further increase in the phosphorylation state of the proteins. According to the results obtained in Fig. 4 D, the addition of okadaic acid did not increase the luciferase activity. Addition of cyclosporin A prior to activation of the cells reduced the luciferase activity, indicating that calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) is at least partially involved in the activation of the COT promoter. MEK inhibitor, which blocks the ERK signal pathway, and HOG/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor hardly diminished the stimulatory signal of PDBu and calcium ionophore. Activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by the addition of 8-Br-cAMP increased the luciferase activity by about 1.7-fold (Fig.4 D). An RNase protection assay was performed to determine whether the increase in the transcriptional activation of the 5′ flanking region of the humanCOT gene by T cell activating signals correlates with an increase in COT mRNA levels after T lymphocyte stimulation. A riboprobe from the COT coding sequence was hybridized with RNA isolated from Jurkat cells stimulated with soluble αCD3 (10 μg/ml) and PDBu (50 ng/ml) for different times. As shown in Fig. 5 A, αCD3 and PDBu stimulation transiently increased COT mRNA levels (∼4-fold). A similar increase in the level of COTtranscripts was detected by RT-PCR analysis of mRNA of Jurkat cells stimulated with PDBu and calcium ionophore for different times, using primers that amplified a COT coding sequence fragment. As a control, a 187-bp fragment of β-actin was also amplified in each reaction (Fig. 5 B). To distinguish COT-1 from COT-2 andCOT-3, a Northern blot with total RNA from Jurkat cells stimulated for different times with PDBu (50 ng/ml), calcium ionophore (0.25 μm), and okadaic acid (100 nm) was hybridized with the coding COT probe (Fig. 6 A). Whereas a hybridization signal of 3.0 kb, corresponding to COT-2 andCOT-3, was detected 3 h after stimulation, theCOT-1 message was first detected 6 h after stimulation. In agreement with the Northern blot analysis, COT-1transcript levels determined by RT-PCR were not increased at 4 h after stimulation of Jurkat cells with the stimuli described above (Fig. 6 B). At this time of stimulation, COT-2 andCOT-3 levels were increased to an equal extent (Fig.6 B). Next, we decided to investigate the subcellular distribution of COT-1,COT-2, and COT-3. RNA was isolated from the cytoplasmic fraction and the nuclear fraction of intact Jurkat cells. A dot blot performed with these RNAs was hybridized with a probe specific for the 5′ UTR of COT-1 (probe C), theCOT coding probe, and a probe containing the −778 to −30 nt sequence of the COT promoter (Fig.7 A). Comparison of the hybridization signals obtained with the different probes and RNA fractions indicated that the COT-1 transcript is mainly located in the nuclear fraction. We next decided to study the distribution of the differentCOT messengers to polysomes. The postmitochondrial supernatant of Jurkat cells was subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation, and RNA was isolated from the different fractions. The levels of the different COT transcripts were measured by RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the fraction ofCOT-1 located in the cytoplasmic fraction is not associated with polysomes. In addition, only a small fraction of COT-2was not loaded with ribosomes. The fact that both COT-2 and COT-3 were detected in fractions corresponding to small polysomes indicates a low translation efficiency of these transcripts. As a control of polyribosome-associated mRNA, we assayed the same fractions for β-actin messenger (Fig.7 B). Stimulation of Jurkat cells with PDBu and calcium ionophore did not change the distribution of these transcripts in the different fractions (data not shown). In this paper we have identified the promoter region of the humanCOT gene and demonstrated that its activity is inducible by T cell-activating signals. We have also identified three different human COT mRNAs, COT-1, COT-2, andCOT-3, with different lengths in the 5′UTR but a common transcription initiation site. This site is located 4748 nt upstream of the translation initiation site of COT kinase. The first exon of COT-1 (denominated exon 1) comprises these 4748 nt and the first 336 nt of the coding sequence of COT kinase (see Table Iand Fig. 1). The lack of splicing in the 5′UTR of COT-1mRNA species results in a predominantly nuclear distribution. The physiological significance of this finding remains to be established. Nevertheless, the possibility that COT-1 mRNA is stored in the cell nucleus and a later processing of its 5′ UTR triggers the transport of the generated transcript to the cytoplasm should not be excluded. A similar situation has been described for other mRNAs (29Weil D. Brosset S. Dautry F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5865-5875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ UTR of the COT-2 transcript is generated when the 5′ region flanking the translation initiation site of human COT kinase undergoes splicing, and this UTR comprised of exons 1a, 1b, and 1c. This 5′ UTR contains 444 nt upstream of the coding sequence of COT kinase and exhibits a putative open reading frame located in exon 1b. COT-3 mRNA, with a 215-nt 5′ UTR, is comprised of exons 1a and 1c and does not have any open reading frame upstream of the translation initiation site of COT kinase. The occurrence of upstream open reading frames has only been detected in about 10% of vertebrate mRNAs, and their physiological role is still unclear. Interestingly, the majority of these mRNA species code for proteins involved in signal transduction (30, 31 and references therein). Toyoshimo and co-workers (15Aoki M. Hamada F. Sugimoto T. Sumida S. Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22723-22731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ohara R. Miyoshi J. Aoki M. Toyoshima K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported a genomic structure of the human COT gene with 9 exons, from which the 2 upstream exons are noncoding, and defined a 5′ UTR of the COT transcript (GenBankTM accession number D14497) with 366 nt; this sequence corresponds to part of the 5′ UTR of the COT-2transcript defined here. Chan et al. (14Chan A.M-L. Chedid M. McGovern E.S. Popescu N.C. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1329-1333PubMed Google Scholar) reported aCOT transcript (GenBankTM accession numberZ14138) (denominated est in their study) with a 159-nt long 5′ UTR; this sequence corresponds to part of the 5′ UTR of COT-1 defined here. It has recently been reported that an increase in COTmRNA levels, determined by RT-PCR analysis, of a 136-nt fragment of the COT coding sequence plays a role in human breast cancer (22Sourvinos G. Tsatsanis D.A. Spandidos D.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on the data obtained here, demonstration of this role in tumorigenesis would require analysis of the expression of the differentCOT transcripts in tumoral versus normal tissues, because the study of the subcellular and polysome distribution of the different COT transcripts indicates that COT-1 is not attached to polysomes but is mainly located in the nucleus and is, therefore, probably not translated. We did not find any evidence of additional splicing variants in the protein coding exons of the described human COT gene (data not shown). This is probably because COT kinase does not have any of the known signaling modules, and consequently changes in the coding sequence (with the exception of the last exon) would result in the modification of at least one of the XI regions necessary for a functional protein kinase (32Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). Deletion of the last exon provides transformation capacity to COT kinase (4Patriotis C. Makris A.

The COT gene is induced during T cell activation. Both combinations of stimuli (PDBu and calcium ionophore or PDBu and αCD3) induce an increase in COT mRNA levels as well as activation of the COT promoter-driven transcription. A number of consensus sequences reported to bind specific trans-acting factors regulated by activating T signals are present in the 5′ flanking region of the COT gene (Fig. 3). Thus, three AP-1 binding sites (27Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar, 28Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) were found at positions −79, −327, and −637 nt. One PEA-3 motif (33Martin M.E. Piette J. Yaniv M. Tang W.J. Folk W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5839-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was located at −267 nt. The analysis also revealed one consensus recognition motif for ets (34Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) at position −808 nt and four consensus binding sequences for OCT-1 (35Ho C. Bhat N.K. Gottschalk L.R. Lindsten R. Thompson C.B. Papas T.S. Leiden J.M. Science. 1990; 250: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) at positions −293, −501, −708, and −1037 nt. The ets and OCT-1 response elements have been reported to be regulated by phorbol esters (36Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Two cAMP-response element (CRE)-like sequences (36Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) are found at positions −41 and −164 nt, which could account for the increased COT promoter activity observed upon 8-Br-cAMP treatment. This finding also suggests that different signal transduction pathways can mediate COT regulation. The relative activities of the different COT promoter constructs in the presence and absence of T cell activating signals indicated that a PDBu and calcium ionophore response element is located in the −340 to −229-nt region of the COT promoter. Activation of the AP-1 response elements in T cells requires an integration of both PDBu and calcium ionophore signals, is independent of ERK pathway activation, is sensitive to cyclosporin A, and is up-regulated by the JNK/SAPK signal transduction pathway (9Ballester A. Velasco A. Tobeña R. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14099-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,37Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 726-736Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The same requirements are needed for activation of the −340COT promoter-driven transcription, indicating that at least the AP-1 binding site present at −327 nt could play a role in the PDBu and calcium ionophore-triggered COT promoter activation. COT kinase activity is crucial for the transduction mechanism of activating signals in T cells during G0/G1transition (1Salmerón A. Ahmad T.B. Carlille G.W. Pappin D. Narsimham R.P. Ley S.C.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The chromatin binding properties of HNF3 are underscored by the structural resemblance of linker histone to the winged helix motif (6Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11079-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of winged helix factors in diverse areas of biological regulation, we have been investigating the unique features of the winged helix and how they may have evolved. Winged helix/Fox proteins comprise a subset of the so-called wHTH proteins. All wHTH proteins contain a classic helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif within a three-helix bundle, braced against an antiparallel β-sheet (8Brennan R. Cell. 1993; 74: 773-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). The β-sheet consists of at least two β-strands that occur C-terminal to the HTH segment (9Wilson D.B. Ghysdael J. Owen M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Fogh R. Ottleben G. Ruterjans H. Schnarr M. Boelens R. Kaptein R.

Structure. 1995; 3: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and in many wHTH proteins, the sheet contains one or two β-strands that precede the HTH (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 6Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M.

Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1 C). In the Fox protein subset of wHTH proteins, extension of a loop between β-strands creates a wing-like structure that can be used to bind DNA, as with wing 1 of the transcription factor HNF3 (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The presence of a wing 2 loop, C-terminal to the β sheet, is also critical for the Fox/winged helix proteins to bind DNA as a monomer (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 3Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and C). Although wing 2 has neither helical nor sheet characteristics, it is well organized in the HNF3 crystal (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Wing 2 appears to be uniquely associated with the 150 winged helix factors related to HNF3 and does not occur in other wHTH proteins. Also, amino acid sequences within the wHTH domain, upstream of wing 2, are highly conserved within the winged helix proteins (2Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), so the presence of wing 2 is just one of several features that distinguish Fox/winged helix factors from other wHTH proteins. For example, although linker histone is a wHTH protein whose crystal structure has only a 1.3-Å root mean square deviation between equivalent α-carbon coordinates of the wHTH domain of HNF3 (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 6Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), sequence identity with HNF3 over this domain is a minimal 13%, and the linker histone lacks wing 2. Thus, it appears that the presence of wing 2 and upstream amino acid changes have evolved together to create the winged helix subdomain of wHTH proteins. This would predict that at least some of the amino acids upstream of wing 2 might interact with wing 2 in specific ways. Since the presence of wing 2 is a distinguishing feature of the Fox/winged helix wHTH factors, and because the wing 2 sequence is essential for DNA binding (3Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), we have investigated the structural role of this segment of the protein. We find that the structural stability of wing 2 and the wing's function in DNA binding is highly sensitive to the presence of wing 2 hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids that are on the opposite face of the protein from that which contacts DNA. Our findings provide insight into the maintenance of the wing 2 loop structure and the creation of temperature-sensitive Fox transcription factors and suggest a mechanism by which the wing 2 loop may have been established in evolution. The hnf3g.pdb crystal structure coordinate file was kindly supplied by S. Burley (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Structure was modeled with Swiss-PdbViewer version 3.1 (17Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A) and Rasmol version 2.6 (R. Sayle) (Fig.1 B) running on a Micron 450 mHz PC. The data base of winged helix factors and their sequence relationships was from the Pomona College site on the World Wide Web (maintained by W. Knöchel, K. Kaestner, and D. Martinez). The full-length mouse HNF3α cDNA in the Escherichia coliexpression vector pET28b (Novagen) was used for mutagenesis (4Cirillo L.A. McPherson C.E. Bossard P. Stevens K. Cherian S. Shim E.-Y. Clark E.A. Burley S.K. Zaret K.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis employed overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) as modified (19Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of the entire segments that were cloned from polymerase chain reaction products verified the sequence changes. Recombinant proteins were overexpressed in and purified from inclusion bodies in E. coli as described (20Zaret K. Stevens K. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which involved stepwise dilution from 6 m urea during the final purification. For transient transfections, the wild type and HNF3α mutant cDNAs were inserted into the vector pRG, downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (21Jackson D.A. Rowader K.E. Stevens K. Jiang C. Milos P. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The designated nanogram amounts of HNF3 expression plasmid were electroporated into mouse 3T3 cells (22Zaret K.S. Dipersio C.M. Jackson D.A. Montigny W.J. Weinstat D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9076-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with 40 μg of pAN6-eG2x and 1 μg of pRT1. pAN6-eG2x contains two HNF3 binding sites upstream of an albumin promoter fragment, the latter consisting of base pairs −56 to +8 with respect to the transcription start, fused to the neomycin resistance gene (23Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). pRT1 contains the Rous sarcoma virus promoter fused to the thymidine kinase gene and served as an internal control. Two days after transfection, total cellular RNA was isolated and subjected to primer extension analysis of neomycin and thymidine kinase RNAs in the same reaction (21Jackson D.A. Rowader K.E. Stevens K. Jiang C. Milos P. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Gels were exposed to BAS2500 phosphor imager plates (Fuji) for quantitation. Signals from the HNF3 target plasmid were normalized to the signals from the control plasmid in each lane and expressed as percentage of wild type activity over background for each mutant. For Western blot analysis, cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA, and after 2 days, whole cell lysates were prepared. HNF3 proteins were visualized with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against bacterially expressed HNF3α protein, and the use of an Enhanced Chemiluminescense Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified HNF3α proteins (4 μg) were suspended in a solution containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 6.5), 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 18% glycerol in a total volume of 35 μl. The designated amounts of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, trypsin, proteinase K, or thermolysin (Sigma) were added, and the reactions proceeded for 30 min at either 37 or 12 °C. Digests were terminated with the addition of 15 μl of 3× SDS gel sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were boiled, run on 12 or 15% polyacrylamide gels with SDS, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gels were scanned with a Umax device and imaged with Picture Publisher 7.0 (Micrografx). Digestion data was quantitated with Fuji ImageGauge 3.12 software. Footprinting reactions were as described (20Zaret K. Stevens K. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and employed 2.5 fmol of a 428-base pair end-labeled DNA probe of the albumin gene enhancer (5Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in a 20-μl reaction volume with the designated concentrations of HNF3. The data in Fig. 3 depict the albumin enhancer eH binding site for HNF3 (21Jackson D.A. Rowader K.E. Stevens K. Jiang C. Milos P. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The probe concentration was about 2-fold below the KD of wild type HNF3 for the eH site (20Zaret K. Stevens K. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Footprinting gels were scanned with a Fuji BAS2500 phosphor imager, and the percentage of occupancy of the eH HNF3 site was determined relative to an internal control band in the same lane (out of the image shown in Fig. 3). Average and S.D. values of percentage of occupancy were determined from two or three independent experiments at each protein concentration. Scatchard plots were drawn from linear regression analysis of the relevant data points, and apparent Kd values were estimated from the negative inverse of the slopes. In order to understand how the wing 2 segment is stably incorporated into the tertiary structure of the winged helix domain, we employed molecular modeling with the crystal structure coordinates of HNF3γ (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Note that the numbering system we use is for Foxa1(HNF3α), which has six conservative substitutions over the 110-amino acid sequence of the winged helix domain of HNF3γ; none of these differences are close to the residues studied here. As seen in Fig.1 A, in which the DNA interacting surface is away from view, the polypeptide backbone of wing 2 consists of an elongated loop at the C terminus, beneath the three-helix bundle. Two aromatic residues, Phe254and Tyr259, are near the distal bend of the loop. A van der Waals image shows that they contact the aromatic and hydrophobic residues Tyr173 and Met181 near the beginning of helix 1 (Fig. 1 B). All of these residues are part of a larger, interacting set of aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids that occur in a depression on the surface of HNF3 (Fig. 1 B), as first noted by Clark et al. (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). It would seem that these surface residues would be important for protein-protein interactions. Although these residues are well spread out in the primary sequence (Fig. 1 C), aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids are highly conserved at these positions among the vast majority of the Fox/winged helix proteins (2Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are critical for the proteins' structure or function or both. As might be expected, the residues in the HNF3-DNA co-crystal with the highest temperature factors (B-factors) are at the distal loop bends of the wing domains (Fig. 1, A and B;yellow, orange, and red). Interestingly, Phe254 and Tyr259 in wing 2 separate the high B-factor residues at the distal loop bend from the low B-factor residues (green and blue) in the remainder of the wing. This suggests that Phe254 and Tyr259 stabilize the association of the wing 2 loop with the wHTH domain, perhaps by associating with Tyr173 and Met181 in the cluster of aromatic and hydrophobic residues. Without this interaction, temperature sensitivity of the entire loop would be predicted to increase, with detrimental consequences for winged helix domain function. We sought to test these possibilities by creating site-directed mutants of HNF3α with alanine substitutions at either Tyr173 and Met181 (YM), Phe254 and Tyr259(FY), or all four residues (YMFY). We anticipated that the FY mutation would primarily affect wing 2 stability and that the YM and YMFY mutations would affect both wing 2 stability and the stability of the HLH globular domain. If the YM and FY mutations were found to have similar effects on the protein, it would suggest that the primary role of the YM and FY amino acids is to maintain wing 2 structure. If YM and FY have different effects, and if YMFY is more destabilizing than either pair of changes, it would suggest that the YM and FY residues have additional or different roles from each other in maintaining winged helix domain stability. To test whether the YM and FY mutations affect HNF3 stability and/or function, we transiently transfected HNF3 expression plasmids into mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells, which lack HNF3. Transcriptional stimulation was monitored from another plasmid that contains two HNF3 target sites juxtaposed to a minimal albumin gene promoter. An HNF3 nonresponsive promoter in a third plasmid served as an internal transfection control. We cultured the transfected cells at 30 °C and 37–39 °C in order to determine if the temperature was a critical determinant for HNF3 stability or activity. We anticipated that the 30 °C temperature would be permissive for a temperature-sensitive function. RNA was isolated after 2 days and subjected to primer extension analysis (Fig.2 A). Two different levels of plasmid DNA were transfected, which showed that there was a linear transcriptional response over the range of HNF3 levels that were quantitated. The HNF3 target gene expression was normalized to the internal control signal, and this value was expressed as the percentage of activity of wild type (WT)1 HNF3, using data from the lower level of transfected HNF3 plasmid at 30 °C and the higher level of plasmid at 37–39 °C. Data from two independent transfection experiments were quantitated with a phosphor imager as shown in Fig. 2 B. The values at 37 and 39 °C were very similar and were grouped together (see small error bars in Fig. 2 B). To quantitate transfected protein levels, we performed Western blot analysis. Two different amounts of whole cell lysates were applied to SDS gels, and several nonspecific bands in each lane of the resulting chemiluminescence film served as a loading control (Fig. 2 C,bands with asterisk). HNF3 bands were quantitated by scanning films of different exposure levels and from different amounts of loaded protein. Data from two independent transfection experiments were quantitated and are shown in Fig. 2 D. As will be documented below, we found that the mutants exhibited temperature sensitivity for transcriptional stimulation that was not reflected by changes in steady-state protein levels. At 30 °C, the transfected HNF3-YM mutant resulted in wild type levels of transcription, whereas the wing 2 loop mutants FY and YMFY reduced transcription by about half (Fig. 2 B,gray bars). By contrast, when the cells were transfected at 37–39 °C, the YM mutant gave about 30% of wild type transcription, the FY mutant gave about 10% of wild type transcription, and the YMFY mutant gave no detectable transcription (Fig. 2, black bars). In Western blots of titrations of whole cell lysates from cells at 30 °C, the abundance of the HNF3 mutant proteins generally reflected their transcriptional output. The YM mutant was at the wild type level of protein, and the FY and YMFY mutants were 67 and 44% of the wild type level, respectively (Fig. 2 D, gray bars). Therefore, when the transcriptional data at 30 °C are normalized to the protein expression data, the YM and YMFY mutant proteins exhibited wild type transcriptional stimulation activity, and the FY mutant was close to the wild type level, at 75% (Fig. 2 E). At 37 °C, the levels of all HNF3 proteins, including wild type, were lower than that at 30 °C (Fig. 2 C), which we attribute to the lower transient transfection efficiency at the higher temperature. Still, the relative level of the YM mutant protein was the same as wild type, the FY mutant was about 90% of wild type, and the YMFY mutant was about 40% of wild type, which is very close to the relative levels seen at 37 °C (Fig. 2 D). Although the YMFY protein is difficult to see in the reproduction in Fig. 2 C,lane 17, it was evident on the original autoradiographs and scans thereof. If amino acids Phe254and Tyr259 interacted primarily with Tyr173 and Met181 to maintain wing 2 domain stability, either set of mutations should be equally destabilizing. However, the YM mutations were neutral, and the FY mutations decreased the steady-state level of the protein, albeit only partially (Fig. 2 D), in a non-temperature-sensitive fashion. These data, and the fact that the YM mutation in the YMFY mutant enhances the destabilizing effect of the FY mutation, suggest that although residues Tyr173 and Met181 may interact with Phe254 and Tyr259 to promote wing 2 stability in vivo, FY is a more critical determinant of overall steady state protein levels. Interestingly, when the transcriptional data are normalized to the protein expression data at 37 °C and compared with that at 30 °C, the YM, FY, and YMFY proteins are markedly temperature-sensitive for transcriptional activation (Fig. 2 E). The YM and FY proteins are 4- and 6-fold deficient at higher temperature, compared with wild type, while the YMFY mutant appears completely temperature-sensitive for activity. The mutants' intrinsic temperature sensitivity for transcriptional activation suggests that the YM and FY residues confer far more to the structural integrity of the HNF3 winged helix domain and consequently, its activity, than was reflected in the steady-state levels of the proteins. On this basis, we next investigated structural aspects of the protein in vitro. Because wing 2 lacks helical or sheet characteristics that are readily detected by physical techniques, we used enzymatic probes to compare the structure of wild type and mutant HNF3s. V8 protease in particular has a potential cleavage target in the distal loop bend of wing 2, in that Glu255 is exposed to solvent (Fig. 1, A and C); therefore, V8 could be a probe of wing 2 structure. In initial experiments, we found that the FY mutant, which contains Phe254 changed to an alanine in the residue that precedes Glu255, had an altered V8 protease digestion pattern compared with wild type HNF3 (Fig.3 A). Note that the starting material for these proteins, as purified from E. coli, migrates as a doublet, designated band a (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2 and 5); the larger protein of the doublet may be due to improper translation termination. While the wild type protein yielded prominent protease-resistant fragments designated b–e (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4), the FY variant yielded much lower levels of fragments c–e and instead had elevated levels of fragments designated x and y (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 7). Note that the x and y bands are also generated from the wild type protein and that part of the band intensity with fragment b is due to V8 protease (see Fig. 4 B,lane 20). The YMFY mutant had the same altered V8 cleavage pattern as the FY mutant, while the YM mutant looked like wild type (data not shown and Fig. 4 A below). We conclude that the Phe254 change to alanine upstream of the V8 target residue Glu255 caused a change in V8 cleavage specificity. Since this change altered the abundance of three of the four prominent V8 digest products (c, d, and e to x and y), wing 2 must be a prominent cleavage target for the enzyme. The specificity of V8 for wing 2 is supported by digestion studies with trypsin, which lacks cleavage targets in the wing 2 loop and exhibits no difference between WT and FY proteins in the generation of 12 different proteolytic fragments (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9,bands with black dots). A similar lack of difference in cleavage pattern was obtained when the YM and YMFY proteins were digested with trypsin and when the WT, YM, FY, and YMFY proteins were digested with thermolysin and proteinase K (data not shown). Thus, the YM and FY mutations do not induce conformational changes throughout the HNF3 protein. We conclude that V8 specifically recognizes wing 2 and that the amino acid changes studied here do not grossly affect HNF3 structure. We hypothesized that the YM and FY mutations might alter the structure of wing 2 or its relation to the three helix bundle, apart from V8 enzyme cleavage specificity. If such were the case, the mutants might exhibit temperature sensitivity for V8 digestion. At 12 °C, increasing amounts of enzyme up to 0.4 μg/reaction yielded 30–60% loss of the starting full-length proteins (band a) (Fig. 4, A and C). At 37 °C, the FY and YMFY mutants, but not the wild type protein, were more protease-sensitive than they were at 12 °C (Fig. 4, B and C). Specifically, at 37 °C the wild type protein consistently yielded full-length material in the presence of up to 0.1–0.4 μg of enzyme, but the full-length band a of the mutants was mostly degraded with 0.1 μg of protease (Fig.4 B). The YM mutant was measurably protease-sensitive but still had some full-length protein at 0.4 μg of protease (Fig.4 B, lane 18). This correlates well with the transcriptional stimulatory activity of the transfected proteins, where the FY and YMFY mutants were more temperature-sensitive than the YM mutant (Fig. 2 E). We conclude that bulky aromatic residues at the FY positions contribute to the thermal stability of the protein. Furthermore, since these studies were conducted with purified protein, these residues must help maintain structural conformation in the wing 2 region in the absence of DNA. If the FY residues and to some extent the YM residues are critical for the structure of wing 2, then alanine substitutions would be predicted to perturb DNA binding. In quantitative DNase footprinting assays with a DNA probe containing an HNF3 binding site, we found that the YM, FY, and YMFY mutants were indeed reproducibly deficient in site-specific binding to DNA at the standard reaction temperature of 20 °C, compared with wild type (Fig. 5 A). We could visualize this in two ways, as seen in portions of the footprinting gels in Fig.3. First, all three mutants were defective in protecting DNA at the HNF3 binding site; saturation at 2 nm protein was achieved only with the wild type protein (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4, 7, 10, and 13,bracketed region). Second, all three mutants were impaired in generating the characteristic DNase hypersensitive cleavage within the HNF3 footprint. Hypersensitivity may be due to the ability of the winged helix factor to slightly open the minor groove on the DNA side that is opposite to that on which the protein binds (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar,25Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), thereby enhancing DNase access. Quantitative phosphor image analysis of multiple footprinting experiments was used to determine binding site saturation (Fig. 5 C) and a general estimate of the apparent Kd of the proteins for DNA (Fig.5 D). We note that in the experiments used for quantitation, the DNA substrate concentration was below the wild type HNF3 apparent Kd . The apparent Kd of wild type mouse HNF3α for the eH binding site, under these conditions at 20 °C, was 0.42 nm (r 2 = 0.94), which agrees well with the 0.65 nm value determined previously with the rat HNF3α, which was a slightly less active protein (20Zaret K. Stevens K. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The quantitation analysis showed that at 20 °C, the YM, FY, and YMFY mutants were increasingly deficient in DNA binding site saturation (Fig. 5 C, dashed lines) and in apparent Kd (Fig. 5 D, slope of dashed lines relative to that of wild type HNF3). Specifically, while the YM mutant had a 2-fold reduction in affinity for the HNF3 target site, the FY mutant had a 2–4-fold lower affinity, and the YMFY mutant had a 10–20-fold lower affinity. However, when the same proteins were tested for binding site occupancy at the lower temperature of 12 °C (Fig. 5 B), the YM mutant exhibited the wild type affinity (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, the YM protein is temperature-sensitive for DNA binding in vitro, similar to the temperature sensitivity of YM function in vivo (Fig. 2 E). In contrast, the FY and YMFY mutants were nearly as deficient in DNA binding at 12 °C as they were at 20 °C (Fig. 5, C and D). Since mutation of the FY residues leads to more severe phenotypes than mutation of the YM residues, in various functional assays, the Phe254 and Tyr259 residues must interact with residues in addition to YM to maintain the structural integrity of wing 2 in the winged helix domain. We suggest that improper refolding of the renatured FY protein in vitro, during purification, leads to a deficiency in DNA binding that is not compensated by a lower temperature. We conclude that the wing 2 residues FY, as well as the YM residues within the HTH domain, all of which are on the non-DNA binding surface of the protein, are critical to allow stable DNA binding by the winged helix protein. Considering that the ∼150 known Fox/winged helix proteins have extensive sequence similarity throughout the entire 110-amino acid domain and that the sequence conservation distinguishes the family from other wHTH proteins, there are likely to be a variety of sequence determinants that impart the distinct regulatory activities of these proteins. We investigated the winged helix domain's most striking structural characteristic, wing 2, by focusing on how the wing 2 loop is stabilized and thereby may help the protein bind DNA. Our data indicate that two aromatic residues, Phe254 and Tyr259, near the loop bend of wing 2 contribute to the stability of wing 2 even in the absence of DNA, apparently by interacting with residues Tyr173 and Met181 and others in the three-helix bundle of the protein. We find that the stabilization of wing 2 structure is critical for DNA binding activity and therefore for the transcriptional function of the winged helix protein. We speculate that hydrophobic and aromatic ring system interactions between Phe254 and Tyr259 residues in the wing 2 loop and Tyr173 and Met181 and other residues in the three-helix bundle (Fig. 1 B) are critical to maintain wing 2 structural integrity. In support of this, of 144 winged helix proteins with a completely sequenced winged helix domain in the data base, 97, 91, and 94% have hydrophobic or aromatic residues at positions corresponding to 173, 181, and 254 in HNF3α, respectively; and 83% of the proteins have a hydrophobic or aromatic residue at position 259. Of the five winged helix proteins that have charged residues corresponding to position 181, four are deleted for five amino acids at the distal loop region, making it unlikely that they form a wing 2 structure. One winged helix protein, daf16b (26Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar), that has a charged (lysine) residue at 181 and that has extensive wing 2 sequences has an oppositely charged glutamate at 173, an arginine at 254, and a threonine at 259. Thus, the putative wing 2 in this protein may be stabilized primarily by opposing charge interactions rather than by hydrophobic and aromatic residue interactions. The YM mutation exhibited temperature-sensitive DNA binding in vitro, in accord with the temperature sensitivity of transcriptional activation in vivo. However, HNF3 proteins containing the FY mutation were deficient in DNA binding at both temperatures tested in vitro. By all criteria tested, the FY mutations had more severe phenotypic defects than the YM mutations, indicating that the residues are more critical to maintain protein integrity. We note that the HNF3 proteins used for in vitrofootprinting were renatured from insoluble precipitates in E. coli. We therefore suggest that improper folding of the winged helix domain in the FY and YMFY mutants in vitro leads to deficiencies in their recovery of DNA binding activity, in comparison with the less severe YM mutation. By contrast, the normal folding pathways inside the cell, which may involve chaperone proteins, apparently allow reconstitution of DNA binding and transcriptional activity of FY mutants at the permissive temperature of 30 °C. Considering the high degree of conservation of aromatic and hydrophobic residues at the respective Tyr, Met, Phe, and Tyr positions in all winged helix proteins, it seems likely that mutation of homologous amino acids in other winged helix family members will also create temperature-sensitive phenotypes in vivo. Given the different ranges of temperature-sensitive transcriptional activation exhibited by the YM, FY, and YMFY mutations (Fig. 2, B and C), it may be possible to generate mutants of other winged helix factors that are temperature-sensitive over different ranges of activity. Each class of mutant could be useful in a different regulatory context. Our findings suggest a model for the evolution of the winged helix domain from the more general wHTH structure (Fig.6). We propose that a primordial wHTH protein may have acquired, by mutation, bulky aromatic and/or hydrophobic amino acids in unstructured sequences that were distal to the wHTH domain. The distal polypeptide segment then could associate with aromatic and/or hydrophobic residues in the three-helix bundle that themselves contribute to the stability or function of the wHTH domain, thus creating wing 2. Further mutations might have strengthened the association and conferred a functional advantage to the protein. For example, some wHTH proteins function as dimers, and the appearance of wing 2 would extend the DNA binding face of the protein so that the resultant winged helix domain could bind efficiently as a monomer. As noted in the Introduction, the deletion of wing 2 prevents HNF3 binding to DNA, despite the presence of sequences for wing 1 and the three-helix bundle. The deficiency in the FY mutants in inducing DNase hypersensitivity within the HNF3 footprint shows that the wing 2 may help the protein stabilize a conformational change in DNA that is essential for monomeric binding. What selective forces could explain the persistence of a surface hydrophobic patch that apparently maintains wing 2 structure for the majority of winged helix factors? A hydrophobic patch within the wHTH motif may not only provide stability to the three-helix bundle; it may also serve as a site for interacting with another protein important for transcriptional regulation. The presence of two bulky hydrophobic residues in wing 2 with four such residues on the back of the wHTH domain expands the surface hydrophobic patch substantially (Fig.1 B). Thus, it seems likely that multiple selective forces maintain the hydrophobic patch within the wHTH domain, providing a base for distal strand recruitment into wing 2 to create a thermostable winged helix structure. Similar mechanisms may account for the creation and maintenance of other tertiary structures from primordial structural motifs.

Lundblad in her provocative Perspective now tells us about another protein, hRap1, that regulates the length of telomeres in human cells with the help of the TRF proteins.

The venue should bring much-needed attention to a crisis that is slowly engulfing sub-Saharan Africa. HIV infection rates have climbed to staggering levels in this region: More than 7% of the adults in 21 countries were estimated to be infected by 1998, and in South Africa, the prevalence among pregnant women—a population widely used to track the disease—zoomed from less than 1% to more than 20% in the 1990s. These grim figures portend a harsh future of escalating disease and premature death in countries whose health care systems are already overburdened.

Two decades after AIDS was first recognized as a new disease, researchers are stepping up their efforts to understand and deal with this looming tragedy. In the following pages, Science correspondent Jon Cohen provides a vivid firsthand look[*][1] at those efforts and the researchers themselves who are struggling—often under difficult conditions—to come to grips with the disease. Many studies are probing the significance of different disease patterns, transmission rates, and HIV subtypes in Africa (p. [2153][2]). Pioneering trials have found relatively cheap ways of reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, but applying those results is proving difficult (p. [2160][3]). Several vaccine tests are being planned, but all are at the earliest stages, which means it will take years before a preparation might prove its worth (p. [2165][4]; also see Editorial, p. [2129][5]). In South Africa, researchers have documented the alarming spread of HIV by migrant laborers and sharp increases in infection rates, but the government's confused response to this growing crisis is drawing sharp criticism from the scientific community (p. [2168][6]).

Most African countries can't afford to support much research themselves, so the vast majority of these studies are being conducted in collaboration with scientists from the developed world. These partnerships have brought major benefits, but inherent inequalities can cause tensions and require constant give-and-take from both sides (p. [2155][7]). On page [2156][8], we list the major collaborative research projects throughout the continent. This is the first time such a list has been put together; we realize it is not comprehensive and intend to update it periodically on Science 's Web site ([www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/africacollaborations.shl][9]). Please send additions and changes to science_news{at}aaas.org .

Research, of course, is not enough. Supervisory Senior Editor Barbara Jasny asked three leading AIDS experts to discuss the enormous policy challenges ahead. Peter Piot, head of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, argues that more political leadership at the highest levels is needed (p. [2176][10]). Hans Binswanger of the World Bank outlines strategies for scaling up prevention programs from local to national levels (p. [2173][11]), and David Bloom of Harvard School of Public Health argues for a Global Task Force to help provide more equitable access to AIDS treatments (p. [2171][12]). Next month's meeting should help focus the world's attention on these urgent issues.
