We found that schistosome-specific phosphatidylserine (PS) activated TLR2 and affected dendritic cells such that mature dendritic cells gained the ability to induce the development of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells. Using mass spectrometry, schistosomal lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) was identified as the TLR2-activating molecule. This activity appears to be a unique property of schistosomal lyso-PS, containing specific acyl chains, because neither a synthetic lyso-PS (16:0) nor PS isolated from the mammalian host activates TLR2. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a novel host-parasite interaction that may be central to long term survival of the parasite and limited host pathology with implications beyond parasitology.

Schistosomes are trematodes that cause schistosomiasis, a chronic blood-vascular disease that is associated with a Th2 response (1Maizels R.M. Bundy D.A. Selkirk M.E. Smith D.F. Anderson R.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 797-805Google Scholar), but at chronic stages of infection also with enhanced IL-10 production and suppressed T cell proliferation to parasite antigens (2King C.L. Medhat A. Malhotra I. Nafeh M. Helmy A. Khaudary J. Ibrahim S. El Sherbiny M. Zaky S. Stupi R.J. Brustoski K. Shehata M. Shata M.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4715-4721Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory responses induced by helminths seem to enable parasite survival within the host with limited inflammatory responses that might otherwise be destructive to the host tissues. This controlled immune response, central to chronic helminth infections, may arise from signals received from the pathogen, as the chronic presence of metabolically active helminths is mirrored by persistent challenge of the immune system with an array of molecules associated with parasite metabolism, reproduction, and attrition. Recognition of an invading microorganism by cells of the immune system involves pathogen-associated molecular patterns that bind specific germline-encoded receptors on the host cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; PS, phosphatidylserine; SEA, water-soluble egg antigen; MF, neutral maturation factors; IL, interleukin; FCS, fetal calf serum; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HKLM, heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes . with extracellular leucine-rich domains and intracellular IL-1 receptor homology domain are important members of such germline-encoded receptors and actively participate in the stimulation of innate immune responses. To date, ten TLR homologs have been found in humans, and ligands have been identified for several TLRs, most of which are of bacterial origin (3Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 6748-6755Crossref Google Scholar). Instructions for development of specific immune responses are largely mediated by dendritic cells, which are present in peripheral tissues such as sentinel dendritic cells, and upon activation migrate to the draining lymph nodes to activate naive T cells, not only by presenting antigen but also by providing signals that determine polarization of T cell development toward a Th1 (6de Jong E.C. Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Tanaka Y. Wierenga E.A. Yazdanbakhsh M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar, 7Cella M. Salio M. Sakakibara Y. Langen H.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar), or T regulatory phenotype (8McGuirk P. McCann C. Mills K.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 221-231Google Scholar). In this way, dendritic cells can play a central role in providing information on the nature of the invading pathogen by integrating signals received and conveying them to T cells by expressing a variety of factors that will determine differentiation of T cells into polarized subsets (9Kalinski P. Hilkens C.M. Wierenga E.A. Kapsenberg M.L. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 561-567Google Scholar). Dendritic cells express several TLRs, depending on their developmental stage and lineage (10Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.H. Wyllie D.H. Dower S.K. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 249-255Google Scholar, 11Kadowaki N. Ho S. Antonenko S. de Waal M.R. Kastelein R.A. Bazan F. Liu Y.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 863-870Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have shown that bacterial products induce maturation of dendritic cells via TLRs (12Michelsen K.S. Aicher A. Mohaupt M. Hartung T. Dimmeler S. Kirschning C.J. Schumann R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25680-25686Google Scholar,13Hertz C.J. Kiertscher S.M. Godowski P.J. Bouis D.A. Norgard M.V. Roth M.D. Modlin R.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2444-2450Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of TLR2 or TLR4 in immature dendritic cells can lead to expression of distinct cytokine profiles (14Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37692-37699Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear to what extent activation of TLRs on dendritic cells influences the T cell phenotype associated with infectious diseases. Several bacterial products considered as pathogen-associated molecular patterns have been shown to contain lipid moieties that are essential for activation of TLRs (15Muhlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Google Scholar, 16Noss E.H. Pai R.K. Sellati T.J. Radolf J.D. Belisle J. Golenbock D.T. Boom W.H. Harding C.V. J.

Indeed, growing interest in lipids and their receptor biology has generated insights into interaction of this class of molecules with the immune system and into the role they may play in immunopathologies (18Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Google Scholar). A variety of lipid moieties can bind to specific receptors on the cells of the innate immune system and thereby play a role in immune regulation. For example, the binding of lysophosphatidylcholine to its receptor appears to have important immunomodulatory function because the deletion of the murine gene encoding the lysophosphatidylcholine-R (that is constitutively expressed in immune cells) resulted in adult-onset autoimmune disease similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus (19Le L.Q. Kabarowski J.H. Weng Z. Satterthwaite A.B. Harvill E.T. Jensen E.R. Miller J.F. Witte O.N. Immunity. 2001; 14: 561-571Google Scholar), α-galactosylceramide prevents onset or recurrence of autoimmune diabetes when presented in the context of the surface molecule CD1d (20Sharif S. Arreaza G.A. Zucker P. Mi Q.S. Sondhi J. Naidenko O.V. Kronenberg M. Koezuka Y. Delovitch T.L. Gombert J.M. Leite-De-Moraes M. Gouarin C. Zhu R. Hameg A. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Lepault F. Lehuen A. Bach J.F. Herbelin A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1057-1062Google Scholar), and the platelet activating factor receptor induces the production of pro- or anti-inflammatory mediators when activated by PAF or oxidized phosphatidylcholine (21Walterscheid J.P. Ullrich S.E. Nghiem D.X. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 171-179Google Scholar). Here, we have concentrated on the role of schistosome lipids in interaction with the innate immune system. We stimulated dendritic cells with lipid classes derived from Schistosoma mansonieggs and adult worms and found that the fraction containing phosphatidylserine (PS) polarized the maturation of dendritic cells, resulting in Th2 skewing and the development of T regulatory cells. The activation of TLR2 on dendritic cells by PS is essential for induction of development of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells. Using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry, a unique schistosomal lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) was identified as the TLR2-activating molecule. Thus, specific lyso-PS species from schistosomes act on dendritic cells via TLR2 to modify their T cell-stimulating property in such manner that regulatory T cells are induced. Lipids were isolated from S. mansoni adult worms and eggs and from the liver of a non-infected hamster and were fractionated using a TEAE-cellulose column as detailed before (22Van der Kleij D. Tielens A.G. Yazdanbakhsh M. Infect Immun. 1999; 67: 5946-5950Google Scholar). Briefly, S. mansoni adult worms were collected by perfusion of golden hamsters 45–48 days after infection. S. mansoni eggs were isolated from livers of infected hamsters after treatment of the liver homogenate with trypsin. Total lipids were isolated according to the method described by Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Canadian Journal of Biochemistry and Physiology. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and were separated into different classes using TEAE-cellulose column chromatography as described by Rouser et al. (24Rouser G. Kritchevsky G. Yamamoto A. Simon G. Galli C. Bauman A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 272-317Google Scholar). The fractions containing PS were used for stimulation of dendritic cells and HEK 293 cells. Synthetic lyso-PS (16:0) was purchased from Sigma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from venous blood of healthy volunteers by density centrifugation on Ficoll. For peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation, cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom plates at 1 × 106 cells/well in RPMI medium as detailed before (25Grogan J.L. Kremsner P.G. Deelder A.M. Yazdanbakhsh M. European Journal of Immunology. 1996; 26: 1365-1370Google Scholar) in the presence of 5% FCS (Greiner) and were stimulated with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (Sigma) or 10 μg/ml schistosomal lipids that were dissolved by water bath sonication in RPMI containing 0.2% Me2SO. For generation of dendritic cells, monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a Percoll gradient as described previously (6de Jong E.C. Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Tanaka Y. Wierenga E.A. Yazdanbakhsh M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar) and were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS, human rGM-CSF (500 units/ml, specific activity 1.11 × 107 units/mg, a gift from Schering-Plough, Uden, The Netherlands) and human rIL-4 (250 units/ml) (R&D Systems). At day 3, the culture medium including the supplements was refreshed. At day 6, CD1a+CD14− immature dendritic cells were matured with maturation factors (MF) (either LPS (100 ng/ml) or a combination of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) (Strathmann Biotechnology, Hannover, Germany) and tumor necrosis factor α (50 ng/ml) (Strathman biotech) in the presence of IFN-γ (103 units/ml), which induces the development of dendritic cells that stimulate the polarization of naive T cells into Th1 (6de Jong E.C. Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Tanaka Y. Wierenga E.A. Yazdanbakhsh M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar); PGE2 (10 μm), which induces the development of dendritic cells that stimulate the polarization of naive T cells into Th2 (6de Jong E.C. Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Tanaka Y. Wierenga E.A. Yazdanbakhsh M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar); schistosome water-soluble egg antigen (SEA) (100 μg/ml), a parasite extract that induces the development of dendritic cells that stimulate the polarization of naive T cells into Th2 (6de Jong E.C. Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Tanaka Y. Wierenga E.A. Yazdanbakhsh M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar); or phosphatidylserine isolated from schistosome eggs or adult worms (10 μg/ml). No differences in the level of maturation of dendritic cells exposed to the various compounds were found, as detected by CD83, CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR expression (data not shown), and therefore differential maturation could not play a role in the polarizing effects observed. In blocking experiments, 10 μg/ml of the anti-TLR2 antibody TL2.1 (26Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 19;274: 33419-33425Google Scholar) or a mouse IgG2 control antibody (CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was added during dendritic cell maturation. After 48 h, mature CD1a+ CD83+dendritic cells were obtained. To measure cytokine production, 2 × 104 dendritic cells were co-cultured with 2 × 104 CD40L-expressing mouse fibroblasts (J558 cells; a kind gift from Dr. P. Lane, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK). Levels of IL12p70 were determined in 24-h supernatants by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies 20C2 (BD Biosciences) and biotinylated mouse-anti-hu IL-12 C8.6 (BD Biosciences) as coating and detection antibodies, respectively. Levels of IL-8 were determined using a commercial ELISA kit (CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Highly purified CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO− naive Th cells (>98% as assessed by flow cytometry) were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a human CD4+/CD45RO− column kit (R & D Systems). 2 × 104 naive Th cells were co-cultured with 5 × 103 mature dendritic cells in the presence of superantigen Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 pg/ml in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates (Costar). At day 5, rhuIL-2 (10 units/ml, Cetus Corp., Emeryville, CA) was added and the cultures were expanded. On day 12, the quiescent Th cells were restimulated with immobilized CD3 mAb (CLB-T3/3, CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and soluble CD28 mAb (CLB-CD28/1, CLB), and IL-10 was measured in 24-h supernatants using a commercial kit (CLB) following the manufacturer's recommendations. To measure the frequency of IL-4- and IFN-γ-producing cells, Th cells were restimulated with PMA (Sigma) and ionomycin (Sigma) in the presence of brefeldinA (Sigma) for 6 h. To detect intracellular production of IL-4 and IFN-γ, cells were stained using anti-hu-IL-4-PE (BD Biosciences) and anti-hu-IFN-γ-FITC (BD Biosciences). To assess regulatory capacity, the effect of T cells (grown in the presence of dendritic cells that were matured with MF and during maturation exposed to IFN-γ, PGE2, SEA, PS from eggs or PS from worms) on proliferation of autologous Th cells was measured. T cells grown in the presence of unpolarized dendritic cells (matured with MF) were used as target cells for regulation. Effector T cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were co-cultured with target cells (5 × 104 cells/well) in the presence of unpolarized mature dendritic cells (MF dendritic cells) (5 × 103 cells/well). Cultures were done in triplicates. [3H]Thymidine was added after 3 days of culture, and incorporation was measured after a 16-h pulse. The background proliferation of effector T cells (i.e. T-effector + dendritic cells) was subtracted from the proliferation when target cells were added (i.e. T-effector + dendritic cells + T-target). Wild-type and TLR2 knockout mice (27Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Google Scholar, 28Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Google Scholar) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 2.5 ml of 3% thioglycolate solution. Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested with cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (gift from Miles Pharmaceuticals, West Haven, CT) 72 h post-inoculation. The cells were washed and seeded at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottom plates. After 24 h, non-adherent cells were removed by washing, and the adherent cells were stimulated with repurified LPS (100 pg/ml) fromEscherichia coli K 235 (gift from S. Vogel, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD), heat-killedListeria monocytogenes (HKLM) (106 cells/ml) (29Flo T.H. Halaas O. Lien E. Ryan L. Teti G. Golenbock D.T. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2064-2069Google Scholar), and schistosomal egg and adult worm PS (10 μg/ml). Tumor necrosis factor α production was measured after 20 h using a commercial DuoSet ELISA kit (R & D Systems). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone) and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin. The cells were transiently transfected at a density of 0.2 × 106cells/well in 12-well plates using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) with 0.5 μg/transfection TLR-expression plasmid and 0.5 μg/transfection pELAM-luc, a reporter construct that transcribes firefly luciferase from an NF-κB-dependent promoter, as described previously (30Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged human TLR1 and TLR2 were provided by Tularic (San Francisco, CA), FLAG-tagged TLR3 was PCR-cloned from a cDNA (DNAX, Palo Alto, CA) into pFLAG-CMV1. Non-tagged human TLR4 (hTOLL) in pcDNA3 was a gift from C. Janeway and R. Medzhitov (Yale University, New Haven, CT) and was co-transfected with human MD-2 (0.25 μg DNA/transfection of TLR4 and MD-2), a gift from K. Miyake (University of Tokyo, Japan), FLAG-tagged TLR7 was cloned from genomic DNA into pFLAG-CMV1 and FLAG-tagged TLR9 was a gift from S. Akira (Osaka University, Japan). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stimulated with IL-1β (100 ng/ml) (Genzyme Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA), HKLM (105bacteria/ml), poly(IC) (100 μg/ml) (Amersham Biosciences), repurified LPS (100 ng/ml), phosphothioate-stabilized CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (10 μm, 2006–TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT, gift from K. Heeg, Institute for Microbiology, Marburg, Germany) or schistosomal adult worm or egg PS fraction (10 μg/ml). Six hours after stimulation, cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activity of the cellular lysate was measured using an assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI) per the manufacturer's protocol. HEK 293-CD14 and HEK 293-CD14/TLR2 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin, and 5 μg/ml puromycin. For stimulation experiments, cells were seeded at 0.2 × 106 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottom plates and were stimulated the next day with PS fractions from schistosomes or hamster liver (5 μg/ml). IL-8 production was measured in supernatants after 20 h using a commercial kit (CLB) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The schistosomal PS preparations were separated by HPLC using a 5-μm Lichrosphere diol normal-phase column (Merck). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by a gradient from 95% eluent A (hexane/isopropanol/acetone (82:17:1)) and 5% eluent B (isopropanol/water/acetone (85:14:1)) to 60% A and 40% B in 30 min, followed by additional elution with the latter solvent for 10 min. Fractions were collected manually, evaporated to dryness, and used to stimulate HEK-CD14/TLR2 cells. Both the total PS preparations and the TLR2-activating HPLC fraction were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry was performed on an API-365 triple quad mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk aan de IJssel, The Netherlands) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Negative ionization spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 200 atomic mass units (amu) per second, using an ion spray voltage of −4500 V, a declustering potential (cone voltage) of 30 V, and a focusing potential of 210 V. Alternatively, PS and lyso-PS were analyzed by recording neutral loss spectra of 87 amu in the negative ionization mode at ion spray-, decluster-, and focusing potentials mentioned above and with a collision energy of 34 V (r). Nitrogen was used as collision- and curtain gas and air as the nebulizing gas. For digestion with phospholipase C, 100 μg of the schistosomal adult worm PS fraction was incubated in 2 ml of diethyl ether and 1 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) supplemented with 5 mmCaCl2 and 1.3 units/ml phospholipase C (Sigma) during 3 h while shaking. As a control, schistosomal PS was incubated in the same buffer in the absence of phospholipase C. After hydrolysis, the ether was evaporated and lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Canadian Journal of Biochemistry and Physiology. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Data were analyzed for statistical significance using a paired t test. To study whether lipids from helminths are involved in interaction with the immune system, lipid classes derived from S. mansoni eggs and adult worms were fractionated on an anion exchange column and were screened for activity by their capacity to stimulate cytokine production (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, or tumor necrosis factor α) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from non-exposed individuals. We found that the lipid fraction containing PS was an inducer of cytokine production (data not shown), and we proceeded to investigate its effects on dendritic cells and subsequent T cell polarization. So-called dendritic cells type-1 (DC1) have previously been shown to induce development of Th1 cells, whereas DC2 cells have been found to promote Th2 development (6de Jong E.C. Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Tanaka Y. Wierenga E.A. Yazdanbakhsh M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar). Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells were exposed to schistosomal PS, schistosomal SEA, a parasite antigen preparation that has previously been shown to induce DC2 development (6de Jong E.C. Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Tanaka Y. Wierenga E.A. Yazdanbakhsh M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar), and as controls, IFN-γ (which induces the development of DC1) or PGE2 (which stimulates the development of DC2) in combination with neutral maturation factors (MF). After several washing steps, the fully matured dendritic cells were tested for cytokine production and used to prime naive T cells. We found that as reported before (6de Jong E.C. Vieira P.L. Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Tanaka Y. Wierenga E.A. Yazdanbakhsh M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1704-1709Google Scholar), upon stimulation with CD40-ligand (a molecule expressed on T cells that activates dendritic cells), the IFN-γ exposed dendritic cells produced high levels of IL-12p70 (IFN-γ-dendritic cells, 6.2 ± 0.4 ng/ml) compared with mature control dendritic cells (2.1 ± 0.3 ng/ml) and enhanced the development of Th1 cells (Fig1A), whereas PGE2- and SEA-exposed dendritic cells had suppressed IL-12p70 production (PGE2-dendritic cells, 0.3 ± 0.2 ng/ml and SEA-dendritic cells, 0.3 ± 0.1 ng/ml) and increased frequency of IL-4 producing T cells (Th2 cells) with decreasing numbers of IFN-γ producing T cells (Fig 1A). The schistosome fraction containing PS extracted from adult worms or eggs polarized the maturation of dendritic cells, resulting in low IL-12p70 release (PS eggs-dendritic cells, 0.4 ± 0.2 ng/ml, PS worms-dendritic cells, 0.4 ± 0.1 ng/ml) and not only in Th2 skewing (Fig 1A) but in contrast to SEA and PGE2, also in the development of IL-10 producing T cells (Fig1B). T cells that develop in co-culture with dendritic cells, which were matured in the presence of schistosomal PS, are capable of suppressing proliferation of autologous Th cells significantly at a Treg:Ttarget cell ratio of 1:1 (Fig 1C). Inhibition of proliferation was reduced to 50% at a Treg:Ttarget cell ratio of 1:2, and no inhibition was detectable at a 1:4 ratio. The observed suppression of proliferation was abrogated when a blocking IL-10 antibody was present in the co-culture of regulatory T cells (Treg) and target T cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the Treg cells exert their inhibitory function via IL-10. The low IL-12p70 production was not caused by PS toxicity, because production of another cytokine (IL-8) by dendritic cells was unaffected or even enhanced and also no apoptotic cells were detected as determined using the method described by Nicoletti et al.(31Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, the maturation of dendritic cells in the presence of schistosome egg- or adult worm-PS leads to the development of dendritic cells capable of inducing Tregcells. This is specific for schistosomal PS, as dendritic cells matured in the presence of SEA or PGE2 (which polarize toward Th2) lacked the capacity to stimulate the development of the IL-10-producing Treg cells. The mechanism whereby dendritic cells matured in the presence of schistosomal PS induce IL-10-producing T cells is currently being investigated. Preliminary experiments show that whereas dendritic cell-derived soluble factors present in supernatants mediate Th2 development, cell-cell contact is required for Tregcell induction. We transiently transfected HEK 293 cells with human TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4+MD2, TLR7, and TLR9 to elucidate the mechanism by which schistosomal PS interacts with cells of the innate immune system. On stimulation with schistosomal PS, only cells transfected with TLR2 were activated (Fig. 2A). These results were confirmed by using peritoneal macrophages of TLR2 −/− mice, which were unresponsive to schistosomal PS, whereas macrophages of the control mice showed a clear response (Fig. 2B). When an anti-TLR2 antibody was added during dendritic cell maturation in the presence of schistosomal PS, the development of IL-10-producing T cells was diminished (Fig 3A) whereas Th2 polarization was not affected (Fig. 3B), indicating that TLR2 plays a role in specifically promoting the development of regulatory T cells, but not Th2 cells.Figure 3TLR2 activation on dendritic cells is essential for the development of IL-10 producing T cells.Dendritic cells were matured with MF alone (−) or with MF and PS worms (10 μg/ml) in the presence of a TLR2 blocking antibody or a control antibody. After maturation, dendritic cells were co-cultured with naive T cells, which after 12 days were restimulated with immobilized CD3 and soluble CD28 (A) to measure IL-10 in 24-h supernatants (results of 3 independent experiments are shown as mean ± S.D., **, p < 0.01) or PMA and ionomycin in the presence of brefeldin A (B) and examined for intracellular IL-4 and IFN-γ (one representative of 3 independent experiments is shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that the active molecule present in the schistosomal PS fractions is indeed a phospholipid and not a minor compound not detectable by mass spectrometry, the schistosomal PS fraction was treated with phospholipase C, which removes the phosphoserine head group from the acylglycerol moiety, and subsequently HEK CD14/TLR2 stably transfected cells were stimulated with the resulting lipid fraction. On phospholipase C digestion, the TLR2-stimulating activity was significantly reduced (Fig. 4A), indicating that the phosphoserine head group is required for TLR2 activation. Phosphoserine alone did not have any TLR2-stimulating activity on HEK CD14/TLR2 cells (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that both the acyl group and the phosphoserine moieties of PS form a combined epitope for activity. In addition, HEK 293 cells stably transfected with TLR2 responded to schistosomal PS in a dose-dependent manner, but did not respond to any concentration of PS isolated from the liver of a non-infected mammalian host (a golden hamster) (Fig. 4B). In agreement with the observation that mammalian PS did not activate TLR2, it also did not affect dendritic cell maturation (data not shown). To identify the structure of the TLR2-activating molecule within the schistosomal PS preparations, we analyzed the contents of the PS preparations extracted from schistosome adult worms and eggs and hamster liver using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 4,C, D and E, respectively). The PS-containing fractions comprised a variety of molecules, but they all showed the typical loss of a serine head group (with a mass of 87 Da) and showed a great variety in the number of C atoms and presence of double bonds in the acyl chains. Strikingly, both in the schistosomal worm and egg PS fractions, PS molecules containing only one acyl chain (so-called lyso-PS molecules) were found, whereas such molecules could not be detected in the hamster liver PS ex"

Currently, lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are considered the primary enzymatic participants in these events. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme protein secreted by activated leukocytes, generates reactive intermediates that promote lipid peroxidation in vitro. For example, MPO catalyzes oxidation of tyrosine and nitrite to form tyrosyl radical and nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2), respectively, reactive intermediates capable of initiating oxidation of lipids in plasma. Neither the ability of MPO to initiate lipid peroxidation in vivo nor its role in generating bioactive eicosanoids during inflammation has been reported. Using a model of inflammation (peritonitis) with MPO knockout mice (MPO−/−), we examined the role for MPO in the formation of bioactive lipid oxidation products and promoting oxidant stressin vivo. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was used to simultaneously quantify individual molecular species of hydroxy- and hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (H(P)ETEs), F2-isoprostanes, hydroxy- and hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acids (H(P)ODEs), and their precursors, arachidonic acid and linoleic acid. Peritonitis-triggered formation of F2-isoprostanes, a marker of oxidant stress in vivo, was reduced by 85% in the MPO−/− mice. Similarly, formation of all molecular species of H(P)ETEs and H(P)ODEs monitored were significantly reduced (by at least 50%) in the MPO−/− group during inflammation. Parallel analyses of peritoneal lavage proteins for protein dityrosine and nitrotyrosine, molecular markers for oxidative modification by tyrosyl radical and ⋅NO2, respectively, revealed marked reductions in the content of nitrotyrosine, but not dityrosine, in MPO−/−samples. Thus, MPO serves as a major enzymatic catalyst of lipid peroxidation at sites of inflammation. Moreover, MPO-dependent formation of ⋅NO-derived oxidants, and not tyrosyl radical, appears to serve as a preferred pathway for initiating lipid peroxidation and promoting oxidant stress in vivo.

Often considered a deleterious process, peroxidation of membrane and lipoprotein phospholipids has been linked to disruption of biomembranes and cellular dysfunction.

A role for MPO-generated ⋅NO2in initiation of lipid peroxidation in vivo has yet to be examined. Although the above data are consistent with the hypothesis that MPO may participate in lipid and lipoprotein peroxidation in vivo, numerous studies have questioned this role for the hemoprotein. For example, only modest differences in lipid hydroperoxide formation were reported in a recent study (45Noguchi N. Nakano K. Aratani Y. Koyama H. Kodama T. Niki E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) examining the capacity of leukocytes isolated from wild type and MPO−/− mice to promote oxidation of low density lipoprotein in model systems ex vivo. Further, an inhibitory effect of NO 2− has been reported when monitoring MPO-catalyzed oxidation of low density lipoprotein (46Carr A.C. Frei B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1822-1828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antioxidant rather than pro-oxidant effects of MPO-generated tyrosine oxidation products during low density lipoprotein oxidation have similarly been proposed (47Exner M. Alt E. Hermann M. Hofbauer R. Kapiotis S. Quehenberger P. Speiser W. Minar E. Gmeiner B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 48Santanam N. Parthasarathy S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2594-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that MPO functions not to generate biologically active lipids but rather to destroy them through oxidative mechanisms, thereby altering inflammatory responses (49Henderson W.R. Klebanoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13522-13527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of MPO in initiation of lipid peroxidation in vivo is uncertain, and only through direct experimental investigation will the contribution of MPO to this process be enumerated. Here we employ a combination of murine models of inflammation and quantification of specific lipid oxidation products to define the role of MPO in the initiation of lipid peroxidation in vivo. Further, through parallel analyses of protein molecular markers of distinct oxidation pathways, the relative contributions of MPO-generated tyrosyl radical and reactive nitrogen species pathways to lipid peroxidation are assessed. Free fatty acids were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Organic solvents were obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. All buffers were passed over a Chelex-100 resin column (Bio-Rad) and supplemented with 0.1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) to remove potential contaminant transition metal ions that might catalyze lipid oxidation. Protein content was determined using Bradford-based Bio-Rad protein assay using IgG as protein standard. Wild type (MPO+/+) and MPO−/− mice were on a C57BL/6J background (>98% genetic homogeneity). Age- and sex-matched MPO+/+ and MPO−/− mice were used for all studies. Superoxide and HOCl generation in recovered peritoneal lavage cells from MPO+/+ and MPO−/− mice were performed as recently described (50Brennan M.L. Anderson M.M. Shih D.M. Qu X.D. Wang X. Mehta A.C.

Nitrotyrosine, chlorotyrosine, and dityrosine were quantified by stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry-based methods as previously described (32Brennan M.L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C. Narine L. Lenkiewicz E. Borchers M.T. Lusis A.J. Lee J.J. Lee N.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Ischiropoulos H. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17415-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). All animal studies were performed using approved protocols from the Animal Research Committee of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. MPO+/+ and MPO−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 4% thioglycollate broth. Twenty hours after recruitment, mice were injected with zymosan (250 mg/kg). Peritoneal lavage was performed in control animals (20 h post intraperitoneal injection of normal saline), 20 h following thioglycollate injection, or 24 h following the combination of both thioglycollate injection (20 h) followed by zymosan injection (4 h), as indicated (Tg/Z). Peritoneal lavages were performed with phosphate-buffered saline containing antioxidant (0.1 mmbutylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)) and metal chelator (2 mmDTPA), transferred to screw-capped tubes covered with argon atmosphere, and then immediately centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. All analyses of protein and lipid peroxidation products were performed on cell-free lavage supernatants. Cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm BHT and 0.1 mm DTPA, and differentials were performed on cytospin preparations of isolated cells. Cell pellets were also used for Western analyses (see below). Both cells and cell-free lavage fluid not immediately analyzed were overlaid with argon, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Cell pellets recovered from peritoneal lavages were lysed, concentration measured, and 25 μg total protein loaded per lane in 10% Tris-HCl gel. Following SDS-PAGE analysis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with rabbit antibodies against mouse COX-1, COX-2, and 12-LO (all from Cayman Chemical) and affinity purified rabbit antibody generated against a peptide fragment of actin (Sigma). Detection was performed using secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for chemiluminescent detection. Quantification of bands was performed by densitometric analysis. Band intensities were normalized to actin to account for loading variations between lanes. The mean relative band intensity (normalized to actin) from MPO+/+mice were assigned a relative value of 1.0 for comparisons between MPO+/+ and MPO−/− mice. All steps were performed under either argon or nitrogen atmosphere. Peritoneal lavage volume was reduced under vacuum centrifugation prior to extraction and preparation for mass spectrometry analysis. Immediately prior to extraction, 10 ng each of two deuterated internal standards, 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic-5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-d8 acid (12-HETE-d8) and prostaglandin F2α(PGF2α-d4) (Cayman Chemical Company) were added to each sample. Hydroperoxides in samples were then reduced to their corresponding stable alcohols by adding 1 mmSnCl2 (23Zhang R. Shen Z. Nauseef W.M. Hazen S.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were then extracted by adding a solvent mixture (1 m acetic acid/2-isopropanol/hexane (2:20:30, v/v/v) to the sample at a ratio of 2.5 ml of solvent mixture/1 ml of sample, vortexing, and then adding 2.5 ml hexane. Following vortex and centrifugation, lipids were recovered in the hexane layer. Peritoneal lavages were re-extracted by addition of an equal volume of hexane, followed by vortex and centrifugation. The combined hexane layers were dried under N2 flow and then analyzed following saponification to release all esterified fatty acid oxidation products. For saponification, N2-dried lipids were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 2-isopropanol, and then fatty acids were released by base hydrolysis with 1.5 ml of 0.2 m NaOH at 60 °C for 30 min under argon atmosphere. Hydrolyzed samples were first acidified to pH 3.0 with 0.5 m HCl, and then fatty acids were extracted twice with 4 ml of hexane. The combined hexane layers were dried under N2 flow, resuspended in 100 μl of methanol, and stored under argon at −80 °C until analysis by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS), as described below. LC/ESI/MS/MS was employed to quantify the multiple distinct oxidation products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, including individual HETEs, F2-isoprostanes, and hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs). Immediately prior to analysis, one volume of H2O was added to 20 volumes methanol-suspended sample, which was then passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Sample (50 μl) was injected onto a C-18 column (2 × 250 mm, 5 μm ODS) (Phenomenex, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The separation was performed using a gradient starting from 85% methanol over 15 min, then to 100% methanol over 1 min, followed by 100% methanol for 15 min. HPLC column effluent was split so that only 50% was introduced into a"

The mammalian family of phospholipases A2 includes the secreted forms (sPLA2s), 1The abbreviations used are: sPLA2(s), secreted phospholipase A2(s); DOetPC and DOetPS, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and -phosphoserine, respectively; [3H]DPPA and [3H]DPPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylcholine, respectively; DTT, dithiothreitol; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; POPA, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate; POPC/G/M/S, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/glycerol/methanol/serine; POPE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; [14C]SAPC, 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonylphosphatidylcholine; TPCK, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone. A comprehensive abbreviation system for the various mammalian sPLA2s is used: each sPLA2 is abbreviated with a lowercase letter indicating the sPLA2 species (m and h for mouse and human, respectively), followed by uppercase letters identifying the sPLA2 group (GIB, GIIA, GIIC, GIID, GIIE, GIIF, GIII, GV, GIX, GX, GXI, and GXII). hGIIFΔC is the mutant of hGIIF lacking the C-terminal 23 amino acids. hGIIDng is the nonglycosylated form of hGIID. LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; LPG, lysophosphatidylglycerol; LIP, lysophosphatidylinositol; LPM, lysophosphatidylmethanol; LPS, lysophosphatidylserine. which are 14–19-kDa (with some exceptions), Ca2+-dependent, disulfide-rich enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the sn-2 position to release fatty acids and lysophospholipids (1Verheij H.M.

John Wiley and Sons, West Sussex, UK2002Google Scholar). 10 sPLA2s have been identified in mice (groups IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, and XII), and humans contain all of these except IIC, which occurs as a pseudogene (5Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Google Scholar, 6Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Google Scholar). Many of these sPLA2s were identified in the past few years, and studies are under way to determine their physiological functions. A catalytically inactive sPLA2-like protein called otoconin-95 was also identified in mice and humans (7Verpy E. Leibovici M. Petit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 529-534Google Scholar, 8Wang Y. Kowalski P.E. Thalmann I. Ornitz D.M. Mager D.L. Thalmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15345-15350Google Scholar). The different sPLA2 paralogs are not closely related isoforms because the amino acid identity between any two is in the range of <15–50%. This plus the fact that each sPLA2 displays a distinct tissue distribution pattern argue for distinct physiological functions of these enzymes. Furthermore, the tissue distributions of the human sPLA2s are often different from those of the mouse orthologs, suggesting that the function of a particular sPLA2 in the mouse may be distinct from that of its human ortholog. Well established physiological functions for mammalian sPLA2s include the following. Pancreatic sPLA2(group IB) has a well known role in the digestion of dietary phospholipids, but other sPLA2s are probably also involved in phospholipid degradation in the gastrointestinal track (9Richmond B.L. Boileau A.C. Zheng S. Huggins K.W. Granholm N.A. Tso P. Hui D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1193-1202Google Scholar). The first nonpancreatic mammalian sPLA2 to be identified was the group IIA enzyme, which is expressed at high levels during inflammation (10Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 8: 1-30Google Scholar) and is the principal bactericidal agent against Gram-positive bacteria in human tears (11Qu X.D. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2791-2797Google Scholar) and also works in concert with neutrophils as a bactericidal agent (12Madsen L.M. Inada M. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2425-2430Google Scholar). Groups IIA and V sPLA2s are involved in liberation of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, for example in endothelial cells and macrophages, for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids (13Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Google Scholar, 14Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Google Scholar). One or more keratinocyte sPLA2 is involved in the generation of free fatty acids, which are one of the main constituents of the permeability barrier of the outermost layer of skin (stratum corneum) (15Mao-Qiang M. Jain M. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 57-63Google Scholar, 16Schadow A. Scholz-Pedretti K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Furstenberger G. Pfeilschifter J. Kaszkin M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 31-39Google Scholar). Physiological functions for groups IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, and XII sPLA2s have not yet been reported, although overexpression of groups IID, IIE, and IIF in HEK293 cells results in arachidonic acid release, which can be converted into prostaglandins (17Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10083-10096Google Scholar, 18Murakami M.

It is also clear that mammals contain a collection of proteins that bind sPLA2s tightly. Two types of sPLA2 receptor (M- and N-type), the cell surface proteoglycan glypican, and soluble sPLA2-binding proteins have been identified and are likely to play a role in the physiological functions of mammalian sPLA2s and in the toxicity of a wide variety of myotoxic and neurotoxic sPLA2s found in reptile and invertebrate venoms (17Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10083-10096Google Scholar, 20Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Google Scholar, 21Hanasaki K. Arita H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 215-223Google Scholar). sPLA2s are water-soluble enzymes that must bind to the membrane interface to gain access to their highly water-insoluble phospholipid substrates (interfacial enzymes) (3Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.-D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2654Google Scholar, 4Berg O.G. Jain M.K. Interfacial Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, West Sussex, UK2002Google Scholar). Kinetic and x-ray structural studies of sPLA2s have established that they contain an interfacial recognition site that allows attachment of enzyme to the interface, which is distinct from the catalytic site where the esterolysis of a single phospholipid molecule occurs. Thus, the substrate specificity of sPLA2s is dictated by the type of membrane interface to which the enzyme prefers to bind (interfacial specificity) and by the type of phospholipid that is accommodated in the catalytic site (catalytic site specificity). These features can be studied separately using suitable methods (22Ghomashchi F. Yu B.-Z. Berg O. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7318-7329Google Scholar). Interfacial binding specificity of sPLA2s has important physiological consequences. For example, human group IIA sPLA2 binds several orders of magnitude more tightly to anionic phospholipid membranes than to an interface composed mainly of charge-neutral phosphatidylcholine (PC) (23Bezzine S. Bollinger J.G. Singer A.G. Veatch S.L. Keller S.L. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (September 19, 10.1074/jbc.M2203137200)Google Scholar). This may explain why the extracellular face of the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, which is rich in PC and sphingomyelin, is normally resistant to degradation by group IIA sPLA2, and yet the phosphatidylglycerol-rich membrane of Gram-positive bacteria is readily degraded by this enzyme (24Elsbach P. Weiss J. Wright G. Forst S. van den Bergh C.J. Verheij H.M. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 349: 1-9Google Scholar, 25Koduri R.S. Grönroos J.O. Laine V.J. Le Calvez C. Lambeau G. Nevalainen T.L.

Special consideration is also required to analyze reversible sPLA2 inhibitors properly because nonspecific effects often result from a decrease in the amount of interface-bound enzyme caused by the presence of the inhibitor candidate in the interface (3Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.-D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2654Google Scholar). Highly specific sPLA2 inhibitors have been reported for some of the group members (27Gelb M.H. Kudo I. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 2000; 45: 1065-1071Google Scholar, 28Mihelich E.D. Schevitz R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 223-228Google Scholar, 29Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized the interfacial kinetic and binding properties of the full set of mouse and human groups I, II, V, X, and XII sPLA2s (mGIB, hGIB, mGIIA, hGIIA, mGIIC, mGIID, hGIID, mGIIE, hGIIE, mGIIF, hGIIF, mGV, hGV, mGX, hGX, and hGXII). The group III sPLA2 gene predicts a protein consisting of a central sPLA2 domain flanked by large N- and C-terminal extensions. This sPLA2 was not included in the present studied because the structure of the mature protein remains to be elucidated. Mouse group XII was not studied because its sequence is 94% identical to that of hGXII. The interfacial kinetic properties (turnover numbers on various different phospholipid vesicles, catalytic site specificity with regard to phospholipid head group andsn-2 acyl chain, and calcium affinity) were studied systematically, allowing the comparison of the enzymatic properties of mammalian sPLA2s measured with a common set of conditions. The interfacial binding affinities of the mammalian sPLA2s for vesicles composed of zwitterionic phospholipids containing various amounts of anionic phospholipids were quantified as a prelude to interpreting the ability of these enzymes to hydrolyze the outer plasma membrane of mammalian cells, which is also reported. Given the importance of sPLA2 inhibitors as medicinal agents and for unraveling the physiological functions of these enzymes, we also report the full set of inhibition data using several previously described compounds that have been established to act by a catalytic site-directed mechanism. All of these studies rely on a source of pure recombinant sPLA2s, and refolding protocols are described which permit native enzymes to be obtained in relatively high yields from Escherichia coli-generated insoluble inclusion bodies except for two sPLA2s that were obtained by expression in insect cells. All phospholipids are from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. unless specified otherwise. PI is from soybeans and is mainly 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoylphosphatidylinositol. sPLA2inhibitors were obtained as follows: DDC-1 (30Bryant M.D. Flick K.E. Koduri R.S. Wilton D.C. Stoddard B.L.

As necessary, sPLA2s were purified on a C18 ZipTip (Millipore) to remove traces of salts prior to electrospray mass spectrometry. The tip was rinsed twice with 50% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, then three times with water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. sPLA2 solution (10 μl) was loaded onto the tip, which was washed twice with water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then with 80% CH3CN to elute the protein. hGIIA, and hGX were produced in E. coli as described previously (23Bezzine S. Bollinger J.G. Singer A.G. Veatch S.L. Keller S.L. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (September 19, 10.1074/jbc.M2203137200)Google Scholar, 39Snitko Y. Han S.K. Lee B.I. Cho W.

E. coli expression plasmids for hGIB and hGIIF were prepared from the respective cDNAs as described for hGXII (41Gelb M.H. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39823-39826Google Scholar). The expression plasmids are based on the pAB3 plasmid encoding the first 8.4 kDa of glutathioneS-transferase followed by a factor Xa protease recognition site fused to the N terminus of mature hGIB and hGIIF (i.e.without signal peptides or prepropeptides) (38Valentin E. Koduri R.S. Scimeca J.-C. Carle G. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19152-19160Google Scholar). Because cDNA for hGIIE could not be PCR amplified from a number of commercial human tissue cDNAs (Clontech), a synthetic gene was prepared as described previously for hGX (37Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Google Scholar) and used to construct a pAB3 plasmid as for hGIB (sequence available from the authors upon request). For hGIIFΔC, a PCR fragment coding for a factor Xa cleavage site (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) followed by the hGIIFΔC mature protein ending with the peptide sequence PTPNC (42Valentin E. Singer A.G. Ghomashchi F. Lazdunski M. Gelb M.H. Lambeau G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 223-228Google Scholar) was amplified with Pwo DNA polymerase and subcloned in-frame in pAB3 (43Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Google Scholar). For hGV expression, the cDNA coding for the mature enzyme was PCR amplified and then cloned in-frame to the initiator Met codon encoded by the NdeI site present in the pET21a expression plasmid (Novagen Inc.). hGIB, hGIIE, hGIIF, hGIIFΔC, and hGXII were expressed in E. coli BL21, and hGV was expressed in BL21 (DE3). Inclusion body protein was isolated and sulfonated as described (41Gelb M.H. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39823-39826Google Scholar). Specific refolding procedures for each human sPLA2 are described below. Enzymatic activity was followed using a fluorometric assay with 1-palmitoyl-2-pyrenedecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphomethanol (44Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Google Scholar). Sulfonated hGIB fusion protein (40 mg) was dissolved in 200 ml of 6m guanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at room temperature by stirring for 30–60 min. The solution was dialyzed against 6.5 liters of prechilled refolding buffer (0.9 mguanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmfreshly added cysteine, 5 mm EDTA) for 5–7 h at 4 °C and then against a second portion of buffer overnight. A small aliquot of dialyzed protein solution was assayed for enzymatic activity using the fluorometric assay (44Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Google Scholar) until it reached a maximum (typically 1–2 days after initiation of dialysis). The dialysis bag was transferred to 6.5 liters of prechilled protease buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2). The buffer was changed twice for a total of 20 liters. The contents of the dialysis bag were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove protein precipitate. The protein concentration in the supernatant was measured with the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad, using bovine serum albumin as a standard). TPCK-treated trypsin was added (0.025 μg/μg of hGIB fusion protein), and digestion was allowed to proceed with stirring at room temperature until the enzymatic activity reached a maximum (typically ∼2 h). The protein solution was centrifuged to remove any particulate and then pumped at 3 ml/min directly onto the HPLC column (60 ml/run, Vydac 218 TP1010 C18 reverse phase) that had been equilibrated previously with solvent A (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid in water). The column was developed with a program of 0–30% solvent B (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 40 min, then to 60% B over 110 min, then to 100% B over 20 min. hGIB elutes at 43 min. The peak fractions were combined, 2 volumes of water were added, and the sample was lyophilized. The overall yield of pure, refolded hGIB is ∼1.7 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The protein was judged to be >98% pure on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The observed molecular weight is 14,125.8, and the calculated weight is 14,125.0. Sulfonated hGIIE fusion protein was refolded by the dialysis method described above for hGIB. Although sPLA2 activity was detected after dialysis against refolding buffer, no activity was detected in the supernatant following centrifugation of the protein solution that was dialyzed against protease buffer. The protein pellet, obtained after submitting 150 mg of sulfonated fusion protein to refolding, was dissolved in 150 ml of protease buffer containing 10 mm lauryl sulfobetaine (Calbiochem) by stirring for 10–20 min at room temperature. After centrifugation (8,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min), TPCK-treated trypsin was added (0.02 μg/μg of fusion protein) to the supernatant. The sPLA2 activity was followed until it reached a maximum (∼1.5 h). The sample was centrifuged (8,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min). One-fourth of the supernatant was pumped directly onto the HPLC column (as for hGIB) that had been equilibrated previously with 10% solvent B. The column was developed with 10–30% B over 20 min then to 45% B over 110 min, and hGIIE elutes at 45 min. The protein solution was concentrated ∼2-fold in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments) and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. The dialyzed hGIIE solution was stored at −20 °C. The overall yield of pure, refolded hGIIE is ∼1.7 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The protein was judged to be >98% pure on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The observed molecular weight (electrospray mass spectrometry) is 13,951.5, and the calculated is 13,952.1. Sulfonated hGIIF fusion protein was dissolved to 10 mg/ml in 6m guanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (this and all subsequently used buffers and HPLC solvents also contained 1 mm methionine to prevent oxidation of protein methionines), by stirring for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm for 20 min to remove undissolved protein. Four ml of protein solution was added dropwise (∼1 drop/s) to 2 liters of hGIIF-refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.9 m guanidine-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mm freshly added cysteine, 30% acetonitrile (by volume), acetonitrile added last to buffer preadjusted to pH 8.0) with stirring in an Erlenmeyer flask at room temperature. Stirring was continued for a few min, and the solution was kept at room temperature without stirring until the sPLA2 activity reached a maximum (∼2–3 days). The volume of the solution was reduced to 1,400 ml by rotary evaporation at 30 °C. Lauryl sulfobetaine was added to a concentration of 5 mm followed by the addition of 14 ml of 100 mmmethionine (previously filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter). The solution was concentrated to 40–50 ml in an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon, YM-10 membrane) with stirring under 30–40 p.s.i. of N2 pressure. The solution was dialyzed against protease buffer at 4 °C (three cycles, each with 40 volumes of buffer). Trypsin was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml, and the sample was left at room temperature overnight. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the solution was filtered through a 0.45-μm nylon HPLC solvent filter. An aliquot (12.5 ml) was pumped onto the reverse phase HPLC column (previously equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, solvent A) at 3 ml/min. The column was washed with 15 ml of solvent A followed by a gradient of 0–6.3% B (100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 2 min, then to 27.5% B in 42 min, then to 100% B in 4 min. hGIIF elutes at 36 min. The purified protein solution was neutralized by adding 2 m Tris (10 μl/ml of HPLC fraction), and lauryl sulfobetaine was added to a concentration of 5 mm. The sample was concentrated in a Centriprep-10 (Amicon) and then dialyzed against 40 volumes of 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for one cycle and then 40 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for two cycles. The protein solution was stored at −20 °C. The overall yield of pure, refolded hGIIF is ∼3.7 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The protein was judged to be >98% pure on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To ensure complete removal of buffer cysteine that may be disulfide-linked to the hGIIF cysteine residue in its C-terminal extension, 0.64 mg of hGIIF in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was treated with 1 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. The sample was diluted to 1.5 ml with 20% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto an analytical HPLC column (Supelco Discovery BIO wide pore C5, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). The column was developed for 5 min in 20% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid followed by a gradient to 50% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 120 min. hGIIF eluted at 69.4 min, and the fraction was diluted with water and lyophilized. The protein was resuspended in 31.5% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the solution was loaded onto the same HPLC column. After 5 min at 31.5% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, a gradient to 36.5% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was started. hGIIF eluted at 46.3 min and was diluted with water and lyophilized. The observed molecular weight (electrospray mass spectrometry) is 16,583.4, and the calculated is 16,583.7. hGIIFΔC was expressed in E. coli as follows. A PCR fragment coding for a factor Xa cleavage site (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) followed by the hGIIFΔC mature protein ending with the peptide sequence PTPNC (43Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Google Scholar) was amplified with Pwo DNA polymerase and subcloned in-frame in the pAB3 vector. Bacterial induction, preparation of inclusion bodies, sulfonation of the fusion protein, and dialysis against 1% acetic acid were performed as described (38Valentin E. Koduri R.S. Scimeca J.-C. Carle G. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19152-19160Google Scholar). Sulfonated hGIIFΔC protein was dissolved at 0.2 mg of protein/ml in 500 ml of 6 m guanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and refolded by dialysis against 8 liters of 0.7 mguanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mml-methionine, and 5 mml-cysteine for 48 h at 4 °C. The refolded protein was dialyzed twice against 8 liters of 2 m urea, 0.1m NH4Cl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein solution was filtered through Sephadex G-50 and subjected to digestion with trypsin (0.025 μg of trypsin/μg of protein) at room temperature. The cleavage of the fusion protein was followed by measuring the increase of sPLA2 activity using E. coli membranes as substrate (45Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Google Scholar). After about 2 h of incubation with trypsin, the reaction was stopped by acidification with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the mixture was concentrated to 40 ml using an Amicon stirred cell concentrator with a YM-10 membrane. The solution was filtered and loaded directly onto a Beckman C18 reverse phase HPLC column (10 × 250 mm, 19.6 ml, 100 Å, 5 μm). Elution was performed at 4 ml/min using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (20–35% acetonitrile over 150 min). Fractions containing sPLA2 activity were lyophilized, dissolved in 23% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and loaded on a Waters Symmet"

https://openalex.org/W2070591805,"We identified a mammalian BiP-associated protein, BAP, using a yeast two-hybrid screen that shared low homology with yeast Sls1p/Sil1p and mammalian HspBP1, both of which regulate the ATPase activity of their Hsp70 partner. BAP encoded an ∼54-kDa protein with an N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting sequence, two sites of <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation, and a C-terminal ER retention sequence. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that BAP co-localized with GRP94 in the endoplasmic reticulum. BAP was ubiquitously expressed but showed the highest levels of expression in secretory organ tissues, a pattern similar to that observed with BiP. BAP binding was affected by the conformation of the ATPase domain of BiP based on <i>in vivo</i> binding studies with BiP mutants. BAP stimulated the ATPase activity of BiP when added alone or together with the ER DnaJ protein, ERdj4, by promoting the release of ADP from BiP. Together, these data demonstrate that BAP serves as a nucleotide exchange factor for BiP and provide insights into the mechanisms that control protein folding in the mammalian ER."
https://openalex.org/W2001929483,"In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oligosaccharyl transferase (OT) is composed of nine different transmembrane proteins. Using a glycosylatable peptide containing a photoprobe, we previously found that only one essential subunit, Ost1p, was specifically labeled by the photoprobe and recently have shown that it does not contain the recognition domain for the glycosylatable sequence Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser. In this study we utilized additional glycosylatable peptides containing two photoreactive groups and found that these were linked to Stt3p and Ost3p. Stt3p is the most conserved subunit in the OT complex, and therefore 21 block mutants in the lumenal region were prepared. Of the 14 lethal mutant proteins only two, as well as one temperature-sensitive mutant protein, were incorporated into the OT complex. However, using microsomes prepared from these three strains, the labeling of Ost1p was markedly decreased upon photoactivation with the Asn-Bpa-Thr photoprobe. Based on the block mutants single amino acid mutations were prepared and analyzed. From all of these results, we conclude that the sequence from residues 516 to 520, WWDYG in Stt3p, plays a central role in glycosylatable peptide recognition and/or the catalytic glycosylation process.

Biochemical, molecular biological, and genetic studies have led to the identification of a remarkably large number of subunits for yeast OT (7–20). During the last decade, OT complexes have been purified from different sources, such as dog pancreas (21Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Google Scholar, 22Kelleher D.J.

To identify the subunit(s) of yeast OT that recognizes Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser sites that can be glycosylated, earlier we developed a photoaffinity probe containing a photoreactive benzophenone derivative,p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) (28Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Google Scholar). By using this125I-labeled Bpa-containing tripeptide, we found that Ost1p was specifically labeled by photoactivation in yeast microsomes (29Yan Q. Prestwich G.D. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5021-5025Google Scholar). However, subsequently we found that Ost1p is not the glycosylation site recognition/catalytic subunit. 2Yan, Q., and Lennarz, W. J. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press.2Yan, Q., and Lennarz, W. J. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press. In this study, we used additional sets of peptides containing two photoreactive groups for photoactivation and found that the photoprobes became linked to Stt3p. Stt3p is highly conserved in eukaryotes and essential for vegetative growth of yeast cells. In fact, it is the most conserved subunit among the OT components. Human, murine, andDrosophila proteins, as well as a putative protein inCaenorhabditis elegans, are more than 50% identical in amino acid sequence (17Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Google Scholar). Stt3p contains a very hydrophobic N-terminal domain spanning the membrane 10–12 times and a hydrophilic, lumenal domain at the C terminus (16Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 167-172Google Scholar, 17Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Google Scholar). To further investigate function of Stt3p, we prepared 21 block mutants in the lumenal domain within regions of high conservation. Furthermore, single amino acid mutations that were derived from the block mutants were also prepared. Based on studies with these and other mutants, we conclude that Stt3p is the OT subunit involved in peptide recognition and/or catalysis and that the sequence at residues 516–520, WWDYG, plays a key role in this process. W303-1a (MAT a ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) was used as the parental strain to generate the Stt3p hemagglutinin (HA) construct that is integrated into the chromosome. PCR was carried out using the ME-3 plasmid (which contains a triple HA tag and the his5+ gene fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe) as the template. The primers were 5′-TCTACGAAAACCAGAAGGTCCATAAAGAGACCTGAATTAGGCTTGAGAGTCTACCCATACGATGTTCCT-3′ and 5′-ACCAAAAAGGGCAAAGACGATCCGTCACGAGCGATCATAATAACGGGAAGGGAAGTCGACGGTATCGATAAG-3′. A linear PCR product was used to transform W303-1a by homologous recombination. The resulting transformant was designated as QYY697. The diploid strain W303 (ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) was used to generate QYY698 (ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 STT3/Δstt3::his 5+ (S. pombe)). PCR was carried out using the ME-3 plasmid as the template. The primers were 5′-CGGTCTAATTCAACGTGACATAGCATCCGCAATCGCATTCACAGCCGTAAATCCCCCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTC-3′ and 5′-ACCAAAAAGGGCAAAGACGATCCGTCACGAGCGATCATAATAACGGGAAGGGAAGTCGACGGTATCGATAAG-3′. A linear PCR product was used to transform the W303 diploid strain by homologous recombination. The resulting transformant was designated as QYY698. QYY698 was transformed with YEp352-STT3 and sporulated. The haploid strain QYY700 (MATa ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3Δstt3::his5+ (S. pombe) YEp352-STT3) was selected on −His −Ura (media) plates. All of the mutant strains were generated using QYY700 as the parental strain. YEp352-STT3 was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Markus Aebi. A 2.9-kb fragment was generated by PCR using QYY697 genomic DNA as template and 5′-CCAAGCTTATGG GATCCGACCGGTCGTGTG-3′ and 5′-CCGAGCTCCTGCAGCCCGGGGGATCCAC-3′ as primers. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pRS314, which was digested withSmaI and SacI to generate the plasmid pRS314-STT3HA. Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am was custom-made by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA), and Bpa-Ala-Asn-Ala-Thr-Ala-Bpa-Am and Asn-Bpa-Thr-Ala-Bpa-Am were custom-made by Center for the Analysis and Synthesis of Macromolecules (Stony Brook, NY). In each case the N terminus was derivatized with 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter (bh) reagent (3 Ci/μmol; ICN, Irvine, CA) as described previously (30Welply J.K. Kaplan H.A. Shenbagamurthi P. Naider F. Lennarz W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 808-819Google Scholar), yielding 125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am,125I-bh-Bpa-Ala-Asn-Ala-Thr-Ala-Bpa-Am, and125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Ala-Bpa-Am, respectively. [3H]Acetic anhydride (7.3 Ci/μmol; AmershamBiosciences) was used to prepare [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am (31Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Naider F. Park H.R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6459-6465Google Scholar). Yeast microsomes were prepared as described by Baker et al. (32Baker D. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. Botstein D. Segev N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 355-359Google Scholar). PCR mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For all of the group and single-residue mutations mentioned in this paper, pRS314-STT3HA was used as the template. Mutagenized plasmids were sequenced, and those with the expected sequence were transformed into QYY700. The transformants were selected for Trp and Ura prototrophy and then further for 5-fluro-orotic acid selection. Yeast spheroplasts or crude microsomes were used for photolysis as described previously (29Yan Q. Prestwich G.D. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5021-5025Google Scholar). After irradiation, immunoprecipitation was performed as described by Karaoglu et al. (33Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Google Scholar), except that after the photoactivation step the reaction was adjusted to 1.5% digitonin, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, 3.5 mm MgCl2. The solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 55,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA), and the supernatant fraction was used for immunoprecipitation. To determine the growth difference between yeast cells carrying stt3p mutants, the same amount of cells (5 × 106) were collected after the strains had been grown to early log phase in −Trp media at 25 °C. Then 10 μl of serial 1:10 dilutions of the cells were spotted on −Trp plates and incubated at 25, 30, and 37 °C, respectively. To determine whether in fact 125I-bh-Bpa-Ala-Asn-Ala-Thr-Ala-Bpa-Am and125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Ala-Bpa-Am are substrates for OT, yeast microsomes (50 μg of total protein/reaction) were used for the assay. The assay was performed as described (34Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1485-1489Google Scholar). To determine the OT activity of the stt3p mutants, yeast spheroplasts were prepared from each mutant and [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am was used as the substrate. For each reaction, 50 μl of spheroplasts (equivalent to 5A 600 units of cells) and 0.5 μCi of peptide substrate were used. After incubation at 25 °C for 20 min, the entire reaction was added to concanavalin A-agarose beads. After allowing glycosylated peptides to bind at room temperature for 4 h, concanavalin A beads were washed twice with 50 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40. The amount of the radioactivity on the beads was counted. For the immunoprecipitated samples, the proteins were eluted from protein G-agarose beads with 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol after immunoprecipitation and subjected to Endo H digestion as suggested by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). For CPY Western blot analysis, 25 μl of spheroplasts (equivalent to 2.5 A 600 units of cells) were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended with 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The suspension was boiled for 10 min and centrifuged. The supernatant was subjected to Endo H digestion as suggested by the manufacturer. Quantitation of immunoprecipitated OT subunits and radiolabeled Ost1p was performed by scanning the films and analyzing the bands using the NIH Image 1.62 program. For the block mutants, we used the same volume of microsomes as the control for immunoprecipitation and photoactivation. We normalized the amount of protein immunoprecipitated and radiolabeled Ost1p to the wild type control. For the point mutants, we used the same volume of microsomes as the control for immunoprecipitation. After quantifying the Ost1p in these microsomes, we used an amount of microsomes that precipitated an equivalent amount of Ost1p for photoactivation. Previously we used125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am for photoactivation. It is known that the OT does not have a specific requirement for the middle amino acid, as long as it is not proline, which would introduce a rigid kink in the conformation of the peptide (1Marshall R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 673-702Google Scholar, 2Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Google Scholar). Although Bpa is located between Asn and Thr, the benzoyl side chain could be oriented away from the enzyme active site. Because we found that a tripeptide with Bpa in the middle position did not lead to photolabeling of the active site,2 we synthesized and tested peptides in which Bpa was located at different positions. We blocked the N termini of the peptides with the 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent and blocked the C termini with amide bonds. First, we prepared a heptapeptide (TableI, peptide II) in which two Bpa residues were incorporated with the hope that the photoprobe could act as a bifunctional probe and thereby cross-link two different proteins (or two different parts of the same protein). This peptide was found to be a substrate for OT, although it was not as effective as the original tripeptide (data not shown).Table IDifferential labeling of OT subunits by three different photoprobesProbe structureProteins radiolabeled125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-AmOst1p125I-bh-Bpa-Ala-Asn-Ala-Thr-Ala-Bpa-AmStt3p, Ost3p125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Ala-Bpa-AmOst1p, Stt3p, Ost3p Open table in a new tab In a second experiment we studied this peptide in terms of photolabeling of OT subunits upon incubation with microsomes. After photoactivation, the microsomes were solubilized with digitonin, and the clarified supernatant was used for nondenaturing immunoprecipitation. Microsomes from a strain containing a chromosomally integrated HA epitope-tagged form of the OST3gene were used to do photolabeling with this heptapeptide. The proteins precipitated with anti-HA antibodies were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. This photoprobe labeled two proteins of the OT complex (Fig. 1 a,lanes 2 and 3). Based on the molecular mass, the upper radiolabeled band could be either Ost1p or Stt3p, and the lower band could be Ost3p. Although the calculated molecular mass for Stt3p is 78 kDa, it was found that it migrates anomalously (runs between 60 and 70 kDa) and always as a diffuse band, and therefore it is hard to separate Ost1p from Stt3p (33Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Google Scholar, 35Spirig U. Glavas M. Bodmer D. Reiss G. Burda P. Lippuner V. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 628-637Google Scholar). To clarify these issues, we used microsomes prepared from strains that expressed either Ost1HAp or Stt3HAp for photolabeling experiments. The triple HA tag has a mass about 3 kDa, and we can detect the migration change by adding it to the C terminus of either Ost1p or Stt3p. When using microsomes prepared from the OST1HAstrain, the upper radiolabeled band did not change its mobility, whereas the lower band increased its mobility. In comparison, when microsomes from an STT3HA containing strain were used, the upper radiolabeled band decreased its mobility, whereas the lower band migrated as it did in the OST1HA construct. These results clearly established that the upper radiolabeled band was Stt3p and that the lower radiolabeled band was Ost3p. It seems that when epitope-tagged Ost3p was replaced by the other epitope-tagged subunits for immunoprecipitation, less Ost3p was precipitated (lanes 1 and 4). Similar results were obtained by Karaogluet al. (33Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Google Scholar). This heptapeptide was designed to be a bifunctional photoprobe with the hope that it could cross-link two nearby OT subunits. Based on our results this obviously was not the case. If this peptide cross-linked two proteins together, we should detect a radiolabeled band that migrated at a position equal to the sum of the two polypeptides. We conclude that the photoprobe is acting as a monofunctional probe, although there are two photoreactive groups available. Because the excitation time of the photoprobe is short (0.8–1.2 μs in the presence of a suitably oriented C–H bond) (28Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Google Scholar), it is unlikely that two photoreactive groups would be excited at the same time. The excited state readily relaxes to the ground state if it does not encounter a hydrogen donor with the appropriate geometry. Once one Bpa is cross-linked to one protein, the other one might not be positioned optimally for photolyzing and linking to another protein. We also prepared a pentapeptide bifunctional photoprobe in which one of the Bpa residues was placed between Asn and Thr, the same position as in the original tripeptide (Table I, peptide I), and another Bpa was located at the C terminus (Table I, peptide III). This peptide was found to be a good substrate for OT. Microsomes from anOST3HA strain were used for photoactivation followed by nondenaturing immunoprecipitation. Three radiolabeled bands were detected on the autoradiogram (Fig. 1 b, lane 3). Based on the molecular mass and the characteristics of the bands, we assumed that they were Stt3p, Ost1p, and Ost3p. This was confirmed by using microsomes prepared from OST1HA and STT3HAstrains for photoactivation. When using Ost1HAp microsomes for photoactivation, the upper band (Stt3p) did not change its mobility compared with using the Ost3HAp microsomes. But the middle band (Ost1HAp) decreased its mobility because of the addition of the triple HA tag, and the lower band increased its mobility because it no longer had a triple HA tag (Ost3p) (Fig. 1 b, lane 1). Similarly, when using Stt3HAp microsomes for photoactivation, the upper band (Stt3HAp) migrated more slowly compared with using the Ost3HAp microsomes, whereas the lower band (Ost3p) migrated more quickly, and the middle band (Ost1p) did not change its mobility (Fig.1 b, lane 5). To better distinguish Stt3p from Ost1p, we performed Endo H digestion of the immunoprecipitated samples. Both Ost1p and Stt3p are glycosylated proteins, and after deglycosylation Ost1p was readily distinguished from Stt3p (Fig.1 b, lanes 2, 4, and 6). By comparing lanes 2, 4, and 6, it is clear that these three radiolabeled bands are Stt3p, Ost1p, and Ost3p. It is obvious that this pentapeptide also did not act as a bifunctional photoprobe, that is, it did not label any two polypeptides simultaneously. However, the fact that it became linked to Ost1p was consistent with the photolabeling of Ost1p when the tripeptide was used because one of the two Bpa residues in the pentapeptide is located in the position between Asn and Thr. It is of interest that the probe with Bpa at the C terminus of the pentapeptide labeled two different proteins. We speculate that this Bpa is probably located at the interface of Stt3p and Ost3p. These two subunits are likely to be near to each other because it is well established that they exist in one subcomplex (Ost3p-Ost4p-Stt3p) (33Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Google Scholar, 35Spirig U. Glavas M. Bodmer D. Reiss G. Burda P. Lippuner V. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 628-637Google Scholar, 36Kim H. Park H. Montalvo L. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1516-1520Google Scholar). It is not surprising that Bpa could label both Stt3p and Ost3p because the photoreactive group is free to rotate. From the previous results it is clear that both Stt3p and Ost3p are in the vicinity of Ost1p in the OT complex. This conclusion is supported by the observation that upon depletion of Stt3p, both Ost1p and Ost3p disappear from the purified OT complex, whereas Wbp1p and Swp1p are still present (17Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Google Scholar). Because Stt3p is the most conserved subunit of OT complex, it is reasonable to speculate that it contains the recognition element and/or catalytic domain for glycosylation. Ost3p is not an essential subunit and thus is not likely to carry out a function absolutely required for glycosylation. The subunit that contains the recognition element and/or catalytic domain for glycosylation must be essential, and mutations in the recognition element and/or catalytic domain would be expected to cause lethality or a severe growth defect. However, if the mutant protein does not get incorporated into the OT complex, we cannot determine whether it is a functional mutation. If it does get incorporated and if the mutation is not lethal, the OT activity would be expected to be dramatically decreased in the mutant. Most importantly, the mutant would be expected to cause a marked decrease in the labeling of Ost1p by the tripeptide Asn-Bpa-Thr. We asked whether Stt3p meets all of these criteria. A search for homologous proteins in the data bases showed that yeast Stt3p shares high homology with proteins in human, mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans (greater than 50% identity over a region of 700 amino acid residues). It even shares homology with a protein in archaebacteria (35Spirig U. Glavas M. Bodmer D. Reiss G. Burda P. Lippuner V. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 628-637Google Scholar). It is remarkable that the identity shared among these proteins is not restricted to one region but rather is spread out over the entire polypeptide. Sequence analysis also demonstrated that the secondary structure predicted for these homologous proteins is quite similar (17Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Google Scholar). Fig. 2 illustrates the very high conservation of the lumenal domains of Stt3p among different species. It is well established that the active site of OT is located in the ER lumen, and for this reason we focused our attention on the lumenal domain of Stt3p in the ER (37Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Google Scholar). First, on the basis of high conservation, we prepared 21 block mutants consisting of 2–5 residues replaced by Ala residues in an epitope-tagged Stt3p construct (TableII). These mutants were transformed into an stt3 null strain containing wild type STT3 on a URA3 plasmid. First, we used the plasmid shuffling procedure to ask whether these Ala mutations caused loss of function in these mutant stt3p. Out of the 21 mutants, six of them properly functioned and were not further studied. Of the remainder, 14 mutants were lethal, and one mutant was temperature-sensitive (Table II). Next, we determined which of these block mutant proteins were incorporated into the OT complex in cells because, as noted above, mutants that do not make stable proteins or proteins that cannot be incorporated into the OT complex are of very limited value. It is important to note that the 14 lethal mutants also contain the wild type STT3 gene to support the growth, but the temperature-sensitive mutant contained only the mutant stt3p. All of the mutant constructs and the wild type control construct of Stt3p contained the HA tag at their C terminus. Detergent extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies, and the precipitated proteins were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and then followed by Western blot analysis. Using the antibodies available to us, we found that mutants 516–519AAAA, 592–594AAA, and 554–556AAA were assembled into the OT complex and co-immunoprecipitated other OT subunits, including Ost1p, Wbp1p, and Swp1p (Fig. 3). For the temperature-sensitive mutant 554–556AAA, the mutant protein was incorporated into the OT complex at both 25 and 37 °C. Of the remainder, some stt3 proteins were not immunoprecipitated well themselves, and others did not co-immunoprecipitate other OT subunits; these mutants were not further studied.Table IIGrowth phenotype of stt3p block and point mutantsMutantsaThe position of amino acid residues replaced by Ala in Stt3p.Growth phenotypebGrowth phenotype was determined by 5-fluro-orotic acid selection. t.s., temperature-sensitive.487–488AAnormal494–498AAAAAlethal500–504AAAAAlethal506–507AAnormal510–512AAAnormal516–519AAAAlethal529–532AAAAlethal533–536AAAAlethal537–540AAAAlethal541–543AAAlethal547–548AAlethal554–556AAAt.s.557–559AAAnormal565–568AAAAlethal573–575AAAlethal582–584AAAlethal585–587AAAlethal592–594AAAlethal612–614AAAnormal667–668AAnormal678–680AAAlethalW516Yt.s.W517YlethalD518ElethalG520At.s.I593At.s.a The position of amino acid residues replaced by Ala in Stt3p.b Growth phenotype was determined by 5-fluro-orotic acid selection. t.s., temperature-sensitive.

It is very interesting that one of the three block mutants, 516–519WWDY, is in a region that shares the highest sequence similarity among eukaryotic Stt3p and the archaeal proteins (35Spirig U. Glavas M. Bodmer D. Reiss G. Burda P. Lippuner V. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 628-637Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Actually, almost all residues of 516–520WWDYG are conserved in all the archaebacteria proteins (Initially, Gly520 was not included in this block mutation because it was known that G520D and G520S were temperature-sensitive mutants, but later the G520D mutant was included when preparing other point mutants based on the block mutations). It seems reasonable to presume that this level of identity reflects functional importance. In our earlier study,2 it was shown that although when using the Asn-Bpa-Thr tripeptide for photolabeling Ost1p was specifically labeled, this subunit did not contain the peptide glycosylation recognition and/or catalytic domain. Stt3p is in the proximity to Ost1p and is the most conserved subunit of OT. Therefore, if particular residues in Stt3p are involved in glycosylation site recognition and/or the catalytic site, mutation of these residues should abolish labeling of Ost1p by Asn-Bpa-Thr. Microsomes were prepared from these three stt3 block mutants, and photolabeling was carried out using radiolabeled Asn-Bpa-Thr. The results clearly demonstrated that mutant 516–519AAAA and mutant 592–594AAA had drastically reduced labeling of Ost1p (0.115 and 0.200 compared with the wild type control), whereas mutant 554–556AAA had a level of labeling one half of the wild type (Fig. 4, aand b, and Table III). We speculate that 516–520WWDYG forms the binding region for the glycosylation recognition site or serves as the active site of the enzyme. Clearly, when these residues are mutated, Asn-Bpa-Thr cannot be recognized or cannot be positioned at the correct site for glycosylation, and therefore the photolabeling of Ost1p is greatly reduced. The residues 554–556EEK and 592–594RIS are probably not within the active site but instead may be involved in positioning the active site of the enzyme. When they are mutated, a modified enzyme conformation might reduce the binding of the substrate, and therefore the photolabeling of Ost1p would be greatly reduced.Table IIICharacteristics of the stt3 block mutantsMutantGrowth phenotypeaGrowth phenotype was determined by 5-fluro-orotic acid selection. t.s., temperature-sensitive.Relative quantity of immunoprecipitatedbThe relative quantity of immunoprecipitated stt3p and Ost1p was determined by mild detergent immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis.

Open table in a new tab Because these three block mutants had important characteristics, we undertook to prepare 10 single amino acid mutants in which each residue was replaced either by Ala or by Asp in an epitope-tagged STT3construct (TableIV). Five mutants derived from changes of the most conserved region, 516–520WWDYG, displayed the most severe growth defects. Two mutations caused lethality, and the other three were temperature-sensitive. Three point mutations derived from the temperature-sensitive block mutant 554–556EEK caused no growth phenotype, and we did not pursue additional studies with them. As to the block mutant 592–594RIS, we prepared only two single mutations; Ser594 was not included because this residue is not highly conserved. Although I593D was a temperature-sensitive mutant, R592A had no growth phenotype, and it was not studied further.Table IVCharacteristics of point mutantsMutantsGrowth phenotypeaGrowth phenotype was determined by 5-fluro-orotic acid selection. t.s., temperature-sensitive.Relative quantity of immunoprecipitatedbThe relative quantity of immunoprecipitated stt3p and Ost1p was determined by mild detergent immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis.

Open table in a new tab We performed a spotting assay to analyze the growth phenotype of the four temperature-sensitive mutants. As shown in Fig.5, the growth rate for these cells was wild type > Y519A > G520D > I593D > W516A. Next, we examined the incorporation of the six single-residue mutant proteins into the OT complex. The two lethal mutants also contained the wild type STT3 gene to support the growth, but the temperature-sensitive mutants had only their own copy ofstt3. All of the mutant constructs and the wild type control contained the HA tag at their C terminus for immunoprecipitation and could co-immunoprecipitate other OT subunits except G520D (part of the data are shown in Fig. 6 below, also see Table IV). Protein made from the G520D construct was comparable in amount with the wild type, but it could not co-immunoprecipitate other OT subunits well. Interestingly, in genetic screens aimed at the identification of components required for the process ofN-linked glycosylation in the ER, Markus Aebi's group identified more than 50 stt3 alleles, and four of those had a temperature-sensitive phenotype (35Spirig U. Glavas M. Bodmer D. Reiss G. Burda P. Lippuner V. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 628-637Google Scholar). Surprisingly, three of the four mutations affected the same amino acid residue, which was Gly520; two of these were G520D, and one was G520S.Figure 6Temperature-sensitive stt3point mutations cause glycosylation defects.In aand b, microsomes were prepared from each mutant strain and the wild type control. Nondenaturing immunoprecipitation was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples eluted from protein G-agarose beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and followed by Western blot analysis using anti-Ost1p and anti-Wbp1p, respectively. In c, spheroplasts were prepared from each mutant strain and the wild type control. Endo H digestion was performed using these spheroplasts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and followed by Western blot analysis using anti-CPY antibody. The numbersnext to the protein bands indicate estimates of the number of oligosaccharide chains on the protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although these single-residue mutants are incorporated into the OT complex, we wanted to determine whether they could support the photolabeling of Ost1p when using the Asn-Bpa-Thr photoprobe for photoactivation. All of the temperature-sensitive mutants had lower Ost1p photolabeling. Of the two lethal mutants, W517A and D518A exhibited residual labeling of Ost1p (Fig. 4 c and Table IV). These findings support the observations shown earlier with the corresponding block mutant and the idea that 516–520WWDYG may form the recognition and/or catalytic site for glycosylation. Among these five residues, Trp517 and Asp518 are most important because mutation of these two caused lethality. When Trp517and Asp518 were mutated, the cells could not survive without a copy of the wild type gene, and there was only a low level of Ost1p labeling. Residues 516–520WWDYG may well function as the catalytic site rather than merely as the recognition site to which Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser binds. In the two mechanisms proposed earlier for the OT enzymatic reaction (see below), there is a base in the enzyme active site that extracts a proton from either Asn or Thr, thus increasing the nucleophilicity of the carboxamide nitrogen so it can react with the electrophilic lipid-linked oligosaccharide. In this case, Asp518, with the Asp fully ionized, is a perfect candidate for such a base in the enzyme active site. In addition to changing these residues to Ala or Asp, we also changed these residues to somewhat similar residues (Table II). W517Y and D518E were still lethal mutations, and W516Y was temperature-sensitive as well. Therefore, an aromatic ring is not sufficient at position 516 or 517, and the enzyme probably requires the hydrophobicity of the Trp. Trp often serves as a hydrophobic cluster in the conformational properties of proteins, and mutation of this residue could perturb the original conformation (38Evans P.A. Topping K.D. Woolfson D.N. Dobson C.M. Proteins. 1991; 9: 248-266Google Scholar, 39Baldwin R.L. Science. 2002; 295: 1657-1658Google Scholar, 40Klein-Seetharaman J. Oikawa M. Grimshaw S.B. Wirmer J. Duchardt E. Ueda T. Imoto T. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. Schwalbe H. Science. 2002; 295: 1719-1722Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Glu518 could not replace the Asp at all; the extra CH2 renders it nonfunctional. This further demonstrates the importance of this Asp, because it is not only the negative charge but also the chain length that is important. These findings suggest that Asp518 could be in the catalytic site. We also measured the OT activity of these single-residue mutants. We could not directly assay the lethal mutants because they have a wild type copy of STT3. First, the expression of Ost1p, Wbp1p, and CPY was examined in the temperature-sensitive mutants because it has been shown that these proteins are glycosylated (Fig. 6). Ost1p contains four potential glycosylation sites, and usually three or four sites are utilized (11Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 525-536Google Scholar, 26Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Google Scholar). Wbp1p contains two potential glycosylation sites, and one or two are glycosylated (7te Heesen S. Rauhut R. Aebersold R. Abelson J. Aebi M. Clark M.W. Eur. J.

Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Google Scholar). It is clear that the proteins detected by their corresponding antibodies migrated as ladders. These ladders are the different glycoforms of the proteins because they all shifted to one band after deglycosylation with protein glycanase F or Endo H (data not shown for Ost1p and Wbp1p). It is obvious that Ost1p, Wbp1p, and CPY were underglycosylated in the mutant cells. In addition, direct in vitro OT activity assays were performed on the single-residue temperature-sensitive mutants. Compared with the wild type control, extracts prepared from the stt3mutants displayed much lower OT activity (Table IV). This result correlates well with the in vivo underglycosylation of the glycoproteins in these mutants. Clearly, these residues are important in the function of OT, and therefore we investigated their apparent affinity for the substrates. As shown in Fig.7, the level of glycosylated peptide formation was dependent on the substrate concentration. However, at low substrate concentrations, the extracts from the mutant strains exhibited much less product formation when compared with the extract from the wild type strain. Only at high substrate concentrations were the glycosylated products formed in the mutants comparable with the amount formed in the control. Because we had a limited quantity of the radiolabeled substrates, we could not perform OT assays using even higher substrate concentrations. But based on the data obtained these mutant proteins may have a higher K m for the peptide substrates. OT catalyzes the formation of an N–C bond between the amide nitrogen of the asparagine side chain and the C1 position of the N-acetylglucosamine residue of the Dol-PP-oligosaccharide. Although Dol-PP is a reasonable leaving group, it is not clear how the nucleophilicity of the asparagine side chain is enhanced so that it can displace Dol-PP and form theN-glycosidic bond. Besides the asparagine residue, the requirement for a hydroxyl amino acid implies a direct role for the hydroxyl group in catalysis. Bause and Legler (42Bause E. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 639-644Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism in which the hydroxyl group of the serine or threonine in the peptide acts as a hydrogen acceptor, with one of the carboxamide hydrogen atoms of the asparagine side chain as the donor. This is proposed to occur because a basic residue at the enzyme active site abstracts a proton from the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine, and this, in turn removes a proton from the amide. The resulting strong nucleophile would then displace the dolichol pyrophosphate from the C1 position of theN-acetylglucosamine containing oligosaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W2013616695,"Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is a platelet-specific glycoprotein that has been indicated to react with collagen and activate platelets. Its structure was recently identified by cDNA cloning (Clemetson, J. M., Polgar, J., Magnenat, E., Wells, T. N., and Clemetson, K. J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 29019–29024). However, the mechanism of the interaction between collagen and GPVI has not been analyzed in detail because both collagen and GPVI are insoluble molecules. In this study, we expressed the extracellular domain of GPVI as soluble forms as follows: the monomeric form (GPVIex) and the dimeric form of GPVI fused with the human immunoglobulin Fc domain (GPVI-Fc2). Purified GPVIex strongly inhibited convulxin (Cvx)-induced platelet aggregation but only weakly inhibited that induced by collagen-related peptide. However, only GPVI-Fc2, and not GPVIex, inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The dimeric form of GPVI exhibits high affinity for collagen, as concluded from measurements of GPVI binding to immobilized collagen by both the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance methods. GPVI-Fc2 bound to the surface of immobilized collagen with a dissociation constant (K D) of 5.76 × 10−7m, but the binding of GPVIex was too weak to allow estimation of this parameter. Cvx did not inhibit the binding of dimeric GPVI to collagen, indicating that the binding site of GPVI to collagen was different from that to Cvx. Taken together, our data indicate that the high affinity binding site for collagen is composed from two chains of GPVI. Furthermore, they suggest that the binding sites for Cvx are different from the collagen-binding sites and do not need to be formed by two GPVI molecules. Because dimeric GPVI is the only form that shows high affinity to fibrous collagen, our results indicate that GPVI would be present as a dimeric form on the platelet. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance indicated that there is no detectable interaction between soluble collagen and GPVI, supporting our previous observation that GPVI only reacts with fibrous collagen.

Collagen is one of the major components of the vessel wall. When the vessel wall becomes damaged, platelets adhere to and are activated on the exposed collagen surface, leading to thrombus formation. Many proteins on the platelet surface were reported to be putative collagen receptors, but among them, only two glycoproteins have properties consistent with them being relevant collagen receptors under normal physiological conditions: one is glycoprotein (GP) 1The abbreviations used for: GP, glycoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CRP, collagen-related peptide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Cvx, convulxin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PRP, platelet-rich plasma.

A number of studies showed that the binding of collagen, CRP, and Cvx to GPVI induced platelet activation through tyrosine phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ-chain, Syk, phospholipase C, and many other proteins (10Watson S. Berlanga O. Best D. Frampton J. Platelets. 2000; 11: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), thus indicating that GPVI is a key receptor for collagen-induced platelet activation. The cDNA cloning of GPVI revealed that GPVI belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily that contains two C2 immunoglobulin-like domains and an Arg residue in the transmembrane region that makes a salt bridge with the Asp residue of the Fc receptor γ-chain (11Clemetson J.M.

Although its structure was identified, the mechanism for the reaction of GPVI with collagen remains unclear. Our previous results obtained by analyzing platelet binding to fibrous collagen suggested that GPVI is reactive only with fibrous collagen and not reactive with soluble collagen (4Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Moroi M. Jung S.M. Shinmyozu K. Tomiyama Y. Ordinas A. Diaz-Ricart M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, to facilitate the analysis of these complex reactions, we used a simplified model system in which we assessed the collagen binding ability of two forms of the extracellular domain of GPVI. We expressed the extracellular domain of GPVI as the soluble monomeric protein (GPVIex) and the soluble dimer consisting of two molecules of the fusion protein GPVI-Fc domain (from human immunoglobulin) (GPVI-Fc2). The dimeric form, and not the monomeric form, shows high affinity to collagen, and only GPVI-Fc2 inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. These results indicated that the specific conformation with high affinity for fibrous collagen is constructed from two GPVI molecules and thus suggested that GPVI would be present as a dimeric form on the platelet surface, with two GPVI molecules being connected by the Fc receptor γ-chain. The cDNA of GPVI containing the extracellular two Ig domains of human GPVI without the signal sequence (642 bp, residues 21–234 (12Miura Y. Ohnuma M. Jung S.M. Moroi M. Thromb. Res. 2000; 98: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) was obtained by PCR using the GPVI cDNA as the template and the oligonucleotide TTAAGCTTCAGAGTGGACCGCTCCCCAAGC (with theHindIII site underlined) and AATCTAGAGGAATGAGACGGTCAGTTCAGCG (with the XbaI site underlined) as the forward and reverse primer, respectively.Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. The PCR product was purified by using a QIAquick gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan), digested with HindIII andXbaI, purified again, and ligated to the pSecTag vector (Invitrogen). The pSecTag vector contains c-Myc and His tag sequences at the ligation site, and the obtained fusion protein contains these epitopes at its COOH terminus. The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli XL-10 (Stratagene). The obtained construct was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The linker sequence between the Ig κ signal sequence and GPVI was deleted by using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of this plasmid, pGPVI mono, was checked by dideoxy DNA sequencing of the entire coding portion. To prepare a dimeric GPVI, DNA of the human immunoglobulin Fc domain was amplified from pBOS-Fc (14Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar) using AATCTAGAGAGCCCAAATCTTGTGA and AGGGCCCCGGCCGTCGCACTCAT as primers and inserted to the XbaI-ApaI site of pGPVI-mono. This recombinant was designated as pGPVI-Fc. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with the pGPVI mono or pGPVI-Fc vector using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (15Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines expressing recombinant protein monomeric GPVI (GPVIex) and dimeric GPVI-Fc (GPVI-Fc2) were selected in medium containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin. For the purification of GPVI-Fc protein, the culture medium was centrifuged, and the obtained supernatant was applied to a column of protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences). After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), GPVI-Fc2 protein was eluted by ImmunoPure Elution Buffer (Pierce). The eluted fractions were concentrated by using an ULTRAFREE®-15 (Millipore, Marlborough, MA) centrifugal filters and applied to a column of Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). GPVIex was purified using a HiTrap Ni2+-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) and a Superdex 200 column. The NH2-terminal sequence of the recombinant GPVIex protein was confirmed to be DQSGPLPKP by an amino acid sequencer (model 377A, Applied Biosystems). For the assay to determine inhibitory effect against platelet aggregation, samples were dialyzed against HEPES-Tyrode buffer (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 12 mmNaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4). Microtiter wells (ImmunoMax; Nalge Nunc. International K.K., Tokyo, Japan) were reacted with 50 μl of bovine acid-soluble type I collagen (20 μg/ml in 0.9% NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. CRP was immobilized to a React-Bind maleic anhydride-activated polystyrene plate (Pierce) using similar conditions, reacting each well with 50 μl of 20 μg/ml CRP in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed once with PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. For the ELISA, 50 μl of GPVI-Fc2 solutions in blocking buffer were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. After washing extensively with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, 50 μl of 5000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (American Qualex Antibodies, San Clemente, CA) was added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then color was developed using an o-phenylenediamine ELISA kit (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 20–30 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed in triplicate and also repeated with different GPVI preparations. Binding to bovine serum albumin-coated wells was measured as the background value, and each of the binding values was subtracted by this background level. To determine the effect of dimerization of monomeric GPVIex on binding to collagen, GPVIex (final concentration of 1 μm) was preincubated with various concentrations of anti-Myc antibody 9E10 for 30 min and then reacted with immobilized collagen. The binding of cross-linked GPVIex to the collagen surface was measured by assessing the amount of biotinylated Cvx bound to collagen-bound GPVIex. After incubating the reactants with the immobilized collagen for 30 min and washing the wells with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the wells were incubated with 50 μl of biotinylated Cvx (5 μg/ml) for 1 h, washed again, and the bound biotinylated Cvx was detected with a VECTASTAIN® Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The developed color was measured as indicated above. For the GPVIex binding assay, the amount of bound GPVIex was estimated using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 by the above-described method with the following modifications: the amounts of GPVIex bound to immobilized collagen or CRP were estimated by incubating each well with 50 μl of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h, washing again, incubating with 50 μl of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) for 1 h, and color developing as described above. To determine the effects of CRP and Cvx on GPVI-Fc2 binding to collagen, GPVI-Fc2 (20 μg/ml) was preincubated with various concentrations of CRP or Cvx, and the binding to collagen was measured by the above-described ELISA method. Data were expressed as percentages of the control value and presented as the mean value ± S.E. from three independent experiments. Analyses were carried out at 25 °C with the BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using HES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Bovine type I collagen in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, was covalently coupled to a CM5 chip (Biacore) using an Amine Coupling Kit (Biacore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GPVI-Fc2 in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, was also coupled to a sensor chip by the same procedure. Regeneration of the collagen surface was achieved by running 15 μl of 10 mm HCl through the flow cell at 30 μl/min two times. A control surface was reacted with the amine coupling reagent in the absence of ligand and then blocked with ethanolamine. GPVIex and GPVI-Fc2 solutions of several concentrations were perfused over the immobilized collagen at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, and the resonance changes were recorded. The sensorgram of the immobilized-collagen surface was subtracted by that of the control surface, and the data thus obtained were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting of the Langmuir binding isotherm with BIAevaluation software (Biacore). The binding of soluble collagen was measured by injecting soluble bovine type III collagen (50 μg/ml in HES buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20) over the surface of immobilized GPVI-Fc2at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The preparation of soluble bovine type III collagen was described in detail previously (16Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14827-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Whole blood was drawn from the cubital vein of healthy volunteers into 0.1 volume of 3.8% sodium citrate. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained, added with sodium prostaglandin I2 (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) at the final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml, and then centrifuged at 900 ×g for 12 min to isolate the platelets. The obtained platelets were washed once with 6.85 mm citrate, 130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, and 5.5 mmglucose, pH 6.5. Then the washed platelets were finally suspended with HEPES-Tyrode buffer at concentrations of 2–4 × 108platelets/ml. Platelet aggregation was monitored by a whole blood aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Haverton, PA) with stirring at 37 °C using PRP or washed platelets in HEPES-Tyrode buffer. Platelets were activated with CRP (0.2 μg/ml), equine type I collagen (1–2 μg/ml, Chrono-Log), or Cvx (23.8 ng/ml); and the change of transmission was recorded. CRP was synthesized by the method of Mortonet al. (9Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) as previously described (18Moroi M. Jung S.M. Shinmyozu K. Tomiyama Y. Ordinas A. Diaz-Ricart M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linked CRP has a platelet activating activity at concentrations of 0.2 μg/ml or less. Cvx was purified from Crotalus durissus terrificusvenom (Miami Serpentarium Laboratories, Punta Gorda, FL) according to the method described previously (8Francischetti I.M. Saliou B. Leduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cvx was also biotinylated by using sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) as described before (12Miura Y. Ohnuma M. Jung S.M. Moroi M. Thromb. Res. 2000; 98: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Bovine type I and type III collagens were obtained from Koken Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or Immunotech International (Marseilles, France). The extracellular domain of GPVI (residues 21–234) was expressed as the monomeric (Myc-His6) tag fusion protein and as the dimeric human immunoglobulin Fc domain fusion protein. These GPVIs were expressed as secreted soluble proteins using a eukaryotic cell line, HEK 293 cell, which prevented misfolding and any non-glycosylation of the expressed proteins, as occasionally happened when using E. coli. About 2 mg/liter of the recombinant GPVIs were obtained from the culture mediums for both forms of GPVI. The molecular mass of GPVIex is 41 and 42 kDa under non-reduced and reduced conditions in SDS-PAGE, respectively (Fig.1, lanes 3 and 4). GPVI-Fc2 has a molecular mass of 150 and 68 kDa under the non-reduced and reduced conditions in SDS-PAGE, respectively (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2). The molecular mass of the purified GPVI-Fc2 was estimated to be ∼180 kDa from gel filtration (data not shown), confirming that the purified GPVI-Fc2 is present as a dimer. Both biotinylated Cvx (12Miura Y. Ohnuma M. Jung S.M. Moroi M. Thromb. Res. 2000; 98: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and anti-human GPVI monoclonal antibody 204-11 2M. Moroi, J. Mizuguchi, S. Kawashima, M. Nagamatsu, Y. Miura, T. Nakagaki, K. Ito, and S. M. Jung, submitted for publication. recognize native GPVI and recombinant GPVIex and GPVI-Fc2 only under the non-reduced condition, suggesting that these recombinant GPVIs have conformations similar to that of native GPVI (data not shown). Next, we tested the activities of the monomeric and the dimeric forms of GPVI against platelet aggregation. As shown in Fig.2, GPVIex did not inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation even at a high concentration (100 μg/ml), but it did inhibit cross-linked CRP-induced platelet aggregation, although very weakly (Fig.3). In contrast, GPVI-Fc2 at 10 μg/ml strongly inhibited cross-linked CRP-induced platelet aggregation. Cvx-induced platelet aggregation was markedly inhibited by both GPVIex and GPVI-Fc2 at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.56 μm, respectively (data not shown).Figure 3Inhibitory effects of GPVIex and GPVI-Fc2 on CRP-induced platelet aggregation.Inhibitory effects of GPVIex (A) and GPVI-Fc2(B) were analyzed as described in the legend of Fig. 2, except 0.2 μg/ml of cross-linked CRP (CRP-XL) was used as the agonist.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GPVIex did not inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation even at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, but GPVI-Fc2 abrogated collagen-induced platelet aggregation at 20 μg/ml without preincubation (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the two forms of GPVI show different binding affinities to collagen itself and the collagen-mimetic CRP. The binding of monomeric and dimeric GPVIs to immobilized ligands was analyzed by the ELISA method (Fig.4). Both proteins showed dose-dependent and saturable binding to the immobilized-CRP surface (Fig. 4 A). EDTA did not affect the binding of either of the recombinant GPVIs to CRP and collagen (data not shown). Although it is impossible to compare quantitatively the extent of bindings of GPVIex and GPVI-Fc2 because we used different antibodies to detect these proteins, we could not detect any strong binding of GPVIex to type I and type III collagens (Fig. 4 B). Even when the sensitivity was increased by using a longer color-developing time, only a small increase in color development was observed at a high concentration of GPVIex, 400 μg/ml (data not shown). In contrast to GPVIex, the bindings of GPVI-Fc2 to bovine type I and type III collagens were each dose-dependent, becoming saturated at 400 μg/ml (Fig. 4 C). These results also indicated that collagen preferably binds to dimeric GPVI-Fc2. The above results suggested that the dimerization of GPVI may be necessary to induce a specific conformation with a high affinity for collagen. To test this hypothesis, we cross-linked the monomeric GPVIex with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, which enabled us to make dimeric GPVIex because each chain of the antibody could bind to one GPVIex molecule through the Myc tag at its COOH-terminal. Fig. 5 illustrates the effect of dimerization on the affinity of GPVIex for collagen. GPVIex preincubated with 9E10 exhibited enhanced binding to collagen, with the binding enhancement depending on the molar ratio of 9E10 to GPVIex. At the molar ratio of 1:2 (9E10:GPVIex), the binding enhancement was maximum, with a 3.4-fold higher amount of binding than that of GPVIex alone. When the binding of cross-linked GPVIex was compared with that of GPVI-Fc2, from the developed color using the same measuring method, the binding of cross-linked GPVIex corresponded to the amount of binding obtained at about 160 nmGPVI-Fc2, indicating that the binding of the cross-linked GPVIex was about 10–20% of that of GPVI-Fc2 (data not shown). These curves also indicate that an excess amount of 9E10 rather decreases the binding of GPVIex to collagen, which would be explained by a decrease in the amount of dimerized GPVIex at the higher ratio of the antibody to GPVIex, where there is a higher chance for antibody reacting with only one GPVIex molecule, and thus not forming a dimer. These results support the hypothesis that the dimerization of GPVI would be responsible for the high affinity binding of GPVI-Fc2 to collagen and negate the possibility that the high affinity is due to GPVI-Fc2 having a conformation different from that of GPVIex. Because Cvx and CRP were reported to be specific ligands for GPVI, we determined their ability to compete with collagen for the binding to GPVI-Fc2 by the ELISA method. CRP inhibited the binding of GPVI-Fc2 to immobilized collagen in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6 A). The concentration required for 50% inhibition of binding (IC50) was calculated to be 4.3 ± 0.4 μg/ml. However, Cvx did not inhibit the binding of GPVI-Fc2 to collagen but instead enhanced the apparent binding to collagen at low concentrations (Fig.6 B). A possible explanation for the enhancing effect of Cvx can be proposed on the basis of its multiple subunit structure (17Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cvx has multiple binding sites for GPVI, and GPVI binds with Cvx at sites different from the collagen-binding ones. As a result, Cvx would be able to bind multiple molecules of GPVI and thereby help to accumulate more GPVI at the collagen surface. Furthermore, Cvx did not inhibit GPVI-Fc2 binding to collagen, providing further evidence that the Cvx-binding site of GPVI is different from its collagen-binding site. Because the binding to type I collagen was almost completely inhibited by CRP, the collagen-binding site of GPVI may be the same or shared with that for CRP. Kinetic analysis of the binding of collagen and the GPVIs was performed by the SPR method. Collagen and CRP were immobilized on sensor chips under acidic conditions, and the interactions between flowing GPVI-Fc2 or GPVIex and immobilized collagen or CRP were measured under physiological conditions. The sensorgrams at different ligand concentrations were obtained and normalized by subtracting the background signals from the collagen (Fig. 7 A) or CRP (Fig. 7 B) responses. The kinetic data obtained from 3 independent experiments are summarized in TableI. In this table, dissociation constants were obtained by two calculation methods, fromk on and k off and from the equilibrium binding equation using resonance units calculated at the equilibrium. Curve fitting indicated that our data fit better to a two-state model than a one-state one, suggesting that there may be a conformational change of the complex after the initial association of GPVI-Fc2 with collagen (TableII). However, even in the two-state model, the apparent K D values are not substantially different from those of the one-state model, and the transition rate is very small, suggesting a rather small contribution of the transition (conformational change) of the complex to GPVI binding. TheK D value of GPVI-Fc2 indicated that dimeric GPVI has at least 10-fold higher affinity to collagen than CRP. The binding of GPVIex to the collagen surface was so weak that reliable kinetic parameters could not be calculated from the obtained experimental data (Fig. 8 A). In contrast to collagen, the K D value of GPVIex for CRP was measurable, being 8.5 ± 0.1 × 10−5m (Fig. 8 B).Table IKinetic parameters in the one-state modelk aaL+R⇄kdkaL·R;L,ligand;R,receptor.k dK DK D equilibriumm−1s−1s−1mmCRP7.87 ± 3.21 × 1033.22 ± 1.57 × 10−25.27 ± 3.40 × 10−65.26 ± 3.40 × 10−6Collagen8.62 ± 0.66 × 1035.04 ± 0.67 × 10−35.78 ± 0.38 × 10−75.76 ± 0.37 × 10−7a L+R⇄kdkaL·R;L,ligand;R,receptor.

These immobilized collagens would contain some fibrous collagen because the SPR experiment was performed under physiological conditions, after the collagen was first immobilized to the chips under acidic conditions. To analyze the interaction of GPVI with only the soluble form of collagen, we prepared soluble type III collagen as described under the “Experimental Procedures,” and we analyzed the interaction by the SPR method. As shown in Fig.9, the sensorgram indicates that there is no significant interaction of the immobilized GPVI-Fc2 with soluble collagen, although the higher concentrations of soluble collagen could not be tested because only a low concentration of soluble collagen could be obtained. This result clearly indicates that GPVI does not have any significant affinity for soluble collagen, and the interaction between immobilized collagen and GPVI is solely attributable to the interaction with fibrous c"
https://openalex.org/W2025699489,"When cells are challenged by hyperosmotic stress, one of the crucial adaptive responses is the expression of osmoprotective genes that are responsible for raising the intracellular level of compatible osmolytes such as sorbitol, betaine, and myo-inositol. This is achieved by the activation of the transcription factor called OREBP (also known as TonEBP or NFAT5) that specifically binds to the osmotic response element (ORE) or tonicity-responsive enhancer that enhances the transcription of these genes. Here we show that p38, a subgroup of the mitogen-activated kinases activated by hypertonic stress, and Fyn, a shrinkage-activated tyrosine kinase, are both involved in the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. Inhibition of p38 by SB203580 or by the dominant negative p38 mutant partially blocked the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter (reporter gene regulated by ORE). Similarly, hypertonic activation of ORE reporter was partially blocked by pharmacological inhibition of Fyn or by a dominant negative Fyn and was attenuated in Fyn-deficient cells. Importantly, inhibiting p38 in Fyn-deficient cells almost completely abolished the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity, indicating that p38 and Fyn are the major signaling pathways for the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. Further we show that the transactivation domain of OREBP/TonEBP is the target of p38- and Fyn-mediated hypertonic activation. These results indicate a dual control in regulating the expression of the osmoprotective genes in mammalian cells.

These results indicate a dual control in regulating the expression of the osmoprotective genes in mammalian cells. When cells are exposed to hypertonic environment, the immediate effect is the loss of water and increase in the level of electrolytes. The cells adapt to this deleterious situation by gradually replacing the excess electrolytes with compatible osmolytes such as sorbitol, betaine, and myo-inositol (1Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) to preserve the normal cellular functions (2Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N.

The hypertonic induction of these genes is controlled at the transcriptional level, and it is mediated by a common regulatory element called the osmotic response element (ORE) or by the TonE (tonicity-responsive enhancer) (6Rim J.S.

The transcription factor that binds to ORE/TonE, known as OREBP/TonEBP, was identified by yeast one-hybrid assay and affinity chromatography purification (9Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S.

This protein is also called NFAT5 because of its sequence homology with the NFAT family of transcription factors (11Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hypertonicity rapidly induces its phosphorylation and induces its translocation into the nucleus (9Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 10Ko B.C. Turck C.W. Lee K.W. Yang Y. Chung S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This is followed by an increase in the levels of OREBP/TonEBP mRNA and protein (9Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 2000; 270: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP involves phosphorylation of its transactivation domain (TAD) (13Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Persaud P. Zhang Z. Chen Y. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and that this activation can be blocked by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a protein kinase CK2 inhibitor. However, the upstream signaling pathway(s) leading to its activation remains obscure. The osmotic signaling pathway in yeast is better understood. When yeast cells are exposed to hypertonic environment, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, Hog1, is activated (14Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 15Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3555-3563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Yeast hog1 null mutant cells are not viable in hypertonic environment, but the expression of p38, the mammalian homologue of Hog1, allowed them to survive such conditions (14Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). This finding has suggested that p38 may be involved in osmoregulation in mammalian cells. Indeed, p38 was found to be activated by various environmental stresses including osmotic stress (14Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). However, whether p38 is involved in mediating the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP remains controversial. Hypertonic induction of AR, BGT-1, and SMIT gene overexpression has been shown to be abrogated by SB2030580, a potent inhibitor of p38 (21Denkert C. Warskulat U. Hensel F. Haussinger D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Sheikh-Hamad D. Di Mari J. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts B.A. Rouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Whether p38 exerts its effect through OREBP/TonEBP is less clear. One report showed that hypertonic induction of an ORE reporter activity was blocked by SB203580 (23Nadkarni V. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Sheikh-Hamad D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas another report showed that overexpression of a dominant negative form of MKK3, which blocked p38 activation, has no effect on hypertonic ORE reporter activity (24Kultz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Apart from the activation of p38, one of the earliest cellular responses induced by hypertonicity is a dramatic increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation (25Szaszi K. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is mediated at least in part by Fyn kinase (26Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a ubiquitously expressed member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (27Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Fyn is activated by cell shrinkage rather than hypertonicity per se. It is thought to be involved in regulating the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which may have important consequences in altering the gene expression pattern of the cell. In addition, it has been shown that Fyn expression induces phosphorylation of Hic-5, a paxillin-like protein, and its Fyn-mediated phosphorylation is strongly potentiated by hypertonicity (28Ishino M. Aoto H. Sasaski H. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Fyn might represent an alternative pathway in addition to p38 to regulate gene expression in response to extracellular hypertonicity. Consistent with this hypothesis, the participation of tyrosine kinase pathways in ORE induction has been suggested, but the responsible enzyme(s) has not been identified. Therefore, we were interested to determine whether Fyn is involved in the OREBP/TonEBP-mediated hypertonic response. In this report, we show that p38 and Fyn both participate in the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. PP2 and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem.

Dominant negative Fyn vector (pCMV-FynDN) and dominant negative p38α vector (FLAG-p38αAF) were kind gifts from Dr. Marilyn Resh and Dr. Jiahuai Han (The Scripps Research Institute), respectively. Human OREBP cDNA clone KIAA0827 was a gift from Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute). The identities of all of the clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fyn−/− fibroblasts were originally isolated from mouse embryos that were homozygous for disruption in the Fyn gene. The wild type (WT) and Fyn−/−fibroblast cells were immortalized with large T antigen (29Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Sheila M. Thomas (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). NIH 3T3 cells, WT, and Fyn−/−fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C in the presence of CO2(300 mosmol/kg of H2O). Hypertonic medium was prepared by supplementing the growth medium with 100 mm NaCl resulting in a final osmolarity of 500 mosmol/kg of H2O. ORE-SVLuc luciferase reporter constructs containing −1235 to −1104 of the human AR gene, which includes three OREs, was made as described previously (7Ko B.C. Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16431-16437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). pM-TAD fusion proteins were generated by in-frame insertion of the sequence coding for the transactivation domain (amino acids 548–1531) of clone KIAA0827 into GAL4-DNA-BD vector (pM). NIH 3T3, WT, and Fyn−/− were grown in isotonic medium (300 mosmol/kg) in 24-well plates. For ORE activity assay, the cells were transfected with 100 ng of ORE-SVLuc. For OREBP-TAD activity assay, the cells were co-transfected with 300 ng of GAL4-Luc and 600 ng of pM-TAD. In co-transfection experiments, the total amounts of plasmid being transfected were made constant by adjusting with plasmid DNA pBS-KSII (Stratagene). Transfection was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the cells were replaced into isotonic or hypertonic medium. In the experiments, where the effects of inhibitors were studied, the cells were placed into isotonic medium with the inhibitor for 30 min, and then this medium was changed to a hypertonic one containing the inhibitor. 4–6 h after switching the medium, the cells were harvested by addition of 100 μl of passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system. Luciferase activity was expressed in relative light units/μg of total cell protein. Lysates containing equivalent amounts of protein (400 μg) were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min and further processed for immunoprecipitation. The extracts were precleared for 1 h using 40 μl of 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose beads and then incubated with the polyclonal anti-Fyn antibody for overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured using 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose, and the beads were either beads were washed two times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25 mmNa3VO4, pH 7.1) for determination of kinase activity. Kinase activity was measured as the phosphorylation of the Src family-specific substrate peptide Cdc2 (6–20) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the immunocomplexes were incubated with 20 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mmMnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and 10 μl of substrate peptide (0.6 mm stock in H2O), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of manganese/ATP mixture (0.5 mm ATP, 75 mm MnCl2 in reaction buffer) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample. After 20 min at 30 °C, 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid was added, and 25 μl of the mixture was layered on P81 phosphocellulose squares. After extensive washing with 0.85% phosphoric acid, the radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding of radioactivity to the filters was determined in each experiment by measuring the activity of samples to which 10 μl of H2O was added instead of the peptide. The low activity measured in these samples was subtracted as background. Protein extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were diluted with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II apparatus. The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the antibody. The binding of the antibody was visualized by peroxidase-coupled secondary anti-mouse antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence. 20 μg of each total RNA sample was loaded on 1.2% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred onto Hybond-N+membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting in 20× SSC. The membrane was first incubated with prehybridization buffer (7% SDS and 0.25 m sodium phosphate) at 65 °C for 1 h and then with hybridization buffer containing [α-32P]dCTP-labeled mouse AR cDNA probe and incubated at 65 °C for 12 h. After hybridization, the filter was washed with 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C for 50 min and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The filter was then stripped in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 100 °C and rehybridized to an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNA (Clontech, BD Biosciences). To assess whether Fyn is involved in relaying hypertonic signals to activate OREBP/TonEBP, we determined the effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 on the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP using a luciferase reporter gene under the control of ORE (ORE-SVLuc). PP2, a pyrazolopyrimidine derivative, is a potent and specific inhibitor of the Src family of protein kinases (30Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that hypertonicity induced a 14-fold increase in the ORE reporter activity in 4 h. The addition of PP2 caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the hypertonic response of the ORE reporter. When 10 μm of PP2 was used, the reporter activity was reduced to one-third of the maximal level. This tyrosine kinase inhibitor had no effect on the reporter gene activity when cells were cultured in isotonic medium. It also did not affect the reporter gene activity under isotonic or hypertonic conditions when the reporter gene was not under the control of ORE (SVLuc). These results suggested that PP2 specifically inhibits hypertonicity-induced, ORE-mediated transcription. Because PP2 inhibits the activity of other members of the Src family protein kinase besides Fyn (30Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar), a dominant negative Fyn (FynDN) (31Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28371-28378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was used to verify the specific role of this tyrosine kinase in the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. The FynDN contains a point mutation in the ATP-binding site where lysine 299 was replaced by methionine. As a result, the FynDN cannot bind ATP and becomes catalytically inactive (32Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing FynDN (pCMV-FynDN) was co-transfected with ORE-SVLuc. As shown in Fig.2 A, whereas hypertonic induction for 4 h greatly stimulated the ORE-SVLuc activity in mock-transfected cells, co-transfection with increasing amounts of pCMV-FynDN resulted in an incremental reduction in the hypertonicity-induced ORE-Luc activity. Consistent with the results obtained after pharmacological inhibition of Src-type kinases by PP2, FynDN did not affect the ORE-SVLuc activity under isotonic conditions or the SVLuc activity under isotonic and hypertonic conditions. To further explore the requirement of Fyn in hypertonic ORE reporter activity, we utilized a fibroblast cell lines derived from WT or Fyn-deficient (Fyn−/−) mice (29Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with Fyn-specific antibodies confirmed that Fyn is present in the WT cells and not found in the Fyn−/− cells (Fig.2 B). WT and Fyn−/− cells were transfected with ORE-SVLuc, and the hypertonicity-induced ORE reporter activity was determined (Fig. 2 C). Under isotonic conditions the ORE reporter activity was similar in both cell lines. However, there was a 2.3-fold decrease in the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity in the Fyn-deficient cells. On the other hand, hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity was not suppressed in Src-deficient cells (data not shown). Taken together, these findings showed that Fyn plays a significant role in mediating the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity. Although these results showed that Fyn significantly contributes to the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP, inhibition of Fyn by co-transfection of FynDN or in Fyn-deficient cells resulted in only ≈50% reduction in the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity, suggesting the involvement of other signaling pathway(s) in this process. As mentioned earlier, p38 has been implicated in the cellular adaptation to hypertonic stress, but there was also a report that contradicted that interpretation. To determine the contribution of p38 to the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP, first we measured the ORE reporter activity in the presence of SB203580. As shown in Fig.3 A, hypertonicity resulted in a 15-fold increase in ORE reporter activity. The addition of 5 and 10 μm SB203580 elicited a dose-dependent decrease in hypertonic ORE reporter activity suppressing the level of induction to 11- and 5-fold, respectively. The presence of SB203580 did not affect the ORE reporter activity under isotonic conditions, nor did it affect the reporter gene activity, which was not controlled by ORE (SVLuc) under both isotonic and hypertonic conditions. These results confirm the previous findings using SB203580. To substantiate that SB203589 exerted its effect on ORE reporter activity by inhibiting p38 and not by interfering with other pathways, we tested the effect of a dominant negative mutant p38 (p38DN) as well. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in the control experiment where NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with ORE-SVLuc and pCMV-Script, hypertonicity resulted in a 19-fold increase in ORE reporter activity. Co-transfection with ORE-SVLuc and the p38DN (FLAG-p38αAF) resulted in a reduction in hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity to 3.5-fold, confirming the results obtained by SB203580 to inhibit p38. Increasing the dosage of p38DN led to a slightly but not significantly greater decrease in the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity, suggesting that the expression of p38DN sufficiently suppressed the effect of the endogenous p38 even when the lower DNA plasmid concentration was used for transfection. Consistent with the results obtained with SB203580, p38DN affected neither the ORE-SVLuc expression under isotonic conditions nor the SVLuc expression under isotonic and hypertonic conditions. Inhibition of p38 by SB203580 or by p38DN did not completely block the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity. Notably, a 5-fold induction was still observed in the presence of p38 inhibition, and significant residual induction of ORE reporter expression remained after Fyn inhibition. These findings suggest that neither p38 nor Fyn alone is sufficient to fully activate OREBP/TonEBP upon hypertonic induction and support the possibility that both p38 and Fyn are required for the complete induction of ORE reporter activity. To test this hypothesis, the ORE-SVLuc was transfected into WT and Fyn-deficient fibroblasts, and the hypertonic induction of this reporter gene was determined in the presence or absence of SB203580. As shown in Fig.4 A, the addition of SB203580 resulted in an incomplete but marked decrease of hypertonicity-induced ORE reporter activity in the WT fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. Hypertonic induction of ORE reporter in the Fyn−/− fibroblasts was much lower than that of the WT fibroblasts, and the induction of the ORE reporter was further attenuated by the addition of SB203580. Importantly, in Fyn−/− cells, 10 μm of SB203580 almost completely blocked the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter expression. Collectively these results indicate that p38 and Fyn are the major contributors to the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. To determine whether p38- and Fyn-mediated hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP leads to the induction of osmoprotective genes like AR, SMIT, and BGT, WT and Fyn−/− fibroblasts were treated with SB203580, and the expression of AR gene was examined under isotonic and hypertonic conditions. As shown in Fig. 4 B, in the WT cells hypertonicity dramatically increased AR mRNA under hypertonic conditions, and this effect was markedly decreased by 10 μm SB203580. In the Fyn-deficient cells, hypertonic induction of the AR mRNA was less prominent, and the induction was further attenuated in the presence of 10 μm SB203580. None of these treatments affected the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. These results demonstrated that p38- and Fyn-mediated hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP leads to the induction of osmoprotective genes exemplified by AR. Recently, it was shown that hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP is mediated by phosphorylation of its TAD (13Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Persaud P. Zhang Z. Chen Y. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To test whether p38 and Fyn regulate OREBP/TonEBP by modifying its TAD, a chimeric expression vector called pM-TAD was constructed by fusing the TAD of OREBP (amino acid 548–1531) to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain expression vector (pM). When co-transfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing the GAL4-binding site (GAL4-Luc), the activity of the TAD can be quantified by measuring luciferase activity. To test whether Fyn-mediated regulation targets the TAD and activates OREBP/TonEBP in response to extracellular hypertonicity, NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with pM-TAD and increasing amounts of pCMV-FynDN, or the control vector pCMV-Script. As shown in Fig.5 A, there was an 8.6-fold increase in GAL4-Luc reporter activity when cells were exposed to hypertonic conditions. The increase in the reporter activity is attributed to OREBP-TAD because co-transfection of GAL4-Luc with pM, which lacks the TAD, resulted in very low levels of luciferase activity both under isotonic and hypertonic conditions. Co-transfection with increasing amounts of pCMV-FynDN resulted in a progressive reduction of hypertonic reporter activity, indicating that FynDN has an inhibitory effect on TAD activity. The expression of FynDN did not affect the TAD under isotonic conditions, suggesting that activation of TAD by Fyn occurs only under hypertonic conditions. The effect of p38 on TAD was also examined. As shown in Fig. 5 B, co-transfection of increasing amounts of FLAG-p38αAF also resulted in a progressively greater reduction of the hypertonic induction of luciferase reporter activity from 13-fold to a minimum of about 5-fold. Expression of the p38DN had no effect on the luciferase reporter activity when the cells were under isotonic conditions. It is noteworthy that, similar to the results of the experiments on the endogenous OREBP/TonEBP described above, neither the dominant negative Fyn nor the dominant negative p38 mutant alone was able to completely block the transactivation activity of OREBP-TAD. We have demonstrated that both Fyn and p38 are required for the maximal hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. Given that both Fyn and p38 are rapidly activated by hypertonic stress (14Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar,26Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether Fyn and p38 belong to different signaling pathways that converge at OREBP/TonEBP or whether they are elements of the same osmotic signaling cascade. If the latter was the case, inhibition of the upstream kinase should prevent the activation of the downstream member. To distinguish between these two possibilities, hypertonic activation of p38 in Fyn-deficient cells and activation of Fyn in the presence of SB203580 were examined. As shown in Fig. 6 A, using antibodies specific for the activated form of p38 as a probe, a large increase in the phosphorylated p38 was observed in both WT and Fyn−/−fibroblasts 15 min after these cells were induced by hypertonic medium. The pattern of activation of p38 was similar in both cell types, indicating that Fyn deficiency did not affect p38 activation. As shown in Fig. 6 B, using the Src family-specific peptide as substrate, Fyn activity in the NIH 3T3 cells was found to be stimulated by hypertonicity. On the other hand, treatment of cells with 10 μm SB203580 did not reduce hypertonic Fyn activation. Interestingly, we consistently observed that SB203580 increased in Fyn activity under isotonic conditions. The reason for this is not clear at present. Nevertheless, these results indicate that the hypertonic activation of p38 was not affected by the lack of Fyn, and p38 inhibition did not reduce hypertonic activation of Fyn activity, supporting the notion that p38 and Fyn are members of independent signaling pathways, and they act in concert to fully activate OREBP/TonEBP in response to hypertonic stress. AR, BGT-1, and SMIT are a group of genes that are responsible for increasing the levels of cellular osmolytes. Hypertonic stress strongly stimulates the expression of these osmoprotective genes, the products of which serve to raise the intracellular osmolyte concentration, thereby counteracting the deleterious effects of the hypertonic environment. Hypertonic induction of these genes is mediated by the binding of the activated OREBP/TonEBP to ORE/TonE associated with these genes. However, the signaling mechanisms that link the hypertonic challenge to OREBP/TonEBP activation remained to be elucidated. In mammalian cells, hypertonicity activates three mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways: c-Jun N-terminal kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and p38 (21Denkert C. Warskulat U. Hensel F. Haussinger D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Haussinger D. Schliess F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Of these, p38 has been implicated in relaying the hypertonic signal to OREBP/TonEBP because its inhibitor SB203580 reduced the hypertonic induction of AR, BGT-1, and SMIT mRNAs (21Denkert C. Warskulat U. Hensel F. Haussinger D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Sheikh-Hamad D. Di Mari J. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts B.A. Rouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and blocked the hypertonic induction of ORE-regulated reporter gene expression (23Nadkarni V. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Sheikh-Hamad D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, a dominant negative mutant of MKK3, an upstream activator of p38, failed to inhibit the hypertonic induction of an ORE-regulated reporter gene (24Kultz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), casting doubt on the role of p38 in the hypertonic OREBP/TonEBP activation and raising the possibility that SB203580 might have exerted its effect by interfering with other enzymes. In this report, in addition to SB203580, we used p38DN to show that p38 is indeed involved in the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity and presumably in the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. This conclusion was directly confirmed by experiments showing that SB203580 and p38DN also blocked the hypertonic induction of the transactivation activity of the TAD of OREBP/TonEBP. The failure of the dominant negative mutant MKK3 to block the ORE reporter gene activity reported earlier can be explained by the recent discovery that p38 can be activated by interaction with transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1-binding protein 1 as well as by other MKK isoforms (35Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that hypertonic activation of p38 may bypass MKK3 via other MKK isoforms or transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1-binding protein 1. On the other hand, it is also possible that the relative contribution of the p38 and the tyrosine kinase pathways is different in various cell types. Our experiments using SB203580 and p38DN to inhibit p38 have clearly demonstrated that this signaling enzyme is involved in the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. However, the hypertonicity-induced ORE reporter activity was only partially blocked by p38 inhibition, suggesting that other signaling pathways may be involved. Hypertonicity also activates Fyn, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Fyn appears to be is activated by the hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage rather than by hypertonicityper se (26Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because cell shrinkage is an immediate consequence of hypertonic exposure, we examined whether Fyn might also be involved in the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. Using PP2, an inhibitor of the Src kinases, FynDN, and Fyn-deficient cells, we demonstrated that Fyn is indeed involved in the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity via the activation of OREBP/TonEBP. Apparently the nuclear translocation of OREBP/TonEBP under hypertonicity is not affected by the pharmacological inhibition of Fyn nor by Fyn deficiency (Data not shown). Similar to p38, Fyn only contributes to part of the hypertonic OREBP/TonEBP activation, as evidenced by the fact that inhibition of Fyn by PP2 or FynDN and also Fyn deficiency did not completely block the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity. However, inhibiting p38 in Fyn-deficient cells almost entirely abolished the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity and the induction of AR mRNA. These findings indicate that p38 and Fyn are the major signal-relaying pathways for the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. Together these two signaling pathways account for almost the entire hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity. Because p38 is activated by a variety of environmental factors including osmotic stress, oxidative stress, cytokines, growth factors, etc., whereas Fyn is also involved in signal transduction of oxidative stress (36Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21003-21010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 37Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and is activated by osmotic stress, these two kinases may belong to the same signaling pathway. However, we showed that the activation of one was not influenced by the inhibition or the deficiency of the other under hypertonic stress, indicating that these two signaling pathways transmit hypertonic signal to activate OREBP/TonEBP independent of each other. Interestingly, under isotonic conditions, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 activates Fyn activity, suggesting that under isotonic conditions, p38 suppresses Fyn. This suppression is released when cells experience hypertonic stress. At this point it is not clear whether Fyn and p38 act directly or indirectly on OREBP/TonEBP. Recently it was shown that FER, a kinase presumably downstream of Fyn, directly phosphorylates cortactin, a cortical actin-binding protein that is highly phosphorylated in a Fyn-dependent manner when cells are under hypertonic stress. Cortactin is involved in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and may mediate signaling to downstream targets (33Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). FER inhibition mitigates cortactin phosphorylation under hypertonic stress (26Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, we found that the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity was not affected in FER-deficient cells, although the osmotic stress-induced cortactin phosphorylation is reduced to marginal levels. 2A. Kapus, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it appears that the Fyn-mediated hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP does not require FER or cortactin. Fyn may mediate the activation of OREBP/TonEBP via other signaling molecules or it may modify OREBP/TonEBP directly. The Src tyrosine kinases are composed of characteristic functional domains. The SH4 domain is required for lipid modification of the kinase, and it is important for targeting to cellular membrane, whereas the SH3 and SH2 domain are protein-binding domains that determine catalytic activity and substrate specificity. SH3 domain interacts with proteins that contain a consensus sequence of PXXP, and the SH2 domain binds to short contiguous amino acid sequences containing phosphotyrosine. Interestingly, there are five potential SH3-binding domains in the TAD of OREBP/TonEBP, suggesting that Fyn might modify OREBP/TonEBP directly. It is still not known whether p38 directly phosphorylates OREBP/TonEBP. Because a number of the transcription factors including the activating transcription factor, CHOP/GADD153 (growtharrest and DNA damage), several cAMP response element-binding proteins, ELK-1, Ets-1, MAX, MEF-2A, MEF-2C, NF-κB, and heat shock transcription factor 1, were shown to be phosphorylated by p38, it is conceivable that OREBP/TonEBP is directly phosphorylated by p38. In conclusion, we show that p38 and Fyn are involved in the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. Furthermore, inhibiting p38 in Fyn-deficient cells almost completely abolished the hypertonic induction of ORE reporter activity, indicating that p38 and Fyn are the major signaling pathways for the hypertonic activation of OREBP/TonEBP. In addition, we show that the transactivation domain of OREBP/TonEBP is the target of p38- and Fyn-mediated hypertonic activation. These results indicate a dual control in regulating the expression of the osmoprotective genes in mammalian cells. We thank Dr. D. Y.

https://openalex.org/W2091797618,"Despite the importance of glucocorticoids in suppressing immune and inflammatory responses, their role in enhancing host immune and defense response against invading bacteria is poorly understood. We have demonstrated recently that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae(NTHi)-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), an important TLR family member that has been shown to play a critical role in host immune and defense response. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of TLR2 induction still remain unknown. Here we show that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 expression via specific up-regulation of the MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) that, in turn, leads to dephosphorylation and inactivation of p38 MAPK, the negative regulator for TLR2 expression. Moreover, increased expression of TLR2 in epithelial cells greatly enhances the NTHi-induced expression of several key cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukins 1β and 8, thereby contributing significantly to host immune and defense response. These studies may bring new insights into the novel role of glucocorticoids in orchestrating and optimizing host immune and defense responses during bacterial infections and enhance our understanding of the signaling mechanisms underlying the glucocorticoid-mediated attenuation of MAPKs.

These studies may bring new insights into the novel role of glucocorticoids in orchestrating and optimizing host immune and defense responses during bacterial infections and enhance our understanding of the signaling mechanisms underlying the glucocorticoid-mediated attenuation of MAPKs. In the host innate immune system, the surface epithelial cells, situated at the interface with the environment, are continually confronted with microbes and thereby act as the first line of host defense against pathogenic bacteria (1Krutzik S.R. Sieling P.A. Modlin R.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 104-108Google Scholar, 2Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 452-456Google Scholar). They recognize the microbial pathogens by a set of germ line-encoded receptors that are referred as pattern-recognition receptors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; DEX, dexamethasone; GR, glucocorticoids receptor; NTHi, nontypeable H. influenzae ; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP-1, MAPK phosphatase-1; MKK, MAPK kinase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; RT, reverse transcription; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase function as the major epithelial pattern-recognition receptors in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (3Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Google Scholar). Activation of TLRs, in turn, leads to induction of direct antimicrobial effector pathways that can result in elimination of the invading pathogens (4Thoma-Uszynski S. Stenger S. Takeuchi O. Ochoa M.T. Engele M. Sieling P.A. Barnes P.F. Rollinghoff M. Bolcskei P.L. Wagner M. Akira S. Norgard M.V. Belisle J.T. Godowski P.J. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Science. 2001; 291: 1544-1547Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of TLRs also induces the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and the release of cytokines that instruct the acquired immune response (5Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Google Scholar). TLRs are a family of closely related type I transmembrane proteins that resemble the mammalian IL-1 receptor (6O'Neil L.A. Dinarello C.A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 206-209Google Scholar, 7Means T.K. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Life Sci. 2000; 68: 241-258Google Scholar). To date, 10 members of the human TLR family have been cloned. Among these, TLR2 has been shown to mediate responses to a variety of Gram-positive products, including peptidoglycan, lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoarabinomannan. In addition, our recent study demonstrated that TLR2 also plays an important role in activation of inflammatory and immune responses by lipoprotein from the Gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) (8Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar), a major cause of otitis media, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and bacterial meningitis (11Quagliarello V.J. Scheld W.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 708-716Google Scholar, 12Niewoehner D.E. Erbland M.L. Deupree R.H. Collins D. Gross N.J. Light R.W. Anderson P. Morgan N.A. N. Engl. J.

The importance of TLR2 in host defense was further demonstrated by the studies from knockout mice showing decreased survival of TLR2-deficient mice after infection with Gram-positiveStaphylococcus aureus (9Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that TLR2 plays a crucial role in host defense against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. In contrast to its relatively higher expression in lymphoid tissues, TLR2 is, however, expressed at low levels in epithelial cells. Interestingly, our recent studies revealed that TLR2, although expressed at very low levels in unstimulated human epithelial cells, is greatly up-regulated by NTHi via a positive IKKβ-IκBα-dependent NF-κB pathway and a negative MKK3/6-p38α/β pathway (10Shuto T. Imasato I. Jono H. Xu H. Watanabe T. Kai H. Andalibi A. Linthicum F. Guan Y.L. Han J. Cato A.C. Akira S. Lim D.J. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17263-17270Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids are highly effective in the control of many inflammatory and immune diseases. Their effects are exerted by binding to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which belongs to the family of steroid hormone receptors. Despite the importance of glucocorticoids in suppressing immune and inflammatory responses, their role in enhancing host immune and defense response against invading bacterial pathogens is, however, poorly understood. Moreover, in addition to their wide use in the treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases, adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy has also been used in a variety of bacterial infections, including bacterial meningitis caused by H. influenzae, otitis media, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (11Quagliarello V.J. Scheld W.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 708-716Google Scholar, 12Niewoehner D.E. Erbland M.L. Deupree R.H. Collins D. Gross N.J. Light R.W. Anderson P. Morgan N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1941-1947Google Scholar, 13Butler C.C. van Der Voort J.H. Arch. Pediatr. Adolesc. Med. 2001; 155: 641-647Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the beneficial effect of glucocorticoids in bacterial infections still remains unclear. Because of the importance of glucocorticoids in the treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases as well as bacterial infections, we recently investigated the effect of glucocorticoids on NTHi-induced TLR2 expression. Surprisingly, in contrast to their potent anti-inflammatory effect, glucocorticoids synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 expression. Thus, these data suggest that glucocorticoids may not only suppress but also enhance host immune and defense response and may explain the beneficial effect of glucocorticoids in certain bacterial infections. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-mediated synergistic enhancement of TLR2 are still unknown as is the physiological relevance of TLR2 up-regulation. Here, we show that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance the NTHi-induced TLR2 expression via specific up-regulation of the MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) (14Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Google Scholar), which, in turn, leads to dephosphorylation and inactivation of p38 MAPK, the negative regulator for TLR2 expression. Moreover, increased expression of TLR2 in epithelial cells also greatly enhance the NTHi-induced expression of several key cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8, thus demonstrating the physiological relevance of TLR2 up-regulation in bacterial pathogenesis. These studies, although rather unexpected, may provide novel insights into the role of glucocorticoids in orchestrating and optimizing host defense and innate immune responses and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for modulating innate immune and inflammatory responses for bacterial infections. Ro-31-8220 and orthovanadate were purchased fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Dexamethasone and RU486 were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). NontypeableH. influenzae (NTHi) strain 12, a clinical isolate, was used in this study. For making NTHi crude extract, NTHi were harvested from a plate of chocolate agar after overnight incubation and incubated in 30 ml of brain heart infusion broth supplemented with NAD (3.5 μg/ml). After overnight incubation, NTHi were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The resulting pellet of NTHi was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Subsequently, the lysate was collected and stored at −70 °C. NTHi whole cell lysate was used in all the experiments, unless otherwise indicated. We chose to use NTHi lysates because of the following reasons: First, NTHi has been shown to be highly fragile and has the tendency to autolyze. Its autolysis can be triggered in vivo under various conditions, including antibiotic treatment (16Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Google Scholar). Therefore, using lysates of NTHi represents a common clinical condition in vivo, especially after antibiotic treatment. Human cervix epithelial cell line HeLa was maintained as described previously (8Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Primary human airway epithelial cells (NHBE) (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) were maintained in Bronchial Epithelial Basal Medium (Clonetics) following the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA was isolated from human epithelial cells using a Qiagen kit (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. For the RT reaction, the Moloney murine leukemia virus pre-amplification system (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) was used. PCR amplification was performed with Taq gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster City, CA).

Total RNA was isolated from human epithelial cells as described above. For the RT reaction, TaqMan Reverse Transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used. Briefly, the RT reaction (final volume of total 50 μl) was conducted for 60 min at 37 °C followed by 60 min at 42 °C using oligo-dT and random hexamers. PCR amplification was performed with TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). In brief, reactions were performed in duplicate containing 2× Universal PCR Master Mix, 2 μl of template cDNA, 200 nm TLR2 primers (5′-GGCCAGCAAATTACCTGTGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGCGGACATCCTGAACCT-3′) and 100 nm TLR2 probe (5′-TCCATCCCATGTGCGTGGCC-3′), in a final volume of 25 μl, and were analyzed in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). TLR2 primers and probes were synthesized by the Applied Biosystems Custom Oligo Synthesis Service. Probes include a fluorescent reporter dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), on the 5′-end and labeled with a fluorescent quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA), on the 3′-end to allow direct detection of the PCR product. Reactions were amplified and quantified using an ABI 7700 sequence detector and manufacturer's software (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantity of TLR2 mRNA was obtained using the Comparative CT Method and was normalized using Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Reagent Human Cyclophilin as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems) (for details, see user Bulletin #2 for the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, available at www.appliedbiosystems.com/support/tutorials). Briefly, the TaqMan software (Applied Biosystems) was used to calculate a C t value for each reaction, where theC t value is the point in the extension phase of the PCR reaction that the product is distinguishable from the background. The C t values were then normalized for TLR2 amplification by subtracting the C tvalue calculated for cyclophilin, an endogenous control for the amount of mRNA from the same sample, to obtain a C tusing the following equation: C t TLR2 −C t cyclophilin = C t. The NTHi- or other inducer-dependent -fold induction of TLR2 was calculated relative to the C t value obtained in the unstimulated cells. The normalized TLR2 expression was thus expressed as the relative quantity of TLR2 mRNA (-fold induction). The mRNAs of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 were measured using pre-developed assay reagent kits (Applied Biosystems) and were then normalized similarly to TLR2. The expression plasmids hTLR2 and MKK6 were previously described (8Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Google Scholar). The expression plasmid of the wild-type MKP-1 was kindly provided by Dr. N. Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) (14Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Google Scholar). The antisense full-length MKP-1 construct was described previously (15Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Google Scholar). All transient transfections were carried out in duplicate for RT-PCR analysis using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Panvera, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instruction, unless otherwise indicated. In all transfections with expression plasmids of signaling molecules, an empty vector was used as a control. To detect MKP-1 up-regulation at the protein level, Western blot analysis was carried out using an antibody against human MKP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). To assess phosphorylation of p38 and MKK3/6, Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies against phospho-p38 (Thr-180/182), p38, phospho-MKK3/6, and MKK3/6 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Phosphorylation of p38 and MKK3/6 were detected as described previously (10Shuto T. Imasato I. Jono H. Xu H. Watanabe T. Kai H. Andalibi A. Linthicum F. Guan Y.L. Han J. Cato A.C. Akira S. Lim D.J. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17263-17270Google Scholar, 16Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation likely via negative cross-talk with the p38 MAPK pathway (10Shuto T. Imasato I. Jono H. Xu H. Watanabe T. Kai H. Andalibi A. Linthicum F. Guan Y.L. Han J. Cato A.C. Akira S. Lim D.J. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17263-17270Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids inhibit NTHi-induced p38 activation that, in turn, leads to enhancement of TLR2 induction, we first reconfirmed the effect of the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, dexamethasone, on NTHi-induced TLR2 expression in the presence or absence of SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK. As we showed previously, dexamethasone alone synergistically enhanced NTHi-induced TLR2 expression (Fig.1 A). However, dexamethasone no longer greatly enhanced NTHi-induced TLR2 expression if the cells were already pretreated with SB203580, thus confirming that glucocorticoids may enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 expression via inhibition of p38, the negative regulator for TLR2 induction. We next sought to investigate whether dexamethasone inhibits NTHi-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by directly inhibiting p38 MAPK or its upstream kinases MKK3/6 (16Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, dexamethasone inhibited NTHi-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but not MKK3/6, indicating that inhibition of NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation by glucocorticoids occurs at the level of p38 itself. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was blocked by the GR antagonist RU486 at an equimolar concentration, suggesting the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (17Subramaniam N. Treuter E. Okret S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18121-18127Google Scholar, 18Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Google Scholar). Similar to NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of p38 induced by overexpression of a constitutively active form of MKK6 (MKK6b(E)), an immediate upstream activator of p38 (19Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Google Scholar, 20Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Google Scholar, 21Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar), was also inhibited by dexamethasone, implicating that the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone may be also applied to p38 phosphorylation activated by other p38 inducers in addition to bacterium NTHi (Fig. 1 C). Together, these data demonstrate that inhibition of p38 activation by dexamethasone occurs at the level of p38 MAPK, downstream of MKK3/6. We next sought to determine whether direct interaction between p38 MAPK and GR is involved in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of p38 phosphorylation. Interestingly, GR was not found to be directly associated with p38 MAPK (data not shown) as assessed by performing immunoprecipitation experiment using antibody against p38, followed by immunoblot analysis using antibody against GR, or vice versa. Thus, the molecular mechanism underlying GR-mediated inhibition of p38 appears to be independent of a direct physical interaction between GR and p38. To determine the possible involvement of de novo protein synthesis in the action of dexamethasone, we then assessed the effect of dexamethasone on NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation and TLR2 up-regulation in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation was antagonized by cycloheximide, suggesting the requirement for new protein synthesis in the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of p38 activation (Fig.2 A). In accordance with these results, dexamethasone-mediated enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 expression was also inhibited by cycloheximide (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, it is clear that de novo protein synthesis is involved in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation and the subsequent enhancement of TLR2 expression. Based on the evidence for the involvement of new protein synthesis in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of p38 activation and enhancement of TLR2 expression, it is logical that glucocorticoids may inhibit p38 activation by either down-regulating the expression of p38 protein or up-regulating the inhibitors for p38 phosphorylation and activation. To test the first possibility, we evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on p38 expression at the protein level. As evidenced in Fig. 3 A, the expression of p38 protein was not affected by dexamethasone. As expected, no change was observed in MKK3 expression upon dexamethasone treatment. These results have thus led us to investigate whether dexamethasone up-regulates the expression of inhibitors for p38 phosphorylation. Because protein phosphatases have been shown to play an important role in dephosphorylating p38 (15Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Google Scholar, 21Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar), we therefore examined whether protein phosphatases are involved in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of p38 phosphorylation. We first evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation in the presence of a protein phosphatase inhibitor, orthovanadate. As shown in Fig. 3 B, glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of p38 phosphorylation was blocked by orthovanadate, thus suggesting the involvement of protein phosphatases. In review of the known protein phosphatases for p38, a novel class of dual specificity phosphatases, collectively termed MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), represents a major group of protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate and inactivate p38 MAPK (14Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Google Scholar, 15Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Google Scholar, 21Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar). To determine whether glucocorticoids up-regulate the expression of MKPs, we next evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on expression of MKPs at the mRNA level by performing RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, dexamethasone strongly up-regulates MKP-1, but not MKP3, -5, and -7, and the up-regulating effect of dexamethasone was antagonized by RU486 (Fig. 3 C). Consistently, up-regulation of MKP-1 by dexamethasone was also observed at the protein level as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 D). Thus, it is evident that glucocorticoids indeed up-regulate the expression of MKP-1, a known inhibitor for p38 phosphorylation. To determine whether MKP-1 is involved in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation and the subsequent enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 expression, we investigated the effect of overexpressing wild-type MKP-1 on NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation and TLR2 up-regulation in the absence of dexamethasone. Similar to dexamethasone, overexpression of MKP-1 abolished NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation (Fig.4 A). Likewise, NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation was also greatly enhanced by overexpressing MKP-1 (Fig. 4 B), completely mimicking the enhancing effect of dexamethasone. These results strongly suggest an important role for increased MKP-1 expression in glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation and TLR2 expression. To further confirm the requirement of MKP-1 in glucocorticoid-mediated synergistic enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation, we first assessed the effect of Ro-31-8220, a chemical inhibitor for MKP-1 expression (22Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Google Scholar), on dexamethasone-induced MKP-1 up-regulation. As expected, Ro-31-8220 indeed inhibited glucocorticoid-induced up-regulation of MKP-1 expression (Fig.5 A). We next sought to determine whether Ro-31-8220 also blocks the dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation and enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 expression. As shown in Fig. 5 B, dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of p38 phosphorylation was abolished by Ro-31-8220. Similarly, dexamethasone-mediated synergistic enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 expression was also greatly inhibited by Ro-31-8220 (Fig. 5 C). To further confirm whether the up-regulation of MKP-1 expression by glucocorticoids is necessary for the enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 expression, we investigated the effect of overexpressing an antisense full-length MKP-1 construct on the glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of TLR2 induction (15Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of the antisense MKP-1 construct inhibited the dexamethasone-mediated enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 expression (Fig. 5 D). Collectively, our data demonstrated that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 expression via up-regulation of MKP-1 that, in turn, leads to dephosphorylation and inactivation of p38, a negative regulator for TLR2 expression. Having demonstrated that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 expression via MKP-1-dependent inhibition of p38 MAPK, the physiological relevance of TLR2 up-regulation in epithelial cells is, however, still unclear. Because of the importance of TLR2 in NTHi-induced inflammatory and immune response, we hypothesized that up-regulated TLR2 in human epithelial cells plays an important role in enhancing NTHi-induced expression of key cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of overexpression of wild-type TLR2 on NTHi-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 at the mRNA levels by performing real-time quantitative PCR analysis. As shown in Fig.6, NTHi-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 was greatly enhanced by overexpression of TLR2, thereby demonstrating that up-regulation of TLR2 does play an essential role in NTHi-induced inflammatory and immune response. Our studies reveal a previously unknown signaling mechanism by which glucocorticoids synergistically enhance the NTHi-induced expression of TLR2 via specific up-regulation of MKP-1 that, in turn, leads to dephosphorylation and inactivation of p38 MAPK, the negative regulator for TLR2 expression. Moreover, increased expression of TLR2 in epithelial cells greatly enhance the NTHi-induced expression of key cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8, thus contributing significantly to host immune response (Fig.7). Despite the importance of glucocorticoids in suppressing immune and inflammatory responses, their role in enhancing host immune and defense response against invading bacterial pathogens is poorly understood (23Wilckens T. De Rijk R. Immunol Today. 1997; 18: 418-424Google Scholar, 24Wilckens T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 193-197Google Scholar, 25Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Google Scholar, 26Cato A.C. Wade E. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 371-378Google Scholar, 27Webster J.C. Cidlowski J.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 396-402Google Scholar). Moreover, the molecular basis for the beneficial role of glucocorticoids in the treatment of bacterial infections such asH. influenzae-induced bacterial meningitis also remains unclear. In this study, we reported that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance the expression of TLR2, an important member of the TLR family that has been shown to play a crucial role in host immune and defense response, as evidenced by the studies from knockout mice showing decreased survival of TLR2-deficient mice after infection with Gram-positive S. aureus (9Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that glucocorticoids may not only suppress but also enhance host immune and defense response. In addition, our study may also provide molecular basis for the explanation of the beneficial role of glucocorticoids in certain bacterial infections. What are the molecular mechanisms by which the glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of TLR2 contributes to host immune and defense response? Given the fact that the TLR2 expression is low in unstimulated epithelial cells, the synergistic enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 expression by glucocorticoids will probably contribute to the accelerated immune response by epithelial cells as well as resensitization of epithelial cells to invading pathogens. If so, up-regulation of TLR2 may be one of the positive immune-regulatory mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid-mediated host defense against many bacterial pathogens. Therefore, our study may bring new insights into the novel role of glucocorticoids in orchestrating and optimizing immune functions, including host defense during bacterial infections (23Wilckens T. De Rijk R. Immunol Today. 1997; 18: 418-424Google Scholar, 24Wilckens T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 193-197Google Scholar). Although p38 MAPK has been identified as a target for negative regulation by glucocorticoids (28Lasa M. Brook M. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar), the signaling pathway that mediates the down-regulation of p38 by glucocorticoids still remains unclear. Our finding that glucocorticoids inhibit the NTHi-induced phosphorylation and activation of p38 via up-regulation of MKP-1 expression should enhance our understanding of the signaling mechanisms underlying the glucocorticoid-mediated attenuation of MAPKs. In addition to p38, two of the other important MAPK family members, JNK and ERK1/2, have also been identified as targets for negative regulation by glucocorticoids (29Kassel O. Sancono A. Kratzschmar J. Kreft B. Stassen M. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7108-7116Google Scholar, 30Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Google Scholar, 31Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Google Scholar, 32Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402Google Scholar). Unlike the involvement of MKP-1 in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of p38, glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of JNK does not require any de novo protein synthesis (30Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Google Scholar). In contrast, the inhibition of ERK1/2 by glucocorticoids does involve new protein synthesis, similar to the inhibition of p38 (29Kassel O. Sancono A. Kratzschmar J. Kreft B. Stassen M. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7108-7116Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling mechanisms underlying the regulation of MAPKs by glucocorticoids are, somehow, diverse. The molecular mechanisms underlying p38-mediated inhibition of TLR2 induction are still unknown. Because the human TLR2 promoter contains multiple transcription factor binding elements, including Sp1 and Ets-1, and both Sp1 and Ets-1 have been shown to be regulated by p38 signaling pathway (33Haehnel V. Schwarzfischer L. Fenton M.J. Rehli M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5629-5637Google Scholar, 34Ma W. Lim W. Gee K. Aucoin S. Nandan D. Kozlowski M. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13664-13674Google Scholar, 35Tanaka K. Oda N. Iwasaka C. Abe M. Sato Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 235-244Google Scholar), it is likely that p38-dependent activation of these transcription factors may be involved in p38-mediated inhibition of TLR2 induction. In addition, because TLR2 promoter also contains some uncharacterized regulatory elements (33Haehnel V. Schwarzfischer L. Fenton M.J. Rehli M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5629-5637Google Scholar), these elements may also play a role in transcriptional inhibition of TLR2. Moreover, based on a previous report (36Kusuhara M. Takahashi E. Peterson T.E. Abe J. Ishida M. Han J. Ulevitch R. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 824-831Google Scholar) that p38 negatively regulates ERK1/2 activity and our recent data 2A. Imasato and J. D. Li, unpublished results. that demonstrate the positive involvement of ERK1/2 in NTHi-induced TLR2 expression, it is possible that p38 may mediate inhibition of TLR2 induction via negative cross-talk with ERK1/2 pathway. Finally, it is also likely that activation of p38 may be negatively involved in TLR2 induction through down-regulation of additional, as yet unidentified, positive signaling pathways. In this study, we have shown that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance the NTHi-induced TLR2 expression via specific up-regulation of MKP-1. However, it should be noted that a direct transcriptional activation of TLR2 by glucocorticoids may also partly contribute to the synergistic enhancement of TLR2, because inhibition of MKP-1 by Ro-31-8220 or overexpressing the antisense MKP-1 construct does not completely abolish the synergistic enhancement of TLR2 and glucocorticoids alone also yield severalfold induction of TLR2 expression. Recent success in cloning the regulatory region of human TLR2 will help to elucidate the detailed transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in TLR2 regulation (33Haehnel V. Schwarzfischer L. Fenton M.J. Rehli M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5629-5637Google Scholar). In addition, future studies will also focus on identifying other positive signaling pathways involved in TLR2 induction that cannot be inhibited by glucocorticoids. Finally, the molecular mechanisms underlying p38-mediated inhibition of TLR2 induction will also be further investigated. These studies may lead to novel therapeutic intervention for modulating host defense and innate immune and inflammatory responses in bacterial infections. We are grateful to Dr. N. Tonks for MKP-1 expression plasmid and to Dr. Xin Lin and Hirofumi Jono for comments on the manuscript. T. Shuto is thanked for excellent assistance with some early experiments."

Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that each Fn-binding protein is distributed in a particular group of M serotype (7Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Timmis K.N.

M1 and M49 organisms express FbaA, whereas M6 and M12 organisms retain protein F1/SfbI, and M4 and M28 strains produce both proteins. On the other hand, M3 and M18 organisms do not possess FbaA as well as protein F1/SfbI and SfbII/SOF (7Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Mol.

M3 is a major serotype that has been isolated throughout the world from patients with TSLS and other severe invasive diseases (14Stevens D.L. Tanner M.H. Winshop J. Swarts R. Ries K.M.

Myouga F. Kawabata H. Yamai S. Watanabe H. J. Infect.

First, an LPXTG motif known to be the cell-anchoring sequence in Gram-positive cocci (21Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1603-1605Google Scholar) has emerged as a target for the identification of new potential surface proteins using the genome sequencing data bases, with the result that GRAB (22Rasmussen M. Müller H. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Google Scholar), Sc1A (23Rasmussen M. Edén A. Björck L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6370-6377Google Scholar), Sc1B (24Whatmore A.M.

Furthermore, various functional motifs among the eukaryotic and prokaryotic species have been added to the protein data bases. Here we report investigation of a novel Fn-binding protein specific for serotype M3 and M18 strains isolated from patients with TSLS in the complete genome data base of the M3 strain using biochemical and bioinformatics approaches. GAS strains were isolated from patients with pharyngitis and TSLS (25Murakami J. Kawabata S. Terao Y. Kikuchi K. Totsuka K. Tamaru A. Katsukawa C. Moriya K. Nakagawa I. Morisaki I. Hamada S. Epidemiol. Infect. 2002; 128: 397-404Google Scholar) and were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (THY). For antibiotic selection, erythromycin (10 μg/ml) or kanamycin (300 μg/ml) was added to THY medium. Escherichia coli strains XL-10 Gold (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and BL21 (Novagen, Madison, WI) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Sigma) or on LB agar plates. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), erythromycin (250 μg/ml), and kanamycin (30 μg/ml). Relevant characteristics of bacterial strains used in this study are listed in TableI. A human laryngeal epithelial cell line, HEp-2 (ATCC CCL23), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2and 95% air.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain and plasmidRelevant characteristicsRef.S. pyogenesstrainsSSI-1M type 3; isolated from patient with TSLSaStreptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome.T.

Open table in a new tab Chromosomal DNA from GAS was purified with a Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MI), and transformation of GAS by electroporation was performed as described previously (26Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 556-586Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA preparation, transformation of E. coli, and PCR were done as described previously (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was done using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The complete genome sequence of GAS strain SSI-1 (M3, isolated from a patient with TSLS in Japan) was obtained from the genome data base at Osaka University (genome.gen-info.osaka-u.ac.jp/bacteria/spyo/). Potential ORFs were initially identified using GeneWorks version 2.4 (IntelliGenetics, Campbell, CA), and ORF data were analyzed by PSI- and PHI-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), whereas the prediction of signal sequence was performed using the WWW Signal Scan Service (bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/signal/) as described previously (28von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Google Scholar). The protein was separated by SDS-7.5% PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and then destained with 40% methanol. After washing with distilled water, N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed by Edman degradation using an ABI protein sequencer model 491HT (Applied Biosystems). An FbaB expression vector was constructed as follows, and primers used in this study are listed in Table II. ThefbaB gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA of GAS strain SSI-1, and the PCR fragment was cloned into pQE30 vector (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). A recombinant FbaB (rFbaB) protein corresponding to amino acid positions 33–734 of FbaB (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AB084272) was made, which was eliminated from the N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal cell-anchoring region. rFbaB was purified using a QIAexpress protein purification system (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit polyclonal anti-FbaB serum was prepared as described previously (12Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Google Scholar) and was collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Western blotting was performed using 8 m urea extracts of GAS as described previously (29Hamada S. Horikoshi T. Minami T. Kawabata S. Hiraoka J. Fujiwara T. Ooshima T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4161-4167Google Scholar).Table IIPrimers used in this studyDesignationSequence (5′ to 3′)Ref.Expression of recombinant proteinN34-BamHIGAGGATCCGTAGGACATGCGGAAACAAGAThis studyN734-SalIGACAGTCGACTTAACATGATGATAGGCGThis studyConstruction of fbaB-deficient mutant strainsfbaBKO1GTGCCACAAGATACAAACTTACAGGCAGThis studyfbaBKO2CATCAATAGGCTTACTATCTTCTCCCTCThis studyDistribution of the fbaB genefbaBD1GTTAAGCTTCCTGTTATCCCThis studyfbaBD2CATGATGATAGGCGTTTTTTGGThis study Open table in a new tab The PCR product of an internal portion of fbaB was ligated into pSF151 vector (30Tao L. LeBlanc D.J. Ferretti J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 120: 105-110Google Scholar). Primers for mutagenesis are listed in Table II. The resultant plasmid pYT1185 was transformed into strain SSI-1 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing strain SSI-1G by electroporation, and the inactivated mutant strains were selected on kanamycin-containing agar plates. The EGFP expression GAS strain was constructed as described previously (31Nakagawa I. Nakata M. Kawabata S. Hamada S. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 395-405Google Scholar). Ligand blotting of Fn was performed as described previously (13Natanson S. Sela S. Moses A.E. Musser J.M. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 871-878Google Scholar). Briefly, human Fn (Invitrogen) was biotinylated using an ECL protein biotinylation module (AmershamBiosciences), and the concentration was adjusted to 10 μg/ml. rFbaB and 8 m urea extracts of GAS strains were electrophoresed in a 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight with 10% membrane blocking agent (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C and then incubated with biotinylated Fn for 1 h and horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin at room temperature for 1 h. Bands were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by autoradiography with an x-ray film (Fuji photo film, Kanagawa, Japan) at room temperature for 5 s. For measuring the binding ability of FbaB, ELISA was performed as described previously (32Massey R.C. Kantzanou M.N. Fowler T. Day N.P.J. Schofield K. Wann E.R. Berendt A.R. Höök M. Peacock S.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 839-851Google Scholar, 33Beckmann C. Waggoner J.D. Harris T.O. Tamura G.S. Rubens C.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2869-2876Google Scholar). Fn at 1 or 10 μg/ml was coated onto 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Nalge-Nunc, Naperville, IL) and left overnight at 4 °C. For blocking, 5% BSA was applied at 37 °C for 3 h. rFbaB was added and bound at 37 °C for 1 h. GAS was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 5 times and added into wells for binding. After washing the plate with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, rabbit anti-FbaB or anti-M3 serum was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C for 1 h and reacted with 0.1%p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt solution (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 15 min. Color development was measured at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader (model Titertek MK11; Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA). All results are presented as the means of triplicate determinations, and each assay was repeated at least 3 times. Statistical analysis was performed by a nonparametric Mann-WhitneyU test. Adhesion to and invasion of cells were quantified by standard procedures as described previously (12Terao Y. Kawabata S. Kunitomo E. Murakami J. Nakagawa I. Hamada S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 75-86Google Scholar, 34Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Mosher D.F. Fässler R. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 625-637Google Scholar). HEp-2 cells were cultured in a 24-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well and infected with 1 × 107 CFU bacteria per well (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 3 h. To determine bacterial adhesion, cells were washed 3 times with DMEM and lysed with 1 ml of sterile distilled water. Serial dilutions of the lysate were plated on THY agar plates to determine the number of viable GAS. For bacterial invasion, cells were washed 3 times and incubated for 1 h with DMEM containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml) and penicillin (100 units/ml). Cells were washed, lysed, and plated to count those invaded by GAS. Data are expressed as the means of the percentage of GAS recovered per well from 6 independent determinations ± S.E. The assays were repeated 3 times, and representative data are shown. Statistical analysis was performed by a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. All conclusions were based on p < 0.005 as significant. HEp-2 cells were cultured on 8-well chamber slides (Nalge-Nunc). After infection with GAS (multiplicity of infection, 1:100), the wells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with 10% FBS containing 50 μg/ml human IgG (Calbiochem). Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (31Nakagawa I. Nakata M. Kawabata S. Hamada S. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 395-405Google Scholar). Adhered GAS was detected using the rabbit anti-M3 polyclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stained GAS was analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (model LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany). CD-1 outbred mice (7 weeks old, female, 20 g in weight, 10 mice per group) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Japan. GAS strains were grown at 37 °C toA 600 values of 0.4 and washed twice with sterile PBS. They were then resuspended in sterile PBS, and concentrations were adjusted to ∼4 × 107 CFU/ml. Each mouse was anesthetized with pentobarbital and injected with 0.1 ml of GAS (equivalent to 4 × 106 CFU) intraperitoneally. The mortality of infected mice was monitored every 24 h for 7 days. Statistical analysis was performed by a χ2 test. All conclusions were based on p < 0.05 as significant. Surface proteins were extracted with 8 m urea from M3 GAS isolates from patients with TSLS or pharyngitis (29Hamada S. Horikoshi T. Minami T. Kawabata S. Hiraoka J. Fujiwara T. Ooshima T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4161-4167Google Scholar). Twenty seven strains of M3 were initially screened for expression of Fn-binding proteins by ligand blotting. On the basis of the reactions to biotinylated Fn by autoradiography, several isolates from TSLS patients were found to express Fn-binding protein (Fig.1 C). Approximately 80- and 88-kDa proteins were found to bind Fn at a binding capability much stronger than M3 protein, which is also an Fn-binding protein (35Schmidt K. Mann K. Cooney J. Köhler W. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 135-144Google Scholar). However, the recovery of the 80- and 88-kDa proteins was much less than M protein at 55 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B). The complete genome sequencing of serotype M3 GAS strain SSI-1 from a TSLS patient was performed and annotated (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number BA000034). When we searched for ORFs with a calculated molecular mass of ∼88 kDa and harboring an LPXTG motif from all putative ORFs, we obtained one ORF. Because it possessed putative signal sequence in the N-terminal region and cell-anchoring LPATGE sequence and Fn-binding repeat motif (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.cgi?uid= pfam02986&version=v1.54) in the C terminus, we presumed the ORF was an Fn-binding protein and designated it FbaB. Furthermore, the deduced sequence of FbaB had identical amino acid residues in the N terminus to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 88-kDa band of Fn-binding protein. Fig. 2 shows the regions of the fbaB gene that were analyzed by a BLAST search. The fbaB gene was located downstream of a global negative regulator gene, nra (4Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Google Scholar), and a putative regulator gene that has been annotated as the msmR gene (36Russell R.R. Aduse-Opoku J. Sutcliffe I.C. Tao L. Ferretti J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4631-4637Google Scholar). Furthermore, there were no phage or phage-like elements in this region. The fbaB gene had a streptococcal consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGAGAG), −10 (TAGGCT), and −35 (TTGTCC) sequences (1Sela S. Aviv A. Tovi A. Burstein I. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1049-1055Google Scholar, 11Rocha C.L. Fischetti V.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2720-2728Google Scholar,37Huang T.T. Malke H. Ferretti J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 197-205Google Scholar) preceding the start codon ATG. The ORF consisted of 2,202 nucleotides and encoded a protein of 733 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of 81 kDa, and the mature protein was calculated to be 79 kDa. Comparisons with the deduced amino acid sequence of other GAS proteins are shown in Fig. 2 B. Similarities between FbaB and another Fn-binding protein, F2, of GAS (8Jaffe J. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 373-384Google Scholar) were confined to the C-terminal portions, which included the Fn-binding repeats. The homology between the region from amino acids 434 to 733 of FbaB and from 741 to 1039 residues of protein F2 was 97%. FbaB also showed a 49% homology to Cpa (collagen-binding protein of GAS; see Ref. 4Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Google Scholar) in the N-terminal region. Protein F1 (1Sela S. Aviv A. Tovi A. Burstein I. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1049-1055Google Scholar) was found to have two sections that exhibited a high similarity to FbaB. To inactivate the fbaB gene, we first constructed pYT1185 carrying the fbaB andaphA3 genes (Fig.3 A). The plasmid pYT1185 was transformed into strain SSI-1 by electroporation and integrated into the chromosomal DNA of SSI-1 by a single crossover recombination. Integration and inactivation of fbaB were demonstrated by PCR with the fbaB gene-specific forward primer and theaphA3-specific reverse primer (data not shown). A generated mutant strain, TR-47, was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FbaB serum, resulting that FbaB protein was not expressed on the bacterial cell surface (Fig. 3 B). We observed that the inactivation of fbaB resulted in disappearance of both 80- and 88-kDa proteins. The 80-kDa Fn-binding protein was considered to be a degradation product of the 88-kDa Fn-binding protein. These results demonstrated that the fbaB gene encodes a novel Fn-binding protein, FbaB. In order to investigate the ability of FbaB with live bacteria, we examined the difference between wild type strain SSI-1 and FbaB-deficient mutant TR-47 by ELISA using Fn-coated plates. Increasing densities of organisms were incubated on the Fn-coated microtiter plates. The binding activities were quantified using rabbit anti-M3 polyclonal antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fig. 3, C and D). Both strains bound to immobilized Fn in a cell density-dependent manner, although the affinity of the FbaB− mutant, TR-47, was lower than that of wild type strain SSI-1. These results clearly show that FbaB functions as an Fn-binding protein on the surface of GAS and suggest that the remaining Fn-binding ability of TR-47 may be ascribed to M3 protein (35Schmidt K. Mann K. Cooney J. Köhler W. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 135-144Google Scholar). The distribution of thefbaB gene was examined by PCR, and the expression of FbaB protein was investigated by Western blotting with anti-FbaB serum and ligand blotting with biotinylated Fn (TableIII). The fbaB gene was found exclusively on the chromosomes of the M3 and M18 strains of GAS. In contrast, anti-FbaB serum and biotinylated Fn reacted with the cell surface extracts of GAS isolated from TSLS patients but not from pharyngitis patients.Table IIIDistribution of the fbaB gene and FbaB protein among various M serotype strains of group A streptococci Open table in a new tab rFbaB was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane, followed by incubation with biotinylated Fn. It was demonstrated that immobilized rFbaB bound strongly to soluble Fn (Fig.4 A). To analyze the binding activity of soluble rFbaB, various concentrations of rFbaB were added to Fn-coated microtiter plates, and bound rFbaB was quantified using rabbit anti-FbaB serum and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The results showed that soluble rFbaB bound to immobilized Fn in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 B). BSA (Sigma) served as a negative control and did not bind to Fn. It was important to determine whether FbaB is surface-associated or localized intracellularly. Immunofluorescent microscopy using anti-FbaB and secondary Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated antibodies revealed the polar distribution of FbaB on the bacterial cell surface (Fig. 5,red image). The EGFP-expressed strain SSI-1G was observed as a green image. Based on these results and those from ELISA with live GAS (Fig. 3, C and D), along with the presence of the LPXTG motif in the C terminus, we concluded that FbaB was localized on the surface of GAS, and we hypothesized that FbaB functions as an adhesin or an invasin. To investigate the role of FbaB, adhesion and invasion efficiencies of strain SSI-1 and its mutant TR-47 were compared. Adhesion to and invasion of the HEp-2 cells by these strains were measured, respectively. Adhesion to and invasion of FbaB-deficient mutant, TR-47, were reduced ∼6-fold as compared with those of SSI-1, respectively (p < 0.005; Fig. 6). The contribution of FbaB in adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells was further studied (Fig. 7). Invasion of HEp-2 cells was assessed using EGFP expression in strain SSI-1G (EGFP+, FbaB+) and its isogenic mutant TR-47G (EGFP+, FbaB−). The adhesion of GAS to the surface of HEp-2 cells was visualized by staining with anti-M3 and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (red image). The adhesion and invasion abilities of TR-47G were clearly abrogated when compared with wild type strain SSI-1G. The above results indicate that FbaB serves as adhesin and an invasin with epithelial cells. Lack of FbaB results in the reduction of mouse mortality after challenge with GAS. The wild type strain SSI-1 yielded 80% mortality on day 2 and 90% mortality on day 4, whereas that of its isogenic mutant strain TR-47 was only 40% on day 2 (Fig. 8). These results strongly suggest that FbaB contributed to the virulence of the GAS strain that resulted in mouse mortality. Bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells through extracellular matrix proteins is considered to promote both colonization and infection. Various bacterial pathogens possess Fn-binding proteins including Staphylococcus aureus (38Signäs C. Raucci G. Jönsson K. Lindgren P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Google Scholar), Listeria monocytogenes (39Gilot P. Andre P. Content J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6698-6701Google Scholar), and Salmonella enterica (40Kingsley R.A. Santos R.L. Keestra A.M. Adams L.G. Baumler A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 895-905Google Scholar). A number of anchored proteins on the surface of GAS have shown binding ability of Fn. Furthermore, a correlation exists between the distribution of a particular Fn-binding protein and specific M serotypes, and a population of the M3 and M18 strains is known to be highly virulent (14Stevens D.L.

In the present study, we elucidated a novel Fn-binding protein selectively isolated from M3 and M18 strains, which we termed FbaB. Jaffe et al. (8Jaffe J. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 373-384Google Scholar) reported that a highly homologous repeat domain in protein F2 is the main Fn-binding region when compared with that of protein F1. The present results showed that the putative Fn-binding domain of FbaB was highly conserved at the C-terminal region (Fig. 2), and the domain contains three Fn-binding repeats consisting of 36-, 37-, and 38-amino acid residues. McGavin et al. (42McGavin M.J. Gurusiddappa S. Lindgren P.E. Lindberg M. Raucci G. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23946-23953Google Scholar) suggested that a contiguous sequence of 8 amino acids is essential for Fn binding activity in FnBB of Streptococcus dysgalactiae. We observed the conserved sequence, HFDNXXP, at amino acids 671–684 in FbaB protein. Furthermore, the fbaB gene was shown to possess a potential ribosome-binding site and promoter-like sequences (−10 and −35) upstream of the start codon and a putative signal sequence in the N terminus and a cell-anchoring LPXTG motif in the C terminus. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that FbaB is expressed on the surface and has Fn binding ability. To examine whether FbaB works as an adhesin and an invasin to host cells, it was important to determine the localization of the protein. The 8 m urea extracts of several M3 GAS strains strongly reacted with biotinylated Fn by ligand blotting (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the results of immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 5) and ELISA with Fn-coated microtiter plates and live organisms (Fig. 3, Cand D) clearly indicated that FbaB was a surface-associated protein. When a correlation between the presence of the fbaBgene and specific M serotypes was observed by PCR, the fbaBgene was found solely in M3 and M18 (Table I). We also found that 61.5% of the M3 strains isolated from TSLS patients expressed FbaB protein, whereas none of those from pharyngitis patients did (Table I). These results suggest that the expression of FbaB is highly associated with M3 organisms from TSLS. Moreover, streptococcal Fn-binding proteins are important virulence factors that play an essential role in adherence and invasion of host cells (43Canningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Google Scholar). We found that FbaB interacted with human epithelial cells, whereas inactivation of thefbaB gene inhibited the FbaB− mutant from adhesion to and invasion of HEp-2 cells (Figs. 6 and 7). Therefore, we hypothesized that the development of severe invasive diseases and TSLS could be ascribed to the actual expression of fbaB. However, to confirm this relationship, we will perform further tests using a number of isolates from many countries. The fbaB gene was found located downstream of a global regulatory gene, nra (Fig. 2). Podbielski et al.(4Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Google Scholar) reported that Nra negatively regulates Cpa and protein F2 transcription as well as its own transcription and that thenra gene is primarily transcribed. Based on their relative locations and a preliminary study (data not shown), we speculated that the fbaB gene is normally controlled under the negative regulator Nra. Podbielski et al. (4Podbielski A. Woischnik M. Leonard B.A. Schmidt K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1051-1064Google Scholar) also predicted that the negative regulatory activity of Nra could be attributed to the essential sequence that would function as an Nra-binding box. Several regulatory proteins in transcription utilize DNA binding activity for the regulator-binding box, which exists in the upstream region of the structural gene (44McIver K.S. Myles R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1591-1601Google Scholar). For example, the Mga-binding box and RofA-binding box from GAS have been reported by McIver et al. (45McIver K.S. Heath A.S. Green B.D. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6619-6624Google Scholar) and Fogg and Caparon (46Fogg G.C. Caparon M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6172-6180Google Scholar), respectively. However, in the present study we could not find the putative Nra-binding box (GCTTCTAAACTT) or similar sequences in the region upstream of the fbaB gene of M3 strain SSI-1. Fn is a large and multifunctional molecule found in serum and basement membranes, and it is known to bind to a wide variety of proteins and host cells by a surface integrin (47Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1985; 40: 191-198Google Scholar). Various pathogenic bacteria bind to Fn and use it for mediation by forming a bridge across the host cells and then facilitating the escape from human immune systems by pretending to be autogenous components. Several reports (34Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Mosher D.F. Fässler R. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 625-637Google Scholar, 48Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Ben-Ze'Ev A. Bokoch G.M. Jou T.S. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 561-573Google Scholar) have shown that adherence to and invasion of epithelial cells require both soluble Fn and integrin expression on the cell surface, which may be explained by the possibility that the Fn-binding protein cannot bind to integrins directly. Stockbauer et al. (49Stockbauer K.E. Magoun L. Liu M. Burns E.H. Gubba S. Renish S. Pan X. Bodary S.C. Baker E. Coburn J. Leong J.M. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 242-247Google Scholar) identified three major SpeBs, a cysteine protease of GAS variants, and showed that one of these variants, SpeB2, contains an RGD motif that was found to be a minimum integrin-binding sequence (50Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Google Scholar). Furthermore, they demonstrated that only SpeB2, which is usually produced by highly virulent M serotype strains, binds to integrins. Because FbaB contained an RGD motif at amino acid positions 135–137 (Fig. 2), we speculated that it might be an integrin-recognizing ligand with the ability to bind to an integrin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FbaB may promote bacterial adhesion to host cell surfaces and also contribute to the colonization and invasion of organisms. We also showed that FbaB indicated two molecular sizes by Western blot and ligand blot analyses (Figs. 1 and 3 B). A band of 80-kDa FbaB from 8 m urea extract reacted with Fn stronger than an 88-kDa protein, which was similar to the pattern shown between M1 protein and immunoglobulins by Raeder et al. (20Raeder R. Woischnik M. Podbielski A. Boyle M.D. Res. Microbiol. 1998; 149: 539-548Google Scholar). Their report demonstrated that SpeB, a cysteine protease, cleaved M1 protein to generate a protein with a higher level of immunoglobulin binding activity. To test the hypothesis that FbaB is also modified by SpeB protein, we incubated rFbaB with various concentrations of recombinant SpeB, which revealed two major bands (molecular mass of 80 and 88 kDa, data not shown). These results suggest that the proteolytic reaction by SpeB affects not only host cells but also the surface proteins of GAS to increase their virulence activities. This modification may be associated with the invasive capability of GAS and a key factor for analyzing the change to invasive strains. Furthermore, the cleavage of FbaB by SpeB in the N terminus may contribute to its escape from the host immune system by raising a distinct antigenicity. Although it is unclear how bacterial adhesion to and invasion of host cells affect streptococcal diseases in humans, findings from many studies have shown that intracellular invasion is associated with an important role of streptococcal virulence. Further study of FbaB may elucidate the mechanisms involved with invasive streptococcal infections, including bacterial colonization and the spread into deeper organs. We thank T. Murai, H. Watanabe, C. Katsukawa, and E. Hanski for providing the streptococcal strains. We also thank to Mikiyo Yamaguchi and Masaya Yamaguchi for help with this work."

To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the developmental fate of these distinct B cell subsets, we investigated their biochemical and biological responses following stimulation through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). As compared with the T1 subset, T2 cells are more responsive to BCR engagement, as evidenced by their robust induction of activation markers, expression of the prosurvival protein Bcl-xL, and enhanced proliferation. BCR stimulation of T2 cells leads to the appearance of B cells with mature phenotypic characteristics, whereas T1 cells die. All of these T2 responses are dependent on the BCR signal transducer Bruton's tyrosine kinase, which is dispensable for the T1 to T2 transition. Furthermore, the serine/threonine kinases ERK, p38 MAPK, and Akt are predominantly activated in T2 compared with T1 B cells following BCR cross-linking. We conclude that T1 and T2 B cells respond differentially to BCR engagement via the induction of stage-specific signaling pathways. In turn, these signaling pathways probably govern the development and selection processes that are critical for the formation of the mature B cell compartment.

B lymphocytes are generated throughout the life of most mammals. This process occurs in the fetal liver before birth and in the bone marrow (BM) 1The abbreviations used are: BM, bone marrow; T1 and T2, transitional type 1 and 2, respectively; BCR, B cell antigen receptor; M, mature; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; xid, x-linked immunodeficiency; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PLC, phospholipase C; BAFF, B cell activation factor; WT, wild type; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HSA, human serum albumin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; MZ, marginal zone; PE, phycoerythrin; FSC, forward scatter light; hi, high; lo, low; int, intermediate. thereafter. Production of functional B lymphocytes requires the normal progression of precursor B cells through both antigen-independent and antigen-dependent stages of development (1Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Annu.

Dev. 1996; 6: 603-609Google Scholar). The antigen-independent phase of B-cell differentiation that occurs in the fetal liver and the BM culminates in the expression of an assembled IgM molecule, which is displayed on the surface of immature B cells (3Willerford D.M. Swat W. Alt F.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 603-609Google Scholar). Of the 10–20 million immature B cells (IgM+) daily produced from the BM, only 10% reach the periphery; of these, only 10–30% join the long lived B cell pool (IgMloIgDhi) (4Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2533-2540Google Scholar, 5Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Lentz V.M. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4431-4444Google Scholar, 6Rajewsky K.

Although the precise nature of this peripheral B cell loss is unclear, these observations suggest that immature B cells either compete with mature B cells for survival or they require selection signals to enter the long lived mature B cell pool (6Rajewsky K.

Analysis of the peripheral B cell repertoire strongly suggests that the progression of immature B cells to the mature B cell stage is the result of positive selection (10Coutinho A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 38-40Google Scholar, 11Forster I. Rajewsky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4781-4784Google Scholar, 12Gu H. Tarlinton D. Muller W. Rajewsky K. Forster I. J. Exp.

In this context, BCR-derived signals are indispensable for both the formation of the B cell repertoire and the long term survival of mature B lymphocytes (6Rajewsky K. Nature. 1996; 381: 751-758Google Scholar, 16Lam K.P. Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1073-1083Google Scholar). Despite a critical requirement for the BCR during splenic B cell development, a specific role(s) for BCR signaling in this process remain(s) poorly understood (8Meffre E. Casellas R. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 379-385Google Scholar, 17King L.B. Monroe J.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 86-104Google Scholar, 18Monroe J.G. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 95: S8-S13Google Scholar). Immature B cells undergo a maturation process in the periphery characterized by a sequential series of discrete stages that can be identified based upon the expression of developmental markers. Thus, splenic B cells can be divided into at least three developmental subpopulations: transitional type 1 (T1) B cells, transitional type 2 (T2) B cells, and mature (M) B cells (19Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar). T1 B cells can develop into T2 B cells, which in turn are thought to serve as the precursor to M B cells (19Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar). Prior studies have revealed that immature and mature B cell subpopulations display distinct responses to similar stimuli. For example, immature B cells undergo apoptosis in response to BCR engagement, whereas M B cells proliferate under similar stimulatory conditions (2Monroe J.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 1-29Google Scholar, 4Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2533-2540Google Scholar, 5Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Lentz V.M. Cancro M.P. J.

These observations suggest that the BCR may deliver distinct signals at discrete stages of peripheral B cell development. Whether distinct BCR responses are developmentally regulated or stage-specific (T1, T2, and M), BCR signaling responses that determine the biological outcome are not known. The BCR propagates biochemical signals via the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases including the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases Lyn, Syk, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) (22Campbell K.S.

Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Google Scholar). These kinases in turn contribute to the formation and activation of a large protein complex termed the BCR signalosome (26Benschop R.J. Brandl E. Chan A.C. Cambier J.C. J.

The M B cell deficiency in these mice is probably due to a failure of T2 B cell transition into M B cells. A similar M B cell deficiency has been observed in mice with gene-targeted deletions in several other components of the BCR signalosome including Syk, Vav1, Vav2, B cell linker protein, Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PLC-γ2 (27Fruman D.A.

In addition, a B cell activation factor (BAFF) has been shown to potentiate both the survival and differentiation of T2 B cells (46Batten M. Groom J. Cachero T.G. Qian F. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Browning J.L. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1453-1466Google Scholar). These observations suggest that T2 B cells display signaling responses that are distinct from T1 and M B cells. These unique BCR responses may play a role in the progression of immature B cells into the long lived M B cell compartment. However, little is known about the specific BCR signaling properties of T2 B cells. Here we examine the BCR signaling responses of T2 B cellsversus T1 and M B cells isolated from WT and BCR signaling-defective mice (btk −/−). We demonstrate that T2 B cells display more potent responses to BCR stimulation than either T1 or M B cells. T2 B cells express higher basal and BCR-induced levels of activation markers and proliferate as well as M B cells, and a subset of them display a mature B cell phenotype in response to BCR stimulation in vitro. In contrast to T1, BCR stimulation of T2 B cells potently induces heightened expression of the prosurvival protein Bcl-xL. The btk −/− B cells were defective for these responses, further supporting an essential role for BCR signaling during peripheral B cell development. Furthermore, consistent with the distinct biological outcomes of T1 versus T2 B cells, BCR cross-linking induces phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and Akt predominantly in T2 but only modestly in T1 cells. Together, these findings suggest that T2 B cells respond to BCR signals with greater potency than either T1 or M B cells. This enhanced response to BCR stimulation may contribute to the positive selection and progression of T2 B cells into the long lived mature B cell pool. 4–8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were used for all of the experiments. The generation of btk-deficient mice (null mutant; btk −/−) has been described previously (34Khan W.N. Alt F.W. Gerstein R.M. Malynn B.A. Larsson I. Rathbun G. Davidson L. Muller S. Kantor A.B. Herzenberg L.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 283-299Google Scholar). These mice have a mixed genetic background of 129/SvxC57BL/6. For wild type controls, 129/SvxC57BL/6 or C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were used. All mice used as a source of cells were treated humanely in accordance with federal and state government guidelines, and their use was approved by the Vanderbilt and University of Massachusetts Medical School institutional animal committees. For flow cytometric analyses, splenocytes were harvested from WT and btk −/−mice and depleted of red blood cells. 1 × 106cells/sample were stained for surface expression of cell surface antigens in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum) with the indicated combinations of FITC-conjugated anti-CD21, PE-conjugated anti-CD23, PE-conjugated anti-IgM, Cychrome-conjugated anti-B220, FITC-conjugated anti-CD25, PE- or APC-conjugated anti-CD5, and biotin-conjugated anti-HSA (M1/69; Pharmingen) antibodies revealed by Cychrome-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen). Live cells were analyzed based on their forward scatter light (FSC)/side scatter light (SSC) properties. In some cases (see Fig. 3), cells were stained in FACS buffer (deficient RPMI (Irvine; catalog no. 9826-10L)) with 10 mm Hepes, 3% newborn calf serum, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide), with indicated combinations of FITC anti-CD21, PE-conjugated anti-CD24 (HSA; clone 30F1), and biotin-conjugated anti-CD23 or anti-CD25 or biotin anti-IgD, revealed with Cychrome-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen; except Southern Biotech Association for PE-30F1 and Ebioscience for anti-IgD). After washing in stain medium, cells were resuspended in 1 μg/ml propidium iodide to exclude dead cells. For the detection of intracellular Bcl-xL protein levels, splenocytes were incubated for 16 h in the presence or absence of anti-IgM. 1 × 106 cells/sample were stained for surface expression of CD21 and HSA. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.3% saponin. Intracellular staining for Bcl-xL was achieved by incubating the permeabilized cells with FITC-conjugated anti-Bcl-xLantibodies in the presence of 15% mouse serum. Samples were stained in parallel with an FITC-conjugated IgG3 antibody as a background control. All flow cytometric samples were assayed on a FACSCaliburTM or FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and the data were analyzed using CELLQuestTM (Becton Dickinson) or FlowJo (TreeStar Inc.) software. Splenic B cell subsets were isolated via a two-step process. First, B cells were purified from the spleens of WT and btk −/− mice by a process of negative selection using an auto-MACS automated cell sorter (Milentyi Biotechnology). Briefly, pooled splenocytes were depleted of red blood cells, incubated with anti-CD43 antibodies coupled to magnetic beads to deplete CD43-bearing leukocytes, thereby excluding B cells. In some experiments, T cells were depleted using biotinylated anti-CD3, -CD4, and -CD8 antibodies followed by streptavidin-magnetic beads. Purified B cells were then stained using FITC-conjugated anti-CD21, PE-conjugated anti-CD23, and biotinylated anti-HSA (revealed by Cychrome-labeled streptavidin) antibodies or FITC-conjugated anti-CD21, PE-conjugated anti-HSA (CD24), and biotinylated anti-CD23 (revealed by Cychrome-labeled streptavidin) antibodies to sort T1, T2, and M B cell populations as described in previous reports (19Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar, 46Batten M. Groom J. Cachero T.G. Qian F. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Browning J.L. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1453-1466Google Scholar). Anti-IgM was specifically not used to avoid preactivation through the BCR. Cells were sorted on a FACStarTM fluorescent cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Nashville, TN) or at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Worcester, MA). To assess their purity, the sorted cells were reanalyzed by FACS. The purity for T1, T2, and M B cells was 90–95, 70–95, and 95–98%, respectively. 2–5 × 104purified T1, T2, M, and total (presort) B cells were dispensed in 96-well microtiter plates (in triplicates) at 100 μl/well and then cultured in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mml-glutamine. Plates were incubated as indicated in the presence of either 20 μg/ml anti-IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or PMA/Iono (1.0 μm each;Calbiochem-Novabiochem). At the end of the incubation period, the cells were pulsed with 1.0 μCi of [3H]thymidine (AmershamBiosciences) per well for 12 h. Cells were then harvested with a cell harvester (Tomtec Orange), and [3H]thymidine uptake was measured with a β plate counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). For Western blot analysis of Bcl-xL, purified T1, T2, and, total B cells (as described in the legend to Fig. 2) were used. Cells were washed and resuspended in complete RPMI (supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and cultured for 16 h with or without 10 μg/ml F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For Western blot analysis of MAPKs, cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with or without 20 μg/ml F(ab′)2 for indicated times as described above. After stimulation, whole cell extracts were prepared and resolved by 4–20% gradient denaturing SDS-PAGE, and blotted on to Immobilon (Millipore Corp.) membranes. The membranes were probed with rabbit anti-Bcl-xL (Pharmingen) or anti-phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), or antibodies to ERK1/2, p38, and Akt (Cell Signaling) and anti-β actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for protein loading control according to the manufacturer's instructions. The bound antibodies were revealed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies, followed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Pierce) on autoradiography film. In prior studies, we and others have demonstrated that the M B cell population is reduced in btk −/− mice and that the majority of the remaining B cells display an immature phenotype (IgMbrightIgDlow and IgMbrightIgDbright) (19Loder F.

BTK is an integral component of the BCR signal transduction network. Therefore, a block in B cell ontogeny at an immature B cell stage inbtk −/− mice suggests an important role for BCR signaling at this stage of B cell development. Immature splenic B cells can be divided into at least two developmentally distinct subpopulations: T1 B cells (IgMbrightCD21low/− or HSAbrightCD21low/−) and T2 B cells (IgMbrightCD21bright or HSAbrightCD21bright). T2 B cells are believed to be the immediate precursors of M B cells (IgMintCD21int or HSAintCD21int) (19Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar). To begin to understand the effects of BCR signaling in the immature B cell subpopulations, we characterized the phenotype of WT splenic B cells using FACS and compared it with splenocytes isolated frombtk −/− mice. FACS analysis using anti-CD21 and anti-IgM antibodies defined a block in btk −/−mice at the T2 stage to M stage of B cell development, since there is a significant reduction in the numbers of M B cells (3.9 × 106 in btk −/− versus19.2 × 106 in WT mice (Fig. 1). The proportion and number of T2 B cells in btk −/− animals compared with the WT mice was slightly increased (9.6 × 106 inbtk −/− mice versus 8.3 × 106 in WT mice) (Fig. 1). This increase might be due to the presence of marginal zone (MZ) B cells that develop normally inbtk −/− mice and constitute ∼2–4% of the cells shown as T2 in Fig. 1 (data not shown). Although some of the T2 B cells expressed slightly decreased levels of IgM, most of thebtk −/− B cells continued to express higher levels of IgM and HSA compared with controls (Fig. 1; data not shown). In addition, the T1 and T2 subsets were not detectable in lymph nodes (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that T2 B cells are found in the spleen but not lymph nodes and that BTK is required for the developmental transition from T2 to M B cell stage. These findings are consistent with a previous study that examined T1 and T2 B cell populations in CBA/N (xid) mice (19Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar). Because T2 B cells are found exclusively in the spleen, where they then develop into M B cells, positive signals mediated by the BCR (provided,in vivo, by the splenic microenvironment) may play an important role in this process. Therefore, we asked whether stimulation via the BCR can induce the maturation of T1 and T2 B cells into M B cells. For these experiments, T1, T2, and M B cells were sorted based on their surface expression of HSA, CD21, and CD23 as described by Loder et al. (19Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar). Anti-IgM was not used for sorting to prevent inadvertent triggering of BCR signals prior to the initiation of the experiment (19Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar, 46Batten M. Groom J. Cachero T.G. Qian F. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Browning J.L. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1453-1466Google Scholar). Reanalysis of the sorted B cell subsets by FACS revealed high purity for T1 (97.7%) and M (96.5%) B cells; however, in purified T2 B cells, a low level contamination with M B cells was observed (84.5% pure) (Fig. 2). We believe that the presence of the M B cells did not significantly interfere with our differentiation assay, because the rate of M B cell proliferation is equal to that of T2 B cells in response to BCR stimulation (Figs. 3A and 5). Thus, the ratio of T2 to M B cells (11:1) should not decrease significantly during the course of the experiment. Purified T1, T2, and M B cells were incubated for up to 96 h with or without anti-IgM antibodies. The fraction of live and dead cells within each sample was determined, and then the cells were stained with fluorescence-tagged antibodies that recognize CD21, HSA, or IgD to define the ratio of T2 to M B cells. The percentage of the surviving cells after various incubation times is shown in Fig. 3A. Very few cells were found at 72 and 96 h in T1 cell cultures and, therefore, are not included in the analysis shown in Fig. 3A. Although cell death was also observed in T2 and M B cell cultures, a significantly higher proportion of anti-IgM-stimulated T2 and M B cells survived compared with similarly treated T1 B cell cultures (Fig. 3A). Analysis of live cells revealed that up to 40% of T2 B cells down-regulated the expression of both CD21 and HSA to intermediate levels (HSAintCD21int), a phenotype consistent with their transition into the M B cell compartment (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, after anti-IgM treatment, the majority of input T2 cells express IgD on their cell surface at higher levels than input M cells, since the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was 242 on enlarged T2 cells in contrast to an MFI of 85 on M cells (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that BCR delivers a signal that facilitates T2 to M B cell maturation. The ability of T2 B cells to develop into M B cells prompted us to investigate their activation responses following BCR stimulation. For these studies, splenocytes were cultured with or without anti-IgM antibodies as indicated. FACS analyses revealed that T2 B cells displayed heightened expression of the activation markers CD25, CD5, CD95, and CD86 compared with either T1 or M B cells prior to BCR stimulation. Following activation, the expression levels of these cell surface antigens increased on both M and T2 B cells; however, T2 B cells displayed a greater increase than did M B cells. Interestingly, when input T2 cells were analyzed 72 h after anti-IgM treatment, the cells that retain T2 phenotype expressed more CD25 than the cells with a M phenotype (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the expression of these activation markers on untreated T1 cells was low or undetectable and did not significantly increase in response to treatment with anti-IgM (Fig. 4B). BCR signaling-defectivebtk −/− B cells were defective for the up-regulation of these cell surface antigens upon anti-IgM stimulation (data not shown). Together, these findings suggest that the activation response of T2 B cells to BCR engagement relative to T1 B cells may be the result of a distinct signaling program of the T2 B cell subset. Alternatively, the robust BCR responses of the T2 B cells may result from a developmental switch during the T1 to T2 transition that enhances BCR-dependent responses of T2 B cells. Previous studies have shown that, unlike mature B cells, immature splenic B cells (IgMbrightHSAbright) do not proliferate but instead undergo apoptosis (4Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2533-2540Google Scholar, 5Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Lentz V.M. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4431-4444Google Scholar, 8Meffre E. Casellas R. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat.

These findings are supported by the observation that xid andbtk −/− B cells, which typically display an immature phenotype, undergo excessive cell death in response to treatment with anti-IgM (49Anderson J.S.

We investigated whether PrPC can move from one cell to another cell in a cell model. Little PrPC transfer was detected when a PrPCexpressing human neuroblastoma cell line was cultured with the human erythroleukemia cells IA lacking PrPC. Efficient transfer of PrPC was detected with the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C. Maximum PrPC transfer was observed when both donor and recipient cells were activated. Furthermore, PrPC transfer required the GPI anchor and direct cell to cell contact. However, intercellular protein transfer is not limited to PrPC, another GPI-anchored protein, CD90, also transfers from the donor cells to acceptor cells after cellular activation. Therefore, this transfer process is GPI-anchor and cellular activation dependent. These findings suggest that the intercellular transfer of GPI-anchored proteins is a regulated process, and may have implications for the pathogenesis of prion disease.

Although the general function is not understood, recent studies have established that PrPC has several activities. There is strong evidence that PrPC is a metal-binding protein that has antioxidation property (3Kramer M.L. Kratzin H.D. Schmidt B. Romer A. Windl O. Liemann S. Hornemann S. Kretzschmar H. J. Biol.

Cell surface PrPC has also been reported to bind laminin and glycosaminoglycans, and to participate in signal transduction (7Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S.

PrPC also plays a central role in a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders, commonly known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 11Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Google Scholar, 12Gambetti P. Parchi P. Capellari S. Russo C. Tabaton M. Teller M. Teller J.K. Chen S.G. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2001; 3: 87-95Google Scholar), which occur in three forms: familial, sporadic, and acquired by infection. The fundamental pathogenic mechanism shared by all the three forms involves the post-translational conversion of PrPC into a pathogenic and infectious conformer, called scrapie PrP (PrPSc) (13Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 345-374Google Scholar,14Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Google Scholar). The mechanism and the cellular locale of PrPC to PrPSc conversion remain unclear. It has been suggested that the conversion is either through the direct binding of PrPSc to PrPC or mediated by a chaperone protein (8Gauczynski S. Peyrin J.M. Haik S. Leucht C. Hundt C. Rieger R.

Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Google Scholar) found that direct interaction between PrPC and PrPSc through the region around amino acid residues 219 to 232 is required for the subsequent conversion in the cell-free system (18Horiuchi M. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Google Scholar). Plasma membrane and subcellular compartments of the protein recycling pathway have been suggested to be the sites of conversion (19Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Google Scholar, 20Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Google Scholar), because in the cell model, the generation of PrPSc is inhibited by brefeldin A, an agent, which blocks the delivery of membrane proteins from the cytosol to the membrane (23Taraboulos A. Raeber A.J. Borchelt D.R. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 851-863Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of cells with phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an enzyme that hydrolyzes the GPI anchor, or with proteases, which degrade PrPC also inhibits PrPSc formation (24Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Google Scholar). In addition, PrPC is not converted to PrPSc when it is expressed as a transmembrane protein rather than a GPI-anchored protein (25Kaneko K. Vey M. Scott M. Pilkuhn S. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2333-2338Google Scholar, 26Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Google Scholar). The GPI anchor may be needed because GPI-anchored proteins occupy microdomains on the cell membrane, known as detergent insoluble complex or lipid rafts, in a concentrated and multimeric form (27Muniz M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 10-15Google Scholar). An additional relevant issue is that although PrPC is expressed in many non-central nervous system tissues (28Liu T. Li R. Wong B.S. Liu D. Pan T. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3733-3742Google Scholar, 29Bendheim P.E. Brown H.R. Rudelli R.D. Scala L.J. Goller N.L. Wen G.Y. Kascsak R.J. Cashman N.R. Bolton D.C.

Virol. 1988; 69: 711-716Google Scholar), the pathology of prion diseases occurs exclusively in the central nervous system (12Gambetti P. Parchi P. Capellari S. Russo C. Tabaton M. Teller M. Teller J.K. Chen S.G. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2001; 3: 87-95Google Scholar,31DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 785-811Google Scholar). It is believed that in prion diseases acquired by infection such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the PrPC to PrPSc conversion happens through a series of intermediates in different tissues until PrPSc reaches the central nervous system. GPI-anchored proteins are diverse and mediate various functions such as: cell to cell adhesion, nutrient uptake, signal transduction, and regulation of complement activity (32McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Google Scholar, 33Stevens E.M. Lament R. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1979; 40: 445-446Google Scholar). Purified GPI-anchored proteins can incorporate spontaneously onto the target cell membranein vitro, a phenomenon known as “cell painting” (34Medof M.E. Kinoshita T. Silber R. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2980-2984Google Scholar,35Tykocinski M.L. Kaplan D.R. Medof M.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1-16Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence also suggests that GPI-anchored proteins may detach from the cell surface and re-attach to another cell. For example, spontaneous cell to cell transfer of CD4-GPI has been demonstrated between co-cultured HeLa cells (36Anderson S.M. Yu G. Giattina M. Miller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5894-5898Google Scholar). In a transgenic mouse model, human CD59 and CD55, which are expressed only on red blood cells, were observed to transfer to vascular endothelial cells (37Kooyman D.L. Byrne G.W. McClellan S.

However, any intercellular transfer of GPI-anchored proteins in vivo must be tightly regulated, to assure that GPI-anchored proteins do not lose their cell type specificity. The in vivo significance and the mechanism by which GPI-anchored protein moves between cells remain unclear (38Ilangumaran S. Robinson P. Hoessli D. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 163-167Google Scholar). In the current study, we established a co-culture system using a PrPC expressing (PrPC+) cell line M17-PrP and the cell line IA lacking PrPC (PrPC−) to study whether PrPC can move from cell to cell. We found that PrPC could be transferred from M17-PrP cells to IA cells by a GPI-dependent process in vitro. However, this process does not efficiently occur spontaneously but requires cell activation and direct cell to cell contact. The human neuroblastoma cell line M17 and the human PrP transfectant M17-PrP have been described in detail (39Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Google Scholar). The PrP-CD44-pCEP4 expression construct was generated by replacing the GPI-anchor signaling sequence with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of human CD44. The PrP-CD44-pCEP4 plasmid was transfected into M17 cells using the DOTAP Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Hygromycin-resistant cells were selected and screened for the expression of cell surface PrPC by immunofluorescent staining with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody (mAb) and flow cytometry as described below. The human erythroleukemia cell line IA, derived from K562, was kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Medof of our institution. IA cells failed to express any GPI-anchored protein because of a defect in the assembly of the GPI-anchor core structure (40Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16968-16974Google Scholar). The original breeding pairs of FVB PrP−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. S. Prusiner, University of California, San Francisco, CA, and Dr. G. Carlson, McLaughlin Institute, Great Falls, MT. Co-culture was carried out in 6- or 12-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY). M17 or M17-PrP cells were first plated and allowed to grow to 90% confluence. IA cells were then added onto the plate and incubated overnight. Except in the experiments to determine the kinetics of co-culture, a 1:1 of donor cell (1 × 106) to recipient cell was used for all the experiments. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) was added at 20 ng/ml at the beginning of the culture. After co-culture, the IA cells, which grow in suspension, were carefully collected. In some experiments, an anti-CD44 mAb was used with a secondary reagent conjugated to magnetic beads to isolate the CD44+ IA cells according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Matenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). For treatment with PI-PLC, cells were incubated with 60 ng/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C for 30 min in a 37 °C in a CO2 incubator as described (39Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were washed extensively and stained with the anti-PrP mAb as described. In some experiments, the donor and recipient cells were cultured in transwells that were separated by a membrane with a 0.4-μm pore size (Costar, Corning). IA cells were placed in the top chamber and the M17-PrP cells in the lower chamber. Single cell suspensions from the spleen of PrP−/− mice were prepared as described (41Liu T. Zwingman T. Li R. Pan T. Wong B.S. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Herrup K. Sy M.S. Brain Res. 2001; 896: 118-129Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in a 12-well plate at 3 × 106 per well with complete medium: RPMI, 1% antibiotics, and 10% pre-selected fetal calf serum. Either PMA (20 ng/ml) or ConA (5 μg/ml) were added to the cells. Plates were incubated in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. After 48 h, the spleen cells were collected and washed twice. Next, they were co-cultured with M17-PrP cells, which had been grown to 90% confluence and were pretreated with PMA or untreated overnight. After an additional overnight co-culture without any activation reagent, cells in suspension were collected for immunostaining. The IA cells or spleen cells were collected and washed with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% newborn calf serum, 0.1% NaN3, pH 7.4), and blocked with Fc-BlockTM (Pharmingen) on ice for 25–30 min. Cells were then incubated with purified anti-PrPC mAb 8H4 or anti-human CD90 mAb 5E10 (Pharmingen) or an isotype matched, control mAb on ice for 45 min. Cells were washed twice and then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2, goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-specific antibody (Chemicon, CA), for 25 min on ice. Finally, the samples were washed and immediately analyzed using a FACScanTM (BD Biosciences). At least 5,000 viable cells were analyzed in all experiments, and all experiments were repeated at least three times for consistency. Following co-culture, IA cells were collected for two-color immunofluorescent staining. The cells were first blocked with 5% human serum for 30 min on ice, then incubated with antibodies in the following sequence, anti-human CD44 mAb A3, Alexa Fluor 488 (green) conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, F(ab′)2 (Molecular Probes), biotinylated anti-PrP mAb 8H4 and Alexa Fluor 594 (red) streptavidin conjugates (Molecular Probes). Samples were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde after staining. A cytospin was then used at 500 rpm for 10 min to allow cells to adhere onto glass slides and mounted immediately with Permount (Sigma). The slides were analyzed using a dual scanning confocal microscopy system (LSM 510, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). IA cells were covalently labeled with the amine-reactive fluorescein dye, 5-carboxyfluorescein, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Labeled cells were washed extensively and loaded into the 96-well plate with M17-PrP monolayers, then co-cultured with or without PMA for 6–8 h. The plate was gently washed and the remaining fluorescent cells were quantified using a CytoFluor multiplate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Series 4000, MA). M17-PrP cells were first cultured with or without PMA for 24 h, the supernatants were then collected and spun at 2,000 × g to remove the cell debris. The supernatant was further subjected to a 100,000 ×g ultraspeed centrifugation for 1 h at 4 °C (42Taylor D.D. Chou I.N. Black P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 470-476Google Scholar). In some experiments the pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer to determine the PrPC content on immunoblots. In other experiments, the pellets were re-suspended in culture medium and various amounts of the microvesicles were cultured with recipient cells. Cells or microvesicle fractions were incubated with lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Predetermined amounts of total protein from each lysate were loaded and separated in 12% polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to Immobilon P (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 90 V. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-PrP mAb 8H4. Bound mAbs were detected with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2of goat anti-mouse IgG Fc region specific antibody (Chemicon, CA). The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were used as standards. M17-PrP, a stably transfected human neuroblastoma cell that expresses high levels of human PrPC (Fig.1 A) and IA a human erythroleukemia cell line, which does not express PrPCbecause it has a defect in the assembly of the GPI anchor (Fig.1 A), were used as donor and recipient cells, respectively. Furthermore, the M17-PrP cells adhere to the substrate and are CD44 negative (CD44−), whereas the IA cells grow in suspension and are CD44 positive (CD44+) so that the two cell lines can be easily separated to examine PrPC transfer from one cell to the other. Following co-culture of M17-PrP cells and IA cells for 12 h, little or no PrPC was detected on the cell surface of IA cells with mAb 8H4 to PrP (Fig. 1 B) (43Zanusso G. Liu D. Ferrari S. Hegyi I. Yin X. Aguzzi A. Hornemann S. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Manson J.C. Brown P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8812-8816Google Scholar, 44Li R. Liu T. Wong B.-S. Pan T. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. O'Rourke K. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Sy M.-S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 567-573Google Scholar). However, we detected a significant amount of PrPC in the IA cells when we co-cultured M17-PrP cells and IA cells in the presence of PMA, an activator of protein kinase C, indicating that PMA had triggered the efficient transfer of PrPC (Fig. 1 C). We next used an anti-CD44 mAb and magnetic beads to isolate IA cells after co-culture. All the preparations enriched in CD44 positive cells (>98% CD44+) were PrPC positive (Fig.1 D). This finding rules out the possibility that the presence of PrPC in IA cell preparations results from contaminating M17-PrP cells because the latter are CD44−. Incubation of IA cells or M17-PrP cells with PMA, respectively, did not induce the expression of either PrPC in IA cells or CD44 in M17-PrP cells (data not shown). Two-color confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of PrPC in the plasma membrane of IA cells only after PMA activation (Fig. 2,A–H). Furthermore, the transferred PrPC and CD44 partially co-distributed on IA cells (Fig. 2,G and H). We further investigated the role of PMA activation in PrPCtransfer and the kinetics of the transfer. Activation of either the donor or acceptor cells separately prior to co-culture was sufficient for PrPC transfer. However, the activation of both cell types consistently resulted in the highest level of transfer (Fig.3, A and B). PrPC transfer could be detected as early as 3 h after co-culture, increased subsequently, and became stable at about 12 h (Fig. 3 C). Approximately 25 ng/ml PMA was the optimal concentration for triggering intercellular transfer (Fig.3 D). The transfer was cell-dose dependent because more PrPC was detected on IA cells when IA cells were co-cultured with increased numbers of M17-PrP cells (Fig.3 E). Significant levels of free PrPC were detected in the culture supernatant of PMA-treated M17-PrP cells as determined by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (not shown). We investigated whether PrPC is transferred as soluble and free PrPC present in the culture supernatant. No PrPC was detected on the surface of IA cells after culture with supernatant from PMA-treated or nontreated M17-PrP cells, even when the IA cells were also treated with PMA (not shown). We next investigated whether purified microvesicles released by activated M17-PrP cells were the source of the transferred PrPC. The microvesicle PrPC content determined by immunoblotting showed that microvesicles from PMA-treated M17-PrP cells contained more PrPC than those from the nontreated M17-PrP cells (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, microvesicles purified from activated M17-PrP cells were added directly into IA cell cultures, which had been preactivated with PMA. Only a very low level of PrPC was detected on IA cells exposed to microvesicles isolated from a number of M17-PrP cell 10 times higher than that used in common co-culture experiments (Fig.4 B). Therefore, neither the soluble PrPC in the supernatant nor the PrPC in the isolated microvesicles is the major source of the transferred PrPC. A transwell co-culture system was then used to investigate whether cell to cell contact is required for PrPC transfer. After culture for 12 h in two chambers separated by a membrane, little or no PrPC was detected on IA cells (Fig.4 C). Finally, an adhesion assay showed that after co-culture with nonlabeled M17-PrP cells for 6 h, about 30–40% more IA cells adhered to M17-PrP cell monolayers following PMA than without PMA (Fig.4 D). Therefore, direct contact between the M17-PrP donor and IA acceptor cells appears to be required for efficient PrPC transfer and is enhanced by activation with PMA. Treatment with PI-PLC that specifically cleaves GPI anchors carrying one or two acyl substituents, drastically reduced transferred PrPC on the surface of IA recipient cells (Fig.5 A) indicating that transferred PrPC is linked to the surface of IA cell by the GPI anchor, and is sensitive to PI-PLC cleavage. We further investigated the importance of the GPI anchor in PrPCtransfer by replacing the GPI anchor of PrPC with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human CD44 to generate a transmembrane form of PrPC. In immunoblots, PrP-CD44 chimeric protein migrated as a broad band at ∼55 kDa and was expressed at a level similar to that of GPI-anchored PrPC in the M17-PrP cells (Fig. 5, B andC). Co-culture of the M17-PrP-CD44 cells with IA cells under conditions identical to those used with the M17-PrP cells did not result in PrPC transfer (Fig. 5 D) suggesting that the GPI anchor is required for PrPC transfer. We investigated whether CD90 (homologue of rodent Thy-1), another GPI-anchored protein, is transferred from M17-PrP cells to IA cells. We chose CD90 because CD90 is a small cell surface molecule, is highly expressed on neurons, and is likely to be present of M17-PrP cells. We found that a moderate level of CD90 is present on the surface of M17-PrP cells (Fig. 6 A). No CD90 immunoreactivity is detected on the surface of IA cells with or without PMA (shaded peak). We then co-cultured M17-PrP cells with IA cells either with or without PMA as described earlier. After co-culture, we found that CD90 immunoreactivity was detected on activated IA cells (Fig. 6 B, dark line), but not on nonactivated IA cells (gray line). These results provide direct evidence that the phenomenon of intercellular protein transfer is applicable at least to another GPI-anchored protein. We also examined whether PrPC could be transferred from M17-PrP cells to normal cells using spleen cells from PrPC−/− mice. Co-culture of PrPC−/− spleen cells with M17-PrP cells for 16 h without PMA did not result in PrPC transfer (Fig.7 A). Following activation by PMA or ConA, a T lymphocyte mitogen, PrPC was detected on the surface of spleen cells (Fig. 7, B and C). These results indicate that PrPC transfer also occurs in normal cells and is not species specific. The present study shows that after cellular activation PrPC, a GPI-anchored protein, can be transferred from neuronal cells to other cell types. Based on the levels of immunofluorescent intensity on M17-PrP cells and IA cells, we estimate that ∼1 to 5% of the PrPC present at the surface of the donor cells is transferred to the acceptor cell (n > 10). This transfer requires cellular activation by PMA, membrane docking by the GPI anchor, and direct cell to cell contact. These requirements imply that the GPI-anchored protein transfer is tightly regulated and depends on the physiologic state of cells as well as the microenvironment. Whereas these conclusions are based mainly on studies carried out with PrPC, it is likely that they are applicable to other GPI-anchored proteins, at least for CD90 as demonstrated here. PMA increases PrPC expression in donor M17-PrP cells, but up-regulation of PrPC expression is not required for PrPC transfer, because activation of recipient IA cells or PrP−/− spleen cells, which lack PrPC also resulted in PrPC transfer, albeit at a lower level. PMA activates protein kinase C (PKC), which is known to induce changes in plasma membrane properties, such as fluidity (45Chakraborty P. Ghosh D. Basu M.K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 185-190Google Scholar), ruffling (46Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Google Scholar, 47Myat M.M. Anderson S. Allen L.A. Aderem A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 611-614Google Scholar), and lipid domain reorganization (48Parolini I. Topa S. Sorice M. Pace A. Ceddia P. Montesoro E. Pavan A. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Sargiacomo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14176-14187Google Scholar, 49Orito A. Kumanogoh H. Yasaka K. Sokawa J. Hidaka H. Sokawa Y. Maekawa S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 235-241Google Scholar, 50Pitto M. Palestini P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 331-338Google Scholar). In addition to PMA, other PKC activators such as ingenol and thymeleatoxin also induce PrPC transfer. Accordingly, inhibitors of PKC such as bisindolylmaleimide I and Gö6976, which is specific for PKC α and βI isoforms, abolish PrPC transfer (not shown). Moreover, inhibitors of intracellular calcium release such as 8-(N,N′-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride also completely inhibited PrPC transfer (not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that it is the calcium-dependent PKC isozymes (α or βI or both) that are important in PrPC transfer. We also demonstrated that activation of PrPC−/− spleen cells with ConA, a T cell mitogen also resulted in PrPC transfer. Recently, it has been shown that PrPC has signaling activity that plays an important role in neuronal differentiation (7Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Google Scholar). This activity depends on PrPC coupling to the tyrosine kinase Fyn. It will be important to determine whether transferred PrPC contributes to, or generates, this activity. In agreement with our finding that direct cell to cell contact is essential for PrPC transfer, we consistently observed a small increase in cellular adhesion between activated donor cells and acceptor cells. Increase in cell adhesion may be because of activation of adhesion molecules, or a general effect on the membrane, such as the distribution and organization of membrane microdomains (52Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Google Scholar). GPI-anchored proteins associate with lipid rafts, which are membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (53Hoessli D.C. Rungger-Brandle E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 439-443Google Scholar, 54Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar). Lipid rafts play an important role in intracellular trafficking and sorting (27Muniz M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 10-15Google Scholar, 55Pomorski T. Hrafnsdottir S. Devaux P.F. van Meer G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 139-148Google Scholar). Although we have established that PrPC is associated with lipid rafts in M17-PrP cells, 2T. Liu, and M. S. Sy, unpublished results. it remains to be determined whether the transferred PrPC is also associated with lipid rafts on IA cells, and whether lipid rafts are important in intercellular transfer of GPI-anchored proteins. On confocal microscopy both CD44 and transferred PrPC formed a punctuate pattern, and partially co-distributed on the IA cell surface. This suggests that PrPC may transfer to IA cells as individual molecules, which are subsequently re-organized into membrane domains. Alternatively, membrane fragments or microdomains that contain multiple PrPC molecules might selectively be transferred. It has been reported that intercellular transfer of CD4-GPI occurred spontaneously from transfected HeLa cell to recipient cells, and direct cell-cell contact was not required. Transfer of CD4-GPI was mediated by microvesicles released from donor cells (36Anderson S.M. Yu G. Giattina M. Miller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5894-5898Google Scholar, 56Miller J.L. Giattina M. Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 215-221Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be because of the nature of donor cells; M17 is a neuronal tumor cell line, HeLa is an epithelial tumor cell line. The cellular activation and cell-cell contact-dependent mechanism described here may be cell type-dependent. This interpretation is in good accordance with the observation that the efficiency of CD4-GPI transfer is cell type-dependent. Alternatively, the expression levels of the protein may determine the efficiency of transfer. GPI-anchored proteins express at very high levels, such as in the CD4-GPI-transfected HeLa cell may permit the protein to relocate to the recipient cells without activation and adhesion. Another important issue we also addressed is whether increase in adhesion alone is sufficient for the transfer to occur. We first “force” the IA cells to adhere to the M17 cell monolayer by centrifuging the co-culture plate. We found that simply physically forcing the two cells to adhere without cellular activation does not result in PrPC transfer (not shown). This result provide additional evidence that cellular activation is critical in triggering efficient PrPC transfer. We also show that the GPI anchor is required for the transfer, because the trans-membrane protein PrP-CD44 is not transferred from M17-PrP-CD44 cells to IA cells. This finding also indicates that transfer is unlikely to result from the fusion of M17-PrP cells and IA cells as a consequence of cellular activation. The importance of the GPI anchor is also supported by our findings, which showed that free PrPC in the culture supernatant of activated M17-PrP cells was not the source of transferred PrPC on IA cells. Recent study revealed that free PrPC in the supernatants of neuronal cells lacked GPI anchors (57Parizek P. Roeckl C. Weber J. Flechsig E. Aguzzi A. Raeber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44627-44632Google Scholar). Intercellular protein transfer is not limited to PrPC because CD90, another GPI-anchored protein, is transferred from M17-PrP cells to IA cells. Recent studies suggested that PrPC and Thy-1 are organized in different domains on the surface of rat neuronal cell lines (58Madore N. Smith K.L. Graham C.H. Jen A. Brady K. Hall S. Morris R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6917-6926Google Scholar). Whether PrPC and CD90 (Thy-1) are also present on different membrane domains on M17-PrP cells and whether cellular activation alters the distribution of theses domains are not known. In contrast to intracellular trafficking, the mechanisms of activation-induced intercellular transfer of GPI-anchored proteins are not known. Lipid transfer has been reported to occur between parasites and human epithelial cells as well as neutrophils (59Rogers R.A. Jack R.M. Furlong S.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 485-491Google Scholar, 60Furlong S.T. Koziel H. Bartlett M.S. McLaughlin G.L. Shaw M.M. Jack R.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 661-668Google Scholar). There is also evidence indicating that hemifusion of the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane can occur between two cells under in vitroconditions (61Lee J. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6251-6259Google Scholar, 62Melikyan G.B. Brener S.A. Ok D.C. Cohen F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 995-1005Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that after cellular activation, there is a transient and focal fusion of the outer leaflets of the donor cell and the acceptor cell membrane. This focal fusion allows the exchange of lipids, which include GPI-anchored proteins. Experiments are now in progress to determine whether cellular activation results in the exchange of lipids between M17-PrP cells and IA cells. In addition to providing new insights into the biology of GPI-anchored protein transfer our findings may also have implications for the pathogenesis of prion diseases. In prion diseases acquired by infection, such as Kuru and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, the infectious prion most likely enters the host through the gastrointestinal tract, subsequently migrates to the spleen, and causes pathology in the central nervous system. Therefore, from the portal of entry to the target organ, the infectious prion must be transferred through different cell types. Infectious PrPSc has first been detected in the spleen even following PrPScintracerebral injection indicating that PrPSc can also travel from central nervous system to the peripheral tissues (63Fraser H. Dickinson A.G. Nature. 1970; 226: 462-463Google Scholar, 64Eklund C.M. Kennedy R.C. Hadlow W.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1967; 117: 15-22Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been known since the 1970s that activation of the immune system enhances susceptibility as well as shortens the incubation time in experimentally infected mice (65Dickinson A.G. Fraser H. McConnell I. Outram G.W. Nature. 1978; 272: 54-55Google Scholar, 66Marsh R.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1981; 134: 359-363Google Scholar). Both PrPC and PrPSc are GPI anchored on the cell surface (20Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14945-14949Google Scholar, 26Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Google Scholar, 67Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Google Scholar). Whether PrPSc also transfers between cells in a similar manner to PrPC is not known. It has been reported that PrPC to PrPSc conversion required PrPSc and PrPC to be present in the same continuous membrane (68Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Dorward D.W. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Google Scholar). This result suggests that PrPSchas to be transferred from infected cell to the uninfected cell surface in order for the conversion to occur. The GPI anchor-mediated intercellular transfer of PrPSc might provide a mechanism for this transfer. Our results indicate that activation-induced PrPC transfer may promote or enhance the conversion by providing PrPC negative cells or cells with low levels of PrPC with more substrate. On the other hand, the transfer of PrPSc would implant the seed of the infectious agent. Experiments are now in progress to determine whether transfer of PrPSc also occur under similar culture conditions.

This domain, present on the DNA accession numbers AP001078 and AP001709, was ∼535 kb in size and contained 17 high glycine-tyrosine and 7 high sulfur KAP genes, as well as 9 KAP pseudogenes. Based on amino acid sequence comparisons of the encoded proteins, the KAP genes could be divided into seven high glycine-tyrosine gene families (KAP6–KAP8, and KAP19–KAP22) and four high sulfur gene families (KAP11, KAP13, KAP15, and KAP23). The high glycine-tyrosine genes described here appear to represent the complete set of this type of KAP genes present in the human genome. Both systematic cDNA isolation studies from an arrayed scalp cDNA library and in situ hybridization expression studies of all of the KAP genes identified in the 21q22.1 region revealed varying degrees and regions of expression of 11 members of the high tyrosine-glycine genes and 6 members of the high sulfur KAP genes in the hair forming compartment.

The high glycine-tyrosine genes described here appear to represent the complete set of this type of KAP genes present in the human genome. Both systematic cDNA isolation studies from an arrayed scalp cDNA library and in situ hybridization expression studies of all of the KAP genes identified in the 21q22.1 region revealed varying degrees and regions of expression of 11 members of the high tyrosine-glycine genes and 6 members of the high sulfur KAP genes in the hair forming compartment. The hair follicle represents one of the few organs of the body that, throughout life, undergoes alternating cycles of growth, senescence, and rest (1Stenn K.S. Paus R. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 449-494Google Scholar). Morphologically, the hair follicle is composed of external epithelial compartments, the outer and inner root sheaths, the companion layer, and a central hair fiber-forming (trichocytic) compartment, comprising the matrix, cuticle, and cortex. Occasionally, a centrally lying medulla is present in specific hair types. Growth of the hair originates in matrix cells located in the bulb of the hair follicle. This hair bulb surrounds a dermal fibroblast condensate, termed the dermal papilla, which is important for hair follicle morphogenesis (1Stenn K.S. Paus R. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 449-494Google Scholar). The main structural proteins of the hair fiber are the hair keratins and the hair keratin-associated proteins, KAPs, 1The abbreviations used are: KAP, keratin-associated protein; ISH, in situhybridization. the latter being encoded by a large number of multigene families (2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar). Hair keratins, a subset of the large keratin family whose members are found in all cells of epithelial origin (3Fuchs E. Weber K. Richardson C.C. Annual Review of Biochemistry. Annual Reviews Inc., Palo Alto, CA1994: 345-382Google Scholar, 4Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Google Scholar), represent two multigene families, the type I (acidic) and type II (basic) families that comprise 15 members in humans (5Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Wolf C. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 464-472Google Scholar, 6Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Heck M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Google Scholar). They form the 8–10-nm intermediate filaments of trichocytes by co-polymerization of type I and type II members, which are differentially expressed during hair fiber development (7Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Winter H. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35123-35132Google Scholar, 8Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Winter H. Praetzel S. Beckhaus U. Rackwitz H.-R. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19874-19884Google Scholar). KAPs, which form the matrix between the hair keratin intermediate filament bundles through extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with cysteine residues in the head and tail domains of hair keratins, possess either high cysteine or high glycine-tyrosine content (2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar) and are further divided into three broad groups containing, to date 17 families. These are the high sulfur families KAP1–KAP3 and KAP10–KAP16, which contain less than 30 mol % cysteine (9–20), the ultra-high sulfur families KAP4, KAP5, KAP9, and KAP17, with more than 30 mol % cysteine (20Rogers M.A. Langbein L.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 625-659Google Scholar), which can be further divided into families with high (>60 mol %, KAP6 family) and lower (< 60 mol %, KAP7 and KAP8 families) glycine-tyrosine content. The majority of the KAP members were initially identified in non-human species (sheep, mouse, rabbit). Recently, however, a large domain of human ultra-high/high sulfur KAP gene families (the KAP1–KAP3, KAP4, KAP9, KAP16, and KAP17 families) have been identified on chromosome 17q21.2 and their expression in the hair follicle partially characterized (20Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Korn B. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar, 31Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Ito M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 226-231Google Scholar). Moreover, chromosomal in situ hybridization studies using specific probes derived from human KAP5 family members have located new KAP genes to chromosomes 11p15 and 11q13 (32MacKinnon P.J. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Baker E.G. MacKinnon R.N. Hyland V.J. Callen D.F. Sutherland G.R. Mamm. Genome. 1991; 1: 53-56Google Scholar). In addition, the sequencing of human chromosome 21 has recently led to the identification of a further KAP gene domain on its long arm (21q23) (33Hattori M. Fujiyama A. Taylor T.D. Watanabe H. Yada T. Park H.S. Toyoda A. Ishii K. Totoki Y. Choi D.K. Soeda E. Ohki M. Takagi T. Sakaki Y. Taudien S. Blechschmidt K. Polley A. Menzel U. Delabar J. Kumpf K. Lehmann R. Patterson D. Reichwald K. Rump A. Schillhabel M. Schudy A. Nature. 2000; 405: 311-319Google Scholar). In a continuation of our previous KAP gene studies (20Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Korn B. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar), we describe here the identification of a novel domain of 24 KAP genes (17 high glycine-tyrosine and 7 high sulfur KAP genes) and 9 KAP pseudogenes on chromosome 21q22.1. The genes could be grouped into 11 families, five of which are novel. Screening of a human scalp cDNA library as well as mRNA expression studies showed the expression of 17 individual KAP members, all of which were essentially localized to the hair cortex and several which also showed matrix and cuticular expression. Analysis of the EBI/GeneBankTM data base with DNA sequences from regions encoding previously described KAP genes/cDNAs (KAP6–KAP8; KAP10–KAP15 family members) using the BLASTN2 program led to the discovery of a contiguous domain of KAP genes on the human EBI/GeneBankTM data base sequences AP001708 and AP001709(Fig. 1). Further DNA homology analysis using the program SIMILARITY led to the identification of 33 putative gene/pseudogene loci. Genes with open reading frames that showed high homology to KAP genes from other species were translated into protein sequences and multalignments made with known KAP family members using the CLUSTAL program. Evolutionary tree analysis of these proteins was performed using the CLUSTREE program. Identification of putative amino acid repeat structures was made using the program DOTPLOT. All of the programs named above are part of the Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resource. 3′-noncoding region PCR fragments from each putative KAP gene were amplified from human genomic DNA (see Table I) and used to screen an arrayed human scalp cDNA library by procedures described previously (20Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Korn B. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). Briefly, the arrayed cDNA library was screened using 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS as prehybridization/hybridization buffer. 1 × 106 cpm/ml of hybridization solution of the respective32P-labeled PCR fragment (see Table I) was used as a probe. The library was hybridized overnight at 59 °C. Posthybridization washes were performed three times using 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS at 59 oC for 30 min. The filters were autoradiographed using Kodak XAR5 film (Amersham Biosciences).

Open table in a new tab The isolated cDNA clones were sequenced using fluorescent dye terminator cycle sequencing (Big Dye DNA Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) and analyzed on an ABI310 capillary DNA Sequencing Apparatus. DNA sequence assembly and correction was performed using the STADEN software package (Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resource). ISH on cryostat sections of human scalp (kindly provided by B. Cribier, Strasbourg, France) and, in parallel, plucked beard hair follicles, were performed as described previously (34Langbein L. Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 57-71Google Scholar, 35Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Praetzel S. Moll I. Krieg T. Winter H. Schweizer J. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 187-194Google Scholar) using the PCR products shown in Table I, which were subcloned into the pCR4.1 plasmid vector (Invitrogen). Antisense35S-labeled transcripts of all of these subclones were used for the detection of the respective KAP mRNA species as described previously (8Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Winter H. Praetzel S. Beckhaus U. Rackwitz H.-R. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19874-19884Google Scholar, 34Langbein L. Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 57-71Google Scholar). The ISH signals were visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeis, Jena, Oberkochen, Germany). Simultaneous visualization of reflected ISH signals through epi-illumination and transmitted light in bright field were combined by overlay using pseudocolors (transmission image in green, electronically changed to black/white; reflection image (ISH signal) shown in red). Our recent detection of a high/ultra-high sulfur KAP gene domain on chromosome 17 led us to look further for human orthologs of the high glycine-tyrosine KAP gene families, KAP6–8, previously described in other species (27Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Google Scholar, 28Kuczek E.S. Rogers G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 79-85Google Scholar, 29Aoki N. Ito M. J. Biol.

This resulted in the discovery of a putative KAP gene domain on chromosome 21q22.1, a region not previously identified during the sequencing of this chromosome (33Hattori M. Fujiyama A. Taylor T.D. Watanabe H. Yada T. Park H.S. Toyoda A. Ishii K. Totoki Y. Choi D.K. Soeda E. Ohki M. Takagi T. Sakaki Y. Taudien S. Blechschmidt K. Polley A. Menzel U. Delabar J. Kumpf K. Lehmann R. Patterson D. Reichwald K. Rump A. Schillhabel M. Schudy A. Nature. 2000; 405: 311-319Google Scholar). We undertook a thorough DNA homology analysis and identified two contiguous genomic DNA sequences, AP001708 and AP001709, on chromosome 21q22.1, which harbored 24 high glycine-tyrosine and high sulfur KAP genes as well as 9 KAP pseudogenes (Fig. 1). The KAP gene domain analyzed covered an area of 535 kb straddling one end of both genomic sequences. All KAP genes possessed a methionine start codon and an open reading frame coding for proteins with either high glycine-tyrosine or high sulfur amino acid content. They displayed putative polyadenylation signals within a region ∼400 bp downstream of their stop codon and nearly all of them contained a presumptive TATAA box sequence within 100 bp upstream of the initiation codon. In addition, a variety of both high glycine-tyrosine and high sulfur KAP pseudogenes (see TableII) were identified by either the absence of an in-frame initiation codon in the region of homology or by the occurrence of frame shifts in the respective homology regions. As a rule, the genes were small (less than 1 kb in size) and comprised only one exon. The intragenic distances between the KAP genes varied widely from ∼5–100 kb, and in general, the genes possessed no unique direction of transcription. The entire gene domain could be subdivided into one large group of 8 high sulfur KAP genes/pseudogene on one end, followed by a central group of 24 high glycine-tyrosine KAP genes/pseudogenes and ending thereafter with one high sulfur KAP gene (see Fig. 1). No putative KAP genes could be found on the DNA sequences immediately adjacent to this domain, but the presence of a further potential high sulfur KAP gene domain, the one initially identified during the sequencing of chromosome 21 (33), was confirmed. 2M.

See “Discussion” for details. Open table in a new tab The KAP genes listed in Fig. 1 were translated into amino acid sequences followed by a multialignment of the various KAP proteins. Included into these multiple sequence comparisons were both high glycine-tyrosine and high sulfur KAP proteins from other species, which had already been appointed to distinct KAP families or were found in the literature without special classification. This allowed the creation of an evolutionary tree in which human and non-human KAP proteins were grouped into distinct families (Fig. 2). In addition to the human orthologs of six previously described KAP families (KAP6, KAP7, KAP8, KAP11, KAP13, KAP15), we identified six novel KAP families, four high glycine-tyrosine KAP families (KAP19–KAP22) and one high sulfur KAP family (KAP23). Human orthologs segregating with the members of the murine high glycine-tyrosine KAP18 family (36Tkatchenko A.V. Visconti R.P. Shang L. Papenbrock T. Pruett N.D. Ito T. Ogawa M. Awgulewitsch A. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 1547-1558Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”) or the sheep high sulfur KAP10 (2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H.

Genomics. 1998; 54: 437-442Google Scholar) were not detected in the evolutionary tree (Fig. 2). The human high glycine-tyrosine KAPs can be divided into seven families, three of which are counterparts of KAP families previously described in other species: The KAP6 family with three members, KAP6.1–KAP6.3 (Figs. 2 and 3) and the hKAP7 and hKAP8 families with one member each, KAP7.1 and KAP8.1, respectively (Figs. 2,4, and 5) (27Fratini A. Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4511-4518Google Scholar, 28Kuczek E.S. Rogers G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 79-85Google Scholar, 29Aoki N. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30512-30518Google Scholar). The KAP6 family members range in size from 6.6 to 11.1 kDa and exhibit a high content of glycine and tyrosine residues (54.6–60.5 mol %, see Table II). Except for KAP6.3, the completely identified KAP6 proteins from all species display unique amino-terminal (MCG(S/-)YY(G/R)NY) and carboxyl-terminal (GS(G/S)FGYY(Y/-)) sequence motifs (Fig. 3). Both the 9.3-kDa KAP7.1 and the 6.8-kDa KAP8 proteins not only exhibit a particularly high sequence homology with their non-human counterparts (Figs. 4 and 5) but also display a particularly low glycine-tyrosine content (34.4 and 42.8 mol %; Table II). All of the known KAP8 proteins from various species show a characteristic carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence (RR(F/Y)(W/S)PFALY) (Fig. 4). However, the first nine amino acids of human KAP8.1 are significantly different from the orthologous mouse and sheep sequences (Fig. 4).Figure 4Multiple sequence alignment of KAP8 family members.

The large KAP19 family consists of 7 members, KAP19.1–KAP19.7, whose size ranges from 5.7 to 9.1 kDa and which exhibit a rather high glycine-tyrosine content (∼55 mol %) (Fig. 6 and Table II). All KAP19 family members have distinctive amino-terminal (M(S)/M(/R)(Y/H)(Y/S)(G/N)(S/N) YY, one exception is KAP19.2) and carboxyl-terminal ((F/S)SGFY, one exception is hKAP19.4) amino acid sequences. Both the KAP20 and the KAP21 families consist of two members, KAP20.1–KAP20.2 and KAP21.1–KAP21.2, respectively, while the KAP22 family comprises only one member, KAP22.1 (Fig. 5). The KAP20 proteins range in size between 6.2 and 6.9 kDa, show short, conserved amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences (M(I/C)YY(R/S)(G/N)YY and RY(W/-)(S/-)(Y/C)GFY) (Fig. 5) and possess the highest glycine-tyrosine content (61.5–67.8 mol %; Table II) of all high glycine-tyrosine KAPs described here. The KAP21 proteins exhibit sizes between 7.9 and 8.5 kDa and possess a distinctly lower glycine-tyrosine content of 50.6–53.1 mol % (Table II), as well as family specific amino- (MCCNYY) and carboxyl-terminal (CYS(S/C)C(Y)/-/(C)) sequences (Fig. 5). Finally, the single KAP22.1 protein is 5.2 kDa in size and exhibits the second lowest glycine-tyrosine content (37.5 mol %; Table II). All of the high glycine-tyrosine KAPs show a high degree of dimeric repeat structures, usually consisting of glycine in the first position followed by either tyrosine, cysteine, serine, or glycine in the second position. The degree of repetitiveness is highly variable ranging from 10 to 30 repeats for the KAP6 proteins and 3–34 repeats for the KAP8, KAP20, and KAP21 family members. In contrast, KAP7 and KAP22.1 contain only few repeat structures. The high sulfur KAP portion of the gene domain described here contains four distinct families, three of which, KAP11, KAP13, KAP15, have been previously characterized in other species (15Huh N. Kashiwagi M. Konishi C. Hashimoto Y. Kohno Y. Nomura S. Kuroki T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 716-720Google Scholar, 16Takaishi M. Takata Y. Kuroki T. Huh N.-H. J. Invest.

Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Korn B. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). The largest high sulfur family is KAP13, which consists of four members, KAP13.1–KAP13.4 (Fig. 7). The human and mouse KAP13 proteins range in size from 17.7 to 19.2 kDa, possess 12.0–12.8 mol % cysteine residues (Table II), and contain a family specific amino-terminal end (M(S/V)Y(N/S)CCS) as well as a high degree of positionally conserved amino acids (cysteine (14Frenkel M.J. Powell B.C. Ward K.A. Sleigh M.J. Rogers G.E. Genomics. 1989; 4: 182-191Google Scholar), serine (13Powell B.C. Sleigh M.J. Ward K.A. Rogers G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 5327-5346Google Scholar), proline (7Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Winter H. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol.

The remaining three human high sulfur KAP families, KAP11, KAP15 and KAP23, consist of only single members. Both KAP11.1 and KAP15.1 show a particularly high sequence homology to their respective mouse orthologs (Figs. 7 and8) and exhibit 14.1 and 10.9 mol % cysteine residues (Table II). The KAP13 family members (size range 17.7–19.2 kDa) and the single KAP11 member (17.1 kDa) represent the largest KAPs described here. Finally, the novel KAP23.1 segregates separately from the other KAP members in the evolutionary tree analysis (Fig. 2) and was, therefore, assigned a new family (KAP23) (Fig. 8). KAP23.1 encodes a 6.8-kDa protein that possesses 7.7 mol % cysteine as well as a high mol % of serine (20.0 mol %), glycine (13.8 mol %), and leucine (13.8 mol %). No obvious repeat structure is present in this protein.Figure 8Multiple sequence alignments of KAP15 and KAP23 family members. Repeat structures are boxed. For further details, see Fig. 3. af162800 is a mouse sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The high sulfur KAPs presented here show, like the previously described human high sulfur KAP1–KAP3 families, cysteine-containing repeat structures. These structures, however, possess a lower degree of conservation when compared with the human KAP1–KAP3 families (20Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Korn B. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). For example, KAP11.1, like its mouse counterpart (15Huh N. Kashiwagi M. Konishi C. Hashimoto Y. Kohno Y. Nomura S. Kuroki T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 716-720Google Scholar), exhibits a fairly strong decapeptide repeat structure covering the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein (see Fig. 7). The degree of repetitiveness is higher, however, in the mouse sequence. In a similar manner, mouse KAP13.1 contains a strongly conserved decameric repeat structure containing an initial CQ(L/E) motif (16Takaishi M. Takata Y. Kuroki T. Huh N.-H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 128-132Google Scholar), which is only partially seen in the human KAP13 family members (Fig. 7). Both, however, possess, in addition, generally less well conserved pentameric repeats in their carboxyterminal regions. A pentameric SL(G/D)CG motif is also seen in human KAP15.1. In contrast KAP23.1 does not appear to possess an obvious repeat structure (Fig. 8). 3′-Noncoding region PCR products from all of the KAP genes presented in this study were used as probes to screen a previously described arrayed human scalp cDNA library (20Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Korn B. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). This led to the isolation of three high glycine-tyrosine (KAP7.1, KAP8.1, and KAP19.1) and two high sulfur (KAP11.1 and KAP13.1) KAP cDNA clones (see Table I). The low number of positive clones isolated, coupled with the identification of a partial KAP6.1 cDNA via 3′-RACE analysis of follicular RNA,2 led us to believe that most of the KAP genes analyzed possessed an expression level below the limits of detection in our arrayed cDNA library, which contains only 26,000 clones. We therefore subcloned all the PCR products used in the cDNA library screen (Table I) and used them as cR"

By using a neuron-astrocyte coculture model, we have investigated the effects of T3-treated astrocytes on cerebellar neuronal differentiation in vitro. Neurons plated onto T3-astrocytes presented a 40–60% increase on the total neurite length and an increment in the number of neurites. Treatment of astrocytes with epidermal growth factor (EGF) yielded similar results, suggesting that this growth factor might mediate T3-induced neuritogenesis. EGF and T3 treatment increased fibronectin and laminin expression by astrocytes, suggesting that astrocyte neurite permissiveness induced by these treatments is mostly due to modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Such increase in ECM protein expression as well as astrocyte permissiveness to neurite outgrowth was reversed by the specific EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin. Moreover, studies using selective inhibitors of several transduction-signaling cascades indicated that modulation of ECM proteins by EGF is mainly through a synergistic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. In this work, we provide evidence of a novel role of EGF as an intermediary factor of T3 action on cerebellar ontogenesis. By modulating the content of ECM proteins, EGF increases neurite outgrowth. Our data reveal an important role of astrocytes as mediators of T3-induced cerebellar development and partially elucidate the role of EGF and mitogen-activated protein kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways on this process.

Although the T3 role on central nervous system (CNS) morphogenesis is well documented, the precise mechanism of hormone action is not completely understood. To gain insights into T3 effects on CNS we have focused on the cerebellum ontogenesis, which is one of the most dramatically affected brain structures in hypothyroidism (6Nicholson J.L. Altman J. Brain Res. 1972; 44: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 7Morte B. Manzano J. Scanlan T. Vennström B. Bernal J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3985-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Most of the granular cells of the cerebellum arise from the external granular cell layer (EGL). Postnatally, these cells migrate from the premigratory zone of the EGL to the internal granular layer, leaving their axons behind to produce the molecular layer. These events are accompanied by a progressive morphological differentiation of Purkinje cells characterized by perisomatic extensions and dendritic trees (8Miale I.L. Sidman R.L. Exp. Neurol. 1961; 47: 26-41Google Scholar, 9Komuro H. Yacubova E. Rakic P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 527-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Anderson G.W. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although cerebellar histogenesis is well studied, the molecular mechanisms that control proliferation and differentiation of granular cells are still unknown. These processes have been shown to undergo dramatic modulation by thyroid hormone (6Nicholson J.L. Altman J. Brain Res. 1972; 44: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 10Anderson G.W. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Cayrou C. Denver R.J. Puymirat J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2242-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Besides a series of abnormalities found in the cerebellar cortex, hypothyroidism causes a decrease in EGL proliferation rate, increased neuronal death in the internal granular layer, impaired migration of granular cells, and a deficiency in the elaboration of Purkinje cell dendritic trees, spines, and synapses (6Nicholson J.L. Altman J. Brain Res. 1972; 44: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).Although a few genes have been shown to be directly modulated by T3 in the cerebellum, the molecular mechanism of T3 action on this brain region is still controversial (12Koibuchi N. Fukuda H. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3955-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Anderson G.W. Hagen S.G. Larson R.J. Strait K.A. Schwartz H.L. Mariash C.N. Oppenheimer J.H. Mol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4373-4380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that such endocrine regulation of cerebellar development might be the result of T3-dependent modulation of secretion of several growth factors such as neurotrophin 3, nerve growth factor, insulin growth factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (15Beck K.D. Knusel B. Hefti F. Neuroscience. 1993; 52: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Figueiredo B.C. Almazan G. Ma Y. Tetzlaff W. Miller F.D. Cuello A.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 17: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Astrocytes have been pointed out as the major source of trophic factors in the CNS (17Garcia-Segura L.M. Naftolin F. Hutchison J.B. Azcoitia I. Chowen J.A. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Dong Y. Benveniste E.M.

The fact that thyroid hormone treatment of astrocytes is associated in vitro with the secretion of several growth factors makes the astrocyte a putative candidate for mediating T3 action on neural histogenesis (19Gomes F.C.A. Maia C.G. Menezes J.R.L. Moura Neto V. Glia. 1999; 25: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Trentin A.G. Alvarez-Silva M. Moura Neto V. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 281: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we described a novel mechanism for T3 action over granular neurons mediated by astrocytes. We demonstrated that cerebellar astrocytes treated by T3 secrete a combination of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tumor necrosis factor-β, which induces proliferation of cerebellar granular neurons in vitro(19Gomes F.C.A. Maia C.G. Menezes J.R.L. Moura Neto V. Glia. 1999; 25: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In the present work, we used an in vitro system of neuron-astrocyte coculture to assess the effects of T3 mediated by astrocytes on another step of cerebellar morphogenesis such as granule cell differentiation. We provide evidence that EGF secreted by astrocytes in response to T3 presents a binary role in cerebellar ontogenesis; acting directly on neurons, EGF promotes proliferation of granular cell precursors, and indirectly, EGF increases neuronal morphological differentiation by modulating the content of two astrocytic extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, laminin and fibronectin. Furthermore, we suggest that EGF modulation of ECM proteins is mainly mediated by activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. Together, our work gives glial cells a novel attribute as mediators of the endocrine-regulated cerebellar development and describes an additional role for EGF on brain morphogenesis.DISCUSSIONIn the present work, we provide the first evidence that EGF secreted by T3-treated astrocytes induces EGL neurons to undergo differentiation initiated by outgrowth of neurites. Such an event is mediated by EGF modulation of laminin and fibronectin astrocytic expression through MAPK and PI3K pathways. The present findings together with those previously described by us (19Gomes F.C.A. Maia C.G. Menezes J.R.L. Moura Neto V. Glia. 1999; 25: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggest a binary role for EGF on cerebellar ontogenesis, directly, on granular precursors proliferation and, indirectly, through ECM components in neurite outgrowth. Our data create a new scenario on the role of EGF and glial cells as mediators of T3 action on cerebellar development.Astrocytes have been well recognized as the major source of ECM components including fibronectin and laminin both in vivoand in vitro (22Garcia-Abreu J. Cavalcante L.A. Moura Neto V. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Menet V. Giménez y Ribotta M. Chauvet N. Drian M.J. Lannoy J. Colucci-Guyon E. Privat A. J.

The pattern of these ECM proteins on the astrocyte surface, which is highly modulated by thyroid hormone, provides directional cues to neurite outgrowth (22Garcia-Abreu J. Cavalcante L.A. Moura Neto V. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Freire E. Gomes F.C.A. Linden R. Moura Neto V. Coelho-Sampaio T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4867-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Farwell A.P. Dubord-Tomasetti S.A.

Brain Res. 2001; 126: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Trentin A.G. Moura Neto V. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).We now report that astrocytes treated by T3 or EGF greatly increased laminin and fibronectin fibrils in the extracellular space, thus providing a permissive substrate to neurite outgrowth. Our data contrast with those obtained from Farwell and Dubord-Tomasetti (29Farwell A.P. Dubord-Tomasetti S.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5014-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that T4 but not T3 increases laminin expression. We believe, however, that this apparent discrepancy between these two works most likely reflect fundamental differences in the technical approaches such as hormone treatment schedule, hormone concentration, and differences in culture conditions. Furthermore, those authors have cultured astrocytes derived from whole brain, whereas we have used in our study astrocytes derived from cerebellum. It has been speculated that spatial differences in the expression of T3 receptors account for the variety of T3 response elicited in brain structures (3Gomes F.C.A. Lima F.R.S. Trentin A.G. Moura Neto V. Prog. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Lima F.R.S. Gonçalves N. Gomes F.C.A. de Freitas M.S. Moura Neto V. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1998; 16: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The addition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin, to T3-treated astrocytes greatly inhibited the ECM increment elicited by the hormone as well as impaired astrocyte permissivity to neurite extension. These data strongly suggest that T3-induced ECM augmentation in astrocytes is mediated by EGF. Furthermore, because no additive effects on neurite outgrowth were observed in astrocytes treated by EGF and T3 in combination, it seems likely that the two growth factors act probably through the same pathway, i.e. induction of ECM components. Because T3-astrocytes already produce EGF (19Gomes F.C.A. Maia C.G. Menezes J.R.L. Moura Neto V. Glia. 1999; 25: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we assume that the addition of exogenous EGF raises the growth factor concentration beyond the saturation limit optimum for its effect.T3 has been proposed to directly modulate some ECM genes (31Alvarez-Dolado M. González-Sancho J.M. Bernal J. Muñoz A. Neuroscience. 1998; 84: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Alvarez-Dolado M. Ruiz M. Del Rı́o J.A. Alcántara S. Burgaya F. Sheldon M. Nakajima K. Bernal J. Howell B.W. Curran T. Soriano E. Muñoz A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6979-6993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, a direct T3 regulation has not been undoubtedly reported for laminin and fibronectin. Our results do not completely rule out a T3 direct regulation of these proteins; however, they reveal an additional new mechanism for ECM protein modulation mediated by EGF in the NS. Together with ours, the recent finding that fibronectin mRNA is increased by activation of the EGFR in cardiac fibroblasts (33Matsubara H. Moriguchi Y. Mori Y. Masaki H. Tsutsumi Y. Shibasaki Y. Uchiyama-Tanaka Y. Fujiyama S. Koyama Y. Nose-Fujiyama A. Iba S. Tateishi E. Iwasaka T. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2000; 212: 187-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and EGFR gene amplification is associated with laminin overexpression in tumor cell lines (34Ono Y. Nakanishi Y. Gotoh M. Sakamoto M. Hirotashi S. Cancer Lett. 2002; 175: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggest that EGF modulation of laminin and fibronectin might be a more general process occurring in several tissues. We completely rule out a direct action of EGF on cerebellar neurite outgrowth since addition of EGF (data not shown) or T3CM (which contains EGF) directly on neuronal cultures does not increase neuritogenesis. This is the first time a T3 action on ECM protein expression and neuronal outgrowth mediated by an intermediary growth factor in NS is clearly described.EGF is implicated in widespread effects in CNS such as proliferation and differentiation of a variety of neuronal progenitors, postmitotic neurons, and glial cells (35Fricker-Gates R.A. Winkler C. Kirik D. Rosenblad C. Carpenter M.K. Björklund A. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 165: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Yamada M. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). EGF exerts most of its cellular actions through activation of the EGF receptor, which belongs to a family of structurally related tyrosine kinase receptors (37Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity for EGFR has been demonstrated in several regions of the embryonic and adult brains such as frontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum (36Yamada M. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Kornblum H.I. Hussaim R.J. Bronstein J.M. Gall C.M. Lee D.C. Seroogy K.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 380: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which support a role for EGF during brain development. Signaling through EGFR is triggered by ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and tyrosine phosphorylation and is classically associated with activation of the Raf-MEK-MAP/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (36Yamada M. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 39Danielsen A.J. Maihle N.J. Growth Factors. 2002; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In our work, the specific inhibitor of MEK1/2 kinase, PD98059, greatly inhibited laminin and fibronectin overexpression induced by EGF. Similar results were yielded by administration of the specific EGFR inhibitor, tyrphostin, which suggested that MAPK pathway is activated downstream of EGFR tyrosine kinase (data not shown). Although the molecular mechanism of ECM modulation by EGF in NS has not been described yet, EGFR transactivation was found to up-regulate fibronectin in a MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent manner in other systems (40Kaiura T.L.

Iwasaka T. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Activation of EGFR is followed by induction of the Ras signaling pathway characterized by a kinase cascade, including Raf, MAPK kinase, and MAPK. It has been suggested that activated MAPK can translocate into the nucleus where it phosphorylates and activates several transcriptional factors (36Yamada M. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 51: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the Ras-MAPK cascade described above is just one of the transcytoplasmic nuclear-signaling pathways activated by EGF (43Yart A. Chap H. Raynal P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This is the case of PI3K, the activity of which has been described to be stimulated by EGF. PI3Ks are a conserved family of lipid kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of the 3′ position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides (43Yart A. Chap H. Raynal P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). They produce lipids implicated in several cellular processes. Although the mechanism involved in EGFR activation of MAP does not display an obvious role for PI3K, pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K were found to strongly interfere with MAPK pathways in several systems (43Yart A.

In agreement with these data, the addition of the PI3K pathway inhibitor, LY294002, completely abolished EGF-induced ECM overexpression. Recent evidence has been accumulated pointing a functional cross-talking between PI3K and MAP kinase pathways (43Yart A. Chap H. Raynal P. Biochim. Biophys.

The addition of the protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720 had no effect on EGF-induced ECM overexpression and neuritogenesis. Taken together, two models for the T3/EGF neuritogenesis induced by astrocytes might be proposed. Thyroid hormone induces cerebellar astrocytes to secrete EGF, which induces neuronal proliferation (Ref. 19Gomes F.C.A. Maia C.G. Menezes J.R.L. Moura Neto V. Glia. 1999; 25: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and Fig.9). By autocrine mechanism, EGF activates astrocytic EGFR. Transactivation of EGFR leads to 1) induction of PI3K followed by MAPK pathway activation, or 2) alternatively, EGFR may activate two separate cascades, a PI3K-dependent pathway and the classical MAPK pathway (Fig.9). The fact that the administration of LY294002 and PD98059 alone is sufficient to completely inhibit ECM overproduction, and concomitant addition does not yield additive inhibition (data not shown) call in favor of converging rather than independent pathways. Full elucidation of the molecular mechanisms implicating PI3K and MAPK pathways await further experiments.We reported a new attribute of EGF as mediator of thyroid hormone action on cerebellar development. Our results suggest that EGF might play a crucial role in distinct aspects of granular cell development in culture. How these in vitro results could account forin vivo cerebellar ontogenesis? Expression of the EGFR and T3 receptor does appear to be temporally uncoordinated in cerebellum. The early germinative zone of the EGL (E15–19) was not undoubtedly reported to express T3 receptor, which will be expressed later in the development in the postmitotic premigratory zone of EGL and in the internal granular layer (49Bradley D.J. Towle H.C. Young W.S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2288-2302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas EGFR mRNA is highly expressed in the EGL (50Seroogy K.B. Gall C.M. Lee D.C. Kornblum H.I. Brain Res. 1995; 670: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These data highlight the importance of a mediator for T3 activity (possibly glia cells via EGF secretion) at least on these early events of cerebellum ontogenesis.Other factors also modulated by thyroid hormone such as the neurotrophins family have been also implicated in the regulation of several steps of cerebellar development (51Lindholm D. Hammer S. Zirrgiebel U. Dev. Neurobiol. 1997; 5: 83-94Google Scholar). Our work points to EGF as an additional growth factor in the modulation of cerebellar granular cell ontogenesis, thus providing support for a multiple novel neurotrophic activity of growth factors in the development of cerebellar cortex. The fact that replacement of neurotrophin-3 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor results in some rescue of cerebellar development in hypothyroid animals (52Neveu I. Arenas E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 631-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) points to the possibility of using glia-derived growth factors as putative therapy to congenital hypothyroidism. Understanding the molecular relationship of thyroid hormones and neuron-astrocyte interactions could open in the future a new avenue to explore and rescue the abnormalities exhibited by the hypothyroid brain. Our work provides the first evidence that EGF secreted by astrocytes mediates thyroid hormone neuritogenesis in the cerebellum. The complexity of the processes underlying axonal growth suggests the existence of multiple sites of possible regulation. Therefore, it is likely that modulation of ECM proteins by EGF reported here in this paper might provide a potential mechanism by which this morphogenetic hormone exerts its effects on neurite outgrowth and establishment of neuronal connections.

Although the T3 role on central nervous system (CNS) morphogenesis is well documented, the precise mechanism of hormone action is not completely understood. To gain insights into T3 effects on CNS we have focused on the cerebellum ontogenesis, which is one of the most dramatically affected brain structures in hypothyroidism (6Nicholson J.L. Altman J. Brain Res. 1972; 44: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 7Morte B. Manzano J. Scanlan T. Vennström B. Bernal J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3985-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most of the granular cells of the cerebellum arise from the external granular cell layer (EGL). Postnatally, these cells migrate from the premigratory zone of the EGL to the internal granular layer, leaving their axons behind to produce the molecular layer. These events are accompanied by a progressive morphological differentiation of Purkinje cells characterized by perisomatic extensions and dendritic trees (8Miale I.L. Sidman R.L. Exp.

Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although cerebellar histogenesis is well studied, the molecular mechanisms that control proliferation and differentiation of granular cells are still unknown. These processes have been shown to undergo dramatic modulation by thyroid hormone (6Nicholson J.L. Altman J. Brain Res. 1972; 44: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 10Anderson G.W. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Cayrou C. Denver R.J. Puymirat J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2242-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Besides a series of abnormalities found in the cerebellar cortex, hypothyroidism causes a decrease in EGL proliferation rate, increased neuronal death in the internal granular layer, impaired migration of granular cells, and a deficiency in the elaboration of Purkinje cell dendritic trees, spines, and synapses (6Nicholson J.L. Altman J. Brain Res. 1972; 44: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although a few genes have been shown to be directly modulated by T3 in the cerebellum, the molecular mechanism of T3 action on this brain region is still controversial (12Koibuchi N. Fukud"
https://openalex.org/W2078809854,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are associated with the conversion of cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a misfolded oligomeric form, PrPSc. Here we have examined the kinetics of folding and unfolding reactions for the recombinant human prion protein C-terminal fragment 90–231 at pH 4.8 and 7.0. The stopped-flow data provide clear evidence for the population of an intermediate on the refolding pathway of the prion protein as indicated by a pronounced curvature in chevron plots and the presence of significant burst phase amplitude in the refolding kinetics. In addition to its role in the normal prion protein folding, this intermediate likely represents a crucial monomeric precursor of the pathogenic PrPSc isoform. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are associated with the conversion of cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a misfolded oligomeric form, PrPSc.

In addition to its role in the normal prion protein folding, this intermediate likely represents a crucial monomeric precursor of the pathogenic PrPSc isoform. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases, are a group of intriguing neurodegenerative disorders that include scrapie in sheep and goat, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic waste disorder in deer and elk, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease in humans (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). These diseases are associated with conformational conversion of a normal prion protein, PrPC, 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular prion protein; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, pathogenic PrP isoform.1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular prion protein; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, pathogenic PrP isoform. into a misfolded isoform, PrPSc. According to the “protein-only” hypothesis (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar), the transmission of the disease does not require nucleic acids, and the prion pathogen consists solely of PrPSc. The latter conformer is believed to act as an infectious agent by catalyzing self-propagating conversion of endogenous PrPC into the pathogenic PrPScisoform. Although the ultimate proof for the protein-only hypothesis is still missing (2Caughey B. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 751-754Google Scholar), the central role of prion protein in the pathogenesis of the disease is documented by a wealth of biochemical and genetic data (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). Cellular human prion protein, PrPC, is a glycoprotein that contains a disulfide bond, is N-glycosylated, and is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). NMR studies have shown that the recombinant prion protein in solution consists of a largely unordered N-terminal region and the folded C-terminal domain encompassing three α-helices and a short β-sheet (3Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Google Scholar, 4Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies have captured the C-terminal part of PrP as a domain-swapped dimer (6Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Google Scholar). This dimer, which is only marginally populated in solution and selectively crystallizes, is also α-helical, and its overall fold is similar to that of the monomer. The PrPC → PrPSc conversion, which appears to occur without any covalent modifications, is believed to involve a major conformational change in the prion protein (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). In contrast to a largely α-helical PrPC, the pathogenic PrPSc isoform is characterized by a high content of β-sheet structure (7Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Google Scholar, 8Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Google Scholar), partial resistance to proteolytic digestion, and a propensity to aggregate into insoluble amyloid-like fibrils and plaques (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanism underlying the PrPC → PrPScconversion and prion propagation remains enigmatic. The key to understanding this mechanism is to elucidate the folding pathway(s) of the prion protein. Here we present evidence for a population of a kinetic intermediate during the folding of the human prion protein. This species may represent a crucial monomeric precursor on the pathway of prion protein conversion to the pathogenic PrPScisoform. The plasmid encoding huPrP-(90–231) with an N-terminal linker containing a His6 tail and a thrombin cleavage site was described previously (9Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Google Scholar, 10Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Google Scholar). The Y218W and F175W variants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate primers and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The proteins were expressed, cleaved with thrombin, and purified according to the previously described protocol (9Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Google Scholar). The equilibrium unfolding curves were obtained using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with an automated titrator and a temperature control system. In these experiments, native protein (1.4 μm) in an appropriate buffer was titrated with a 9 m buffered urea solution containing protein at the same concentration. The extent of protein unfolding was monitored by ellipticity at 222 nm or fluorescence intensity above 320 nm (excitation wavelength of 296 nm). The unfolding curves were analyzed using a two-state transition model (11Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Google Scholar). The kinetics of unfolding and refolding reactions were studied by diluting the native protein or protein fully unfolded in 8 m urea into the buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0 or 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8) containing urea at a desired concentration. In most experiments, the final protein concentration was 5.0 μm. The reactions were monitored by fluorescence above 320 nm (excitation at 296 nm) using the Applied Photophysics π* stopped-flow instrument equipped with a 5-μl cell and operating at a 1:10 mixing ratio. Depending on urea concentration, the mixing dead time of this instrument was 0.8–1.1 ms. The dead times were determined by a standard protocol for the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol byl-ascorbate (12Tonomura B. Nakatani H. Ohnishi M. Yamaguchi-Ito J. Hiromi K. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 370-383Google Scholar). Each protein folding/unfolding reaction was measured at least eight times. The kinetic traces were averaged and analyzed using the software provided by Applied Photophysics. In the present study, we have focused on folding of the recombinant protein corresponding to human PrP fragment 90–231 (huPrP-(90–231)). This region of PrP is of special importance because it encompasses the entire sequence of proteinase-resistant protein found in prion-infected brain, contains all known point mutations associated with familial prion disorders, and is sufficient for the propagation of the disease. The folding mechanism of huPrP-(90–231) was studied by the kinetic stopped-flow method with tryptophan fluorescence detection. Since the fluorescence of the sole native Trp at position 99 changes very little upon protein unfolding, these studies required preparation of huPrP-(90–231) variants with a single Trp engineered into the folded domain of the protein. This was accomplished by replacing Trp99 with Phe and, on that background, substituting Phe or Tyr at different positions with tryptophan. Preliminary characterization of these single Trp variants has identified the Y218W mutant (Fig.1) as potentially the most suitable candidate for stopped-flow experiments. Both at neutral and acidic pH, the Y218W substitution is essentially non-perturbing as indicated by far-UV circular dichroism spectra and equilibrium urea unfolding curves (data not shown). Furthermore, the fluorescence of the Trp218 probe is very sensitive to protein conformation. It is quenched in the native state, increasing sharply upon huPrP-(90–231) unfolding in urea. The stopped-flow method was used to follow kinetics of Y218W huPrP-(90–231) folding and unfolding at both acidic and neutral pH. The experiments were performed at 5 °C because, as shown previously (13Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Google Scholar), at room temperature the refolding and unfolding reactions for the prion protein are very fast, occurring within the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument. Representative kinetic traces for the fluorescence-detected folding and unfolding reactions of Y218W huPrP-(90–231) at pH 4.8 are shown in Fig.2. At each denaturant concentration, the kinetic traces could be fitted by a single exponential function, yielding the apparent rate constants. The urea dependence of these rate constants (“chevron plot”) is shown in Fig.3 A. The data do not fit a two-state transition model since the plot of the logarithm of the refolding rate versus [denaturant] at low urea concentrations (below ∼3.5 m) clearly deviates from linearity. The unfolding branch of the curve does not show any detectable curvature; however, the urea concentration range available for unfolding measurements is too narrow to allow any definitive conclusions. A non-linearity of the refolding part of the chevron plot (below 3 m urea) was also observed at pH 7 (Fig.3 B). Similar downward curvatures of the rate constant versus [denaturant] plots have been reported for a number of other proteins (14Roder H. Colon W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Google Scholar, 15Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1998Google Scholar, 16Ferguson N. Capaldi A.P. James R. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1597-1608Google Scholar). This effect is usually attributed to the presence of an early folding intermediate that forms during the dead time of the instrument and becomes increasingly populated under stabilizing conditions (i.e. at low denaturant concentration) (14Roder H. Colon W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Google Scholar, 15Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H.

However, recent studies indicate that deviation from linearity in chevron plots could also result from the transient protein aggregation during the refolding reaction (17Silow M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6084-6086Google Scholar). To test the latter possibility, the measurements of refolding kinetics at a few urea concentrations (1.2, 1.8, 2.3, and 2.9 m) were repeated using protein concentration of 1.2, 2.7, 5.0, and 25 μm. The rate constants did not show any appreciable protein concentration dependence, indicating that, under the conditions used, the folding reaction is monomolecular and does not involve any transient aggregates.Figure 3Folding and unfolding data for Y218W huPrP-(90–231) at pH 4.8 (A and C) and pH 7 (B and D).

The solid linesrepresent the best fit of experimental data to a sequential three-state kinetic model N ↔ I ↔ U.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The presence of a kinetic folding intermediate at pH 4.8 was further corroborated by the analysis of the refolding amplitudes. At low urea concentrations, the initial fluorescence intensities obtained by extrapolation of the kinetic curves to time 0 are markedly smaller than the amplitudes expected assuming that the fluorescence intensity of the unfolded state changes linearly with denaturant concentration (Fig.3 C). This indicates that a significant fraction of the total fluorescence change occurs within the dead time of the instrument (burst phase), suggesting rapid formation of a folding intermediate (14Roder H. Colon W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Google Scholar, 15Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1998Google Scholar, 16Ferguson N. Capaldi A.P. James R. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1597-1608Google Scholar). At pH 7, the unfolding curve was shifted to very high urea concentrations. The unfolding base line for Y218W huPrP-(90–231) under these conditions was poorly defined (Fig. 3 D), precluding application of the “amplitude test.” A non-linearity of chevron plots and the observation of a burst phase strongly indicate the presence of at least one intermediate on the Y218W huPrP-(90–231) folding pathway. It has been recently argued that curved chevron plots could also result from changes in the transition state (18Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Proctor M. Oliveberg M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6499-6511Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely to be a significant factor in the present study, especially since transition state movement could not account for the observed burst phase in the refolding reaction. Indeed, the denaturant dependence of the folding rates at both pH values studied (Fig. 3) fits well to the equation describing folding reaction according to the three-state Scheme I:U⇌kIUkU1I⇌kNIkINNScheme I where U and N represent the unfolded and native states, respectively, and I represents an early folding intermediate formed during the dead time of the instrument (16Ferguson N. Capaldi A.P. James R. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1597-1608Google Scholar). The fitting parameters (Table I) indicate that, relative to the unfolded state, the intermediate is significantly more stable under acidic conditions than at neutral pH (ΔG UI of 5.7 and 9.6 kJ m−1 at pH 7 and 4.8, respectively). In either case, the intermediate rapidly folds to the native state at a rate of ∼1200–1300 s−1. The fit also allows the calculation of parameter αI, the ratio ofm values for the pre-equilibrium transition,m UI, relative to the equilibriumm value, m eq =m UI + m IN≠ + m NI≠. The αIparameter, which provides a quantitative measure of the solvent-accessible area of U that becomes buried upon formation of I (14Roder H. Colon W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Google Scholar), indicates that the folding intermediate is more compact (i.e. characterized by a smaller solvent-accessible area) under acidic conditions than at neutral pH.Table IThermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the folding of human prion proteinProbepHΔGUN0,eqΔGUN0,kinKUI0m UIkIN0mIN≠kNI0mNI≠αIkJ mol−1kJ mol−1kJ mol−1m−1s−1kJ mol−1m−1s−1kJ mol−1m−1Trp2184.817.7 ± 0.819.367.23.611650.2418.21.00.747.029.4 ± 1.930.712.22.112900.200.032.40.45Trp1757.027.7 ± 0.529.611.32.113400.240.042.60.43ΔGUN0,eq represents the free energy obtained from the best fit of the equilibrium unfolding data to a two-state model (11Santoro M.M.

Based on limited data for the F175W variant of mouse PrP-(121–231), it was concluded that at neutral pH prion protein folds according to the two-state mechanism without any kinetic intermediates (13Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Google Scholar). In view of this apparent discrepancy, we have repeated our measurements at pH 7 for F175W huPrP-(90–231),i.e. using the same reporter group as in the previous study with mouse prion protein. The rate profile for F175W huPrP-(90–231) was very similar to that of the Y218W variant, showing a well defined curvature at low denaturant concentrations (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, a clear departure from a linear base line was observed for initial fluorescence intensities (refolding amplitudes), indicating the presence of a burst phase in the refolding reaction (Fig. 4 B). The fit of kinetic data according to a three-state model yielded, for F175W huPrP-(90–231), folding parameters very similar to those derived for the Y218W variant (Table I). The close similarity of the results obtained using the reporter groups in different parts of the protein molecule (helix 3 and helix 2 in Y218W and F175W variants, respectively (Fig. 1)) indicates that the single Trp variants used in this study faithfully represent the folding of the native human prion protein. A number of factors could contribute to the discrepancy between the present data and the apparent lack of a folding intermediate in the previous study with mouse prion protein. It is conceivable that the human and mouse PrP fold through different pathways and/or that the N-terminal fragment 90–120 affects the folding of the C-terminal domain 121–231 (experiments with mouse PrP were performed using the 121–231 domain, whereas the present study with human protein used a longer 90–231 fragment). However, it should also be noted that data reported for mouse PrP-(121–231) refolding are limited to a relatively narrow urea concentration range above 3.2 murea. The missing data below 3 m urea are of potentially critical importance since folding intermediates (and curvatures in chevron plots) usually become detectable only under stabilizing conditions, i.e. at low denaturant concentrations (14Roder H. Colon W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Google Scholar, 15Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1998Google Scholar). Indeed, at high urea concentrations the rate constants for huPrP-(90–231) refolding at pH 7 are very similar to those reported for mouse PrP-(121–231), and there is a linear dependence of the logarithm of these rates on denaturant concentration. A departure from this linearity, indicative of a folding intermediate, becomes detectable only at urea concentrations below 3 m. Experiments at low urea concentrations became feasible in the present study due to the recent improvements in stopped-flow instrumentation. The use of a 5-μl cell reduced the dead time of our instrument to 1 ms, allowing reliable measurements of rate constants in excess of 1500 s−1. In a recent study with ubiquitin, it has been noted that the stopped-flow measurements of reactions that are fast relative to the instrumental dead time may be prone to experimental error (19Krantz B.A. Sosnick T.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11696-11701Google Scholar). However, this concern applies mainly to complex folding reactions in which the fastest detectable phase is followed by poorly resolved slower phase(s). The present studies with prion protein should be largely immune to these problems since the observed kinetic traces are clearly monophasic. Within the context of the protein-only hypothesis, the key event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases is the conversion of prion protein from α-helical form, PrPC, to a β-sheet-rich conformer, PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). One of the central questions related to the mechanism of this conversion pertains to the nature of the PrP monomer that is a direct precursor of the oligomeric PrPSc. Is it a native α-helical conformer, a fully unfolded form, or a monomeric folding intermediate? Some theoretical models point to a potential involvement in the PrPC → PrPScconversion of partially structured folding intermediates (20Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Google Scholar). Such intermediate structures are also believed to play a central role in amyloid formation by other proteins. However, unlike for classical amyloidogenic proteins such as transthyretin and lysozyme variants (21Kelly J.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 595-600Google Scholar,22Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Bobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Google Scholar), putative folding intermediates for prion protein have proved very difficult to detect and characterize (13Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Google Scholar, 23Hosszu L.L.P. Baxter N.J. Jackson G.S. Power A. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Craven C.J. Collinge J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 740-743Google Scholar, 24Nicholson E.M. Mo H. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Marqusee S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 807-815Google Scholar). Early studies with the recombinant prion protein have identified an acid-induced β-sheet-rich form of PrP that was claimed to represent a “monomeric equilibrium intermediate” (25Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27517-27520Google Scholar, 26Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6010-6601Google Scholar). However, more recent data have invalidated this claim, showing that the β-sheet-rich species is not an equilibrium folding intermediate but, in fact, represents an aggregated form of prion protein with physicochemical properties similar to those of PrPSc (10Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Google Scholar, 27Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Google Scholar). Given the later finding, the involvement of intermediate(s) in prion protein folding remains a matter of speculation. The present kinetic stopped-flow study provides, for the first time, conclusive experimental evidence that prion protein folds by a three-state mechanism involving a monomeric intermediate. This early intermediate, which precedes the rate-limiting formation of the native state, appears to be relatively compact and especially stable under acidic conditions. In addition to its role in normal prion protein folding, the newly discovered folding intermediate is also likely to be of major importance in the PrPC → PrPScconversion. In the absence of experimental evidence for an intermediate, some authors have argued that the mechanism of prion protein conversion is fundamentally different from that for other amyloid-forming proteins and that it is the unfolded state of PrP that is directly converted into PrPSc (13Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Google Scholar, 23Hosszu L.L.P. Baxter N.J. Jackson G.S. Power A. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Craven C.J. Collinge J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 740-743Google Scholar). However, the present finding of a stable monomeric intermediate in prion protein folding calls for a critical reassessment of this view. Compared with the fully unfolded protein, the partially structured PrP intermediate is much more stable. This, combined with a relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity of typical folding intermediates, renders the I state of PrP as a better candidate than the unfolded state for a direct monomeric precursor of PrPSc. The role of a folding intermediate in the PrP conversion is in line with the recent finding that the transition of the recombinant prion protein to a scrapie-like form is strongly promoted in the presence of relatively low concentrations of urea,i.e. under conditions that would increase the population of an intermediate state (10Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Google Scholar). In contrast, conditions favoring the native state (no denaturant), or those that shift equilibrium toward the fully unfolded state (high concentration of urea), are not conducive to the conversion reaction (10Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the in vitro transition of the recombinant PrP to a scrapie-like form appears to be especially effective at low pH (27Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Google Scholar, 28Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Google Scholar). This correlates well with the present observation that acidic pH stabilizes the intermediate populated during the prion protein folding reaction. Mildly acidic conditions are of potential relevance to prion disease pathogenesis since previous reports indicate that the PrPC → PrPSc conversion may take place in acidic compartments (29Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Google Scholar). The evidence of an intermediate in prion protein folding also has potentially important implications for understanding the mechanism of familial diseases that segregate with specific mutations in human prion protein (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). In these disorders, the PrPC → PrPSc conversion appears to occur spontaneously,i.e. not requiring infection with a preexisting prion agent. It has been postulated that familial mutations promote the spontaneous conversion of the prion protein by destabilizing the native structure of PrPC (20Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Google Scholar). However, recent data indicate that some of these mutations produce negligible thermodynamic destabilization of the native state of prion protein relative to the unfolded state (30Swietnicki W. Petersen S.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Google Scholar, 31Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Google Scholar), a conundrum for the model assuming that a fully unfolded prion protein is a direct precursor of PrPSc. The finding of an intermediate in prion protein folding may explain this conundrum. Based on the present data, we propose that familial mutations facilitate the conversion reaction not necessarily by increasing the population of an unfolded protein but rather by affecting the conformation and/or increasing the stability of the partially folded intermediate species. This work provides a foundation for studying the effect of disease-causing mutations on the folding pathway of the prion protein. We are grateful to W. Swietnicki for the contribution to the molecular biology (construct preparation) part of this work."

The latter promotes PDE5 phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, which activates catalysis, enhances allosteric cGMP binding, and causes PDE5A1 to apparently elongate. A human PDE5A1 R domain fragment (Val46-Glu539) containing the phosphorylation site (Ser102) and allosteric cGMP-binding sites was studied. The rate, cGMP dependence, and stoichiometry of phosphorylation of the PDE5 R domain by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase are comparable with that of the holoenzyme. Migration in native polyacrylamide gels suggests that either cGMP binding or phosphorylation produces distinct conformers of the R domain. Phosphorylation of the R domain increases affinity for cGMP ∼10-fold (K D values 97.8 ± 17 and 10.0 ± 0.5 nm for unphospho- and phospho-R domains, respectively). [3H]cGMP dissociates from the phospho-R domain with a single rate (t12 = 339 ± 30 min) compared with the biphasic pattern of the unphospho-R domain (t12 = 39.0 ± 4.8 and 265 ± 28 min, for the fast and slow components, respectively). Thus, cGMP-directed regulation of PDE5 phosphorylation and the resulting increase in cGMP binding affinity occur largely within the R domain. Conformational change(s) elicited by phosphorylation of the R domain within the PDE5 holoenzyme may also cause or participate in stimulating catalysis.

The superfamily of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; R domain, regulatory domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; R domain, regulatory domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid is comprised of eleven known families of PDEs that vary in substrate specificity, regulatory properties, and tissue distribution (1Soderling S.H.

The regulatory domains of five of the known PDE families (PDEs 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11) contain either one or two sequences known as GAF domains, and these are homologous among the five families. In three of these families (PDEs 2, 5, and 6), at least one of these sequences in each monomer forms an allosteric site for cGMP binding (3Charbonneau H. Beavo J.

These latter PDEs belong to a subgroup of PDE families known as cGMP binding PDEs. In PDE2, cGMP binding to the cGMP binding allosteric sites increases catalytic activity of the enzyme toward cAMP and cGMP by an unknown mechanism (11Beavo J.A. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3841-3846Google Scholar, 12Manganiello V.C. Tanaka T. Murashima S. Beavo J. Houslay M.D. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases: Stucture, Regulation and Drug Action. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 61-85Google Scholar). In PDE5, the effect of allosteric cGMP binding is still not clear, but cGMP binding to the PDE5 R domain controls phosphorylation of a specific serine that is near the amino terminus of the R domain (13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar, 14Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 505-510Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at this serine activates both PDE5 catalytic and allosteric cGMP-binding activities (15Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PDE5 occurs in intact vascular smooth muscle cells after cGMP elevation, and this phosphorylation is associated with increased catalytic activity of this enzyme (16Wyatt T.A. Naftilan A.J. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 448-455Google Scholar, 17Mullershausen F. Russwurm M. Thompson W.J. Liu L. Koesling D. Friebe A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 271-278Google Scholar, 18Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Feil R. Hofmann F. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3310-3317Google Scholar). Mechanism(s) by which cGMP binding and phosphorylation of the R domain of PDE5 alter enzyme properties are not understood. PDE5 exists in at least two conformational states. In absence of cGMP, the enzyme assumes an apparently more compact structure (19Francis S.H. Chu D.M. Thomas M.K. Beasley A. Grimes K. Busch J.L. Turko I.V. Haik T.L. Corbin J.D. Methods. 1998; 14: 81-92Google Scholar). Occupation of the PDE5 catalytic site by either cGMP or inhibitors such as 3-isobuty-1-methylxanthine, zaprinast, or sildenafil stimulates cGMP binding to the allosteric sites, and when both catalytic and binding sites are occupied PDE5 undergoes an apparent elongation (19Francis S.H. Chu D.M. Thomas M.K. Beasley A. Grimes K. Busch J.L. Turko I.V. Haik T.L. Corbin J.D. Methods. 1998; 14: 81-92Google Scholar). However, little is known about specific structural events that occur in PDEs upon interaction with regulatory agents or after post-translational modification by phosphorylation. Regulation of PDE5 involves cGMP interaction with the R domain, which is required for efficient post-translational modification through phosphorylation (13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar, 15Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Google Scholar). Models of allosteric regulation of many enzymes include modulation of the equilibrium of distribution of proteins between two conformers,i.e. a relaxed (R) state that is active and has higher affinity for substrate and a taut (T) state that is less active and has lower affinity for substrate (20Monod J. Wyman J. Changeaux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Google Scholar, 21Johnson L.N. Barford D. Owen D.J. Noble M.E.M. Garman E.F. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 11-28Google Scholar). Phosphorylase is an example of this model wherein either binding of an allosteric activator, 5′AMP, or phosphorylation by phosphorylase kinase alters equilibrium between the two states to produce a more active enzyme (21Johnson L.N. Barford D. Owen D.J. Noble M.E.M. Garman E.F. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 11-28Google Scholar). PDE5 may conform to that model, because cGMP binding to allosteric binding sites induces an apparent conformational change in PDE5, perhaps converting it from a less active state to a more active state (15Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Google Scholar, 19Francis S.H. Chu D.M. Thomas M.K. Beasley A. Grimes K. Busch J.L. Turko I.V. Haik T.L. Corbin J.D. Methods. 1998; 14: 81-92Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of Ser92 in bovine PDE5 and activation of PDE5 occur efficiently only when cGMP is elevated, and the enzyme is already in the cGMP-bound (R) conformation. Therefore, it is possible that this phosphorylation effectively sequesters more PDE5 in the R state or induces yet a third conformation (R*) that differs from the fraction of unphospho-PDE5 fluctuating between cGMP-bound (R) and free (T) states (T ↔ R ↔ R*). If so, it would represent an additional overlay on the allosteric regulation of PDE5. Protein phosphatase action would be required to dephosphorylate phospho-PDE5 for this portion of cellular PDE5 to once again re-enter the equilibrium between cGMP-bound (R) and cGMP-free (T) PDE5. To examine functional and conformational changes associated with phosphorylation and activation of PDE5 further, we have studied intact PDE5, as well as the isolated PDE5 R domain, using a recombinant protein containing the phosphorylation site and the allosteric cGMP-binding sites. These studies reveal that regulation of PDE5 phosphorylation by cGMP and enhanced cGMP binding induced by PDE5 phosphorylation is associated strongly with changes in conformation and in function within the R domain of the enzyme. A truncated R domain of PDE5 was expressed as a GST fusion protein inEscherichia coli by slight modification of the method reported previously (8Liu L. Underwood T. Li H. Pamukcu R. Thompson W.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 45-51Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment coding for the regulatory domain of PDE5 was amplified by PCR from human fetal lung cDNA (Clontech) using specific primers 5′-AAAAGAATTCTGTTAGAAAAGCCACCAGAGAAATG-3′ and 5′-AAAACTCGAGCTCTCTTGTTTCTTCCTCTGCTG-3′ (Val46-Glu539 of human PDE5A1). The amplified fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI andXhoI sites of pGEM-5X3, resulting in the expression plasmid coding for GST-fused human PDE5 regulatory domain. GST-fused PDE5 R domain was phosphorylated by PKA primarily at Ser102, but there was also a low level of phosphate incorporation into Thr50 (-Arg-Lys-Ala-Thr50-), which is near the junction with the GST tag. In contrast, native PDE5 is phosphorylated by PKG or PKA catalytic subunit (C subunit) only at Ser92 of the bovine enzyme or Ser102 of human PDE5 (8Liu L. Underwood T. Li H. Pamukcu R. Thompson W.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 45-51Google Scholar, 13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar). Therefore, Thr50 was mutagenized to alanine using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primer sets 5′-GAAAAGCCGCCAGAGAAATGGTCAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTGACCATTTCTGGCGGCTTTTC-3′. The resulting pGEX-PDE5 R domain-T50A, which is called GST-fused PDE5 regulatory domain or PDE5 R domain herein, was then expressed in E. coli (BL21 DE3 stain) by 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 22 °C for 18 h. Cells were disrupted in PBS by a sonicator and then centrifuged at 48,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column, and the GST-fused PDE5 regulatory domain was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Eluate was stored in the same buffer containing 10% sucrose and 0.15 m NaCl at −70 °C. The protein was incubated with fresh 5 mmdithiothreitol overnight at 4 °C before use. Purity of the protein was assessed using 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Characteristics of the effects of phosphorylation on the properties of the original PDE5 R domain construct and of the PDE5 R domain (T50A) were the same. PDE5 R domain was phosphorylated routinely using free C subunit of PKA that had been purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine heart by a method published previously (22Flockhart D.A. Corbin J.D. Marangos P.J. Campbell I.C. Cohen R.M. Brain Receptor Methodologies. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 209-215Google Scholar). For experiments to determine rate and cGMP dependence of PDE5 and PDE5 R domain phosphorylation, the reaction was conducted in a mixture containing isolated PDE5 R domain (1.4 μm) or purified His-tag bovine PDE5 (1.4 μm), purified bovine C subunit (100 nm), 143 μm sildenafil, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm ATP (with addition of trace [32P]ATP), 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.1 m NaCl, and in absence or presence of 50 μm cGMP at 30 °C. At varying times, aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted onto phosphocellulose paper (P81), washed four times in 0.5% phosphoric acid, dried, and counted. Alternatively, aliquots were used for SDS-PAGE analysis as described below and followed by radioautography. For experiments to prepare quantitatively phosphorylated PDE5 R domain, the phosphorylation was conducted as follows. PDE5 R domain (2 nmol, 7.5 μm) was incubated with 200 μm ATP and 2 mm magnesium acetate in the presence of 10 μm[3H]cGMP and 3 μm C subunit. In some instances, [32P]ATP was included in trace amounts to quantitate stoichiometry of phosphorylation. After incubation for 2 h at 30 °C, cIMP at a final concentration of 3.3 mm was added to exchange with cGMP bound to PDE5 R domain and incubated for an additional 1 h. Tubes were placed on ice and incubated for 1 h. Cyclic IMP has ∼10-fold lower affinity for PDE5 allosteric binding sites than does cGMP and therefore can be removed more readily from the protein using gel filtration. Phospho-PDE5 R domain was concentrated using ULTRAFREE-0.5 (Millipore) to reduce concentrations of free cIMP and cGMP. The concentrated sample was loaded onto Sephacryl S200 (0.9 × 50 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 m NaCl to remove free ATP, [3H]cGMP, and cIMP. Eluted samples were pooled and concentrated to ∼500 μl using an Amicon filtration cell equipped with a PM-30 membrane. Stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation into PDE5 R domain was assessed by [32P] incorporation and by the slowed migration of phospho-PDE5 R domain in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. More than 90% of total protein was phosphorylated, and phosphorylation of the PDE5 R domain (T50A) was exclusively at serine. The PDE5 R domain mutant lacking the phosphorylation site at Ser102 (S102A) was not phosphorylated under these conditions (data not shown). According to radioactivity of [3H]cGMP of the purified phosphorylated PDE5 R domain, the cGMP content of the protein was less than 1% of total cGMP-binding sites. Unphospho-R domain was treated using the same conditions but in the absence of ATP, magnesium acetate, and C subunit. Both the unphospho- and phospho-R domains eluted as sharp peaks from Sephacryl S200 at a position consistent with a dimeric structure of this size. The regulatory domain of PDE5 has been shown previously to account for dimerization of the enzyme (2Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 1-52Google Scholar, 23Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Google Scholar). Cyclic GMP-binding assays were conducted in a reaction mixture that contained 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.55 mm EGTA, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 0.17 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and various concentrations of [3H]cGMP as indicated. The binding reaction was initiated by addition of isolated PDE5 R domain. After incubation for various periods at 30 °C, 1.5 ml of cold KP buffer (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8) was added to each sample. Samples were filtered immediately onto pre-moistened Millipore HAWP filters (pore size 0.45 μm), which were then washed with 1.5 ml of cold KP buffer three times. Filters were then dried and counted using non-aqueous scintillant, and radioactivity was then counted. Blanks containing no protein were run for each concentration of [3H]cGMP where cGMP was varied. Otherwise, nonspecific binding was determined by incubation of PDE5 R domain in the presence of 1 mmunlabeled cGMP. Unphospho-PDE5 R domain (16 nm) and phospho-PDE5 R domain (8.3 nm) were incubated for 25 min at 30 °C in a [3H]cGMP-binding mixture containing 1 μm [3H]cGMP (see above) to allow saturation of cGMP-binding sites with [3H]cGMP. Cyclic GMP binding stoichiometry was the same at 1 and 3 μm[3H]cGMP. Reaction mixtures were transferred to 4 °C for 25 min and then aliquots were removed for determination of total bound [3H]cGMP (Bo). A 100-fold excess of unlabeled cGMP was then added, and aliquots were removed at indicated times (t) for determination of [3H]cGMP remaining bound (Bt) using the Millipore filtration technique described above. Results were corrected by subtraction of a parallel control performed with no enzyme and plotted as ln Bt/Bo versus time, where Bt/Bo represents the fraction of [3H]cGMP remaining bound at any time. For SDS-PAGE, aliquots (15 μl) of protein samples were boiled in 10% SDS/2 m2-mercaptoethanol for 4 min, combined with 2 μl of bromphenol blue (1 mg/ml) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gels) as described previously (5McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. LeTrong H. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Google Scholar). In experiments utilizing [32P]ATP for phosphorylation of PDE5 R domain, the dye front was run into the lower buffer to remove [32P]ATP prior to radioautography. For native gel electrophoresis, two protocols were used. For studies of PDE5 R domain, protein samples were combined with sample buffer and loaded into wells of pre-cast 7.5% Tris-HCl acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis used 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine running buffer, pH 8.3, and electrophoresis proceeded for 40 min at constant voltage (250 V) at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some instances, cGMP (1 mm) was added to the running buffer. For studies of recombinant PDE5 holoenzyme, native gels (9.5%) were prepared daily as described previously (19Francis S.H. Chu D.M. Thomas M.K. Beasley A. Grimes K. Busch J.L. Turko I.V. Haik T.L. Corbin J.D. Methods. 1998; 14: 81-92Google Scholar), and electrophoresis was conducted at constant voltage (50 V) at 4 °C for 24 h. In all instances, bovine serum albumin standard for native gels (Sigma) was run alongside to serve as markers. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue or silver stain. Protein concentration of GST-fused PDE5 R domain was determined by the Bradford method and by amino acid analysis. The value determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard was in accordance with that determined by amino acid analysis. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [8-3H]cGMP was fromAmersham Biosciences. Acryliquid 40 and Instabis were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Preformed native gels were purchased from Bio-Rad. Low molecular weight SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis standards were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. cGMP, ATP, magnesium acetate, bovine serum albumin, and IBMX were from Sigma. Our laboratory has reported that both native and recombinant PDE5 holoenzyme can be phosphorylated in vitro by PKG or C subunit of PKA at a specific serine in the regulatory domain of PDE5 (13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar, 14Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 505-510Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this serine (Ser92 and Ser102 in bovine and human PDE5A1, respectively) is stimulated potently by cGMP binding to the allosteric cGMP binding sites in the R domain, i.e. a substrate-modulated phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of PDE5 holoenzyme has been shown recently to stimulate catalytic activity and to increase cGMP binding affinity at the allosteric sites (15Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PDE5 holoenzyme is tightly regulated, because cGMP binding to the R domain is minimal unless cGMP, a cGMP analog, or an inhibitor such as IBMX or sildenafil is bound at the catalytic site. Biochemical evidence suggests that exposure of the phosphorylation site in PDE5 is a stepwise process in which substrate/inhibitor binds to the catalytic site and causes a conformational change that increases cGMP binding to the R domain (13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar, 23Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Google Scholar, 24Francis S.H. Lincoln T.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 620-626Google Scholar). Upon cGMP occupation of the allosteric binding sites, the phosphorylation site is exposed and can then be phosphorylated by either PKG or C subunit of PKA. PKG is a ten times better catalyst than PKA in vitro for this phosphorylation and would be activated under cellular conditions when cGMP is elevated. However, it cannot be ruled out that under some conditions PKA could also act as a catalyst in vivo. Whether the molecular events associated with substrate-directed phosphorylation of PDE5 and the phosphorylation-induced increase in cGMP-binding affinity reside largely in the PDE5 R domain or require the entire molecule is the focus of this report. Native gel electrophoresis of recombinant bovine PDE5A1 commonly reveals a doublet of protein bands in which the more rapidly migrating species almost always predominates. For the studies shown in Fig. 1 (control lane), we used a PDE5 preparation that was comprised largely of the more rapidly migrating band to present a clear demonstration of the electrophoretic gel shift that occurs in response to ligand binding or phosphorylation. Prior incubation of the enzyme with the PDE5 inhibitor zaprinast, which interacts with the catalytic site of the enzyme, does not alter the migration of the protein band significantly. However, pre-incubation of PDE5 with zaprinast, in combination with cGMP, causes a major redistribution of the PDE5 protein bands so that a more slowly migrating form is prominently visible (Fig. 1). This result is consistent with the interpretation that cGMP binding to allosteric sites in PDE5 causes an apparent elongation of the protein and demonstrates that simultaneous occupation of both catalytic and allosteric cGMP binding sites induces a significant change in overall structure of the protein. Addition of high concentrations of cGMP alone can also cause a quantitative electrophoretic gel shift of PDE5 into the more slowly migrating band (data not shown). This effect is consistent with simultaneous cGMP occupation of both the catalytic and allosteric cGMP binding sites. However, ongoing hydrolysis of cGMP by the PDE5 catalytic site during the preincubation and the rapid migration of cGMP toward the anode progressively reduces the concentration of the ligand and its effect. Introduction of additional negative charges into the PDE5 R domain either by binding cGMP or by covalent incorporation of phosphate would be predicted to accelerate mobility because of an overall increase in electronegativity. It was established earlier that phosphorylation of PDE5 by PKG or C subunit of PKA requires occupation of the allosteric cGMP binding sites of PDE5 (13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1 also demonstrate for the first time that when PDE5 is phosphorylated under these conditions,32P incorporation occurs exclusively in the more slowly migrating PDE5 band and does not redistribute into the lower band. Phosphorylated PDE5 appears to co-migrate with the more slowly migrating band observed in the unphospho-PDE5 in the presence of cGMP and zaprinast (lane 2). Whether these two forms differ could not be determined. This question has now been pursued further using the isolated PDE5 R domain to determine whether this apparent elongation upon phosphorylation occurs in absence of the catalytic domain. A GST fusion protein, PDE5 R domain, containing glutathione S-transferase fused to a segment of the human PDE5A1 R domain extending from Val46 through Glu539 (8Liu L. Underwood T. Li H. Pamukcu R. Thompson W.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 45-51Google Scholar) with a predicted monomer molecular weight of ∼85,000, has been used to examine effects of cGMP binding to or phosphorylation of the PDE5 R domain. The amino acid sequence of PDE5 R domain includes the specific serine (Ser102) in human PDE5A1 that is homologous to Ser92 in bovine PDE5 and is phosphorylated by either PKG or C subunit of PKA (8Liu L. Underwood T. Li H. Pamukcu R. Thompson W.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 45-51Google Scholar, 13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar). The sequence terminates in the region predicted to conclude the b GAF domain (5McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. LeTrong H. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Google Scholar). The protein used for the present studies is highly purified (>95%) as assessed using SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie or silver staining. Kinetic characteristics of [3H]cGMP binding by the isolated R domain mimic closely those of PDE5 holoenzyme determined in the presence of a PDE inhibitor, such as sildenafil or IBMX, that occupies the catalytic site and relieves autoinhibition of cGMP binding at the allosteric sites (data not shown). The K D values for cGMP binding are 97.8 ± 17 and 106 ± 8 nm, mean ± S.E. for the isolated R domain and PDE5 holoenzyme, respectively. These similarities suggest that the isolated R domain is in the active, i.e. the deinhibited state, and affirm the usefulness of this protein to study PDE5 function. As shown in Fig. 2,A and C, cGMP stimulates phosphorylation of the isolated R domain by the C subunit of PKA. This is presumed to occur by cGMP binding to PDE5 R domain, because cGMP does not bind to the C subunit. Phosphorylation of the isolated R domain is time-dependent and cGMP-stimulated under conditions used for these studies (Fig. 2, A andB). This pattern was obtained using four separate purified preparations of the PDE5 R domain. The rate and cGMP dependence of phosphorylation of the isolated R domain by C subunit are comparable with that of PDE5 holoenzyme (Fig. 2, B and C). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of PDE5 R domain by PKA is 0.91 ± 0.15 mol of phosphate per monomer of PDE5 R domain when a higher concentration of C subunit is used (see “Experimental Procedures”) and radiolabel is associated with serine phosphate. The cGMP stimulation of phosphorylation of the R domain demonstrates for the first time a significant communication between two functional subdomains within the isolated R domain of PDE5, i.e. the allosteric cGMP-binding subdomain and the phosphorylation subdomain. The energy provided by cGMP binding to the allosteric cGMP binding sites alone is sufficient to effect exposure of the phosphorylation site. Although occupation of the catalytic site of intact PDE5 by cGMP, cGMP analogs, or PDE inhibitors is established as an important initial step in the mechanism of phosphorylation of PDE5 holoenzyme, its main effect is apparently to enhance cGMP binding to the allosteric sites by relieving autoinhibition of this function. However, the presence of PDE5 catalytic domain is not required to effect conformational changes that occur in the R domain to bring about exposure of the phosphorylation site and its availability for modification by the kinases. PKG can also be used as the catalyst for the phosphorylation reaction (13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar). With PKG as catalyst, 8-bromo-cGMP (4 μm) was included to activate PKGIα fully, but cGMP (10 μm) was still required to achieve significant phosphorylation of PDE5 R domain (data not shown), because cGMP is required to occupy the cGMP binding sites on PDE5 R domain. PKG is an ∼10-fold better catalyst than PKA for phosphorylation of PDE5 or isolated PDE5 R domain, but it has not been used for studies in this report for three reasons (13Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Google Scholar). First, when PKG is used to phosphorylate the isolated PDE5 R domain, interpretation of the results is complicated by the fact that cGMP, or a cGMP analog, is required for full PKG catalytic activity, and cGMP is also required for the substrate-directed stimulation of phosphorylation of PDE5. Second, under these conditions, PKG undergoes autophosphorylation, and after electrophoresis, the PKG and PDE5 R domain protein bands are closely juxtaposed. Third, the presence of PKG in the reaction mixture complicates subsequent interpretation of cGMP-binding studies, because both the PKG and the PDE5 R domain bind cGMP, and because of similarity in size, they are difficult to separate using conventional techniques. Therefore, the free C subunit of PKA has been used for the studies described herein. PKA C subunit phosphorylates the same site in PDE5 as does PKG, and its activity is cyclic nucleotide-independent. Therefore, the effects produced by addition of cGMP can be determined directly to be substrate-directed. To assess whether phosphorylation in the isolated PDE5 R domain results in an apparent elongation of the protein as occurs in PDE5 holoenzyme, the mobility of unphospho- and phospho-R domains on native polyacrylamide gels was examined. Unphospho- and phospho-R domains were prepared using non-radiolabeled ATP according to the protocol for quantitative phosphorylation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following incubation to generate unphospho- and phospho-R domains, aliquots of the respective proteins were analyzed by native PAGE (Bio-Rad) in the absence and presence of cGMP (Fig.3). In Fig. 3 (lanes 2–5), unphospho- and phospho-R domains were pre-incubated at 4 °C overnight either in absence or presence of 20 mm cGMP prior to electrophoresis for 40 min at room temperature at constant voltage (250 V). A high concentration of cGMP is used in the preincubation, because cGMP, as a small negatively charged molecule, migrates rapidly toward the anode and is removed quickly from the environs of the protein. At lower concentrations of cGMP, the mobility shift in the protein diminishes progressively (data not shown). Bovine serum albumin standards for native gels were run alongside (lanes 1 and8) and are shown as controls for relative migrations of the various forms of PDE5 R domain. In Fig. 3, lane 2, two species of the PDE5 R domain are visible, suggesting that the protein can exist in two conformational states, but the basis of the distinction between these two forms is not known. The more rapidly migrating species is by far the major form in most of our preparations. Phosphorylation of the isolated R domain shifts the protein almost quantitatively into a more slowly migrating species (lane 3) that clearly differs from either band seen in lane 1 containing the unphospho-R domain. This suggests that phosphorylation of the isolated R domain induces a conformational change that is distinct from either species observed in the unphospho-R domain preparation. To better determine the relationship of the cGMP-bound form of the isolated PDE5 R domain to the protein bands observed in phospho-PDE5 R domain, the same unphospho- and phospho-forms of the R domain were pre-incubated with 20 mm cGMP prior to native gel electrophoresis. Because cGMP is diluted when sample is combined with loading buffer, and cGMP in the sample migrates rapidly toward the anode, very high concentrations of cGMP were used in an attempt to maximize the likelihood that cGMP would remain bound to PDE5 R domain during electrophoresis. As seen in lane 4, preincubation of the unphospho-R domain with cGMP causes a redistribution of protein between the two protein bands observed in lane 2. Cyclic GMP binding to the unphospho-R- domain causes a major shift of protein into a more slowly migrating band. This shift is consistent with the interpretation that cGMP binding to R domain of PDE5 holoenzyme induces a significant conformational change in this region to expose the phosphorylatable serine to PKG or PKA action. Furthermore, the combined effect of cGMP binding and phosphorylation (lane 5) clearly differs from the effect elicited by cGMP binding alone (lane 4). Whether migration of the phospho-PDE5 R domain in absence of cGMP (lane 3) differs from the migration of the phospho-PDE5 R domain in presence of cGMP (lane 5) could not be ascertained with confidence. The results could be explained by the phosphorylation-induced increase in cGMP binding affinity of the PDE5 R domain. That is, the phospho-R domain might retain cGMP with greater efficiency throughout electrophoresis. To examine this possibility, the same unphospho- and phospho-PDE5 R domain samples were preincubated with 20 mmcGMP prior to loading into the native gel wells. Electrophoresis was conducted using the standard Tris-glycine buffer containing 1 mm cGMP (lanes 6–8). Because cGMP is negatively charged, cGMP in the running buffer migrates progressively toward the anode throughout the 40-min electrophoresis, thereby maintaining a high cGMP concentration in the microenvironment of the migrating R domain. Unphospho-PDE5 R domain under conditions designed to saturate cGMP binding (lane 6) migrates as a single band that clearly differs from the cGMP-bound phospho-R domain. Therefore, the cGMP-bound form of the phospho-PDE5 R domain is conformationally distinct from that of the cGMP-bound form of unphospho-PDE5 R domain (comparelanes 4 and 5 or lanes 6 and7). This conformational difference is likely to relate to functional differences between these two forms of the protein. When the catalytic site of PDE5 holoenzyme is not occupied by a cyclic nucleotide analog such as IBMX or sildenafil, cGMP binding to the enzyme is minimal. However, the isolated R domain of PDE5 has cGMP-binding characteristics similar to that of the PDE5 holoenzyme whose catalytic site is occupied by cyclic nucleotide analogs such as IBMX or sildenafil. Considering the similarity of theK D values of the two proteins (106 ± 9 for PDE5 holoenzyme, and 97.8 ± 17 nm, mean ± S.E. for the isolated R domain), this suggests that the isolated R domain is in the active form for cGMP binding and is similar kinetically to the holoenzyme when inhibitors or cGMP are bound to the catalytic site. Phosphorylation of the PDE5 holoenzyme causes increased cGMP-binding affinity at its allosteric sites. To determine the molecular basis for the increase in affinity of allosteric cGMP binding following phosphorylation more precisely, the isolated PDE5 R domain was stoichiometrically phosphorylated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As seen in Fig. 4 A, the phospho-R domain was shifted quantitatively on native gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 4, phosphorylation of the isolated PDE5 R domain improves cGMP-binding affinity ∼10-fold with no effect on total cGMP binding (Fig.4 B). Stoichiometry of cGMP-binding to unphospho- and phospho-PDE5 R domain is 0.50 ± 0.03 and 0.69 ± 0.02 mol/mol, respectively (n = 14). TheK d value for cGMP binding to the unphospho-PDE5 R domain is 97.8 ± 1 nm compared with 10.0 ± 0.5 nm, mean ± S.E. for the phospho-PDE5 R domain. These values agree well with those reported previously by this laboratory (15Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Google Scholar) for the effect of phosphorylation on cGMP-binding affinity of PDE5 holoenzyme. For PDE5 holoenzyme, phosphorylation increases the allosteric cGMP binding affinity ∼4-fold. Because cGMP binding to the allosteric cGMP-binding sites of the isolated PDE5 R domain or PDE5 holoenzyme is required to expose the serine for phosphorylation by PKA or PKG, it would be predicted by the principle of reciprocity that phosphorylation should affect cGMP binding (26Weber G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 1-83Google Scholar). The results are consistent with that prediction. The similar effects of phosphorylation to increase cGMP-binding affinity in both the PDE5 holoenzyme and its isolated R domain suggest that the interactions that provide for enhanced function of these sites reside solely within this segment of human PDE5A1 sequence, i.e. Val46through Glu539. Allosteric cGMP binding to PDE5 and to isolated PDE5 R domain has been studied previously by measuring the dissociation of [3H]cGMP from the enzyme in the presence of saturating levels of unlabeled cGMP (6McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Google Scholar, 23Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Google Scholar). Both the PDE5 holoenzyme and the isolated PDE5 R domain exhibit curvilinear dissociation exchange kinetics consistent with the presence of two cGMP-binding sites with different affinities. The effect of phosphorylation of the PDE5 R domain to increase cGMP binding affinity was investigated further by measuring the rate of cGMP dissociation from the phospho- and unphospho-PDE5 R domains (Fig. 5). Unphospho- and phospho-PDE5 R domains have similar stoichiometries of cGMP binding at zero time, i.e. 0.50 and 0.69 mol of cGMP/mol PDE5 R domain, respectively, and this is similar to the stoichiometry of cGMP binding per PDE5 monomer in the intact holoenzyme (≤1 mol/mol). The same stoichiometry of cGMP binding by the isolated PDE5 R domain is achieved using either 1 or 3 μm[3H]cGMP. The unphospho-PDE5 R domain shows the typical curvilinear dissociation pattern for [3H]cGMP, and the t12values compare with those reported previously for the recombinant and native PDE5 (Fig. 5). Data for unphospho-R domain were analyzed using GraphPad Prism and Origin graphing programs using a biexponential decay model. Results indicated that the lower affinity and higher affinity cGMP binding sites in unphospho-R domain account for 52.4 ± 4.9 and 47.8 ± 4.8 of the cGMP binding sites, respectively. Thet12 value for the lower affinity site was determined to be 39.0 ± 4.8 min compared with at12 of 265 ± 28 min for the higher affinity site; correlation coefficient = 0.99. In contrast, the dissociation of [3H]cGMP from the phospho-PDE5 R domain occurs with a single rate component (t12 = 339 ± 30 min, S.E. correlation coefficient = 0.94) that is significantly slower than dissociation of [3H]cGMP from the unphospho-R domain. Thus, phosphorylation converts the curvilinear pattern of cGMP dissociation from the unphospho-PDE5-R domain into a single high affinity kinetic component. This suggests, but does not prove, that the sites are identical structurally. Phosphorylation may relieve kinetic asymmetry between two sites. The functional asymmetry in cGMP binding to allosteric sites in PDE5 could be produced in several ways. First, there could be two entirely separate cGMP binding sites with different kinetic properties,e.g. cGMP could bind to sites in GAF a domain and in GAF b domain. Current evidence argues against, but does not disprove, this possibility. Second, a single type of allosteric cGMP-binding site e.g. the two GAF a sites, with identical primary structure could have inherently different kinetic properties because of structural constraints imposed by contacts within the dimeric PDE5 R-domain. Third, cGMP saturation of the allosteric binding sites in the unphospho-R domain of PDE5 could impose conformational changes that induce kinetic differences on sites that have identical primary structures, e.g. the two GAFa domains. However, it is clear that the effect of phosphorylation relieves this kinetic asymmetry by increasing the affinity of the fast site of cGMP binding, and this effect is likely to be relevant physiologically. Results presented herein demonstrate that the isolated PDE5 R domain can exist in at least three states depending on the state of phosphorylation of a specific serine in this region and the extent of cGMP binding to the allosteric site(s) in the R domain. Phosphorylation of the isolated PDE5 R domain is stimulated strongly by cGMP occupation of the allosteric cGMP binding sites, and the resulting phosphorylation induces a distinct conformational change that is associated in turn with a 10-fold increase in binding affinity for cGMP. In addition, phosphorylation converts the curvilinear pattern of [3H]cGMP dissociation of the unphospho-PDE5 R domain to a single high affinity component in the phospho-PDE5 R domain. Cyclic GMP binding to the isolated R domain causes an apparent elongation, and phosphorylation of the R domain produces an even more pronounced effect as reflected by significantly slower mobility in native PAGE. This communication between the phosphorylation subdomain and the allosteric cGMP-binding subdomain occurs within the context of the PDE5 R domain alone and does not require the presence of the PDE5 catalytic domain. However, these characteristics of the PDE5 R domain are associated with and may provide for activation of PDE5 by phosphorylation. Results of this study provide important insights into molecular processes that contribute to functional changes induced by phosphorylation of selected domains within the chimeric structure of PDE5.

Chem. 277, 25867–25869) described novel caveolin- and actin-containing structures associated with the adipocyte cell surface that contain specific signaling proteins. We have characterized these structures, here termed “caves,” using light and electron microscopy and observe that they represent surface-connected wide invaginations of the basal plasma membrane that are sometimes many micrometers in diameter. Rather than simply a caveolar domain, these structures contain all elements of the plasma membrane including clathrin-coated pits, lipid raft markers, and non-raft markers. GLUT4 is recruited to caves in response to insulin stimulation. Caves can occupy a significant proportion of the plasma membrane area and are surrounded by cortical actin. Caveolae density in caves is similar to that on the bulk plasma membrane, but because these structures protrude much deeper into the plane of focus of the light microscope molecules such as caveolin and other plasma membrane proteins appear more concentrated in caves.

Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). If the cells are cultured for long periods of time, the lipid droplets tend to fuse to form one large droplet resembling mature white adipocytes. The morphological changes that accompany adipocyte differentiation have been studied in detail (9Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 10Franke W.W. Hergt M. Grund C. Cell. 1987; 49: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Most notably, each rounded lipid droplet is surrounded by a single lipid layer, which is in turn ensheathed by endoplasmic reticulum. Another characteristic morphological feature of differentiating adipocytes is the increase in abundance of caveolae. Caveolae are evident as single pits at the cell surface as well as associated with surface-connected spherical structures, to form characteristic caveolae-studded features termed “rosettes” (9Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Caveolar rosettes are found in many eukaryotic cells (11Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) but they are particularly abundant in adipocytes. The relationship between these organelles and adipogenesis is not clear, although it may be related to a role in cholesterol homeostasis and/or lipid transport between the lipid droplet and the cell surface. One of the metabolic processes that is acquired during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation is a highly insulin-responsive glucose-transport system (12Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates glucose transport in muscle and adipocytesin vivo via the translocation of a facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 from intracellular tubulovesicular elements to the plasma membrane (13Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that two separate insulin-responsive signal-transduction pathways regulate cell surface levels of GLUT4 in an additive manner (reviewed in Ref. 14Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The first pathway involves the lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, and the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB. The second pathway is independent of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and involves the recruitment of a multimeric complex that includes c-Cbl and CAP to a specialized microdomain of the plasma membrane (15Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 16Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1-13Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This specialized domain has been characterized as a lipid raft domain that is highly enriched in the lipid raft marker proteins caveolin and flotillin. Very recently, these structures have been defined as a specialized form of caveolae associated with the filamentous actin cytoskeleton, referred to as Cav-actin (17Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have also observed the presence of large ring-like structures associated with the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In the present study, we have further characterized these rings using both light and electron microscopy. These structures are detected in differentiated adipocytes but not in preadipocytes. They represent large surface-connected invaginations of the plasma membrane and hence have been named caves. In contrast to previous studies (15Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we show that although these structures are studded with caveolae, they simply represent an extension of the cell surface, also containing clathrin-coated pits and non-caveolar markers (raft and non-raft markers). By light microscopy we observe an enrichment of actin staining around caves and by electron microscopy we observe a filamentous network associated with these structures resembling actin filaments. Thus, caves represent an adipocyte-specific specialization of the cell surface. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, from the American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) 1The abbreviations used for: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; CT-B, cholera toxin binding subunit B; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum (CSL Limited, Parkville, Victoria, Australia), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/liter penicillin and 100 μg/liter streptomycin at 37 °C in 10% CO2, and passaged at ∼70% confluence. Confluent fibroblasts were induced to differentiate 1 d after reaching confluence by the addition of DMEM containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen), 4 mg/ml insulin, 0.25 mm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 100 ng/ml d-biotin. After 72 h, the differentiation medium was replaced with fresh FCS/DMEM containing insulin. Adipocytes were re-fed with FCS/DMEM every 72 h and utilized for experiments at 8–10 days post differentiation. All tissue culture media were purchased from Invitrogen, except fetal calf serum, which was obtained from Trace Biosciences (Clayton, Australia). Insulin was obtained fromCalbiochem. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The GLUT4 polyclonal antibody (R017) was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 20 amino acids of rat GLUT4. Monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (DM10) was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-caveolin antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Syntaxin4, GLUT1, and SNAP 23 polyclonal antibodies are described elsewhere (18Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S.

The insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Susanna Keller. Clathrin monoclonal antibody X22 was a kind gift of Dr. Frances Brodsky. Phalloidin-FITC and all the fluorophore-tagged secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Cells cultured on coverslips in 6- or 12-well dishes were starved for 2 h in DMEM/0.2%BSA or Krebs Ringer Phosphate buffer (KPP)/0.2% BSA buffers and incubated with the appropriate treatments. Cells were fixed in acetone for 5 min, washed with PBS, washed again with PBS/0.15 mglycine, and incubated with 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in PBS/1% BSA for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS/0.1% BSA and incubated for 30 min with phalloidin-FITC or the corresponding FITC or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS/1% BSA. Normal rabbit serum was used as a negative control. The coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted onto glass microscope slides, and viewed using a X63/1.4 Zeiss oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal imaging system. In experiments designed for staining of cytoskeletal structures, cells were fixed and permeabilized simultaneously in cytoskeleton-stabilizing buffer CSB (10 mm PIPES pH 6.9, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) as described in Ref. 21Arcangeletti C. Sutterlin R. Aebi U. De Conto F. Missorini S. Chezzi C. Scherrer K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 35-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Plasma membrane fragments were prepared from basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes as described previously (22Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23Robinson L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E383-E393PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes were grown on glass coverslips and sonicated using a probe sonicator (Kontes) to generate a lawn of plasma membrane fragments that remained attached to the glass. These fragments were then immunolabeled with the corresponding antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Coverslips were visualized and imaged using a confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscope. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or differentiated adipocytes on 3-cm-diameter plastic dishes were incubated with 50 μg/ml CT-B-HRP (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA as described previously (24Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). They were then washed, fixed, and processed for HRP detection. Alternatively, cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde containing 1 mg/ml ruthenium red. The cell monolayer was embedded in a thin layer of Epon resin in situ. Sections were cut parallel to the culture substratum from the base of the cell. In some experiments, pieces of polymerized resin containing the cells were sandwiched together with fresh resin between them, and after polymerization vertical sections were prepared perpendicular to the culture substratum. For analysis of plasma membrane lawns by electron microscopy, fibroblasts were cultured on carbon/Formvar-coated gold grids in a 6-well multidish. After differentiating for 10 days, grids were transferred to a new well of a 6-well multidish containing 10 ml of PBS. Grids were fixed with forceps on the bottom of the well, and the grid was then sonicated for 1–3 s using a Sonifier 250 with a microtip (Branson Ultrasonics) 5 mm above the grid at output level 1 until the carbon/Formvar coating started to peel off. The plasma membrane lawns were then immunolabeled with polyclonal antibodies against caveolin-1 and protein A-gold 5 nm followed by fixation and staining as described elsewhere (25Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We have previously described a technique that we refer to as the plasma membrane lawn assay for examining the insulin-dependent movement of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (22Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Using this technique, highly purified plasma membrane fragments, termed plasma membrane lawns, are generated by sonication of whole cells attached to glass coverslips. Labeling of these fragments with antibodies specific for GLUT4 reveals very little labeling in the absence of insulin, whereas with insulin there is a marked increase in labeling. The GLUT4 labeling appears quite uniform across the plane of the membrane but also, in many cells, strongly labels very large ring structures that we have in the past not been able to explain. These structures are shown in Fig. 1. Lawns from insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were labeled with antibodies to GLUT4 (Fig. 1 A) or caveolin-1 (Fig. 1 B) and processed for immunofluorescence. Both proteins showed a strong labeling of the striking ring-like structures in many plasma membrane lawns, indicating that both raft-associated proteins such as caveolin and non-raft proteins such as GLUT4 (26Hill M.M. Clark S.F. James D.E. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2629-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are present in these structures. Although caveolin and GLUT4 were both found distributed over the entire basal surface of the adipocyte, this labeling appeared weaker than that in rings and generally appeared in a more restricted focal plane (data not shown). We then examined the distribution of GLUT4 in intact cells (control or insulin-stimulated) using three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal sections taken through the basal half of the cell. In the absence of insulin, GLUT4 was predominantly found in intracellular perinuclear structures (Fig.1 C), but after insulin stimulation there was a dramatic increase in the general cell surface GLUT4 labeling and in labeling of the rings (Fig. 1 D). The observation that these ring-like structures remained attached to the plasma membrane during preparation of plasma membrane lawns suggested that they were surface-connected. To test this possibility, we labeled adipocytes with FITC-labeled cholera toxin B subunit at 4 °C. Under these conditions, the probe labels the entire cell surface and is not internalized. As shown in Fig.2, the ring-shaped structures were clearly labeled by cholera toxin and colocalized with the caveolae marker, caveolin-1. We also examined the relationship of the rings to the cortical actin network. The ring-shaped structures were surrounded by FITC-phalloidin labeling indicative of f-actin (Fig.1 E). We next investigated whether other plasma membrane markers are associated with the ring-shaped structures. Plasma membrane lawns were prepared from adipocytes and labeled for immunofluorescence. We first labeled with antibodies to the coated pit marker, clathrin. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a focal plane close to the substratum shows clathrin labeling over the entire surface with a faint indication of ring-shaped labeling (arrowheads). However, a higher focal plane above the lawn (Fig. 3, B andB′) still reveals strong staining of the characteristic rings, now in the absence of general plasma membrane staining. Note that the limiting membrane of the cell is also evident in this plane, presumably representing part of the plasma membrane protruding above the substratum after sonication. We investigated whether other plasma membrane markers are present in the rings. As shown in Fig. 3,C–G and C′–G′, the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, IRAP, was evident within the caves of insulin-treated cells, and the transferrin receptor, the glucose transporter GLUT1, and the SNARE proteins syntaxin 4 and SNAP23, were all clearly evident within the rings of basal cells. Thus, markers of caveolae, clathrin-coated pits (clathrin, transferrin receptor), and other surface markers (GM1, GLUT1, syntaxin 4, and SNAP23) are all associated with the rings. To further characterize the surface morphology of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we used an HRP-labeled cholera toxin B subunit, CT-B-HRP, and electron microscopy. Cells were labeled with CT-B-HRP at 4 °C and then processed for HRP visualization and resin embedding in situ. Semi-thick sections were cut parallel to the culture substratum or samples were processed for vertical sections perpendicular to the culture plane. CT-B-HRP showed labeling of the entire surface and allowed good visualization of associated caveolae (Fig. 4 A). As expected, CT-B-HRP labeled both single caveolae as well as the characteristic groups of caveolae around a spherical surface structure, termed rosettes, which have been well characterized in both 3T3-L1 cells (9Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and other cell types (11Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). As in other cell types (11Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), clathrin-coated pits were also associated with these structures in adipocytes (data not shown), suggesting that they are not simply an elaborate caveolar structure. Sections parallel to the substratum also revealed long thin invaginations of the surface connecting groups of caveolae to the cell surface (Fig. 4 B). These surface-connected invaginations appear to account for the presence of small groups of caveolae deep within the cell interior. A striking example of this is shown in Fig.4 C, in which a caveolae group can be observed within an area of cytoplasm surrounded by the nucleus. Without a cell surface marker these structures could be assumed to be internal caveolae, endosomes, or caveosomes (27Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The most striking observation in these studies was the presence of huge CT-B-HRP-labeled structures within the cell interior. Although variable from cell to cell, these structures were readily visualized in sections cut parallel to the culture substratum after CT-B-HRP labeling (Figs. 5,6, and 8). Because cells were labeled at 4 °C, these structures are clearly surface-connected and correlate with the ring-shaped structures labeled with CT-B-FITC and caveolin-1 seen by light microscopy. As is evident in Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, at low magnification these structures could easily be mistaken for lipid bodies owing to their large size, electron-lucent lumen, and position in the cell (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). However, the labeling of these structures with CT-B-HRP as well as the presence of associated caveolae showed that these structures are surface-connected. We also used a different surface marker, the nonspecific plasma membrane marker ruthenium red (Fig. 7). Ruthenium red also showed striking labeling of the surface-connected “internal” structures in differentiated adipocytes. Neither ruthenium red nor CT-B-HRP labeled these structures in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (results not shown), showing that they are specific to the differentiated cells. We operationally termed these structures “adipocyte caves” to emphasize their presence in the differentiated cells and their unique surface architecture.Figure 6Electron microscopic analysis of adipocyte caves. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were processed and sectioned as described in the legend to Fig. 4 (A and B) or were resectioned perpendicular to the culture substratum (C). The large caves (asterisks) are several micrometers in diameter and surround the nucleus. The caves possess numerous caveolae (arrows), as shown at higher magnification in B.

Note that there are both caveolae and non-caveolar flat areas within the caves.L, lipid bodies. Bar = 600 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite their surface connection, the caves were often found extremely close to the nucleus, Golgi complex, and lipid bodies in the perinuclear area of the cell (Figs.Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Close examination of the caves showed them to be composed of both invaginated caveolar membrane and intervening non-caveolar planar membrane (e.g. see Figs.6 B and 7 C). The density of caveolae associated with the cave membrane was variable but in the same range as that observed at the peripheral plasma membrane. Clathrin-coated pits were also associated with the caves (Fig. 5 A) as well as thin filaments which, based on the immunofluorescence data (Fig. 1), we assume represent actin filaments (Fig. 5, A andC). We used perpendicular sections to further examine the relationship of the caves to the basal plasma membrane. In some sections, we fortuitously observed large invaginations at the base of the cell that extended upward toward the interior (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that the caves are huge pits in the basal plasma membrane. We also performed serial sectioning of CT-B-HRP-labeled cells, cutting a series of sections from the base of the cell (see Fig. 8 for representative sections). The first sections showed, as expected, that the entire basal cell surface was covered in densely packed CT-B-HRP-labeled caveolae (Fig. 8 A). Large CT-B-HRP-labeled structures were clearly visible in these, and in subsequent, serial sections (Fig. 8, B, C, and C′). Note that lipid bodies and nuclei were in the same plane as the caves, showing that the caves extend up from the base of the cell into the perinuclear area. Serial section analysis, combined with analysis of perpendicular sections (see above) showed that the caves are extremely large in the xy plane (up to several micrometers) but generally smaller in the z plane (one micrometer or less). Plasma membrane lawns have been extensively characterized by light microscopy. To allow exact correlation of the labeling seen by light microscopy, we developed methods to analyze the ring-shaped structures seen in plasma membrane lawns at the ultrastructural level by immunogold electron microscopy. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured on Formvar-coated grids and then sonicated to leave plasma membrane lawns attached to the grids. The grids were then immunogold labeled using antibodies to caveolin-1. As shown in Fig.9, putative caves were readily visualized with this technique, appearing as circular or multilobed structures within the center of the lawns. Caveolae, labeled with anti-caveolin antibodies, and clathrin-coated pits (recognized by characteristic morphology) were very abundant around many of the caves (Fig. 9,B–E). Other putative caves appeared to have been sheared off close to the plane of the plasma membrane and showed no evident concentration of caveolae or coated pits (Fig. 9 F). Taken together with observations of sectioned material, these observations suggest that concentration of markers within caves simply represents the amount of plasma membrane retained with the caves after sonication. The abundance of the rings was variable among different cells in the field, and we were unable to find any significant correlation between their abundance and other parameters such as density of lipid droplets, cell size, and insulin sensitivity. Regardless, based on serial section analysis we have estimated that the contribution of these structures to the total plasma membrane area may be as high as 25% in certain cells and so these structures may play an important role in transmitting signals or nutrients across the cell surface. This study represents the first ultrastructural description of a novel plasma membrane specialization in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells and has important implications. It has recently been suggested that adipocytes possess a novel signal-transduction pathway involved in insulin action that is localized to surface-connected caveolae (15Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 16Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the structures in which caveolin and the signaling proteins colocalize are identical morphologically to those reported here. Because the ring-shaped caves are the prominent structures observed in plasma membrane lawns (because they have greater depth than the flat plasma membrane between), it can appear that proteins colocalize in these domains by light microscopy. Colocalization of proteins, such as flotillin, with caveolin in the ring-like structures has been interpreted as evidence of caveolae localization (15Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, in view of the results presented here it is important to assess at the ultrastructural level whether such proteins are actually enriched in these domains as compared with the bulk plasma membrane. It is clear that higher resolution is required to show caveolae localization. Based on our data the rings, or caves as we call them, are not simply groups of caveolae but represent large plasma membrane domains with associated caveolae. GLUT4, a well characterized membrane protein that does not show raft association (26Hill M.M. Clark S.F. James D.E. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2629-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), is also clearly associated with this domain. These domains also appear to act as non-selective docking sites for exocytic vesicles. We have observed the presence of SNAREs in these structures (Fig. 3) and at times soon after insulin stimulation we have observed the simultaneous appearance of GLUT4 in both caves and the flat part of the membrane (data not shown). In addition, we have shown the association of clathrin-coated pits and transferrin receptors with caves. Analysis of plasma membrane lawns by electron microscopy, as described here, indicates that in some instances the caves, which extend away from the plane of the membrane, may remain associated with the lawns whereas in other cases they may be removed, presumably during the sonication process. This likely explains why on occasions we observe large holes in the lawns by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). In cases where the membrane is retained, it may appear that marker molecules are relatively enriched in these structures compared with the flat plasma membrane by light microscopy due to their extended height. This is well illustrated for clathrin (Fig. 3), in which the relative abundance of this marker in the flat part of the membraneversus the caves depends on where the plane is taken. Thus, further work is required to establish caveolae, or raft localization, of specific signaling pathways. The caves that we have described here appear to form during the process of adipocyte differentiation, because we were unable to detect them in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Notably, caves were not observed in all adipocytes in the culture suggesting that they may have a rather specialized role. Further study will be required to determine the function, biogenesis, and dynamics of these structures in adipocytes. The caves clearly represent areas of plasma membrane detachment from the substratum. Of note was the presence of filamentous material, which we assume represents extracellular matrix, traversing the lumen of each cave (see Fig. 8 for examples). Whether a simple absence of adhesion molecules in certain areas of the plasma membrane, or masking of these molecules, could cause the generation of the caves is presently unclear. After trypsinization of adipocytes, cave-like structures could still be detected but only in a minority of cells (results not shown). It also remains to be established whether caves are dynamic structures that are constantly being remodeled. Images of actin at the neck of two connected structures (e.g. Fig. 5) would certainly be consistent with this view, although previous studies suggest that clustered caveolae are not significantly affected by actin disruption (17Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that in a model adipocyte system large “internal” vacuoles are connected to the “limiting” membrane. Rather than simply groups of caveolae, these membranes have the characteristics of a plasma membrane domain; they are composed of caveolae, coated pits, raft and non-raft membranes and have an associated cortical actin network.

Here we identified a novel membrane-associated adaptor protein, LAX. LAX is mainly expressed in B cells, T cells, and other lymphoid-specific cell types. It shares no overall sequence homology with LAT and is not localized to lipid rafts. However, like LAT, LAX has tyrosine motifs for binding Grb2, Gads, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Upon stimulation via the B or T cell receptors, LAX is rapidly phosphorylated by Src and Syk family tyrosine kinases and interacts with Grb2, Gads, and p85. Overexpression of LAX in Jurkat cells specifically inhibits T cell receptor-mediated p38 MAPK activation and NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional activation. Our data suggested that LAX functions to negatively regulate signaling in lymphocytes.

However, like LAT, LAX has tyrosine motifs for binding Grb2, Gads, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Upon stimulation via the B or T cell receptors, LAX is rapidly phosphorylated by Src and Syk family tyrosine kinases and interacts with Grb2, Gads, and p85. Overexpression of LAX in Jurkat cells specifically inhibits T cell receptor-mediated p38 MAPK activation and NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional activation. Our data suggested that LAX functions to negatively regulate signaling in lymphocytes.

Although the BCR and TCR have different structures and recognize different forms of antigens, signaling pathways activated via these two receptors are strikingly similar. Both the BCR and TCR utilize receptor-encoded signaling motifs termed ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) to activate non-receptor tyrosine kinases (1Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Following receptor engagement, Src family tyrosine kinases, activated by the CD45 phosphatase, phosphorylate the paired tyrosine residues within ITAMs. Syk family kinases are then recruited to the receptor by binding phosphorylated ITAMs via their tandem SH2 domains and are subsequently activated by Src family kinases (2Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar).

Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The binding of Grb2 to LAT is postulated to recruit Sos to the membrane to activate Ras. The association of LAT with PLC-γ1 recruits PLC-γ1 to the membrane so it can be phosphorylated and activated. Activation of PLC-γ1 is essential for TCR-mediated Ca2+ flux and activation of Ras-GRP, a molecule that functions to activate Ras (17Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C.

TCR-mediated Ras-MAPK activation and Ca2+ flux are defective in LAT-deficient Jurkat cells, indicating that LAT is essential for TCR-mediated signaling (9Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 19Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Binding of Gads to LAT recruits SLP-76 indirectly to the membrane (20Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr.

Science. 2001; 291: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SLP-76 is also essential in TCR-mediated signaling as indicated in SLP-76-deficient cells (11Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 22Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). TCR-mediated MAPK activation and Ca2+ flux are severely compromised in these cells.As a membrane-associated adaptor protein, LAT plays a critical role in signaling in T cells. Similar molecules might also exist in other cell types with immune receptors. A similar molecule has not been found in B cells. It has been proposed that BLNK functions as both LAT and SLP-76 to link the BCR engagement to MAPK activation and Ca2+ flux (23Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). BCR-induced PLC-γ2 activation and Ca2+ flux are defective in BLNK-deficient cells (24Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). BCR-mediated JNK and Erk activation are also compromised. However, in contrast to LAT, BLNK is not constitutively localized to the membrane. Furthermore, LAT deficiency in Jurkat cells cannot be complemented by BLNK (25Wong J. Ishiai M. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33116-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is less likely that BLNK functions as both LAT and SLP-76 in B cells. It is possible that B cells or other lymphoid cells use a LAT-like molecule to link the receptor engagement to Ras-MAPK activation and Ca2+ flux. Due to the near completion of the human genome sequencing, it might be possible to find a LAT homolog in the human genome data base.To look for a LAT-like molecule in B cells and other cell types, we searched the human genome data base with the tyrosine motifs in LAT and identified a novel gene. We named it LAX. Like LAT, LAX is a membrane-associated adaptor protein. It is expressed in T cells, B cells, and other cell types of lymphoid origin. It associates with Grb2, Gads, and the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase. However, it is unlikely that LAX functions as a B cell LAT-like molecule. Our data show that as opposed to LAT, LAX functions to negatively regulate antigen-receptor signaling in T cells by inhibiting TCR-mediated p38 MAPK activation.DISCUSSIONAccumulating evidence indicates that adaptor proteins are important in antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathways. In this paper, we report identification of a novel membrane-associated adaptor molecule, LAX. LAX was exclusively expressed in lymphoid tissues. Of the several cell lines we tested, LAX was found in B, T, NK, and monocyte cell lines. In the cytoplasmic domain of LAX, there are multiple tyrosines. These tyrosines are within the Grb2- or p85-binding motifs. Upon stimulation via the TCR or BCR, LAX was tyrosine-phosphorylated and interacted with Grb2, Gads, and p85. By coexpressing LAX with Src and/or Syk tyrosine kinases, we showed that LAX could be phosphorylated by Lck, Syk, and ZAP-70. Phosphorylation of LAX was reduced in ZAP-70-deficient cells and was abolished in Lck-deficient cells. By overexpressing wild-type LAX and a mutant LAX with mutations at four critical tyrosines, we showed that overexpression of wild-type LAX inhibited p38 MAPK activation and NFAT/AP-1-mediated transcription in Jurkat cells, whereas overexpression of the mutant LAX had no effect. Our data indicated that LAX is an adaptor molecule that potentially functions to negatively regulate TCR signaling.LAX and LAT are membrane-associated adaptor proteins. Both of them have a short extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. Whereas LAT is expressed in T cells, NK cells, mast cells, and platelets (31Facchetti F. Chan J.K. Zhang W. Tironi A. Chilosi M. Parolini S. Notarangelo L.D. Samelson L.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), LAX is expressed in T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. We have not tested whether LAX is present in mast cells, platelets, or other cell types. Although LAT and LAX have no overall homology in amino acid sequences, the tyrosine motifs in their cytoplasmic domains are very similar (Fig. 1 B). These motifs are responsible for binding the SH2 domain-containing proteins. LAX has five Grb2-binding motifs (YXN) in its cytoplasmic tail. It also has a Gads motif (YVNV) identical to those in LAT. In addition, LAX has a p85-binding motif (YXXM), which is not present in LAT, although LAT is able to associate with p85. Upon antigen receptor stimulation, LAX also interacted with Grb2, Gads, and p85 like LAT. However, we have not been able to detect any significant interaction between LAX and PLC-γ1/2.Overexpression of LAX-WT inhibited NFAT activation, whereas overexpression of a LAX mutant with mutations at four tyrosines had no effect. It is possible that overexpression of LAX could sequester other signaling proteins from LAT and further inhibit TCR-mediated signaling. Biochemical analysis of Jurkat cells stably transfected with WT-LAX and LAX-4YF showed that overexpression of LAX had no significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, Ca2+, Erk, or Jnk activation, suggesting that overexpression of LAX did not inhibit LAT-mediated signaling by sequestering Grb2, Gads, and p85 from LAT. Interestingly, overexpression of LAX specifically inhibited TCR-mediated p38 MAPK activation. This suggested that LAX likely functions in the pathway of p38 MAPK.Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAPKs are three subgroups of the MAPK superfamily. These three kinases are all activated following T cell activation. These MAPKs phosphorylate different subsets of substrates (32Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The substrates for p38 MAPK include transcription factors (Elk-1, ATF2, CHOP, MEF2C, and SAP-1) and downstream protein kinases (Mnk1, Mnk2, PRAK, MSK1, etc). It is not clear how p38 MAPK activation is coupled to TCR engagement and how p38 contributes to IL-2 production in T cells. Pretreatment of Jurkat cells with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or expression of a dominant negative form of MKK6, one of the upstream kinase of p38, can suppress the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter (29Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It has been shown in mice that p38 MAPK activation can modulate T cell development and is required for the activation of Th1 cells but not for activation of Th2 cells (32Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Mulroy T. Sen J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3056-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our data placed LAX in the p38 pathway. However, how LAX suppresses p38 activation remains to be determined. Because the LAX mutant with mutations of four tyrosine residues failed to inhibit p38 activation, the interaction between LAX with Grb2, Gads, or p85 might be required for LAX function. It is likely that LAX might recruit a negative regulator, such as phosphatase, to the membrane to turn off p38 MAPK activation. However, we have not been able to detect any interaction between LAX and phosphatases.Previous studies (9Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 19Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) showed that LAT is critical in T cell activation. LAT-deficient cells are defective in TCR-mediated Ras-MAPK activation and Ca2+ flux. Our data here suggested that LAX functions differently from LAT as follows. 1) In contrast to LAT, LAX is not localized in lipid rafts. 2) Defective signaling in LAT-deficient Jurkat cells could not be rescued by expression of LAX. 3) LAX does not interact with PLC-γ1 or -γ2. Thus, LAX is less likely to function in linking receptor engagement to Ca2+flux.Signaling via the BCR shares many similar features as signaling via the TCR. BLNK associates with Grb2, Vav, PLC-γ1, and Nck in B cells similar to LAT and SLP-76 in T cells. BLNK is not constitutively localized in the membrane, which is different from LAT. Therefore, there might exist a LAT-like molecule in B cells. This molecule functions to recruit BLNK and its associated proteins to the membrane. As opposed to LAT, LAX is expressed in B cells. Upon activation via the BCR, LAX became tyrosine-phosphorylated. We have attempted to perform similar experiments to determine whether overexpression of LAX affects BCR-mediated NFAT activation. We failed to obtain any conclusive results due to a low efficiency of transfection with these B cells. The function of LAX in B cells needs to be further studied. Because LAX is not localized in lipid rafts and does not associate with PLC-γ1/2, it is less likely that LAX functions like LAT in B cells.In summary, we identified a novel membrane-associated adaptor protein, and we showed that it functions to negatively regulate TCR signaling. This inhibitory signal delivered by LAX may be critical for terminating IL-2 production in the late stage of immune responses. Interestingly, consistent with this notion, the amount of LAX protein extracted by Brij detergent was increased dramatically upon stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-TCR antibody or PMA. 2M. Zhu, E. Janssen, K. Leung, and W. Zhang, unpublished data. Increased LAX protein at the membrane might bring more inhibitory molecules to the membrane to turn off a T cell response. The mechanism by which LAX inhibited p38 MAPK and NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional activation remains to be determined. The precise function of LAX in lymphocyte signaling and immune response will be revealed by analysis of LAX-deficient mice.

Although the BCR and TCR have different structures and recognize different forms of antigens, signaling pathways activated via these two receptors are strikingly similar.

Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Following receptor engagement, Src family tyrosine kinases, activated by the CD45 phosphatase, phosphorylate the paired tyrosine residues within ITAMs. Syk family kinases are then recruited to the receptor by binding phosphorylated ITAMs via their tandem SH2 domains and are subsequently activated by Src family kinases (2Chan A.C.

By overexpressing wild-type LAX and a mutant LAX with mutations at four critical tyrosines, we showed that overexpression of wild-type LAX inhibited p38 MAPK activation and NFAT/AP-1-mediated transcription in Jurkat cells, whereas overexpression of the mutant LAX had no effect. Our data indicated that LAX is an adaptor molecule that potentially functions to negatively regulate TCR signaling.LAX and LAT are membrane-associated adaptor proteins. Both of them have a short extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. Whereas LAT is expressed in T cells, NK cells, mast cells, and platelets (31Facchetti F. Chan J.K. Zhang W. Tironi A. Chilosi M. Parolini S. Notarangelo L.D. Samelson L.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), LAX is expressed in T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. We have not tested whether LAX is present in mast cells, platelets, or other cell types. Although LAT and LAX have no overall homology in amino acid sequences, the tyrosine motifs in their cytoplasmic domains are very similar (Fig. 1 B). These motifs are responsible for binding the SH2 domain-containing proteins. LAX has five Grb2-binding motifs (YXN) in its cytoplasmic tail. It also has a Gads motif (YVNV) identical to those in LAT. In addition, LAX has a p85-binding motif (YXXM), which is not present in LAT, although LAT is able to associate with p85. Upon antigen receptor stimulation, LAX also interacted with Grb2, Gads, and p85 like LAT. However, we have not been able to detect any significant interaction between LAX and PLC-γ1/2.Overexpression of LAX-WT inhibited NFAT activation, whereas overexpression of a LAX mutant with mutations at four tyrosines had no effect. It is possible that overexpression of LAX could sequester other signaling proteins from LAT and further inhibit TCR-mediated signaling. Biochemical analysis of Jurkat cells stably transfected with WT-LAX and LAX-4YF showed that overexpression of LAX had no significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, Ca2+, Erk, or Jnk activation, suggesting that overexpression of LAX did not inhibit LAT-mediated signaling by sequestering Grb2, Gads, and p85 from LAT. Interestingly, overexpression of LAX specifically inhibited TCR-mediated p38 MAPK activation. This suggested that LAX likely functions in the pathway of p38 MAPK.Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAPKs are three subgroups of the MAPK superfamily. These three kinases are all activated following T cell activation. These MAPKs phosphorylate different subsets of substrates (32Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The substrates for p38 MAPK include transcription factors (Elk-1, ATF2, CHOP, MEF2C, and SAP-1) and downstream protein kinases (Mnk1, Mnk2, PRAK, MSK1, etc). It is not clear how p38 MAPK activation is coupled to TCR engagement and how p38 contributes to IL-2 production in T cells. Pretreatment of Jurkat cells with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or expression of a dominant negative form of MKK6, one of the upstream kinase of p38, can suppress the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter (29Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It has been shown in mice that p38 MAPK activation can modulate T cell development and is required for the activation of Th1 cells but not for activation of Th2 cells (32Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Mulroy T. Sen J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3056-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our data placed LAX in the p38 pathway. However, how LAX suppresses p38 activation remains to be determined. Because the LAX mutant with mutations of four tyrosine residues failed to inhibit p38 activation, the interaction between LAX with Grb2, Gads, or p85 might be required for LAX function. It is likely that LAX might recruit a negative regulator, such as phosphatase, to the membrane to turn off p38 MAPK activation. However, we have not been able to detect any interaction between LAX and phosphatases.Previous studies (9Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 19Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) showed that LAT is critical in T cell activation. LAT-deficient cells are defective in TCR-mediated Ras-MAPK activation and Ca2+ flux. Our data here suggested that LAX functions differently from LAT as follows. 1) In contrast to LAT, LAX is not localized in lipid rafts. 2) Defective signaling in LAT-deficient Jurkat cells could not be rescued by expression of LAX. 3) LAX does not interact with PLC-γ1 or -γ2. Thus, LAX is less likely to function in linking receptor engagement to Ca2+flux.Signaling via the BCR shares many similar features as signaling via the TCR. BLNK associates with Grb2, Vav, PLC-γ1, and Nck in B cells similar to LAT and SLP-76 in T cells. BLNK is not constitutively localized in the membrane, which is different from LAT. Therefore, there might exist a LAT-like molecule in B cells. This molecule functions to recruit BLNK and its associated proteins to the membrane. As opposed to LAT, LAX is expressed in B cells. Upon activation via the BCR, LAX became tyrosine-phosphorylated. We have attempted to perform similar experiments to determine whether overexpression of LAX affects BCR-mediated NFAT activation. We failed to obtain any conclusive results due to a low efficiency of transfection with these B cells. The function of LAX in B cells needs to be further studied. Because LAX is not localized in lipid rafts and does not associate with PLC-γ1/2, it is less likely that LAX functions like LAT in B cells.In summary, we identified a novel membrane-associated adaptor protein, and we showed that it functions to negatively regulate TCR signaling. This inhibitory signal delivered by LAX may be critical for terminating IL-2 production in the late stage of immune responses. Interestingly, consistent with this notion, the amount of LAX protein extracted by Brij detergent was increased dramatically upon stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-TCR antibody or PMA. 2M. Zhu, E. Janssen, K. Leung, and W. Zhang, unpublished data. Increased LAX protein at the membrane might bring more inhibitory molecules to the membrane to turn off a T cell response. The mechanism by which LAX inhibited p38 MAPK and NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional activation remains to be determined. The precise function of LAX in lymphocyte signaling and immune response will be revealed by analysis of LAX-deficient mice. Accumulating evidence indicates that adaptor proteins are important in antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathways. In this paper, we report identification of a novel membrane-associated adaptor molecule, LAX. LAX was exclusively expressed in lymphoid tissues. Of the several cell lines we tested, LAX was found in B, T, NK, and monocyte cell lines. In the cytoplasmic domain of LAX, there are multiple tyrosines. These tyrosines are within the Grb2- or p85-binding motifs. Upon stimulation via the TCR or BCR, LAX was tyrosine-phosphorylated and interacted with Grb2, Gads, and p85. By coexpressing LAX with Src and/or Syk tyrosine kinases, we showed that LAX could be phosphorylated by Lck, Syk, and ZAP-70.

https://openalex.org/W2048217643,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-binding protein (PBP) is an important coactivator for PPARγ and other transcription factors. PBP is an integral component of a multiprotein thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP)/vitamin D3 receptor-interacting protein (DRIP)/activator-recruited cofactor (ARC) complex required for transcriptional activity. To study the regulation of PBP by cellular signaling pathways, we identified the phosphorylation sites of PBP. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches and mutagenesis of PBP phosphorylation sites, we identified six phosphorylation sites on PBP: one exclusive protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site at serine 656, two protein kinase C (PKC) sites at serine 796 and serine 1345, a common PKA/PKC site at serine 756, and two extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 sites of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family at threonine 1017 and threonine 1444. Binding of PBP to PPARγ1 or retinoid-X-receptor for 9-cis-retinoic acid (RXR) is independent of their phosphorylation states, implying no changes in protein-protein interaction after modification by phosphorylation. Overexpression of RafBXB, an activated upstream kinase of the MAPK signal transduction pathway, exerts a significant additive inductive effect on PBP coactivator function. This effect is significantly diminished by overexpression of RafBXB301, a dominant negative mutant of RafBXB. These results identify phosphorylation as a regulatory modification event of PBP and demonstrate that PBP phosphorylation by Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade exerts a positive effect on PBP coactivator function. The functional role of PKA and PKC phosphorylation sites in PBP remains to be elucidated.

The resulting modification of chromatin structure is believed to facilitate transition from a CBP/p300-dependent to a mediator-dependent stage of transcription involving the TRAP/DRIP/ARC complex of coactivators that link with the general transcription machinery and RNA polymerase II (18Yuan C.X.

Although the CBP/p300 and p160 family of coactivators, as well as others that form the first complex, appears to function by exhibiting HAT and arginine methyltransferase activities, there exists limited information about the mechanisms by which PBP and other proteins that form the TRAP/DRIP/ARC complex influence transcription. PBP appears to lack detectable enzymatic activity of any kind and yet seems to be as vital as CBP/p300 to the survival of the organism. Disruption of the PBP and CBP/p300 genes in the mouse results in embryonic lethality around E11.5 days, indicating that these pivotal anchoring coactivators affect the function of many nuclear receptors and other transcription factors (28Crawford S.E.

Indeed, stimulation of CBP transcriptional coactivation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (43Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Google Scholar) points to phosphorylation as a positive regulatory modification in coactivator activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 by protein kinase C has been shown to attenuate the transcriptional activity of p300, suggesting that different signaling pathways operate in differing ways to determine the coactivator function (7McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar, 47Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Google Scholar). These studies underscored the need to explore the role of phosphorylation and of kinase signaling pathways to understand the influence of coactivators in cell- and gene-specific transcription. Because very little information is available about mechanisms that influence the coactivator function of PBP, the pivotal component of the TRAP/DRIP/ARC coactivator complex (40Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Google Scholar, 41Ito M. Yuan C.-X. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 683-693Google Scholar, 42Kang Y.K. Guermah M. Yuan C.-X. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2642-2647Google Scholar), it appeared necessary to examine the role of phosphorylation in PBP function. Using in vitro andin vivo approaches, we established that PBP is phosphorylated and then identified the major PKA, PKC, and MAPK phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, the effect of activation of MAPK on PBP-mediated PPARγ1 transcription suggested that this kinase signal transduction pathway positively influences PBP function.DISCUSSIONRecent studies have demonstrated that CBP, p300, and PBP play a critical role as coactivators for a wide range of nuclear receptors and certain transcription factors involved in many cellular functions (5Ito M.

Consistent with their functional importance is that homozygous mutations in CBP, p300, and PBP result in embryonic lethality (28Crawford S.E. Qi C. Misra P. Stellmach V. Rao M.S. Engel J.D. Zhu Y.

The mechanisms by which diverse coactivators exert their effects in a coordinated combinatorial manner in regulating gene expression in divergent biological processes remain largely unclear. It appears that some of the recently identified coactivators and coactivator-binding proteins bridge the multiprotein transcriptional complexes into a distinctive multiprotein megacomplex (24Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar, 61Misra P. Qi C. Yu S. Shah S.H. Cao W.Q. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 11836-11841Google Scholar). Nonetheless, new insights have emerged regarding the role of post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation in coactivator activity (5–7, 27,). Of particular interest are recent observations suggesting that coactivators are influenced by cellular kinase signaling pathways and such alterations may determine the contextual functionality of coactivators (7McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar). CBP/p300 and SRC family members appear particularly sensitive to modification by kinase-mediated pathways (43Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem.

Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 127-134Google Scholar, 6Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Google Scholar, 7McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar).To delineate the role of signaling pathways that may influence PBP function, we have first established that PBP is phosphorylated under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. We then determined the phosphorylation sites in PBP using in vitrokinase assays and site-directed mutations and then analyzed the role of PKA- and MAPK-induced PBP phosphorylation in PPARγ1 activation. Of the 17 putative phosphorylation sites in PBP, we have positively identified 6 as phosphorylation sites (Figs. 2 and 3). Four phosphorylation sites are at serine 656, 756, 796, and 1345, and the remaining two sites are at threonine 1017 and 1444. In vivomutation study confirmed the authenticity of in vivophosphorylation of threonine 1444. The serine 656 is in close proximity, within 22 amino acids, of the second of the two LXXLL signature motifs located at aa 589–593 and aa 630–634 in PBP that are necessary and sufficient for interaction with nuclear receptors (14Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Google Scholar, 60Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar). Changes in phosphorylation of this site as well as other phosphorylation sites in this region (Fig. 6) do not appear to affect PBP binding to the nuclear receptor PPARγ1. Using multiple GST-PBP fusion fragments, site-directed mutations, and differential use of kinases, we determined that serine 656 is an exclusive PKA phosphorylation site, serine 796 and 1345 are PKC sites, and serine 756 is a common PKA/PKC site. These four sites have the typical RXXS phosphorylation consensus sequence used by PKA and PKC (56Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Google Scholar). The threonine 1017 (PFTP; boldface letter) and threonine 1444 (PAYTP; boldface letter) in PBP, which were found to be phosphorylated by MAPK (ERK2 and -5), are located, respectively, within perfect (PX(S/T)P) and imperfect (PXX(S/T)P) consensus phosphorylation sequences for MAPK (57Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3753-3757Google Scholar, 58Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr.

Surprisingly, threonine 1444 in the imperfect consensus MAPK phosphorylation sequence appeared as a robust phosphorylation site when compared with threonine 1017 (Fig. 5). Using this PBP fragment, we have established that threonine 1444 phosphorylation is dependent upon Raf1 MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) cascade (Figs. 5and 8), leading to the speculation that ERK2 and -5 may act cooperatively to regulate PBP phosphorylation. We have demonstrated that threonine 1444 is phosphorylated in vivo. In vivo authentication of the remaining PKA, PKC, and MAPK phosphorylation sites in PBP and mutational analyses will be required to further study the physical interactions between phosphorylated PBP and other coactivators and transcription factors.The demonstration of PKA-, PKC-, and MAPK-dependent phosphorylation sites in PBP suggests that these signaling pathways can affect PBP activity either independently or in concert. Activated Raf (RafBXB) exerted robust enhancement of PBP coactivator activity of PPARγ1 transcription, and the increase was abrogated in the presence of the dominant mutant of Raf (RafBXB301), indicating a definitive involvement of this signal transduction cascade in the regulation of PBP function. Recent studies strongly implicate kinase-mediated modifications in the recruitment and function of coactivators (6Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol.

In this study, we examine the activation of CDK2-cyclin E by constructing a CDK2 that is constitutively targeted to the nucleus. Activation of CDK2 requires the removal of two inhibitory phosphates (Thr-14 and Tyr-15) and the addition of one activating phosphate (Thr-160) by a nuclear localized CDK-activating kinase, which is thought to be constitutively active. Surprisingly, nuclear localized CDK2-NLS and CDK2-NLS(A14,F15), which lacks the inhibitory phosphorylation sites, require serum to become active, despite complexing with expressed cyclin E. We show that inhibition of mitogen-mediated ERK activation by treatment with U0126, a selective MEK inhibitor, or expression of dominant-negative ERK markedly reduces the phosphorylation of Thr-160 and enzymatic activity of both CDK2-NLS constructs. Consistent with a role for ERK in Thr-160 phosphorylation, expression of constitutively active Raf-1 induces Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS in serum-arrested cells, an effect that is blocked by treatment with U0126.

Taken together, these data show a new role for ERK in G1 cell cycle progression: In addition to its role in stimulating cyclin D1 expression and nuclear translocation of CDK2, ERK regulates Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-cyclin E. In eukaryotic cells, growth factors activate signaling pathways that stimulate cells to divide. The sequential activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; CAK, CDK-activating kinase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase controls the orderly progression of cell cycle events (1Sherr C.J.

The first CDK to become active in G1 is CDK4/6, which requires the accumulation of cyclin D (5Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Two signaling pathways, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway are required for cyclin D1 accumulation, and therefore, cell cycle progression in IIC9 cells (9Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Google Scholar, 10Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Google Scholar). To promote progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, mitogen-induced signals are required through the G1-S phase transition, for reasons that are not fully understood (11Donjerkovic D. Scott D.W. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 1-16Google Scholar, 12Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Google Scholar, 13Dou Q.P. Levin A.H. Zhao S. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1493-1497Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the major and perhaps only function of cyclin d-CDK4/6 is to regulate the accumulation of the next activating cyclin, cyclin E (14Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Google Scholar,15Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Google Scholar). Cyclin E is required for the late G1 activation of CDK2 (16Koff A. Cross F. Fisher A. Schumacher J. Leguellec K. Philippe M. Roberts J.M.

Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Google Scholar). CDK2-cyclin E has many reported substrates and is critical for regulating several cell-cycle components necessary for progression into S phase (18Winey M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R449-R452Google Scholar, 19Zhao J. Dynlacht B. Imai T. Hori T. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 456-461Google Scholar, 20Dynlacht B.D. Flores O. Lees J.A. Harlow E.

Riabowol K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1593-1602Google Scholar). In addition to cyclin E accumulation, activation of CDK2 requires additional modifications to become active. Recently, CDK2-cyclin E translocation to the nucleus has been shown to be necessary for enzymatic activation (23Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22404-22409Google Scholar, 24Blanchard D.A. Mouhamad S. Auffredou M.T. Pesty A. Bertoglio J. Leca G. Vazquez A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4184-4189Google Scholar, 25Dietrich C. Wallenfang K. Oesch F. Wieser R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 72-78Google Scholar). This is, presumably, because of post-translational modifications that occur only in the nucleus and are required for CDK2 activity. One such nuclear modification is phosphorylation on Thr-160. The phosphorylation site, located on the “T-loop” is highly conserved among all CDKs and is essential for proper alignment of the kinase domain (26Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Google Scholar, 27Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Google Scholar). Thr-160 phosphorylation is thought to be carried out by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) activity. The identity of CAK is reported to be the heterotrimeric complex consisting of p40MO15 (CDK7), cyclin H, and menage-a-trois (MAT1), which is believed to be constitutively active and nuclear (28Larochelle S. Pandur J. Fisher R.P. Salz H.K. Suter B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 370-381Google Scholar, 29Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 285-289Google Scholar, 30Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Google Scholar, 31Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Google Scholar). Another post-translational modification that is required for CDK2 activity is the removal of inhibitory phosphorylations on Thr-14 and Tyr-15 (32Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Google Scholar). These phosphates are added to CDK2 by the cytosolic mixed-lineage kinase Wee-1. They are removed by cdc25A phosphatase (32Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Google Scholar, 34Sexl V. Diehl J.A. Sherr C.J. Ashmun R. Beach D. Roussel M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 573-582Google Scholar). The regulation and localization of cdc25A is not well understood (35Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Google Scholar). Our laboratory recently found a second role for ERK in G1progression. In that study (23Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22404-22409Google Scholar), we show that U0126, a MEK inhibitor, blocks nuclear translocation and activation of CDK2-cyclin E, indicating a role for ERK kinase in CDK2-cyclin E nuclear translocation. However, these studies did not address whether other mitogen-mediated modifications are critical for nuclear CDK2-cyclin E activation. To address this question, we targeted CDK2-cyclin E to the nucleus, examined the activation of CDK2-cyclin E complexes, and found a novel role for ERK in the activation of nuclear targeted CDK2-cyclin E (CDK2-NLS).

IIC9 cells (Chinese Hamster Embryonic Fibroblasts) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4. 5 g/liter glucose and 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma). Growth-arrested (Go) cells were established by washing subconfluent (80%) or transfected cells once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by a 48-h incubation with α-MEM containing 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (basal medium). Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were stimulated with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. U0126 at 10 μm(PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and LY294002 at 15 μm(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were added to cells 30 min before stimulation. IIC9 cells were grown to subconfluency (80%) in DMEM containing 4. 5 g/liter glucose and 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma). Cells were transfected with a solution containing 5 μl/ml PlusTM, 5 μl/ml LipofectAMINETM (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of total DNA per 1 ml in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Five hours post-transfection, DMEM supplemented with FCS (final serum concentration of 0.1% v/v), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin was added. After 12 h, the cells were growth-arrested for 24 h in basal medium before stimulation. Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 10% FCS after pre-incubation in the absence or presence of 15 μm LY294002 or 10 μm U0126 for 30 min. After the indicated time, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped into cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7. 5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm sodium vanadate, 20 mmsodium fluoride, 50 μm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were sonicated briefly, and insoluble material was pelleted by microcentrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Plus (Pierce, Rockford, IL) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were incubated with 1 μg of monoclonal c-Myc tag antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, New York) or 1 μg of CDK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C with gentle rocking overnight. The immune complexes were then immunoprecipitated by 2-h incubation with protein G-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were pelleted by microcentrifugation at 6,000 × g and washed two times with lysis buffer, two times with cold PBS, and once with cold wash buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm MgCl2). Immune complexes were resuspended in 30 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 μm β-glycerophosphate, and 20 μm ATP) and incubated with 4 μg of histone H1 (Calbiochem) and 0.5 μCi of [32P-γ]ATP at 30 °C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 13 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and CDK2-cyclin E activity was quantified using a PhosphorImager TM (AmershamBiosciences). Transfected and growth-arrested IIC9 cells grown on chamber slides (Nalgene® Labware, Rochester, NY) were incubated in the absence or presence of 10% FCS. After 17 h of stimulation, cells were fixed in a 3.7% formalin (Sigma) solution for 10 min at room temperature followed by a 6-min incubation in ice-cold methanol at −20 °C and then supplemented with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). The cells were washed in PBS twice and blocked in 1 ml of blocking buffer (0.8 g of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in 100 ml of PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Monoclonal(9E10) c-Myc tag antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) was added at a 1:35 dilution (antibody: blocking buffer) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The slides were washed three times with PBS. The secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG, Texas Red-linked (Amersham Biosciences) was added (1:50 dilution in blocking buffer) for 45 min at room temperature. Again the slides were washed three times with PBS and then mounted using gel mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and microscope coverslips (Fisher Scientific). Images were visualized using a fluorescent microscope. Transfected and growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10% FCS after pretreatment in the presence or absence of 15 μm LY294002 or 10 μm U0126 for 30 min. At the indicated times, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped into cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 50 μmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were sonicated briefly, and the insoluble material was pelleted by microcentrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Plus (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. Protein lysates (100–300 μg) were incubated with 5 μg of monoclonal(9E10) c-Myc tag antibody (Upstate) or 5 μg of polyclonal CDK4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C with gentle rocking overnight. Immune complexes were then immunoprecipitated by 2-h incubation with protein G-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immune complexes were pelleted by microcentrifugation at 6,000 × g and washed three times with cold lysis buffer and two times with cold PBS supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 50 μmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. Immunocomplexes were resuspended in 1× PBS in Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-12%polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp, Boston, MA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Membranes were probed with phospho-CDK2(T160) polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), CDK2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), or cyclin E monoclonal antibody (Upstate). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (AmershamBiosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Previously, we found that mitogen-induced ERK activity is required for CDK2 nuclear translocation (23Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22404-22409Google Scholar). In addition, several studies have shown that CAK activates CDK2 in the nucleus in late G1 (39Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4213-4221Google Scholar). Because CAK is reported to be constitutively active and localized to the nucleus, we reasoned that targeting CDK2-cyclin E to the nucleus should result in activation of CDK2 in serum-arrested cells. Therefore, we constructed a construct that expresses human CDK2 cDNA with a 3× NLS (Fig.1 A). This construct also contains a C-terminal c-Myc tag, which allows us to distinguish CDK2-NLS from endogenous CDK2. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies directed against the c-Myc tag shows nuclear labeling (Fig.1 B), in both serum-arrested and serum-stimulated cells. Nuclear labeling was not detected in untransfected cells (data not shown). We do not detect c-Myc tag immunofluorescence outside of the nucleus, indicating that CDK2-NLS localizes exclusively to the nucleus, independent of serum stimulation. Because full activation of CDK2 requires association with a cyclin (E, A), we next examined whether CDK2-NLS will form a complex with ectopically expressed cyclin E. These conditions represent non-physiologic expression of CDK-NLS and unscheduled expression of cyclin E in quiescent cells. Therefore, ensuring complex formation is of particular interest. To test this, lysates were prepared from serum-arrested cells expressing CDK2-NLS, cyclin E, or both, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the c-Myc tag. c-Myc tagged-CDK2 immunocomplexes from basal cell lysates do not contain cyclin E when only CDK2-NLS is expressed (Fig.2 A, lane 2). Cyclin E does co-immunoprecipitate with CDK2 when CDK2-NLS and cyclin E are co-expressed in basal cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). As a specificity control we immunoprecipitated CDK4 and examined whether the immunocomplexes contain CDK2 or cyclin E (Fig. 2 A,lane 4). Consistent with the specificity of the interactions of the CDKs with their appropriate cyclin, neither cyclin E nor CDK2 co-immunoprecipitates with CDK4 (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). These data indicate that CDK2-NLS does not require serum to form a complex with ectopically expressed cyclin E. We next asked whether nuclear-targeted CDK2 requires mitogen to become active. To examine this, we transfected CDK2-NLS into IIC9 cells, together with cyclin E, and measured in vitro kinase activity from serum-arrested and serum-stimulated cells. Surprisingly, in serum-arrested cells, CDK2-NLS shows negligible kinase activity (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). However, addition of serum induces an approximate 17-fold activation of CDK2-NLS (Fig.2 B, lane 4), indicating that CDK2-NLS requires mitogenic signaling to become enzymatically active. For our activity control, we also constructed CDK2-NLS(A160) (Fig. 1 A), which contains an alanine substituted for Thr-160 and cannot be activated by mitogen (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). This construct is also found exclusively in the nucleus, independent of serum (Fig. 1 C). These data show that targeting CDK2-NLS-cyclin E complexes to the nucleus is not sufficient for catalytic activation. A possible explanation of the serum dependence of CDK2-NLS-cyclin E activation is the presence of known CDK2 inhibitor proteins (such as members of the CIP/KIP family) in the CDK2-NLS/cyclin E complex in basal, but not stimulated cells (40Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar, 41Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Google Scholar, 42Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Google Scholar). The CDK2 inhibitor p27Kip1 accumulates in serum-arrested cells, but re-addition of serum induces a reduction in steady-state protein levels (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and2) (43Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Google Scholar, 44Hu W. Bellone C.J. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3396-3401Google Scholar). However, we were unable to find p27Kip1 in the CDK2-NLS-cyclin E c-Myc tag immunocomplexes in basal or stimulated cells (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and4). Similarly, we were also unable to detect p21CIP1/WAF1 in complex with CDK2-NLS/cyclin E (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that either p27 or p21 blocks CDK2-NLS activation in serum-arrested cells. Because cyclin E accumulation, CDK2 nuclear translocation, and the subsequent post-translational modifications, which are required for activation, occur late in G1 (23Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22404-22409Google Scholar, 44Hu W. Bellone C.J. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3396-3401Google Scholar), endogenous CDK2-cyclin E becomes active late in G1. We expect CDK2-NLS-cyclin E to become active more rapidly than endogenous CDK2, because it localizes to the nucleus in serum-arrested cells. Consistent with this expectation, serum induces a marked increase in CDK2-NLS-cyclin E activity in 3 h, with full activation in only 5 h of serum stimulation (Fig.4 B). In accordance with earlier reports, endogenous CDK2 does not become fully active until 12 h of serum stimulation (Fig. 4 A). These data are consistent with the notion that endogenous CDK2 is activated in the nucleus. Furthermore, because nuclear translocation of endogenous CDK2-cyclin E occurs 12 h after serum addition (23Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22404-22409Google Scholar) and CDK2-NLS-cyclin E is activated after 5 h (Fig. 4 B,lane 4), the results suggest that the enzymatic activities required for the post-translational modifications of CDK2 are present hours before nuclear translocation. In addition to association with cyclin E, CDK2 requires post-translational modifications in order to become activated. Inhibitory phosphorylations on Thr-14 and Tyr-15, which are added by the cytosolic mixed-lineage kinase Wee-1 and removed by the mixed phosphatase cdc25A, must be removed for CDK2 to become active (34Sexl V. Diehl J.A. Sherr C.J. Ashmun R. Beach D. Roussel M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 573-582Google Scholar). Little is known about the regulation of cdc25A. A possible explanation why CDK2-NLS requires serum to become active is that cdc25A requires mitogen to de-phosphorylate Thr-14 and Tyr-15. To examine this, we constructed CDK2-NLS(A14,F15), which contains an alanine and phenylalanine substitution for Thr-14 and Tyr-15, respectively (Fig.5 A). This construct also localizes exclusively to the nucleus (data not shown). Because this construct cannot be phosphorylated at these sites, cdc25A phosphatase activity is not required for activation. Intriguingly, when co-transfected with cyclin E, CDK2-NLS(A14,F15) does not have catalytic activity in serum-arrested cells, but displays 17-fold stimulation with the addition of serum (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, the time course of activation of CDK2-NLS(A14,F15) mirrors that of CDK2-NLS, becoming fully active in 5 h (data not shown). This argues that the dephosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 is not the serum-dependent step required for CDK2-NLS activation. Because CDK2-NLS(A14,F15) requires serum to become active, we reasoned that the serum-dependent step for CDK2-NLS-cyclin E activation is the phosphorylation on Thr-160. We tested this by examining Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK-NLS at various times after re-addition of serum, using an antibody specific for Thr-160-phosphorylated CDK2. By immunoprecipitating equal amounts of CDK2-NLS (Fig. 6, upper), we observed that serum induces the phosphorylation of Thr-160 in 3 h, with CDK2-NLS becoming maximally phosphorylated in 5 h (Fig. 6,lower). The Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS(A14,F15) is similarly induced by serum (Fig.7 B). These results indicate that, although CDK2-NLS localizes to the nucleus, serum is required for the phosphorylation of Thr-160, and therefore, activity. This suggests that CAK activity is growth factor-dependent and required for CDK2-NLS activity.Figure 7Effect of U0126 on CDK2-NLS activity and Thr-160 phosphorylation. A, IIC9 cells were co-transfected with c-Myc-tagged CDK2-NLS and cyclin E and growth-arrested for 24 h. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of U0126 or LY29004 30 min before stimulation. Cells were stimulated by adding FCS to a 10% (v/v) final concentration for 17 h. Lysates were collected by scraping into cold lysis buffer, and protein lysate (100 μg) was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of c-Myc tag antibodies. Immunocomplexes were assayed for the ability to phosphorylate histone H1 in vitro. B, IIC9 cells were co-transfected with c-Myc-tagged CDK2-NLS(A14,F15) and cyclin E and growth-arrested for 24 h. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of either 10 μm U0126 or 15 μmLY29004 30 min before stimulation, as indicated. The IIC9 cells were then stimulated by addition of FCS to 10% for indicated lengths of time. Lysates were collected by scraping into cold lysis buffer, and protein lysate (300 μg) was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of c-Myc tag antibodies. Immunocomplexes were examined by Western blotting using antibodies directed against CDK2 (upper) or phospho-CDK2(T160) (lower). Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In an effort to elucidate the specific signaling mechanisms that are required for CDK2-NLS activation, we made use of selective inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the ERK cascade, two pathways that are critical for cell-cycle progression. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that inhibition of CDK2-cyclin E activity by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, but not an ERK cascade inhibitor, can be overcome by transient transfection of cyclin E in stimulated cells (23Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22404-22409Google Scholar). Pre-treatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126, which prevents the MEK activation of ERK, inhibited the activation of CDK2-NLS in a concentration-dependent manner, fully inhibiting activation at 10 μm (Fig. 7 A, lanes 3–5). In contrast, addition of 20 μm LY29004, a concentration which selectively inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and cell-cycle progression in IIC9 cells (9Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Google Scholar, 45Goel R. Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18640-18648Google Scholar), does not effect CDK2-NLS activity (Fig. 7 A, lane 6). Because we found the phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS on Thr-160 to be the serum-dependent step in activation, and because MEK activity is critical for activation, we reasoned that ERK regulates the phosphorylation of CDK2 on Thr-160. Not surprisingly, we found that U0126 inhibits Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS(A14,F15) in serum-stimulated cells, whereas LY29004 is ineffective (Fig.7 B). The same result was found with CDK2-NLS (Fig.8 A, lanes 1–4). These data indicate a critical role for ERK in the phosphorylation of CDK2 on Thr-160. Furthermore, the time course of Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS (Fig. 6) and CDK2-NLS(A14,F15) (Fig.7 B, lanes 1–4) were concomitant with the time course of enzymatic activation (Fig. 4 B). If ERK activity is required for the phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS on Thr-160, transfection of a dominant-negative ERK construct should prevent serum-stimulated Thr-160 phosphorylation. As expected, in serum-stimulated cells, expression of ERK(K71R) diminishes Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS (Fig.8 A, lane 5) to levels below that of basal (Fig.8 A, lane 1), demonstrating that ERK activity is necessary for this phosphorylation. To further demonstrate the role of the ERK cascade in Thr-160 phosphorylation, we expressed a constitutively active Raf-1 construct in basal cells. Raf-1 is the upstream activator (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase) of the ERK cascade, and therefore, constitutively active Raf-1 stimulates the ERK cascade independent of growth factors (46Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Google Scholar, 47Macdonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson R.L. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Google Scholar, 48Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Google Scholar). Intriguingly, expression of constitutively active Raf-1 induced robust Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS in basal cells (Fig.8 B, lane 4), indicating that stimulation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is sufficient for Thr-160 phosphorylation. Moreover, this effect was almost completely blocked by treatment with the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 8 B, lane 5). Taken together, these data (Figs. 7 and 8) strongly indicate a crucial role for the ERK pathway in regulating CDK2 phosphorylation on Thr-160. The phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) by CDK4 and CDK2 relieves the pRb-mediated repression of the E2F transcription factors, thus promoting G1progression (49Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei S.A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Google Scholar, 50Chow K.N. Starostik P. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7173-7181Google Scholar, 51Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Google Scholar). Because pRb represses E2F-mediated transcription and cyclin E is downstream of E2F, we anticipate that the activation of CDK2-NLS-cyclin E is independent of pRb. RbΔcdk is a mutant pRb that cannot be phosphorylated by CDKs and does not release from E2F on serum stimulation (38Leng X. Connell-Crowley L. Goodrich D. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 709-712Google Scholar). Expression of RbΔcdkhas been shown to inhibit E2F-driven reporters, cyclin A expression, and cell-cycle progression. 2S. M. Keenan, N. H. Lents, and J. J. Baldassare, unpublished results.However, expression of RbΔcdk does not diminish Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS (Fig. 9,lane 4), arguing against a role for pRb in the phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS on Thr-160. Consistent with this, overexpression of E2F1 in basal cells does not induce Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS (Fig. 9, lane 3). These data, together with the rapid time course, argue that the role for ERK in inducing Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2-NLS is through a target other than pRb/E2F. The enzymatic activation of the first CDK to become active in G1progression, CDK4-cyclin D, has been studied in detail. However, much less is known about the regulation of CDK2-cyclin E, an activity crucial for progression into S phase. The role for ERK in promoting the accumulation of cyclin D1 in early G1 is well established. In demonstrating the importance of ERK in regulating CDK2 nuclear translocation, a second role for ERK in G1 progression was found (23Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22404-22409Google Scholar). In the present study, using a CDK2 that localized to the nucleus independent of mitogen, and overexpressing cyclin E, we found yet another role for ERK in G1 progression, i.e.Thr-160 phosphorylation and activation of CDK2-cyclin E. Thus, ERK activity is important throughout G1; regulating cyclin D1 expression, CDK2-cyclin E nuclear translocation, and the phosphorylation and activation of CDK2-cyclin E (Fig.10). In an interesting study, Chiariello et al. (52Chiariello M. Gomez E. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 869-876Google Scholar) used ERK cascade inhibitors and showed that CDK2 failed to become phosphorylated on Thr-160 upon serum stimulation. However, because the role for ERK in CDK2 nuclear translocation was not known, the authors were most likely observing a failure of CDK2 to translocate to the nucleus, where Thr-160 phosphorylation is reported to take place. The use of nuclear-targeted CDK2 afforded us the ability to examine Thr-160 phosphorylation independent of nuclear translocation. The activity thought to be responsible for this phosphorylation is termed CAK, the identity of CAK is reported to be the CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 complex (28Larochelle S. Pandur J. Fisher R.P. Salz H.K. Suter B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 370-381Google Scholar, 31Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Google Scholar, 53Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5027-5036Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ERK regulates the activity of CAK, if at all, remains unknown. In IIC9 cells, CDK7 immunocomplexes appear to have full CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 activity in basal, stimulated, and U0126-treated cells, 3N. H. Lents and J. J. Baldassare, unpublished results. demonstrating that ERK is not regulating CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 activation. Some studies (54Martinez A.M. Afshar M. Martin F. Cavadore J.C. Labbe J.C. Doree M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 343-354Google Scholar,55Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Google Scholar) have speculated that growth factors may alter CDK7 substrate specificity, suggesting that ERK may regulate the ability of CDK7 to recognize CDK2-cyclin E. Another explanation is the subcellular localization of CDK7, for example it may be associated with the transcription factor TFIIH complex in serum-arrested cells and become dissociated in late G1. A final explanation is that ERK regulates a CAK activity different than CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1. Interestingly, a CAK activity that is not CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 has been reported in yeast and human cells (33Tsakraklides V. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar, 39Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4213-4221Google Scholar, 56Nagahara H. Ezhevsky S.A. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Dowdy S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14961-14966Google Scholar). As CAK activity is studied in more detail, the ERK substrate that mediates CAK regulation may become clear."

We have previously shown that hemolysin production is repressed by adding glucose to culture media and that production can be restored by adding cAMP. In this study, hemolysin activity and the level of vvh transcript were determined to reach a maximum in late exponential phase and were repressed when cells entered stationary phase. Northern blot and primer extension analyses revealed that vvhA is cotranscribed with a second gene, vvhB, located upstream of vvhA. Transcription of the vvhBA operon begins at a single site and is under the direction of a single promoter, Pvvh. A crp null mutation decreased hemolysin production and the level of vvhBA transcript by reducing the activity of Pvvh, indicating that the Pvvh activity is under the positive control of cAMP receptor protein (CRP). A direct interaction between CRP and the regulatory region of the vvhBA operon was demonstrated by gel-mobility shift assays. The CRP binding site, centered at 59.5 bp upstream of the transcription start site, was mapped by deletion analysis of the vvhBA promoter region and confirmed by DNase I protection assays.

The pathogenic marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus is the causative agent of food-borne diseases such as gastroenteritis in healthy persons and life-threatening septicemia in immunocompromised individuals (1Blake P.A. Weaver R.E. Hollis D.G. Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 341-367Google Scholar, 2Klontz K.C. Lieb S. Schreiber M. Janowski H.T. Baldy S.M. Gunn R.A. Ann. Intern. Med. 1988; 109: 318-323Google Scholar, 3Tacket C.O. Brenner F. Blake P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1984; 149: 558-561Google Scholar). V. vulnificus infections are remarkable for their invasiveness, severe tissue damage, and rapidly fulminating course of disease. The characterization of somatic as well as secreted products of V. vulnificus has yielded a large list of putative virulence factors, whose known or putative functions are consistent with disease pathology (4Linkous D.A. Oliver J.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 207-214Google Scholar). Among the putative virulence factors is the cytolytic hemolysin encoded by the vvhA gene. Hemolysin can lyse red blood cells from a variety of animal species by forming small pores in the cytoplasmic membrane. Hemolysin also shows cytolytic activity against cultured cell lines (5Shinoda S. Miyoshi S. Tamanaka H. Miyoshi N.N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 29: 583-590Google Scholar, 6Yamamoto K. Wright A.C. Kaper J.B. Morris Jr., J.G. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2706-2709Google Scholar). Purified hemolysin, which has an estimated molecular mass of 51 kDa, is heat-labile and toxic for Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Gray L.D. Kreger A.S. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 62-72Google Scholar, 8Kreger A. Lockwood D. Infect. Immun. 1981; 33: 583-590Google Scholar, 9Wright A.C. Morris Jr., J.G. Maneval Jr., D.R. Richardson K. Kapar J.B. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 922-924Google Scholar). When injected intravenously, the purified toxin is lethal in mice at levels of ∼3 μg/kg body weight. It has been reported that hemolysin may bind to cholesterol and induce the release of K+ ions and to a lesser extent Na+ ions from liposome (10Yamanka H. Katsu T. Satoh T. Shimatani S. Shinoda S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 44: 253-258Google Scholar). Although there is a substantial body of literature concerning the biochemical and pathogenic properties of hemolysin, only a few studies have addressed the mechanisms whereby expression of the virulence factor is modulated (11Bang Y.B. Lee S.E. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7639-7642Google Scholar). A 3.4-kb DNA fragment of V. vulnificus strain EDL174, which encodes VvhA, has been cloned, and its nucleotide sequence has been reported (6Yamamoto K. Wright A.C. Kaper J.B. Morris Jr., J.G. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2706-2709Google Scholar). This DNA fragment contains two genes, vvhB andvvhA. The vvhA gene encodes hemolysin, but the function of the vvhB gene product is unknown. In a previous report (11Bang Y.B. Lee S.E. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7639-7642Google Scholar), we showed that hemolysin production in V. vulnificus is repressed by adding glucose to culture media and that expression is derepressed by the addition of cAMP. These results suggested that hemolysin synthesis is regulated by cAMP-CRP (cAMP receptor protein) 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein controlled catabolite repression. However, until now, no definitive analysis of the role of the CRP in vvhA expression has been reported. Neither the promoter(s) of the vvhA gene nor CRP binding sites upstream of vvhA has been previously identified. Furthermore, the question of whether CRP directly or indirectly affects hemolysin production has not been previously addressed. This lack of the information on vvhA regulation makes it difficult to understand how hemolysin levels are modulated. Therefore, in an effort to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of vvhAexpression at a molecular level, we examined the influence of growth phase on hemolysin synthesis. We demonstrated that the vvhBAgenes are cotranscribed, that transcription is growth phase dependent, and that vvhBA transcription is initiated at a single site. The effects of a crp null mutation on hemolysin production, the cellular level of vvhBA transcript, and the activity of Pvvh were also examined. Finally, binding of CRP directly to the upstream portion of vvhBA was demonstrated, and the site for CRP binding was determined. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed below (see Table II).Escherichia coli strains used for plasmid DNA replication or conjugational transfer of plasmids were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB broth containing 1.5% (w/v) agar. Unless noted otherwise, V. vulnificus strains were grown in LB medium supplemented with 2.0% (w/v) NaCl (LBS). When appropriate, antibiotics were added to media at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and tetracycline (10 μg/ml).Table IIStrains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristicsaApr, ampicillin-resistant; Kmr, kanamycin-resistant; Tcr, tetracycline-resistant.Reference or sourceStrainsV. vulnificusATCC29307Clinical isolate, wild-typeLaboratory collectionKC74ATCC29307,crp::nptI(15Jeong H.S.

Open table in a new tab Procedures for the isolation of plasmid DNA, genomic DNA, and transformation were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.2001Google Scholar). Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were used as recommended by the manufacturer (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA). DNA cloning and manipulation were conducted in E. coli DH5α, and restriction mapping was used to confirm that transformants contained the appropriate plasmids. PCR amplification of DNA was performed using a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT) and following standard protocols. Cultures of V. vulnificus strains were grown at 30 °C with aeration. 5-ml samples were removed at regular intervals for determination of cell densities, hemolysin activity, and cellular protein concentrations. Growth was monitored by measuring the A 600 of the cultures. Cultures with an A 600 > 0.8 were diluted prior to measurement. Hemolysin activities were determined as previously described (5Shinoda S. Miyoshi S. Tamanaka H. Miyoshi N.N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 29: 583-590Google Scholar, 11Bang Y.B. Lee S.E. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7639-7642Google Scholar). A hemolytic unit was defined as the reciprocal of the maximal dilution showing 50% hemolysis of a suspension (1%, v/v) of human red blood cells. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Averages and standard errors of the mean (S.E.) were calculated from at least three independent determinations. Total cellular RNAs from V. vulnificusstrain ATCC29307 and an isogenic crp mutant, KC74, were isolated using a TRIzol reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). For Northern blot analysis, RNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized as previously described (14Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Rhee J.H. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Google Scholar). A series of reactions was performed according to standard procedures (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.2001Google Scholar) with 20 μg of total RNA for Northern dot blot analyses. Two DNA probes, VVHAP and VVHBP, were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-a-gene labeling system (Promega, Madison, WI) and used for hybridizations, as previously described (Fig. 1) (14Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Rhee J.H. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Google Scholar). The VVHAP probe was prepared by labeling the 1.0-kbSacII-PstI DNA fragment internal tovvhA. A 0.7-kb DNA fragment containing the coding region ofvvhB was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, VVH002 and VVH004 (see Table I), and then labeled for VVHBP probe. The blots were visualized and quantified using a phosphorimaging analyzer (model BAS1500, Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) and the Image Gauge (version 3.12) program. Primer extension experiments were carried out with SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to Sambrook et al.(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.2001Google Scholar). A 23-base oligonucleotide (VVH9901, see Table I) complementary to the open reading frame of vvhB was used as the primer. The primer was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The cDNA products were purified and resolved on a sequencing gel alongside sequencing ladders generated with the same primer used for the primer extension. The nucleotide sequence of pHK0202 (see Table II) was determined using the dideoxy-chain termination method with TopTM DNA polymerase (Bioneer, Seoul, Korea) following the manufacturer's protocols. The gels were dried, visualized, and then quantified as described above for Northern analysis. The coding region of crp was amplified using chromosomal DNA ofV. vulnificus ATCC29307 as the template and oligonucleotide primers, HIS-CRP021 and HIS-CRP022 2S. H. Choi, manuscript in preparation. (see Table I). The 0.6-kb PCR product was digested with BamHI andEcoRI and then ligated with a 6× histidine-tagging expression vector, pRSET A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, pHK0201, encodes CRP with a His6 tag at the amino terminus. His-tagged CRP protein was expressed in E. coliBL21, and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's procedure (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The final concentration of the purified protein was adjusted to 0.6 μg per microliter of elution buffer and kept frozen until use. A set of vvh-luxAB transcriptional fusion reporters were created by subcloning a series of DNA fragments that overlapped the vvhBA promoter region into pHK0011 (Fig.6 A). The later plasmid carries the promoterlessluxAB luciferase genes (15Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.-J. Lee K.-H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13875-13880Google Scholar). The subcloned fragments were amplified via PCR using pHK0202 (Fig. 1) as the template. Primer VVH004 (see Table I) contained a BamHI restriction site followed by bases corresponding to the 5′-end of the vvhA coding region. VVH004 was used in conjunction with one of the following primers to amplify DNA upstream of vvhA: VVH001 (for pHK0012), VVH002 (for pHK0013), or VVH003 (for pHK0014) (TableI). The primers were designed to amplify 824-, 724-, and 690-bp lengths, respectively, of DNA upstream of vvhA. A KpnI restriction site was added to these primers to facilitate cloning of the DNA fragments. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and KpnI and inserted into pHK0011 that had been digested with the same enzymes, to create the three vvh-luxAB reporter constructs. The reporter fusion of pHK0015, which carries 480 bp ofvvhBA upstream DNA, was constructed using primers VVH005 and VVH001. All constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Thevvh-luxAB reporters were mobilized into ATCC29307 and the crp mutant by conjugation. Cultures were grown to late exponential phase (A 600 of 1.2), then 1-ml samples were taken from each culture, diluted 100-fold with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and placed into cuvettes. 10 μl of a 0.3% (v/v) decanal stock solution was then added to each cuvette. The decanal stock solution was prepared by adding decanal to a 1:1 mixture of water and ethanol. Cellular luminescence was measured with a Lumat model 9501 luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Data are expressed as arbitrary relative light units. Gel shift assays to measure binding of CRP to the regulatory region of vvhBA were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.2001Google Scholar). The 188-bp upstream region of the vvh gene, extending from residues −167 to +27 with respect to the +1 transcription start site, was amplified by PCR using the 32P-labeled VVH011 and unlabeled VVH010 as primers. The labeled 188-bp DNA (7 nm) fragment was incubated with varying concentrations of purified His-tagged CRP protein for 30 min at 37 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing, 1× binding buffer (16González-Gil G. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Google Scholar), 200 μm cAMP, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Following the incubations, 3 μl of loading buffer (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.2001Google Scholar) was added to each reaction, and the samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For competition analyses, the same but unlabeled 188-bp DNA fragment was used as a competitor DNA. Various amounts of competitor DNA were added to the reaction mixture containing 7 nm of the labeled DNA prior to the addition of 300 nm CRP. DNase I protection assays were performed as described previously (16González-Gil G. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 300 ng of the same labeled 188-bp DNA, used for the mobility shift assay, was suspended in 20 μl of reaction solution containing 1× binding buffer (16González-Gil G. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Google Scholar), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 μm cAMP, and various concentrations of CRP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. 20 μl of 10 mm MgCl2and 5 mm CaCl2 mix were then added along with 1 μl of a DNase I solution (10 ng/μl, Sigma, St Louis, MO). Samples were then incubated for 1 min at 25 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 80 μl of stop solution (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.2001Google Scholar), and the DNA products were purified by ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA products were resolved on a sequencing gel alongside sequencing ladders of pHK0202 generated using VVH011 as primer. Gels were processed as described for the primer extension analyses. A 6.5-kb DNA fragment from V. vulnificus ATCC29307, which carries the entire vvhBA operon, was cloned in pHK02022(Table II). As shown in Fig.1, an open reading frame forvvhB is present upstream of the vvhAcoding region. The function of the vvhB gene product has not yet been determined. To determine whether vvhBA is expressed as a single transcript or as two independent transcripts, Northern blot analyses were performed. When total RNA was isolated from log phase ATCC29307 cells and hybridized with the VVHAP DNA probe, only a single ∼2.0-kb transcript was detected (Fig.2 A). Based on the DNA sequence of vvhBA, it was anticipated that a vvhA mRNA would be ∼1.5 kb in length. Cotranscription of vvhA andvvhB was predicted to produce a 2.0-kb transcript. Therefore, it appeared that a single mRNA coded for both VvhB and VvhA. To test this possibility, Northern blot analysis was performed again using VVHBP as a DNA probe. VVHBP also hybridized to a 2.0-kb RNA (Fig. 2 B). These combined results demonstrated that thevvhBA genes are transcribed as a transcriptional operon rather than as two independent genes. To examine whether the production of hemolysin is influenced by growth phase, the hemolysin activities of ATCC29307 cultures were analyzed at various growth stages (Fig.3 A). Hemolysin activity appeared at the beginning of growth and reached a maximum in the late-exponential phase. Hemolysin activity then decreased in the stationary phase. Growth phase regulation of hemolysin production could be manifest at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. To distinguish between these two possibilities, levels ofvvhBA mRNA were monitored during growth. The same amount of total RNA was isolated from ATCC29307 cells at different stages of growth. The results indicated that vvhBA mRNA levels decreased as the bacterial culture entered stationary phase (Fig.3 B). This result suggested that decreased hemolysin activity in the stationary phase correlated with a decrease in the level ofvvhBA mRNA. The decrease in vvhBA mRNA in stationary phase could be the result of a decrease in the rate of mRNA transcription initiation or decreased mRNA stability. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 2.0-kb vvhBA transcript, observed in log phase cultures, was not detected in the total RNAs isolated from the stationary phase cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This result agreed well with our previous observation that growth phase-dependent production of hemolysin is regulated at the level of transcription (Fig. 3 B). It was possible thatvvhBA mRNA stability was decreased in stationary phase. The likelihood for this seemed low, however, because we could not detect any partial degradation products of vvhBA mRNA with either the VVHAP or VVHBP DNA probe (Fig. 2, A andB). These results indicated that a decrease in the level of transcription initiation at the vvhBA promoter is the sole, or at least the major, mechanism whereby hemolysin activity is down-regulated in the stationary phase. A previous study suggested that cAMP-CRP catabolite repression may play a role in the regulation of hemolytic activity inV. vulnificus (11Bang Y.B. Lee S.E. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7639-7642Google Scholar). To confirm and expand these earlier results, we examined hemolysin production by a crp mutant, KC74. The crp mutant was constructed by allelic exchange in ATCC29307 (15Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.-J. Lee K.-H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13875-13880Google Scholar). Cultures of ATCC29307 and the crp mutant were grown to log phase, and the hemolysin activities of each culture were determined. Although hemolysin activity was present at about 2.0 units per μg of cellular protein in the wild-type strain, KC74 appeared to produce much less hemolysin. The residual level of hemolysin activity in KC74 corresponded to approximately one-thirtieth of that in the wild-type strain (Fig.4 A). Down-regulation of hemolysin due to the disruption of crp suggested that CRP acts as a positive regulator of vvhBA. To rule out the possibility that the decreased hemolytic activity in the crp mutant was due to polar effects of thecrp insertion on downstream genes, we determined if reintroduction of crp on a plasmid could complement the mutation. For this purpose, plasmid pKC0004 was constructed by subcloning crp into pRK415 (15Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.-J. Lee K.-H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13875-13880Google Scholar, 17Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene. 1988; 70: 191-197Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pKC0004, was transferred into KC74 by conjugation. The hemolytic activity expressed by KC74 (pKC0004) was, at least, equivalent to that of ATCC29307 (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, the decreased hemolytic activity of KC74 resulted from inactivation ofcrp rather than reduced expression of any genes downstream of crp. To characterize the role of CRP in more detail, the levels ofvvhBA mRNA in the wild-type strain and KC74 were compared by Northern dot blot analysis. When VVHBP was used as the DNA probe, the vvhBA transcript was almost undetectable in KC74 (Fig. 4 B). The vvhBA transcript was readily detectable in the wild-type strain and in KC74 (pKC0004). Therefore, levels of vvhBA mRNA correlated with hemolysin production for all three strains (Fig. 4). These results indicated that CRP exerted its effects on the production of hemolysin at the level ofvvhBA transcription. Overall, these results led us to conclude that the expression of vvhBA in V. vulnificus is under the positive control of CRP, at least in log- phase cultures. The one or more transcription start sites of vvhBA were mapped by a primer extension analysis. For this purpose, RNAs were prepared from strain ATCC29307 and KC74 harvested log phase and stationary phase cells. A single reverse transcript was produced from primer extension of RNA isolated from log phase and stationary phase cultures (Fig.5). Using several different sets of primers, we were unable to identify any other transcription start sites by primer extension (data not shown). This indicated that the same transcription start site was used for the transcription ofvvhBA in both log and stationary phases. The 5′-end of thevvhBA transcript is located 115-bp upstream of the translational initiation codon of VvhB and is subsequently designated +1. The putative promoter upstream of the transcription start site was named Pvvh. Based on the intensity of the reverse transcripts, Pvvhactivity was significantly decreased in stationary phase. This observation supported our hypothesis that the decrease in the level of hemolysin activity in stationary phase is mainly due to the reduced activity of the vvhBA promoter. In contrast, primer extension analysis, performed with RNA prepared from either log phase or stationary phase cells of KC74, failed to produce a visible product (Fig. 5). This result was not unexpected, because the vvhBA transcript was not detectable in Northern analysis of KC74 RNA (Fig. 4 B). Although other explanations are possible, these data, combined with other results, indicate thatvvhBA transcription is directed by the same promoter, Pvvh, in log and stationary phase cells and that CRP affects the level of hemolysin production by activating Pvvh. To delineate the cis DNA sequences in the Pvvhpromoter region required for CRP activation, transcriptional fusions of the putative vvhBA regulatory region were made to the reporter gene, luxAB. The pHK-reporter fusions are shown in Fig. 6. The reporter constructs were transferred into the wild-type strain and KC74. Culture luminescence was used to quantify the capacity of each vvh upstream fragment to activate transcription of the vvhBA operon. For the wild-type strain containing pHK0012, a plasmid that carries an intact regulatory region, luminescence activity was about 1.5 × 106 relative light units (Fig. 6 B). The light produced in the crp mutant carrying pHK0012 was significantly reduced, supporting the hypothesis that the expression of the Pvvh is dependent on CRP. Luminescence was also reduced in the strains that carried pHK0013. Moreover, the levels of luminescence in ATCC29307 (pHK0013) and KC74 (pHK0013) did not significantly differ. Similar results were observed when the luminescence was compared between the wild-type and KC74 cells containing pHK0014 (Fig. 6 B). These data indicated that the sequences necessary for activation of Pvvh by CRP are absent from the vvh upstream regions carried on pHK0013 and pHK0014. Because the vvhBA upstream region on pHK0013 was deleted up to −63, it is reasonable to conclude that thecis-acting element important for activation of Pvvh by CRP extends about 63-bp upstream of thevvhBA transcription start. When transformed with pHK0015, the levels of luminescence in the wild-type and crp mutant were comparable to those observed in the cells containing pHK0012. The magnitude of the decrease in luminescence from pHK0015 in the crp mutant was similar to that observed in cells carrying pHK0012. This result suggests that thevvhB coding region does not harbor any cis-acting elements essential for vvhBA transcription. In addition to this, no significant difference was observed when the luminescence was compared between E. coli cells containing either pHK0012 or pHK0015 (data not shown). This observation indicates"

Exposure to the PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (GF I) or Ro-31-8220 converted oscillatory responses to transient, non-oscillatory responses, significantly reducing the percentage of cells that showed [Ca2+]ioscillations but without decreasing the overall response to increase in [Ca2+]e. Exposure to 100 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, a direct activator of PKC, eliminated [Ca2+]i oscillations. Addition of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate at lower concentrations (3 and 10 nm) did not eliminate the oscillations but greatly reduced their frequency in a dose-dependent manner. Co-expression of CaR with constitutively active mutants of PKC (either ε or β1 isoforms) also reduced [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency. Expression of a mutant CaR in which the major PKC phosphorylation site is altered by substitution of alanine for threonine (T888A) eliminated oscillatory behavior, producing [Ca2+]iresponses almost identical to those produced by the wild type CaR exposed to PKC inhibitors.

The extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) 1The abbreviations used are: CaR, Ca2+-sensing receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; Ins(1, 4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate is a member of the superfamily of heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that was cloned originally from parathyroid chief cells (for review see Ref.1Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Phys. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Google Scholar). Inactivating and activating mutations of the CaR in humans (2Hendy G.N. D'Souza-Li L. Yang B. Canaff L. Cole D.E.C. Hum.

Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Google Scholar) established that the CaR functions in the control of Ca2+ homeostasis. Specifically, a major physiological role of the CaR is to correct small changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e) by regulating parathyroid hormone secretion (1Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Phys. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrating that the CaR is also expressed in many other tissues and cells including kidney (4Riccardi D. Hall A.E. Chattopadhyay N. Xu J.Z. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F611-F622Google Scholar), keratinocytes (5Oda Y. Tu C.-L. Chang W. Crumrine D. Komuves L. Mauro T. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. J. Biol.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1128-1139Google Scholar), and nerve terminals suggest that the CaR could play additional, as yet less well defined, physiological roles in the regulation of secretion, gene expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Phys. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Google Scholar). Recent studies of CaR activation in individual living cells has shown that intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) oscillates upon stimulation of CaR by an elevation in [Ca2+]e (8Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Google Scholar, 9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Google Scholar). It is recognized increasingly that the pattern and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations play a key role in signal transduction, regulating Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (10Soderling T.R. Chang B. Brickey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3719-3722Google Scholar), protein kinase C (11Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Google Scholar), mitochondrial metabolism (12Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Google Scholar), and nuclear transcriptional activity leading to differential gene expression (13Li W.-H. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature (London). 1998; 392: 936-941Google Scholar, 14Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Google Scholar, 15Hu Q. Deshpande S. Irani K. Ziegelstein R.C.

Nature (London). 2000; 405: 694-697Google Scholar). Consequently, the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations has attracted intense interest. Most models proposed to explain the mechanism by which [Ca2+]i oscillations are generated in response to GPCR activation are based broadly on negative feedback effects of PKC on the production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or on the regulatory properties of [Ca2+]ion the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor (17Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9583-9586Google Scholar, 18Thomas A.P. Bird G.S.J. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Google Scholar, 19Taylor C.W. Thorn P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R352-R355Google Scholar). For example, classic (α, β1, β2, and γ) and/or novel (δ, ε, η, and θ) isoforms of PKC, which are stimulated by [Ca2+]i and diacylglycerol or by diacylglycerol, respectively (20Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar, 21Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Google Scholar), can attenuate phosphoinositide signaling either by phosphorylation and uncoupling of the receptor from Gq (22Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature (London). 1996; 383: 89-92Google Scholar, 23Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Google Scholar) or by phosphorylation of the β3 isoform of phospholipase C, which prevents its activation by Gq (24Yue C.P. Kus C.Y. Liu M.Y. Simon M.I. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30220-30225Google Scholar). In addition, PKC can also reduce [Ca2+]i by accelerating the rate of Ca2+ extrusion from the cell (25Usachev Y.M. DeMarco S.J. Campbell C. Strehler E.E. Thayer S.A. Neuron. 2002; 33: 113-122Google Scholar). Our recent experiments, using the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220, suggested that negative feedback by PKC could also play a role in the generation of [Ca2+]e-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations via the CaR (9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Google Scholar). Specifically, in the presence of this inhibitor, most cells expressing CaR responded to an increase in [Ca2+]e by a transient increase in [Ca2+]i rather than by [Ca2+]i oscillations (9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Google Scholar). In contrast, Breitwieser et al. (8Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Google Scholar) concluded that the activity of a variety of protein kinases, including PKC, does not influence the pattern of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by activation of the CaR by [Ca2+]e. Thus, the mechanism(s) underlying [Ca2+]e-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations through the CaR is not understood, and the role of protein kinases, especially of PKC, in this process remains controversial. The studies presented here were designed to elucidate whether PKCs play a role in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by activation of the CaR. Our results produced several lines of evidence indicating that PKCs negatively regulate the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by activation of the CaR by increases in [Ca2+]e. In particular, we demonstrate, for the first time, that expression of a mutant CaR in which the major PKC phosphorylation site (Thr-888) is altered by substitution of alanine for threonine completely eliminates [Ca2+]e-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations. We conclude that [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by activation of the CaR in response to an increase in [Ca2+]e result from negative feedback involving PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the CaR at Thr-888. HEK 293 cells were maintained in culture as described previously (26Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Google Scholar). For experimentation, cells were re-plated onto clean 15-mm diameter number 1 glass coverslips (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) resting on the bottom of 35-mm plastic culture dishes 1 day before transfection. Approximately 8.5 × 104 cells were plated per 35-mm dish. Culture medium was high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D5796; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (10 units/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (25 ng/ml). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator under 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. A total of 1.7 μg of plasmid DNA (human CaR cDNA cloned in the pCR3.1 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Allen Spiegel, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to transfect cells in each 35-mm culture dish. DNA was diluted and mixed with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's guidelines. The resulting solution (volume, 1 ml) was added to the cells, and after 4–6 h, cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were studied 2 or 3 days after transfection. To identify transfected cells expressing the CaR, co-transfections were performed with vector encoding CaR and expression vector pDsRed1-N1 (Invitrogen), which produces a red fluorescent protein. In all co-transfections, total DNA was maintained at 1.7 μg. CaRT888A mutant was constructed by QuikChangeTM mutagenesis (Stratagene) using cloned human CaR cDNA plasmid as a template and a pair of complementary primers (sense, 5′CAAGGTGGCTGCCCGTGCCGCGCTGCGCCGCAGCA; antisense, 5′TGCTGCGGCGCAGCGCGGCACGGGCAGCCACCTTG) in which endogenous restriction site SrfI was eliminated, and a single point mutation, ACG → GCG, was introduced. Mutation was confirmed by SrfI digestion and DNA sequencing. Physiological saline consisted of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) without phenol red supplemented with calcium and 20 mm HEPES buffer. Final concentrations (in mm) were as follows: 138 NaCl, 4 NaHCO3, 0.3 Na2HPO4, 5 KCl, 0.3 KH2PO4, 1.5 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.4 MgSO4, 5.6 d-glucose, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells on coverslips were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fura-2 by incubation in saline containing 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45–60 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were then mounted in an experimental chamber (RC-25F; Warner Instrument Corp.) that was perfused at 1.5 ml/min. The perfusion solution was heated using an inline heater (TC-344B; Warner Instrument Corp.), which maintained bath temperature at 37 °C. The chamber in turn was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss TV 100; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) to which was attached a digital imaging system (Attofluor; Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) with electronically controlled excitation filter positions and associated software (RatioVision). Ratios of images (340 nm excitation/380 nm excitation, emission filter 520 nm) were obtained at 1.5-s intervals. A region of interest covering 15 × 15 μm was defined over each cell, and the average ratio intensity over the region was converted to [Ca2+]i using a calibration curve constructed with a series of calibrated buffered calcium solutions (calcium calibration buffer kit #2; Molecular Probes). For each cell, [Ca2+]i values and their times of acquisition were stored on computer disk. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. GF I (bisindolylmaleimide I), GF V (bisindolylmaleimide V), and PDBu (phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate) were purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmids encoding constitutively active mutant PKC isoforms εmut and β were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Parker, Imperial Cancer Research Institute, London, United Kingdom. To examine the effect of [Ca2+]e on CaR-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i in single cells, HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the human CaR cDNA were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 and incubated in the presence of 1.5 mm[Ca2+]e. Intracellular Ca2+ imaging revealed that most transfected cells exhibited a stable [Ca2+]i. In agreement with our recent results (9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Google Scholar), a small increase in [Ca2+]e from 1.5 to 3.0 mm elicited sustained [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig.1 a). The fraction of responsive cells was 72%, and that fraction displaying [Ca2+]i oscillations was 57% (n = 28; see Fig. 1 d). Untransfected HEK 293 cells or cells transfected with vector did not exhibit [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to an identical increase in [Ca2+]e (results not shown). To determine whether PKC activity is required for the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations, HEK 293 cells transfected with CaR were pretreated for 1 h with the selective PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (27Yeo E.J.

An increase in [Ca2+]e in cells exposed to Ro-31-8220 at 1.25 μm induced a marked increase in [Ca2+]i, but the change in [Ca2+]i no longer had a strong oscillatory component; the majority of the responses consisted of an initial [Ca2+]i transient followed by a sustained plateau. Individual traces from four separate cells are presented in Fig. 1 b. Pretreatment with GF I (3.5 μm) also inhibited the oscillatory behavior induced by an increase in [Ca2+]e and also resulted in a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i after the increase in [Ca2+]e. Individual traces from four separate cells are illustrated in Fig. 1 c. As summarized in Fig. 1 d, the fraction of GF I-treated cells that exhibited [Ca2+]ioscillations dropped to only 16% (p < 0.05 compared with control; n = 14) whereas the percentage of responsive cells treated with GF I was 78%. Thus, the PKC inhibitor blunted the oscillatory behavior without reducing overall responsiveness. In contrast, exposure of HEK 293 cells transfected with CaR to 3.5 μm GF V (an inactive analog of GF I) for 1 h did not have any significant inhibitory effect on the fraction of cells that displayed [Ca2+]e-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations (p > 0.05; n = 35). A previous study (8Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Google Scholar) has reported that treatment with GF I did not produce any effect on the pattern of [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by the CaR in HEK 293 cells. In the study of Breitwieser et al.(8Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Google Scholar), the cells were treated with 1 μm GF I for 4 min at 22 °C. When we used GF I at identical experimental conditions (i.e. 1 μm at 22 °C for 4 min), we also observed that such an exposure to this agent did not inhibit [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to an increase in [Ca2+]e in HEK 293 cells expressing the CaR. In this case we found that the fraction of cells showing [Ca2+]ioscillations was 53%, and the percentage of responsive cells was 69%, similar to control values (Fig. 1 d). It is likely that under these conditions exposure to GF I did not change [Ca2+]i oscillations, because it did not accumulate in the cell at a sufficient concentration. Previous studies using cell populations showed that phorbol ester-induced activation of PKC abrogates [Ca2+]e-evoked stimulation of phospholipase C and the associated increases in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that PKC may modulate the coupling of the CaR to intracellular signaling systems directly (30Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that addition of 100 nm PBD to HEK 293 cells expressing CaR stops [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations within a few cycles (Fig. 2 a). If negative feedback by PKC is required for the production of [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations, we would expect that exposure to lower concentrations of PDBu (e.g. 3 and 10 nm) should modulate oscillation frequency. As shown in Fig. 2 b, pretreatment of the cells with 3 nmPDBu for 5 min reduced average oscillation frequency. Increasing the concentration of PDBu to 10 nm further reduced [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency in response to an elevation of [Ca2+]e (Fig. 2 c). The results are summarized in Fig. 2 d. The average [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency dropped by about 50% after 5 min of exposure to 3 nm PDBu (control, 2.7 ± 0.14/min (±S.E.), n = 28; 3 nm PDBu, 1.39 ± 0.16/min (±S.E.), n= 21; p < 0.0001). An increase in PDBu concentration to 10 nm caused a further reduction in oscillation frequency (0.74 ± 1.6/min (±S.E.), n = 12;p < 0.02 compared with 3 nm PDBu). These results suggest that PDBu-induced PKC activation reinforces a negative feedback component that markedly reduces the frequency of [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by the CaR in single cells. Having established that pharmacological inhibition or activation of PKCs strikingly influences the frequency of [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in HEK 293 cells expressing the CaR, our next step was to examine whether overexpression of PKC isoforms also down-regulates the frequency of [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by the CaR. The PKCs comprise a family of at least 10 distinct isoforms, which can be classified into three distinct subgroups on the basis of structural and regulatory differences (31Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar, 32Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Google Scholar, 33Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Google Scholar). Classic PKCs (α, β, and γ) respond to intracellular rises in diacylglycerol and [Ca2+]i whereas novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ) respond to diacylglycerol but not to changes in [Ca2+]i. Receptor stimuli that induce [Ca2+]i oscillations promote a parallel repetitive translocation of classic PKCs to the plasma membrane in a variety of model systems (11Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Google Scholar, 23Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Google Scholar, 34Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Google Scholar). In contrast, novel PKCs translocate to the plasma membrane with kinetics that are not synchronized with [Ca2+]i oscillations (35Schaefer M. Albrecht N. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 144-163Google Scholar). These considerations prompted us to examine the effect of co-transfection of the CaR with either a classic or a novel isoform of the PKC family. Cultures of HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the CaR and either vector, constitutively active isoforms of PKC (β1 and ε), or protein kinase D, a kinase that is activated downstream of PKC (36Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Google Scholar, 37Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Google Scholar). Fig.3 a shows a typical tracing of [Ca2+]i oscillations in a control HEK 293 cell transfected with the CaR after [Ca2+]e was raised from 1.5 to 3.0 mm. As shown in Fig. 3 b, when HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding for the CaR and constitutively active PKC isoform β1 (PKCβ1mut), the oscillation frequency was reduced markedly. The results are summarized in Fig. 3 c. Average oscillation frequencies of cells transfected with an empty vector or cells transfected with a plasmid encoding protein kinase D were not significantly different (p > 0.5, n = 17 cells;p > 0.3, n = 30 cells) from control cells transfected with only the plasmid encoding CaR. In contrast, cells transfected with the active mutants of PKC isoforms ε (PKCεmut) or β1 (PKCβ1mut) show reduced average oscillation frequencies compared with control cells (ε, p = 0.03, n = 26 cells; β1, p = 0.001, n = 32 cells). These results suggest that an increase in the cellular concentration of PKC reinforces a negative feedback loop that regulates the frequency of [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in HEK 293 cells expressing the CaR. In a previous study using cell populations, Baiet al. (30Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Google Scholar) have shown that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of threonine 888 of the CaR inhibits [Ca2+]e-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, indicating that this amino acid is the major site for the inhibitory influence of PKC on the CaR. However, the effect of this mutation on the oscillatory signaling properties of the CaR in individual living cells has not been investigated. If CaR-mediated [Ca2+]ioscillations are generated physiologically by the periodic phosphorylation of this inhibitory site by PKC, mutation of Thr-888 to a non-phosphorylatable amino acid should significantly reduce or even eliminate [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by this receptor. To test this hypothesis, we expressed a CaR in which the threonine at position 888 of the CaR was mutated to alanine (T888A). As shown in Fig.4 b, HEK 293 cells expressing CaRT888A did not show [Ca2+]i oscillations after CaR activation by increases in [Ca2+]e. The [Ca2+]i response consisted of a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i followed by a sustained phase of elevated [Ca2+]i. In all, of 129 responding cells analyzed from five independent preparations that responded to an increase in [Ca2+]e to 3.0 mm, all 129 cells showed this behavior, i.e.none exhibited [Ca2+]ioscillations (Fig. 4 c). In addition, prior exposure to PDBu (100 nm for 5 min) does not prevent the response to 3.0 mm[Ca2+]e in CaRT888A-expressing cells (Fig. 4 d). We verified that the non-oscillatory [Ca2+]iresponse induced by an increase in [Ca2+]e to 3.0 mm in cells expressing this CaRT888A mutant in HEK 293 cells did not prevent [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by 10 μm carbachol (data not shown), which acts via an endogenous muscarinic GPCR expressed by these cells (40Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G.S.J. Putney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5613-5621Google Scholar). We have reported recently that stimulation of HEK 293 cells expressing the CaR with amino acids (l-phenylalanine orl-tryptophan) induced [Ca2+]i oscillations of a different pattern from [Ca2+]ioscillations induced by increases in [Ca2+]e (9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Google Scholar). The patterns differed in the following ways: 1) The amino acid-induced [Ca2+]i transients repetitively returned to baseline levels. 2) The amino acid-induced oscillation frequencies (∼1/min) were lower than those induced by [Ca2+]e (∼4/min). 3) Amino acid-induced and [Ca2+]e-induced oscillations differed in their sensitivity to pharmacological agents that influence [Ca2+]i (9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Google Scholar). The results illustrated in Fig. 5 a confirm that stimulation of HEK 293 cells expressing the wild type CaR with 5 mm l-phenylalanine induced [Ca2+]i oscillations of a different pattern from [Ca2+]ioscillations induced by an increase in [Ca2+]e (from 1.5 to 3 mm). These results raised the interesting possibility that amino acids and [Ca2+]e produce [Ca2+]i oscillations via the CaR through a different mechanism(s). In view of these considerations and the results illustrated in Fig. 4 with CaRT888A, we examined [Ca2+]i oscillations triggered by addition of 5 mm l-phenylalanine to cultures of HEK 293 cells expressing either CaR or CaRT888A. As shown in Fig. 5 b, [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by addition of 5 mm l-phenylalanine persisted in the same cells expressing CaRT888A in which [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were eliminated, although the average oscillation frequency of thel-phenylalanine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations was reduced (1.0 ± 0.06 min−1; n = 23 cells) compared with wild-type CaR (1.3 ± 0.1 min−1;n = 14 cells). These results provide further support for the notion that amino acids and [Ca2+]e produce [Ca2+]i oscillations through the CaR via different mechanisms. Most models proposed to explain the mechanism by which [Ca2+]i oscillations are generated in response to GPCR activation are based broadly on negative feedback effects of PKC on the production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or on the regulatory properties of [Ca2+]ion the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor (17Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9583-9586Google Scholar, 18Thomas A.P. Bird G.S.J. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Google Scholar, 19Taylor C.W. Thorn P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R352-R355Google Scholar). However, definitive evidence identifying the mechanism(s) involved is available in very few instances. For example, even the role of PKC in the generation of glutamate-induced [Ca2+]ioscillations mediated by the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, one of the most studied systems, appears controversial (22Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature (London). 1996; 383: 89-92Google Scholar, 23Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Google Scholar, 34Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that PKC activation provides a negative feedback link that is critical for generating the [Ca2+]i oscillatory behavior produced by [Ca2+]e activation of the CaR. Our results produced several lines of evidence indicating that PKCs negatively regulate the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by activation of the CaR by increases in [Ca2+]e. 1) Exposure to the PKC inhibitors GF I or Ro-31-8220 converted oscillatory responses to transient, non-oscillatory responses, significantly reducing the percentage of cells that showed [Ca2+]i oscillations but without decreasing the overall response to [Ca2+]e. 2) Exposure to PDBu, a direct activator of PKC, greatly reduced the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations in a dose-dependent manner. 3) Co-expression of CaR with constitutively active mutants of PKC (either ε or β1isoforms) reduced [Ca2+]ioscillation frequency. These results indicate that [Ca2+]i oscillations generated in response to [Ca2+]e-elicited CaR activation are based on negative feedback effects of PKC. PKC can exert negative feedback on phosphoinositide signaling either by phosphorylation and uncoupling of the receptor from Gq (22Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature (London). 1996; 383: 89-92Google Scholar,23Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Google Scholar) or by phosphorylation of the β3 isoform of phospholipase C, which prevents its activation by Gq (24Yue C.P. Kus C.Y. Liu M.Y. Simon M.I. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30220-30225Google Scholar). In addition, PKC can also reduce [Ca2+]i by accelerating the rate of Ca2+ extrusion from the cell (25Usachev Y.M. DeMarco S.J. Campbell C. Strehler E.E. Thayer S.A. Neuron. 2002; 33: 113-122Google Scholar). A salient feature of the results presented here is that a single amino acid substitution in the CaR was sufficient to drastically reduce the ability of this GPCR to generate [Ca2+]i oscillations. Specifically, mutation of the major PKC phosphorylation site, threonine 888, to alanine eliminated [Ca2+]ioscillations induced by activation of the CaR by increases in [Ca2+]e, producing [Ca2+]i responses almost identical to those produced by the wild-type CaR in cells exposed to inhibitors of PKC. These results support a model in which periodic phosphorylation of the CaR at the inhibitory threonine 888 by PKC provides the negative feedback needed to cause [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. The CaR is an allosteric protein that responds to two different agonists, Ca2+ and aromatic amino acids (41Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Google Scholar), with the production of [Ca2+]i oscillations (8Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Google Scholar, 9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Google Scholar). The differing patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced byl-phenylalanine and [Ca2+]e suggest that these stimuli induce [Ca2+]i oscillations through different mechanisms. This idea is given further credence by our results showing that cells expressing the mutant receptor CaRT888A continue to respond to the addition ofl-phenylalanine with [Ca2+]i oscillations (although at reduced frequency), whereas at the same time they do not produce [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to increases in [Ca2+]e. This suggests that unlike [Ca2+]e-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations,l-phenylalanine-induced oscillations are not controlled by PKC providing negative feedback though the major phosphorylation site at threonine 888 on the CaR. Further experimentation will be necessary to determine the mechanism(s) by which l-phenylalanine induces [Ca2+]i oscillations through the CaR. Oscillatory changes in [Ca2+]i in response to receptor stimulation is a fundamental mechanism of cell signaling in both non-excitable and excitable cells that can protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of prolonged increases in [Ca2+]i. It is increasingly recognized that the pattern and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations encodes for differential regulation of biological responses including selective gene expression (13Li W.-H. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature (London). 1998; 392: 936-941Google Scholar, 14Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Google Scholar, 15Hu Q. Deshpande S.

Richter-Dahlfors A. Nature (London). 2000; 405: 694-697Google Scholar). For example, low frequency [Ca2+]i oscillations activate the transcription factor NF-κB whereas higher frequencies lead to stimulation of the transcription factor NF-AT (14Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Google Scholar). Our results demonstrating that the CaR-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to an increase in [Ca2+]e are negatively regulated by PKC are of potential physiological importance. Because many cells in the organism that express CaR are exposed to numerous hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors that promote PKC activation, it is plausible that the pattern of [Ca2+]i oscillations triggered by activation of the CaR in response to an increase in [Ca2+]e could be finely tuned by PKC activity, which in turn is determined by other signals reaching the cell.

(2001)Biochem. J. 353, 377–385). To understand the nature of this interaction and the role of cofilin in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity, we searched for cofilin-binding proteins in the rat skeletal muscle cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Several cDNA clones were isolated, some of which coded for triose-phosphate isomerase, a glycolytic enzyme. The interaction of cofilin with triose-phosphate isomerase as well as Na,K-ATPase was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy in HeLa cells. Cofilin was translocated to the plasma membrane along with triose-phosphate isomerase by the Rho activator lysophosphatidic acid but not by the p160 Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632, suggesting that the phosphorylated form of cofilin bound to TPI interacts with Na,K-ATPase. Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake showed that Na,K-ATPase activity was increased by the overexpression of cofilin and lysophosphatidic acid treatment, but not by the overexpression of mutant cofilin S3A and Y-27632 treatment. Pretreatment with the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetic acid caused a remarkable reduction of Na,K-ATPase activity, whereas pretreatment with the oxidative inhibitor carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone caused no detectable changes, suggesting that the phosphorylated cofilin is involved in feeding glycolytic fuel for Na,K-ATPase activity.

Cofilin exists ubiquitously in eukaryotes and is essential for cell viability (2Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Google Scholar). Cofilin binds to both G- and F-actins and severs and depolymerizes actin filaments. Cofilin is usually localized to the regions that require rapid actin assembly, such as neural growth cones, developing skeletal muscle, cell cortex, ruffling membranes, and cleavage furrow (3Bamburg J.R.

Another possible mechanism is through binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to the actin binding domain of cofilin (26Yonezawa N. Homma Y. Yahara I. Sakai H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17218-17221Google Scholar, 27Kusano K. Abe H. Obinata T. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 190: 133-141Google Scholar). However, elucidation of the mechanisms for phosphorylation of cofilin and its inactivation has not resulted in an understanding of the physiological role of the inactive form of cofilin. We reported previously that cofilin interacts with Na,K-ATPase and enhances its activity (1Lee K. Jung J. Kim M. Guidotti G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 377-385Google Scholar). To understand the functional role of cofilin in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity, we screened a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library for cDNAs coding for novel proteins that interact with cofilin, using the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that cofilin interacts with triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI), 1The abbreviations used are: TPI, triose-phosphate isomerase; BFP, blue fluorescence; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GFP, green fluorescence; HA, hemagglutinin; IAA, iodoacetic acid; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ROCK, p160 Rho-associated kinase. which catalyzes the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a process that completes the preparatory phase of glycolysis. Because it has been demonstrated that ATP from glycolysis is required for Na,K-ATPase activity and that glycolytic enzymes are associated with structural proteins and plasma membrane complexes (28Balaban R.S. Bader J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 804: 419-426Google Scholar, 29Cantiello H.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F637-F643Google Scholar, 30Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the interaction of cofilin with TPI might serve to feed glycolytic ATP for Na,K-ATPase activity. The yeast two-hybrid screen assay was performed as described previously (1Lee K. Jung J. Kim M. Guidotti G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 377-385Google Scholar). Clone 267 of rat cofilin which encodes residues 45–166 was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain and used as a bait to screen the cDNA library from rat skeletal muscle. The yeast strain EGY48/pSH18-34/pEG clone 267 carrying LexAop-Leu2, LexAop-LacZ reporters was transformed with the library, using the high efficiency method. Galactose Ura-His-Trp-Leu-dependent transformants were obtained. Plasmid DNA species were rescued and reintroduced individually into EGY48/pSH18-34, either alone or with the LexA fusion plasmids to eliminate false positives. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described (1Lee K. Jung J. Kim M. Guidotti G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 377-385Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding potential cofilin-interacting proteins were identified by DNA sequencing with the primer 5′-TACCCTTATGATGTGCCA-3′, corresponding to the hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequences in the pJG4-5 library vector. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. An N-terminal HA-tagged cofilin construct in pcDNAneo (Invitrogen), C-terminal blue fluorescence protein (BFP)-tagged cofilin, or cofilin S3A (in which Ser-3 is replaced with Ala), and C-terminal BFP-tagged TPI were transiently transfected with the LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). After transfection, the HeLa cells were treated with 10 μm lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Sigma) or 10 μm Y-27632 (Tocris) for 30 min after serum starvation and incubated with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, NaF, Na3VO4, Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablets) for 30 min on ice and gently homogenized with Pyrex 7727-07. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The total cell lysates (1 mg/ml) were incubated overnight with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, rat anti-cofilin polyclonal antiserum, or rabbit affinity-purified anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech) at 4 °C. Protein A- or G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then added and the mixture incubated for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. Protein A- or G-agarose-bound immune complexes so obtained were pelletized and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After washing, the immune complexes were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Blots were incubated with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, rat anti-cofilin polyclonal antiserum, rabbit anti-TPI polyclonal antiserum, rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-phosphoserine polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or rabbit anti-Na,K-ATPase polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). HeLa cells cultured as described above were treated with 10 μm LPA or 10 μmY-27632 for 30 min, incubated with ice-cold lysis buffer for 30 min on ice, and gently homogenized with Pyrex 7727-07. The homogenates were centrifuged at 2,500 × g, at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 40,000 × g, at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction and the pellet containing crude membrane fraction were separated, and the pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100). Each fraction was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and identified using anti-cofilin polyclonal antiserum, anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, anti-TPI polyclonal antiserum, and anti-Na,K-ATPase polyclonal antibody. HeLa cells were cultured on an 18-mm φ cover glass in the presence or absence of serum and treated with 10 μm LPA or 10 μm Y-27632 after serum starvation. The cells were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS containing Ca2+/Mg2+ and incubated with rat anti-cofilin polyclonal antiserum, rabbit anti-TPI polyclonal antiserum, or mouse Na,K-ATPase monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) in PBS containing 0.1% saponin for 1 h at room temperature on a tilting platform. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with anti-rat aminomethylcoumarin, anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate, or anti-mouse-rhodamine second antibody (Jackson Laboratories), mounted in anti-bleaching agent solution, and analyzed by laser confocal microscopy LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss). 500 μl of HeLa cells (3.0 × 105 ∼ 1 × 106 cells/ml) was inoculated into 24 wells and transiently transfected with cofilin-BFP or cofilin-BFPS3A plasmids. After 24–36 h, the serum-starved cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with or without 1 mm ouabain in 0.1% bovine serum albumin-containing Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. The cells were treated with 10 μm LPA, or 10 μm Y-27632, or 50 μm iodoacetic acid (IAA), or 0.1 μmcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) for 30 min. The 86Rb+ was used as a tracer to measure the uptake of K+. After a 5∼10-min incubation with86Rb+ (2 μCi/ml), cellular86Rb+ uptake was stopped by the addition of ice-chilled Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, and the cells were washed twice and lysed by adding 50 mm NaOH. The cell lysates were then counted after mixing with scintillation mixture. The difference between 86Rb+ uptake in the presence and absence of ouabain was taken as ouabain-sensitive86Rb+ uptake. 500 μl of HeLa cells (3.0 × 105∼1 × 106cells/ml) was inoculated into 24 wells and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After serum starvation, the cells were treated with 10 μm LPA, 10 μm Y-27632, 50 μm IAA, or 0.1 μm CCCP for 30 min and trypsinized. The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a buffer prepared as follows. A stock solution of 2 mm sodium green tetraacetate (Molecular Probes) in dimethyl sulfoxide was mixed with an equal volume of 20% (w/v) pluronic F-127 in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted with Ham's F-12 medium (in 2 mm sodium bicarbonate and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, without phenol red and serum) to a final concentration of 8 μm sodium green tetraacetate and less than 0.1% detergent. The cells were then washed with PBS three times. Changes in the fluorescence intensity of sodium green tetraacetate were determined, employing flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Excitation was performed with a 488 nm argon laser, and fluorescent emission was detected at 530 nm (FL-1). All flow cytometric analyses were accomplished using CellQuest software. To understand the functional role of cofilin in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity, we searched for cofilin-binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Using this approach, we were able to isolate 25 clones coding for rat TPI, 3 clones coding for rat proteasome subunit RC5, and several clones coding unknown proteins. Because full-length cofilin clone activates reporter genes without interacting protein, we used cofilin clone 267, which was short of 44 residues from the N terminus, as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening. However, we used rat full-length cofilin cDNA for further experiments. To confirm that cofilin interacts with TPI in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using appropriately tagged antisera (Fig. 1A). Expression plasmids of both HA-tagged rat cofilin (HA-cofilin) and blue fluorescence-tagged rat TPI (TPI-BFP) were cotransfected transiently into HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitates were prepared from HeLa extracts with anti-HA monoclonal antibody and immunoblotted with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody. HA-cofilin coprecipitated 54.7 kDa of the TPI-BFP only from transfected cells (Fig. 1A). To determine whether cofilin interacts simultaneously with both TPI and Na,K-ATPase, we blotted the coprecipitated complex sequentially with rabbit Na,K-ATPase polyclonal antibody. 100 kDa of endogenous Na,K-ATPase was also detected only from transfected cells, suggesting that cofilin is complexed with TPI as well as Na,K-ATPase at the same time (Fig. 1A). This finding is in accord with our previous study (1Lee K. Jung J. Kim M. Guidotti G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 377-385Google Scholar). To confirm the above coimmunoprecipitation results, we examined, using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, whether endogenous cofilin is complexed simultaneously with TPI and Na,K-ATPase in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). When HeLa cells in serum-containing media were labeled with either rat anti-cofilin polyclonal antiserum (blue) or rabbit anti-TPI polyclonal antiserum (green), we observed that endogenous cofilin was found distributed with polarized pattern in about half of the cell, whereas endogenous TPI was found distributed equally throughout the cell (Fig. 1B). On staining with monoclonal anti-Na,K-ATPase antibody (red), endogenous Na,K-ATPase was also found throughout the cell but distributed mainly at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). As can be seen in Fig. 1B, middle panel, cofilin was colocalized with TPI as shown by merged azure color in the cytoplasm. Cofilin was also colocalized with Na,K-ATPase as well as TPI at the plasma membrane as shown by merged white color in the membrane region (Fig. 1B, right bottom panel,magnified). Colocalization of cofilin, TPI, and Na,K-ATPase at the plasma membrane region was observed only in serum-containing media but not in serum-free media. This may be because the serum phosphorylates cofilin via a Rho-ROCK-LIM kinase-mediated signaling pathway (23Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Google Scholar, 32Geneste O.J. Copeland W. Treisman R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 831-838Google Scholar, 33Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar, 34Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cofilin inhibits its actin depolymerizing activity. Cofilin is phosphorylated by LPA, which activates Rho GTPase. This phosphorylation is inhibited by Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK which is a downstream effector of Rho and phosphorylates LIM kinase (23Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the translocation of cofilin and TPI to the plasma membrane is under the control of a Rho-mediated signaling pathway (Fig. 2). After treatment of HeLa cells with LPA following serum starvation, translocation of both endogenous cofilin and TPI to the plasma membrane was increased remarkably (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, inhibition of ROCK by Y-27632 (23Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Google Scholar) decreased the translocation (Fig. 2A). Endogenous Na,K-ATPase in membrane fraction was not affected by treatment with either LPA or Y-27632 (Fig. 2A). Based on these data, it appears that cofilin bound to TPI may translocate to the plasma membrane to form local complexes with Na,K-ATPase and that the translocation process is under the control of a Rho-mediated signaling pathway. Cofilin exists in dephosphorylated and phosphorylated (on the serine 3 residue) forms (22Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 808-809Google Scholar, 23Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Google Scholar, 24Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Google Scholar, 25Yangs N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Google Scholar). To investigate the role of phosphorylation of cofilin in the translocation phenomenon, we constructed BFP-tagged wild type cofilin (cofilin-BFP) and a mutant cofilin, in which serine 3 was replaced with alanine (cofilin S3A-BFP) and used them for transient transfection of HeLa cells. Translocation of the overexpressed cofilin-BFP and endogenous TPI to the plasma membrane was increased upon treatment with LPA and decreased upon treatment with Y-27632, whereas endogenous Na,K-ATPase was not affected (Fig. 2B). However, neither overexpressed cofilin S3A-BFP nor endogenous TPI was changed in the plasma membrane fraction, even after treatment with either LPA or Y27632 (Fig. 2C), indicating that phosphorylated cofilin complexed with TPI translocates to the plasma membrane. To obtain more evidence that phosphorylated cofilin complexed with TPI translocates to the membrane and associates with Na,K-ATPase via a Rho-mediated signaling pathway, we introduced expression plasmids of cofilin-BFP and cofilin S3A-BFP into HeLa cells and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitates were prepared from LPA- and Y-27632-treated HeLa cell lysates after serum starvation and coprecipitated with either cofilin polyclonal antiserum or GFP polyclonal antibody. We blotted the coprecipitated complexes sequentially with the following antibodies: anti-Na,K-ATPase polyclonal antibody, anti-TPI polyclonal antiserum, anti-cofilin polyclonal antibody, and anti-GFP polyclonal antibody. We also examined the phosphorylated forms of both endogenous cofilin and overexpressed cofilin by blotting the coprecipitated complexes with anti-phosphoserine polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, the phosphorylated forms of endogenous cofilin (Fig. 3A) and cofilin-BFP (Fig. 3B) were increased by LPA but decreased by Y-27632. Endogenous Na,K-ATPase immunoprecipitated with anti-cofilin antibody or anti-GFP antibody was also increased by LPA but decreased by Y-27632 (Fig. 3, A and B). We could not detect the phosphorylated cofilin and Na,K-ATPase in immunoprecipitates from cofilin S3A-BFP cell extracts by the treatment of either LPA or Y-27632 (Fig. 3C), which indicates that only phosphorylated cofilin is able to associate with Na,K-ATPase. However, there was a consistent amount of TPI in all of the immunoprecipitates, and this was not affected by treatment with either LPA or Y-27632. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of cofilin with TPI is not dependent on phosphorylation of cofilin, which in turn suggests that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of cofilin can bind to TPI, but only the phosphorylated cofilin complexed with TPI is able to associate with Na,K-ATPase. Next, we performed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to chase the movement of cofilin and TPI upon the treatment of LPA and Y27632 in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). After treatment with LPA and Y-27632 following serum starvation, HeLa cells were labeled with cofilin polyclonal antiserum, TPI polyclonal antiserum, or Na,K-ATPase monoclonal antibody. Endogenous Na,K-ATPase was detected at the plasma membrane as well as in the cytoplasm, whereas endogenous cofilin and TPI were distributed throughout the cell excluding the plasma membrane in serum-starved HeLa cells (Fig. 4). They did not colocalize with Na,K-ATPase at the plasma membrane in serum-starved HeLa cells (Fig. 4, merged and magnified panels in Control). However, in LPA-treated HeLa cells, endogenous cofilin and TPI became associated with Na,K-ATPase at the plasma membrane as shown by mergedwhite colors (Fig. 4, merged and magnified panels inLPA). In contrast to treatment with LPA, treatment with Y-27632 caused the accumulation of these proteins mainly in the nucleus, as shown by merged white colors (Fig. 4, merged and magnified panels in Y-27632). These results confirm that the association of cofilin with Na,K-ATPase at the plasma membrane requires phosphorylation of cofilin via a Rho-mediated signaling pathway. Based on earlier reports that ATP from glycolysis is required to regulate Na,K-ATPase (35Paul R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: C399-C409Google Scholar, 36Dizon J. Burkhoff D. Tauskela J. Whang J. Cannon P. Katz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1082-H1089Google Scholar, 37Okamoto K. Wang W. Rounds J. Chambers E.A. Jacobs D.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E479-E488Google Scholar) and that glycolytic enzymes are associated with structural proteins such as actin, microtubules, and plasma membrane (28Balaban R.S. Bader J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 804: 419-426Google Scholar, 29Cantiello H.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F637-F643Google Scholar, 30Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 381: 37-46Google Scholar, 31Nelson J.W. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Google Scholar), we speculated that ATP produced by a glycolytic enzyme cluster including TPI may be channeled to the Na,K-ATPase and that the process is mediated via phosphorylated cofilin. To verify this, cofilin-BFP and cofilin S3A-BFP were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and Na,K-ATPase activity was measured using ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake assay (Fig. 5). Consistent with our previous report (1Lee K. Jung J. Kim M. Guidotti G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 377-385Google Scholar), Na,K-ATPase activity of cofilin-BFP-transfected cells was about 31% higher than that of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the Na,K-ATPase activity of cofilin S3A-BFP-transfected cells was decreased (Fig. 5A). To determine whether Na,K-ATPase activity is dependent on glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation, we employed IAA, a relatively specific irreversible inhibitor of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and CCCP, a protonophore oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor (Fig. 5A). In mock, cofilin-BFP, and cofilin S3A-BFP-transfected cells, Na,K-ATPase activity was decreased significantly (to 0–5%) in the presence of IAA (Fig. 5A). However, in the presence of CCCP, mock and cofilin-BFP-transfected cells exhibited slightly increased Na,K-ATPase activity, and cofilin S3A-BFP-transfected cells exhibited slightly lower activity (Fig. 5A). As suggested by Okamoto et al. (37Okamoto K. Wang W. Rounds J. Chambers E.A. Jacobs D.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E479-E488Google Scholar), the slight increase in Na,K-ATPase activity in mock and cofilin-BFP-transfected cells produced by CCCP may be caused by a compensatory increase in glycolysis. These data suggest that glycolysis, but not oxidative phosphorylation, is effective in providing ATP to Na,K-ATPase, through a process that requires the phosphorylated cofilin. The studies described in Fig. 5A were also performed after treatment with LPA and Y-27632. As expected, after LPA treatment, Na,K-ATPase activity of mock-, cofilin-BFP-, and cofilin S3A-BFP-transfected cells increased to 142, 180, and 80%, respectively, (Fig. 5B). However, after LPA treatment, Na,K-ATPase activity in all three transfected cells remarkably decreased in the presence of IAA but was almost unaffected in the presence of CCCP (Fig. 5B). Y-27632 treatment caused, in all three transfected cells, decreases in Na,K-ATPase activity, which was decreased further by IAA and unaffected by CCCP (Fig. 5C). These results indicate again that glycolytic ATP is required for Na,K-ATPase activity and that the glycolytic fuel is supplied by the phosphorylated cofilin via a Rho-mediated signaling pathway. Because Na,K-ATPase is reported to be involved in the extrusion of intracellular sodium, we wondered whether phosphorylation of cofilin, which regulates this enzyme, also affects the intracellular sodium concentration [Na+]i. To check this out, we performed flow cytometry experiments (FACS) using the cell-permeable sodium-binding fluorescent indicator, sodium green, and measured the [Na+]i (Fig. 6). FACS of HeLa cells in the presence of LPA showed a remarkable decrease in the intracellular sodium of a population of cells, probably through the increased Na,K-ATPase activity (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, FACS showed little change in the intracellular sodium concentration in the presence of Y-27632 (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that sodium transport to outside of the cells may be facilitated by the activation of Rho signaling, which presumably phosphorylates cofilin and activates sodium activity. We also tested whether [Na+]i is affected by a glycolytic pathway or oxidative pathway, using specific inhibitors of IAA and CCCP (Fig. 6B). As expected, in the presence of IAA, the population of cells that have an increased [Na+]i was increased, whereas in the presence of CCCP, there was no difference from the control (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that a glycolytic pathway, rather than an oxidative pathway, provides the energy demands for Na,K-ATPase activity. To clarify the relationship between glycolytic energy fuel and cofilin, in the context of its regulation by a Rho-mediated signaling pathway, we treated HeLa cells with LPA and Y-27632 as well as IAA and CCCP, as described in ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake experiments (Fig. 6C). As expected, in the presence of IAA, the population of cells that had an increase in [Na+]i was increased by pretreatment with either LPA or Y-27632 (Fig. 6C). However, both in the absence and presence of CCCP, [Na+]i decreased after pretreatment with LPA but increased after pretreatment of Y-27632 (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results suggest that Rho and ROCK play an important role in the regulation of [Na+]i probably through the phosphorylation of cofilin. This study demonstrated the following: (a) cofilin is phosphorylated by LPA through the Rho signaling cascade, Rho/ROCK/LIM kinase; (b) both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cofilin S interacts with TPI; (c) phosphorylated cofilin complexed with TPI is translocated to the plasma membrane and becomes associated with Na,K-ATPase; and (d) the TPI-glycolytic enzyme complex feeds glycolytic fuel to Na,K-ATPase. In Fig. 7, we propose a pathway for Na,K-ATPase regulation by the cofilin-TPI complex in HeLa cells. The two major sources of ATP in the cells are aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It is believed that oxidative ATP supports the mechanical activity of the cell, whereas glycolytic ATP fuels energy for membrane functions (38Weiss J. Hiltbrand B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 436-447Google Scholar). Indeed, many membrane proteins such as the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, Ca2+ pump, Na,K-ATPase, and L-type Ca2+channel, are known to use glycolytic ATP preferentially rather than oxidative ATP (39Hardin C.D. Zhang C. Kranias E.G. Steenaart N.A. Raeymaekers L. Paul R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1326-H1333Google Scholar). Recently, direct binding of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase to a proton pump was demonstrated (40Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn Jr., W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrated that a glycolytic enzyme, TPI, associates indirectly with the large cytoplasmic domain of the sodium pump through phosphorylated cofilin. Our previous demonstration, employing a yeast two-hybrid assay, that the large cytoplasmic domains of glucose transporter 1, glucose transporter 4, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and plasma membrane Ca-ATPase did not interact with cofilin (41Kim M. Jung J. Park C.-S. Lee K. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; (October 1, DOI: 10.1016/50300-9084(02)00004-4)Google Scholar) suggests that the interaction with cofilin may not be a general phenomenon for feeding glycolytic fuels to the transmembrane proteins. Thus, it appears that glycolytic energy for the membrane function is provided via two different mechanisms, namely, one involving direct interaction of a plasma membrane protein such as a proton pump with glycolytic enzymes, and the other involving indirect interaction of a plasma membrane protein such as a sodium pump with glycolytic enzyme via cofilin mediator. It has been shown that glycolytic enzymes such as aldolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase interact directly with structural proteins such as actin and microtubules, whereas TPI binds indirectly (30Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 381: 37-46Google Scholar, 42Stephan P. Clarke F. Morton D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 873: 127-135Google Scholar, 43Walsh J.L. Keith T.J. Knull H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 64-70Google Scholar). Previously, we identified, in yeast two-hybrid screening studies, both TPI and cofilin as binding partners of the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase. However, when TPI was reintroduced into transformants containing Na,K-ATPase, the interaction was not reproducible, suggesting that TPI does not bind directly to Na,K-ATPase (data not shown). The present study, demonstrating that cofilin interacts with TPI and that this interaction is not dependent on the phosphorylation of cofilin, suggests that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cofilin can bind to TPI. Thus, it seems that TPI interacts indirectly, through phosphorylated cofilin with Na,K-ATPase, and through dephosphorylated cofilin, with structural proteins. Dephosphorylated cofilin is essential to actin dynamics. It becomes inactive through phosphorylation at serine 3 residue, in a process regulated by LIM kinase (22Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 808-809Google Scholar, 23Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S.

Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of LIM kinase depends on several small GTPase signaling cascades, known as Rho/ROCK and Rac or Cdc42/Pak sequences (22Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 808-809Google Scholar, 23Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S.

Although the signaling pathway for cofilin phosphorylation is well defined, the function of the inactive form of the phosphorylated cofilin has not been clear until now. The present study is the first demonstration that the phosphorylated cofilin functions as a glycolytic ATP feeder for the ATP-hydrolyzing sodium pump. Rho is an important signaling element that regulates the cytoskeleton and interacts with other small GTPases, as well as other signaling elements, to regulate various cell functions (45Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Google Scholar, 46Dickson B.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that Rho is involved in the regulation of intracellular sodium, probably through Na,K-ATPase activation, which requires the phosphorylated cofilin and TPI complex. Rho also stimulates Na+/H+ exchanger activity through ROCK, and activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger requires the glycolytic ATP (47Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Google Scholar, 48Szaszi K. Kurashima K. Kapus A. Paulsen A. Kaibuchi K. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 27: 28599-28606Google Scholar, 49Sugiyama S. Satoh H. Nomura N. Terada H. Watanabe H. Hayashi H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 217: 153-161Google Scholar). Because both Na,K-ATPase and the Na+/H+ exchanger are involved in the regulation of sodium homeostasis, Rho also may play an important role in the maintenance of intracellular sodium. In summary, we have described studies indicating how glycolytic enzymes are associated with the plasma membrane and what role they play in supporting ion pump activity in relative isolation from other metabolic enzyme cascades. The advantage of this system would be that the noted close juxtaposition and the functional coupling of energy producing system and energy-consuming enzymes may allow a fast and efficient adaptation of metabolic flow to fluctuating cellular conditions.

Rad54 is thought to stimulate the search of homology via formation of a specific complex with the presynaptic Rad51 filament on single-stranded DNA. Herein, we address the interaction of Rad54 with Rad51 filaments on double-stranded (ds) DNA, an intermediate in DNA strand exchange with unclear functional significance. We show thatSaccharomyces cerevisiae Rad54 exerts distinct modes of ATPase activity on partially and fully saturated filaments of Rad51 protein on dsDNA. The highest ATPase activity is observed on dsDNA containing short patches of yeast Rad51 filaments resulting in a 6-fold increase compared with protein-free DNA. This enhanced ATPase mode of yeast Rad54 can also be elicited by partial filaments of human Rad51 protein but to a lesser extent. In contrast, the interaction of Rad54 protein with duplex DNA fully covered with Rad51 is entirely species-specific. When yeast Rad51 fully covers dsDNA, Rad54 protein hydrolyzes ATP in a reduced mode at 60–80% of its rate on protein-free DNA. Instead, saturated filaments with human Rad51 fail to support the yeast Rad54 ATPase. We suggest that the interaction of Rad54 with dsDNA-Rad51 complexes is of functional importance in homologous recombination.

The RAD52 epistasis group of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RAD50, MRE11, XRS2, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, RDH54/TID1, RPA) controls homologous recombination and recombinational repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). After DNA double-stranded break formation, the DNA ends at break sites are promptly processed by nucleases. The resulting 3′ OH ending tails are then presumably coated by RPA, the eukaryotic ssDNA 1The abbreviations used for: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). -binding protein. The key player of recombination is the Rad51 protein, the eukaryotic homologue of the bacterial RecA protein (reviewed in Ref. 2Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the aid of accessory factors, Rad52 protein and Rad55-Rad57 complex, Rad51 displaces RPA from ssDNA tails and assembles into a nucleoprotein filament. This filament, also named presynaptic complex, is the molecular device for homology search on partner duplex DNA molecules and subsequent DNA strand exchange. Further steps comprise hybrid DNA extension, priming of DNA synthesis, branch migration, and resolution of Holliday junctions, yielding DNA molecules repaired in an intrinsically error-free way. The detailed mechanism of these latter stages remains poorly understood. The model presented above is supported by data on the physical association of the corresponding proteins and their recombinational activities in vitro (reviewed in Ref. 3Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation ofRAD51, RAD52, or RAD54 confers the strongest recombination/repair-deficient phenotypes. Rad51 protein can associate with itself, with Rad52, Rad54, and with the Rad55/Rad57 heterodimer (4Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T.

RPA is an essential component of the presynaptic phase required for proper loading of Rad51 on ssDNA and formation of functionally active filaments (10Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). RPA also associates with Rad52 (11Gasior S.L. Wong A.K. Kora Y. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K.

Rad52 is thought to enhance filament formation by favoring the displacement of RPA from ssDNA by Rad51 (14Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 15New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Likewise, Rad55/Rad57 heterodimer stimulates presynaptic filament formation in the presence of RPA, possibly by nucleating the ssDNA-Rad51 filament (18Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic evidence points to a specific function of Rad54 protein in eukaryotic homologous recombination. Rad54 protein belongs to the Swi2/Snf2 group of superfamily 2 of DNA-dependent/stimulated NTPases, which are known to act in transcriptional regulation of gene expression (e.g. Mot1 and the ATPase subunits of chromatin remodeling complexes), DNA repair (Rad5, Rad16, Rad26/ERCC6, and Rad54), and chromosome segregation (lodestar protein) (reviewed in Refs. 19Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar and 20Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These proteins carry putative helicase motifs, but no helicase activity has been demonstrated for any of them in conventional strand displacement assays. Rad54 protein possesses potent dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity and DNA remodeling activity, which are dependent on ATP hydrolysis (21Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 22Swagemakers S.M. Essers J. de Wit J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Rad54 ATP binding site (Walker A-box) confer repair-deficient phenotypes similar to that of a deletion mutant (23Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Clever B. Schmuckli-Maurer J. Sigrist M. Glassner B.J. Heyer W.D. Yeast. 1999; 15: 721-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This indicates that the cellular function of Rad54 protein is dependent on its ATPase activity. Genetic studies have shown that deletion of the SRS2 gene is lethal in a rad54 mutant (28Palladino F. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 23-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Srs2 is a DNA helicase involved in the metabolism of ssDNA gaps, preparing the substrate for the RAD6 postreplicational repair pathway (29Chanet R. Heude M. Adjiri A. Maloisel L. Fabre F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4782-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the absence of Srs2, these gaps are channeled into the homologous recombination pathway (29Chanet R. Heude M. Adjiri A. Maloisel L. Fabre F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4782-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutations in RAD52,RAD51, RAD55, and RAD57, genes that encode proteins acting in the presynaptic and synaptic phases of recombination, suppress this synthetic lethality (30Schild D. Genetics. 1995; 140: 115-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations, together with cytological data showing that Rad51 foci accumulate in a rad54 mutant (31Shinohara M. Gasior S.L. Bishop D.K. Shinohara A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10814-10819Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), suggest that, in yeast, Rad54 protein acts in recombination after presynaptic filament formation. In vitro, Rad54 was found to stimulate Rad51-mediated d-loop formation and three-stranded DNA strand exchange via an interaction with the established presynaptic filament (21Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 26Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Rad54 protein enhances, in an ATP-dependent way, both synaptic joint formation and further extension of heteroduplex DNA in the postsynaptic phase (32Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,33Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8447-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This stimulation is accompanied by a concomitant increase of the Rad54 ATPase and DNA remodeling activities. It is thought that topological changes in the duplex DNA molecule made by Rad54 facilitate both homology search and DNA strand exchange (25Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 26Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Rad54 protein can interact, via its NH2-terminal part, with Rad51 protein in solution (6Clever B. Interthal H. Schmuckli-Maurer J. King J. Sigrist M. Heyer W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Jiang H. Xie Y. Houston P. Stemke-Hale K. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33181-33186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and this interaction is likely to have biological relevance at the level of the nucleoprotein complex (26Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To achieve maximal stimulation of DNA strand exchange, Rad54 has to be added to the reaction mixture either right after presynaptic filament formation or as the last component after partner duplex DNA addition. It was proposed that the presynaptic filament first binds Rad54 protein and then targets the protein to duplex DNA. The activated Rad54 facilitates the homology search by Rad51 protein and further steps of the reaction (26Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is known that Rad51 protein has affinity to both ssDNA and dsDNA (34Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 35Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 36Namsaraev E.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and that Rad51 binding to dsDNA substrate inhibits initial stages of homologous pairing in vitro (39Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the product of DNA strand exchange, heteroduplex DNA, is likely to be covered by Rad51 protein, as inferred from the mechanism of the RecA protein-mediated reaction. Thus, the dsDNA-Rad51 complex is an important intermediate or by-product of homologous recombination with as yet unknown functional significance. In addition, it is morphologically very similar to the presynaptic filament (35Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 39Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate the possible interaction of Rad54 protein with dsDNA-Rad51 complexes. We show that besides the basic ATPase activity on protein-free duplex DNA, Rad54 exerts distinct modes of activity on dsDNA-Rad51 complexes: an enhanced ATPase mode on partial Rad51 filament and a reduced ATPase mode on duplex DNA fully covered with Rad51 protein. Our findings point to a specific role of the Rad54 interaction with duplex DNA-Rad51 complexes in homologous recombination. S. cerevisiae glutathioneS-transferase-tagged Rad54 (ScRad54) protein was purified as described (32Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Plasmids for expression of recombinant S. cerevisiae Rad51 (ScRad51) and human Rad51 (hRad51) proteins were kindly provided by Dr. P. Sung. ScRad51 protein was purified as described (10Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). hRad51 protein was produced in Escherichia coli and purified essentially according to the protocol for the ScRad51 with an additional Mono S column step at the end. E. coli RecA protein was a kind gift of Dr. S. Kowalczykowski. Plasmid and phage DNA were purchased from Invitrogen and New England Biolabs. Rad51 and Rad54 concentrations are given in moles of monomers. Duplex DNA concentrations are given in moles of base pairs. Single-point analysis of ATP hydrolysis was performed using a charcoal-based assay as described (32Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 50-μl reaction mixtures containing either protein-free DNA or preformed DNA-Rad51 complexes at the indicated concentrations were incubated at 30 °C with Rad54 protein in the ATPase reaction buffer containing 25 mm triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.5, 13 mm magnesium acetate, 1.8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Before the addition of a final component (usually Rad54 protein) the mixture was supplemented with 0.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were terminated at specific time points by the addition of 10 volumes (500 μl) of ice-cold charcoal mixture (2%, w/v, NoriteTM charcoal (Sigma C-5260), 0.25 mHCl, 0.25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.25 mmK2HPO4). Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min, and then centrifuged for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximal speed; 400-μl portions of supernatants were collected. Radioactivity of the supernatant reflecting the extent of ATP hydrolysis was counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. The assay was based on a reaction in which the regeneration of hydrolyzed ATP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH (40Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Following each cycle of ATP hydrolysis, the regeneration system consisting of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase converts one molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate when the ADP is converted back to the ATP. The pyruvate is subsequently converted to lactate by l-lactate dehydrogenase resulting in the oxidation of one NADH molecule. The assay measures the rate of the NADH absorbance decrease at 340 nm, which is proportional to the rate of steady-state ATP hydrolysis. The constant regeneration of ATP allows monitoring the ATP hydrolysis rate over the entire course of the assay. A multicell holder permits the simultaneous analysis of up to 7 control and experimental samples. The assay was typically performed at 24 °C, if not otherwise indicated, with 5 nm Rad54 protein and the indicated concentrations of DNA, Rad51 protein, or preformed DNA-Rad51 complexes in a 100-μl volume of the ATPase reaction buffer supplemented with a regeneration system (3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase), 20 units/ml l-lactate dehydrogenase and NADH to give anA 340 of 1.6–1.8 (about 250–300 μm). Extra NADH was added to resume those reactions where the NADH pool became exhausted. The absorbance data were collected using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer equipped with UV-visible ChemStation software. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the following equation. Rate[ATP×min−1]=−dA340dt[OD/min]×9678×mole−1ATPaseEquation 1 Calculated rates of ATP hydrolysis were plotted over corresponding time points where the absorbance readings were made. Comparison of different samples within the same kinetic time course was made over identical time intervals. The conditions of the DNA unwinding assay were adopted from a protocol originally used to measure DNA helicity in the region of homologous pairing promoted by RecA protein (41Kiianitsa K. Stasiak A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7837-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, supercoiled pUC19 DNA at a concentration of 46 μm was incubated with 2 μm ScRad51 protein for 15 min at 30 °C in 15 μl of the ATPase reaction buffer. Then 2.5 units of wheat germ topoisomerase (Promega) were added and the reaction was continued for another 15 min. Subsequently, samples were deproteinized and analyzed on a 1.7% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer containing chloroquine at 1 μg/ml. DsDNA-ScRad51 complexes were formed at 30 °C for 15 min in the ATPase reaction buffer (omitting the bovine serum albumin and ATP regeneration system) and then fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde. Spreading and negative staining were performed as described (42Di Capua E. Engel A. Stasiak A. Koller T. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Specimens were subjected to transmission electron microscopy on CM-120 (Philips Electron Optics) at 80 kV tension. Electron micrographs were made at ×35,000 magnification using the low dose mode. Binding of Rad51 protein to duplex DNA severely inhibits DNA strand exchange in vitro (39Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The assembly of the presynaptic filament requires a stoichiometric DNA/protein ratio (3 bp/Rad51) under which an appreciable fraction of the Rad51 may evade binding ssDNA and may bind to dsDNA. This could explain, at least in part, the intrinsically slow rate of Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange. We investigated whether Rad54 interacts with Rad51-covered duplex DNA and how this interaction may be related to the stimulatory effect of Rad54 protein on Rad51-mediated homologous recombination. Because the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity is vital for the cellular function of the Rad54 protein and this activity is significantly increased upon Rad54 interaction with the presynaptic filament in vitro, we monitored the ScRad54 ATPase on dsDNA-ScRad51 complexes. Single-point measurements of hydrolyzed ATP were used to compare overall efficiencies of the Rad54 ATPase with various substrates and orders of addition. As observed previously (25Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,26Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), ssDNA-ScRad51 complexes stimulated the Rad54 ATPase (Fig.1 A). The addition of ScRad51 filaments preformed on short (100-mer) or long (φX174) ssDNA at the saturating molar ratio of 3 nucleotides/Rad51 monomer increased the Rad54 ATP hydrolysis to 140–150% (Fig. 1 A). Direct addition of subsaturating amounts of ScRad51 (300 bp/monomer) to dsDNA, when ssDNA was omitted from the reaction, resulted in an even greater increase of Rad54 ATPase activity (about 170%). With saturating ScRad51 amounts added to dsDNA (3 bp/monomer), partial inhibition of the Rad54 ATPase activity was observed, down to 75–80% of its activity on protein-free DNA. To verify that the observed stimulatory effect on the Rad54 ATPase activity is not because of any particular DNA sequence, size, or topological state, the ATPase assays with the subsaturating bp/Rad51 ratio (300:1) were repeated using a set of duplex DNA substrates (Fig.1 B). The stimulation of the Rad54 ATPase was observed with all DNA substrates tested, including linear, nicked circular, and supercoiled duplex DNA. To rule out the possibility that the dsDNA substrates contained minute amounts of ssDNA, to which ScRad51 protein might preferentially bind and activate Rad54, supercoiled DNA was treated with E. coli exonuclease III followed by chromatography on benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE-cellulose. This treatment should quantitatively remove all potential ssDNA species including partial duplex molecules with single-stranded ends or gaps (43Kodadek T. Gamper H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3210-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). No differences in the stimulation of the Rad54 ATPase using dsDNA substrates before and after this treatment were found (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the activation of the Rad54 ATPase is a property common to dsDNA-ScRad51 complexes formed at a subsaturating ratio. Subsequently, this mode of Rad54 activity is referred to as the enhanced ATPase mode of Rad54 on partial dsDNA-Rad51 filament. We refer to the ATPase activity of Rad54 on protein-free dsDNA as the basic mode. Previous studies indicated that the order of addition of individual components critically affects the progression of DNA strand exchange. The highest stimulation is achieved when Rad54 is added after ssDNA-ScRad51 filament formation, but prior to or soon after duplex DNA addition (26Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test whether the stimulatory effect of ScRad51 protein on the Rad54 ATPase is because of Rad54 interaction with the established dsDNA-ScRad51 filament, we performed a set of experiments with different orders of addition. The highest ATPase stimulation at the 45-min time point was achieved on pre-formed dsDNA-ScRad51 filaments. When protein-free duplex DNA was reacted with Rad54 prior to ScRad51 addition, the stimulatory effect was essentially absent (Fig.2 A). As addressed below, we believe the absence of stimulation at this time point reflects a kinetic impediment. Incubation on ice of ScRad51 with Rad54 followed by dsDNA addition had an intermediary effect, whereas a similar incubation at 30 °C resulted in a slight decrease of the Rad54 ATPase activity. This latter decrease is most likely because of the extreme temperature sensitivity of Rad54 in the absence of DNA (32Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that to be activated to the enhanced ATP hydrolysis mode, the unbound Rad54 protein has to come from solution to the established dsDNA-Rad51 filament. The single-point analysis of ATP hydrolysis (Figs. 1 and 2 A) does not allow evaluating possible differences in the kinetics of the reaction, which may be particularly pertinent in the order of addition experiments. For a more detailed analysis of the Rad54 ATPase stimulation, the order of addition experiment depicted in Fig.2 A was repeated using the ATP/NADH-coupled assay, which allows monitoring the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). First, we wanted to determine whether the stimulation of Rad54 protein by dsDNA-Rad51 complexes had a transient or continuing character. The Rad54 ATPase on protein-free dsDNA and on partial dsDNA-ScRad51 complexes was progressively inactivated with time (30–40% loss of activity over 1800 s, Fig.2 B). To compensate for this inactivation effect, the rates of Rad54 ATPase in the presence of Rad51 protein were normalized to the Rad54 ATPase rates on protein-free DNA at the corresponding time points and expressed as percentage of Rad54 ATPase stimulation (Fig.2 C). With Rad54 protein added to the preformed subsaturated dsDNA-ScRad51 filament (optimal order of addition,triangles) the stimulation of the Rad54 ATPase was continuous and remained at maximal level. When Rad54 protein had been added to dsDNA prior to establishing the dsDNA-ScRad51 nucleoprotein filament (Rad54 added first to DNA or added together with ScRad51), a delay in the Rad51-dependent stimulation of the Rad54 ATPase was observed. At limited amounts of ScRad51 protein (300 bp/Rad51), this kinetic delay probably reflects first, the time required for the formation of dsDNA-Rad51 complexes; and second, the time required for Rad54, which had bound protein-free DNA, to dissociate from it and find a Rad51 filament-containing DNA molecule. In similar experiments performed with longer incubation times, the Rad54 ATPase at nonoptimal order of addition gradually attained a level of the stimulation at optimal order of addition (data not shown). To determine the optimal conditions for stimulating the Rad54 ATPase activity, we performed a set of titration experiments at a fixed dsDNA/Rad54 ratio using varying amounts of ScRad51 protein to form filaments of different saturation. The optimal DNA/Rad51 ratios fell within a narrow range of 20–50 bp/Rad51 monomer that corresponds to filaments occupying 6–15% of a dsDNA molecule (Fig.3 A). The titration experiments performed with two different duplex DNA substrates (supercoiled pUC19 and dsφX174) show very similar profiles. It has recently been shown that the greatest stimulation of ScRad51 pairing activity by Rad54 protein in the d-loop assay between supercoiled dsDNA and short single-stranded oligonucleotides is achieved at equimolar ratio between the two proteins (26Mazin A.V.

To determine whether changes in the Rad51/Rad54 protein ratio would affect the enhancement of the Rad54 ATPase activity, we performed a titration experiment using a fixed amount of Rad54 protei"

As described previously, in a degradation system utilizing rabbit reticulocyte lysate, antizyme 1 (AZ1) accelerates proteasomal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) degradation, but antizyme 2 (AZ2) does not. To examine the relationship between antizyme structure and function, we further characterized the properties of AZ1 and AZ2 and protein chimeras composed of elements of the two.

The bulk of cellular proteins are long-lived, but some are synthesized, function briefly, and are then destroyed. Labile proteins control an extensive range of biological processes (1Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). These processes include cell cycle control, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, signal transduction, differentiation, and surface-receptor desensitization. Many of these processes have in common the need for rapid or transient responses. The major protease that destroys naturally labile proteins, as well as those that are mutant or misfolded, is the proteasome (2Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). This structurally complex and highly conserved molecular machine contains an interior nanochamber where specific catalytic sites perform proteolysis. Some form of traffic control is needed to accurately direct appropriate substrates to the proteasome interior for destruction, while excluding other proteins. For many well characterized labile proteins, post-translational modification with polyubiquitin chains serves as the marker directing degradation (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). In a few cases, proteasomal degradation takes place without the participation of ubiquitin. A well characterized example is the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) 1The abbreviations used for: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; AZ1, antizyme 1; AZ2, antizyme 2; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used for: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; AZ1, antizyme 1; AZ2, antizyme 2; ORF, open reading frame.

Its degradation is more rapid still in cells with superabundant polyamines. Polyamine excess induces the protein antizyme 1 (AZ1), which binds tightly to ODC, forming a heterodimer. In association with AZ1, ODC becomes a very efficient substrate of the proteasome, with a half-life of a few minutes (7Murakami Y. Tanaka K. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). AZ1 was shown recently to belong to a conserved gene family, with at least three members in the vertebrate lineage (10Ivanov I.P. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1907-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). AZ1 and antizyme 2 (AZ2) are found in all tissues, with AZ1 transcripts generally present in 10- to 20-fold greater amounts than AZ2 (11Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). AZ3 is found only in the testes and is expressed solely during postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis (12Ivanov I. Rohrwasser A. Terreros D. Gesteland R. Atkins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). AZ1 takes part in polyamine homeostasis. By binding to ODC, it disrupts the active form of the enzyme, a homodimer, and then causes its destruction (13Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). AZ2 also binds and inhibits, but whether it has degradative capacity is unclear. Our previous studies using an in vitro system of proteasomal degradation (derived from rabbit reticulocyte lysates) demonstrated that, in this context, AZ1 directs degradation, but AZ2 does not (14Zhu C. Lang D.W. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26425-26430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, when mammalian ODC and AZ1 or AZ2 were co-expressed in insect cells using baculovirus-derived vectors, both AZs greatly reduced the steady state levels of ODC, a result consistent with accelerated degradation (14Zhu C. Lang D.W. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26425-26430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that AZ1 and AZ2 indeed differ in their ODC degradative activity when made and tested in vitro or in bacteria and that this functional difference depends on two amino acids. All DNA manipulations used standard molecular methods. Constructions that utilized PCR steps were verified by sequencing; constructions that relied on restriction-ligation utilized fully sequenced constituents. The ODC gene was mouse (Mus musculus), AZ1 was rat (Rattus norvegicus), and AZ2 was human (Homo sapiens). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the megaprimer method (15Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.2001Google Scholar). TheEscherichia coli expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) was used for expression of recombinant ODC, AZ1, and AZ2 proteins, each with a His6 sequence positioned near the N terminus to facilitate purification by transition-metal ion chromatography. The AZ1 construct was designed such that the N-terminal sequence Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6-Gly-Ser-Ala-Cys replaced the initial methionine of the native protein sequence; AZ2 was similarly constructed but with Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6-Gly-Ser. In vectors used for bacterial expression of the AZs, deletion of a single T nucleotide was used to align native ORFs 1 and 2 (16Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S.I. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification and other protein manipulations outside the scope of this paper, the initial methionine of the native sequence of ODC was replaced with a sequence containing a His6 tag, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site and FLAG tag: Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6-Gly-Ser-(Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly (TEV site)-Gly-Ser-Met-(Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (FLAG epitope)). All plasmids or PCR products used for in vitrotranscription/translation contained a T7 promoter positioned upstream of the ORF. The plasmids used for transcription/translation of ODC, AZ1, and AZ2, which encode proteins with the native sequence, have been described (14Zhu C. Lang D.W. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26425-26430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PCR overlap extension with a T7 promoter positioned upstream of the ORF was used to produce a series of reciprocal AZ1/AZ2 chimeras suitable for in vitro transcription/translation. One series consisted of an N-terminal portion originating in AZ1 up to residue n, followed by a crossover to the AZ2 sequence at residue n + 1. A second parallel chimera protein series was similarly constructed, but with the N-terminal region originating in AZ2 rather than AZ1, e.g. N-AZ2129–AZ1130-C. The junction sites of these chimera pairs in AZ1 were residues 121, 129, 138, 145, 157, or 172. (We use within this paper an amino acid numbering system for both AZs that is referenced to the primary sequence of AZ1, a common coordinate system made possible by the gapless strong homology throughout the two sequences.) AZ-stimulated ODC degradation was assayed as previously described (14Zhu C. Lang D.W. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26425-26430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35S-labeled ODC was produced by coupled in vitro transcription/translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TNT, Promega). AZ1 and AZ2 were similarly produced. The reticulocyte lysates used for synthesis of ODC and the AZs also provided the proteasomes required for degradation. Lysates containing ODC and AZs were incubated at 37° C for 1 h in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (30 mm Tris pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1.6 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase). The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The fraction of ODC remaining undegraded was determined by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and densitometry. Band intensity was quantitated with Scion Image software. Background degradation observed in the absence of AZ was subtracted. Binding of AZs to ODC was measured by evaluating the inhibition of ODC enzymatic activity as previously described (14Zhu C. Lang D.W. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26425-26430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); because ODC associated with AZ is enzymatically inactive, enzymatic activity provides a measure of AZ binding. ODC activity was determined as previously described, using 14COOH-ornithine as substrate. AZ1, AZ2, and AZ chimeras were compared at a series of AZ:ODC ratios (using as the diluent a mock transcription/translation reaction mix not programmed with template) under identical conditions to determine in parallel enzymatic inhibition and stimulation of ODC degradation. The relative stoichiometry of the labeled proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE and quantitation of the 35S-labeled autoradiographic bands, taking into account the number of methionine residues present in each protein. [35S]methionine-labeled recombinant His6-TEV-FLAG-ODC in expression vector pQE30 was synthesized and metabolically labeled in E. coli. The recombinant ODC was expressed in strain SG13009 (Qiagen). For labeling with [35S]methionine, cells were preincubated in methionine assay medium (Difco) at 37 °C for 30 min. After addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (final concentration 1 mm) and 2 mCi of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml), incubation was continued for a further 30 min at 30° C. Cells were washed twice with cold M9 medium, broken by lysozyme treatment and sonication, and His6-TEV-Flag-ODC then purified by Talon metal affinity chromatography (Clontech). Recombinant HisAZ1 and HisAZ2 were similarly expressed and purified in unlabeled form. To measure AZ-stimulated degradation, reactions were performed with purified AZs and 35S-labeled ODC and purified rat liver 26S proteasomes. Proteasomes were purified by successive steps of ultracentrifugation, glycerol gradient centrifugal fractionation, MonoQ anion-exchange chromatography, and ultracentrifugation. 2M. Zhang and P. Coffino, manuscript in preparation. Proteasome purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and by comparing the hydrolysis activity for fluorogenic peptide substrates with literature values. Reaction mixtures contained AZ1 or AZ2, 35S-labeled ODC, proteasomes (50–100 nm), a protease inhibitor mixture (aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, each at 2 mg/ml) and an ATP-regenerating system were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 μg of bovine serum albumin and trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration), incubating on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The acid-soluble counts in the supernatant were measured by scintillation counting and the result was expressed as the fraction of input ODC degraded. We have shown previously using anin vitro degradation system derived from rabbit reticulocytes that AZ1 accelerates degradation of ODC but AZ2 does not (14Zhu C. Lang D.W. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26425-26430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the rabbit reticulocyte extract used forin vitro translation provides the AZs and ODC, and is also a rich source of proteasomes, the protein machine that degrades ODC. Titration experiments comparing AZ1 and AZ2 in this in vitromodel have shown the former to be at least 16 times more potent than the latter in directing degradation. However, no measurements were made in this system to determine whether the two AZs used to test degradation activity were both binding to ODC. If the avidity of AZ2 for ODC is markedly inferior to that of AZ1, a failure of AZ2 to bind ODC under the experimental conditions used could trivially account for their distinct degradative capacities. To address this question, we measured in parallel two activities of both AZ1 and AZ2: the capacity to accelerate ODC degradation and ODC binding. Binding to ODC was determined by measuring ODC enzymatic activity. This surrogate measure of binding is available because AZ binding converts the ODC homodimer into an enzymatically inactive AZ:ODC heterodimer. The reduction in activity therefore reflects the extent of ODC occupancy by antizyme. [35S]methionine-labeled ODC, AZ1, and AZ2 were individually generated by coupled in vitro transcription and translation, and the relative protein amounts were determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Various amounts of AZ1 and AZ2 were compared in both an ODC degradation assay and ODC activity inhibition assay, using in each case a fixed quantity of ODC (Fig.1). The effect of different stoichiometric ratios of AZ:ODC was assessed. The lowest amount of AZ1 tested caused the degradation of about half of the ODC substrate (Fig.1 A). This amount of AZ1 represents a stoichiometric ratio of 0.3:1 (AZ1:ODC). Greater amounts of AZ1, up to 20-fold more (equivalent to a stoichiometric ratio of about 6:1 AZ1:ODC) similarly resulted in degradation of about half of the substrate. The capacity of sub-stoichiometric amounts of AZ1 to produce significant degradation is consistent with the catalytic role of AZ1, in which one molecule can direct the degradation of multiple molecules of ODC (7Murakami Y. Tanaka K. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Mamroud-Kidron E. Omer-Itsicovich M. Bercovich Z. Tobias K.E. Rom E. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, AZ2 did not augment ODC degradation when added at similar concentrations. At the highest concentration of AZ2 tested in the inhibition assay (Fig. 1 B), ODC was more than half saturated by AZ2. The avidity of AZ1 for ODC was about 3-fold greater than that of AZ2: a 3-fold higher concentration of AZ2 compared with AZ1 was required to produce 50% inhibition of ODC activity (Fig.1 B). However, at amounts of the two AZs that were equipotent in binding, AZ1 caused degradation, but AZ2 did not. Therefore, a difference in the extent of their association cannot explain the difference in degradative activity. The reticulocyte is a highly specialized end-stage tissue that may not reflect the characteristics of ODC degradation in other cells. To determine whether the complex cell extracts used for degradation contain an activity that can differentially inhibit AZ2-mediated ODC targeting (or enhance that of AZ1), the activities of AZ1 and AZ2 were compared using purified components. Purified [35S]methionine-labeled ODC and recombinant His6-AZ1 or His6-AZ2 were incubated with purified proteasomes and Mg2+-ATP. His6-AZ1 caused proteolysis of about 1/3 of the [35S]methionine-ODC substrate in 1 h (Fig.2). His6-AZ2, in contrast, produced little detectable degradation compared with a control incubation without AZ. The distinction between the degradative activities of the recombinant AZs therefore is preserved in a system containing only ODC and the proteasome as additional macromolecular components. The region consisting of amino acids 70–120 of AZ1 was previously identified by deletion analysis as important for mediating ODC degradation (18Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Hayashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Deletions, however, can disturb folding of the residual protein, thus propagating functional changes outside of the region that has been deleted. To test the function of this region in the context of an intact AZ, we constructed the chimeric protein N-AZ1121 –AZ2122-C, composed of the N-terminal residues 1–121 of AZ1 followed by residues from 122 to the C terminus of AZ2, but found that this did not efficiently mediate ODC degradation (results not shown). This may be because some crucial region in AZ1 is absent in the chimera. To help localize the region or regions responsible for the functional difference between the two AZs, we made a systematic series of reciprocal AZ1/AZ2 chimeras and measured the capacity of each chimera to direct ODC degradation. The strong homology of the second ORF of the two AZs, the ORF expressed as the result of polyamine-stimulated frame-shifting (10Ivanov I.P. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1907-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), makes it possible to unambiguously identify residues that can be used as homologous crossover points in constructing such paired chimeras. One chimera protein series consisted of an N-terminal portion originating in AZ1 up to residue n, followed by a crossover to the AZ2 sequence at residue n + 1 (Fig.3 A). For example, one such protein was N-AZ1129 –AZ2130-C. A second parallel chimera protein series was similarly constructed, but with the N-terminal region originating in AZ2 rather than AZ1, e.g.N-AZ2129 –AZ1130-C. These chimera pairs had junction sites at residues 121,129, 138, 145, 157, or 172. In the simplest and most readily analyzed outcome, a single small linear region would be found to account for the greater part of the functional difference. This proved true; the only region of functional importance was the region between AZ1 residues 121 and 145 (Fig. 3 B). The chimeras with breakpoints intermediate between 121 and 145, at 129 or 138, had intermediate activity, and the reciprocal pairs with breakpoints at 129 or 138 within the critical region had approximately additive activities. To determine whether AZ1 amino acids 130–145 are responsible for the distinct degradative activities of the two proteins, we carried out reciprocal swaps of this sequence. We concentrated on this region because the properties of the single-breakpoint chimeras suggested that amino acids 130–145 capture most of the functional difference between AZ1 and AZ2. When amino acids 130–145 of AZ2 were used to replace the corresponding region of AZ1 (forming the double chimera AZ1-2-1), AZ1 losses the ability to target ODC degradation (Fig.4 A), although it retains high ODC binding potency (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, the reciprocal molecule in which the corresponding amino acids of AZ1 are implanted within the body of AZ2 (double chimera AZ2-1-2) exhibits 65% of the degradative ability of AZ1, despite having a somewhat reduced ability to bind ODC compared with AZ1. The rank order of avidity for ODC was AZ1-2-1 > AZ1 > AZ2 > AZ2-1-2 (Fig. 4 B). Chimera AZ1-2-1 showed higher ODC binding potency than AZ2-1-2, although it lacks the capacity to degrade ODC. In contrast, chimera AZ2-1-2 showed a relatively low avidity for ODC, but it can mediate ODC degradation efficiently. These results imply that amino acids 130–145 of AZ1 are crucial for degradation but not for ODC association. To determine which specific residues among amino acids 130–145 of AZ1 were important for degradation, we mutated all of those that differed between AZ1 and AZ2. There are 10 such amino acids. All of these in AZ1 were altered to correspond to the sequence of AZ2; amino acids were changed individually (131, 143, 145), or in clusters of two or three (134–135, 136–138, and 140–141). The degradative activity of each mutant was compared with that of wild-type AZ1 (Fig. 5). Only two of the amino acid exchanges reduced activity by 20% of more, Arg131Asp and Ala145Asp, each of which reduced activity about 2-fold. The Arg131Asp, Ala145Asp double mutation was then made and tested; its residual activity was 6% that of wild-type AZ1. The chief findings of this paper are as follows. When rabbit reticulocyte lysate is used as the environment of proteolysis, AZ1 can direct ODC degradation but AZ2 cannot. The difference in degradative function is intrinsic to the AZs, because it is also observed in a purified system in which proteasomes, ODC, and AZ are the only proteins present. A greater avidity of AZ1 for ODC does not explain their disparate function. Analyses of chimeras between AZ1 and AZ2 and of regional reciprocal swaps demonstrate that most of the functional difference is conferred by amino acids 130–145 of AZ1. Site-directed mutagenesis of Arg131 and Ala145 of AZ1 shows that these two amino acids fully account for the difference in functional properties of the two AZs. The strategy employed here started with the finding that two proteins of similar structure have dissimilar properties: one can and the other cannot direct degradation of ODC in vitro. This suggested that chimeras and regional and local exchanges of sequence information between the two forms of AZ could be used to identify the responsible residues. As anticipated from their similarity of structure, these hybrid proteins retained the capacity to bind ODC, eliminating this potentially confounding factor in the analysis of the data. The overall approach was validated by the readily interpreted unambiguous results. Chimeras had transitions of activity that depended smoothly on breakpoint location. Reciprocal chimeras had reciprocal activities, thus implicating a single small region as critical. Exchange of this region between the two parent proteins inverted their functional properties. The partial activity of chimeras with breakpoints between residues 130–145 suggested that more than one residue within this region contributes to the functional difference. Exhaustive amino acid exchanges within this region identified two amino acids as critical to function. The limitations as well as benefits of this approach merit consideration. We began with the agnostic stance that nothing is known about the sequence elements responsible for the difference of degradative function, and asked a very specific question: usingin vitro degradation by the proteasome, where do the responsible sequence elements lie? In fact, previous work based on other methods had told us much about the functional domains of AZ1. The C-terminal AZ1 half molecule (amino acids 120–227) is sufficient for ODC binding, and additional sequence information within amino acids 70–119 is required to direct ODC degradation (18Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Hayashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of amino acids 113–118 also destroys the degradative capacity of AZ1 (18Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is no contradiction between these data and our present results identifying residues 131 and 145 as critical. We have answered a single but significant question, the identity of the amino acids responsible for the different in vitro degradative properties of the two AZs. The use of reciprocal chimeras and replacements rather than truncations and deletions is less likely to result in artifactual misidentification of functional elements, because removing sequence elements can disturb folding into a native conformation. The further question of whether and under what conditions AZ2 can mediate ODC degradation remains to be resolved. ODC is degraded by the proteasome in either the presence or absence of AZ (9Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The process is accelerated by but not dependent on AZ. The C terminus of ODC has an essential role in its degradation (20Ghoda L. van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It bears residues necessary for degradation, preeminently Cys441 and the five terminal residues. AZ1 exposes the ODC C terminus. Antibodies directed at the ODC C terminus gain greater access to the molecule in the presence of AZ1, and such antibodies impair proteasomal degradation (21Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We have not tested whether AZ2, like AZ1, alters access to the ODC C terminus. Our previous studies (18Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and those of others (19Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Hayashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that a portion of AZ1 consisting of approximately the C-terminal half of that molecule (amino acids 120–227) binds to ODC and can disrupt ODC enzymatic activity. Like intact AZ1, the AZ1 C-terminal half molecule presumably displaces the ODC homodimer, replacing it with an ODC:AZ heterodimer. Like the AZ1 C-terminal half molecule, AZ2 must inactivate ODC by disrupting the homodimer, and like the AZ1 half molecule, cannot direct degradation. This reinforces the conclusion, based previously on AZ1 deletions and truncations, that disrupting the ODC homodimer is not sufficient for enhancing degradation. It is possible that AZ1 functions in degradation merely by mobilizing the ODC C terminus. Alternatively, it may do this, but perform some additional function that promotes degradation. Amino acids 131 and 145 may be critical contact residues in one or both of these roles, interacting with ODC or the proteasome. The crystal structure of truncated (22Kern A.D. Oliveira M.A. Coffino P. Hackert M.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or full-length ODC containing all 461 amino acids (23Almrud J.J. Oliveira M.A. Kern A.D. Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) shows little electron density corresponding to amino acids C-terminal to residue 420, implying that the most distal part of ODC is disordered. It remains to be determined whether this region is more or less flexible when ODC is complexed with AZ1. We thank Mingsheng Zhang of this laboratory for providing purified rat proteasomes."

We show that eukaryotic and bacterial GAPDH and two proteins from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, which are annotated as dehydrogenases, cleave RNA producing similar degradation patterns. RNA cleavage is most efficient at 60 °C, at MgCl2 concentrations up to 5 mm, and takes place between pyrimidine and adenosine. The RNase active center of the putative aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from S. solfataricus is located within the N-terminal 73 amino acids, which comprise the first mononucleotide-binding site of the predicted Rossmann fold.

It is known that dehydrogenases and other metabolic enzymes can bind RNA. In numerous studies on RNA binding, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 1The abbreviations used for: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ssDNA, single stranded DNA; BSA, bovine serum albumin; dsDNA, double stranded DNA. 1The abbreviations used for: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ssDNA, single stranded DNA; BSA, bovine serum albumin; dsDNA, double stranded DNA. was identified as the major RNA-binding protein. It was shown that human and/or rabbit muscle GAPDH selectively binds tRNA (1Singh R. Green M.R.

The selectivity of GAPDH binding to RNA was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (4De B.P. Gupta S. Zhao H. Drazba J.A. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol.

Furthermore, one of the proteins that specifically binds to a small stable RNA from Mycoplasma capricolum was identified as bacterial GAPDH (10Matsuda T. Ando K. Sasaki T. Ushida C. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 187-188Google Scholar). On the other hand, human GAPDH was also identified as a major protein that binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and oligodeoxynucleotides containing the TAAAT motif (11Morgenegg G. Winkler G.C. Hubscher U. Heizmann C.W. Mous J. Kuenzle C.C. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Griffoni C. Laktionov P.P. Rykova E.Y. Spisni E. Riccio M. Santi S. Bryksin A. Volodko N. Kraft R. Vlassov V. Tomasi V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently it was proposed that the NAD-binding structure (Rossmann fold) of GAPDH represents a novel RNA binding domain that provides a molecular basis for RNA recognition by dinucleotide-binding metabolic enzymes (13Nagy E. Henics T. Eckert M. Miseta A. Lightowlers R.N. Kellermayer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Baker et al. (14Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) provided another line of evidence for the relationship between dehydrogenases and enzymes interacting with RNA. They revealed that spinach CSP41, an mRNA-binding protein and ribonuclease (15Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar), is homologous to nucleotide-sugar epimerases and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and proposed that these proteins share a common ancestor. We are interested in the identification of archaeal endoribonucleases and therefore monitored protein fractions from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus using RNase activity assays. Two major proteins were copurified in a cell fraction with RNase activity. Surprisingly, they were identified as hypothetical dehydrogenases. During their biochemical characterization as endonucleases, we found that eukaryotic and bacterial GAPDH enzymes also possess RNase activity. Our results show for the first time that the key glycolytic enzyme GAPDH, which possesses RNA-binding capability, also acts as RNase. The finding that two archaeal proteins annotated as dehydrogenases, as well as eukaryotic and bacterial GAPDH, efficiently cleave RNA suggests that dehydrogenases and dehydrogenase-related proteins of all three life domains may be involved in RNA turnover. S. solfataricus strain P2 was maintained in 100 ml of liquid cultures at 75 °C. Per 1 liter of culture medium we added 1 g of yeast extract, 1 g of casamino acids, 3.1 g of KH2PO4, 2.5 g of (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g of MgSO4 × 7H2O, 0.25 g of CaCl2× 2H2O, 0.1 ml of the following solutions: 1.8% MnCl2 × 4H2O and 4.5% Na2B4O7 × 10H2O, and 10 μl of each of the following solutions: 2.2% ZnSO4 × 7H2O, 0.5% CuCl2 × 2H2O, 0.3% NaMoO4 × 2H2O, 0.15% CoCl2 × 6H2O. The medium was adjusted to a pH of 4.2–4.4 and autoclaved, and 10 μl of sterile filtered 0.3% VOSO4 × 2H2O per 1 liter was added. In a fermenter, 10 liters cultures were grown for 5 days at 70 °C, pH of 4.2–4.4, and an air supply of 10 liters min−1. Escherichia coli M15 (REP4) cells were grown on standard I medium (Difco) at ampicillin and kanamycin concentrations as specified by QIAexpressionist (Qiagen). S. solfataricus cells (60 g) were resuspended in extraction buffer (16Rauhut R. Jäger A. Conrad C. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and sonified. The cytoplasmic fraction was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against TEG buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol). The chromatography steps were performed using the fast protein liquid chromatography System (Amersham Biosciences). The protein fractions containing endoribonuclease activity were pooled and applied on the next column. The following columns were used: HiTrap heparin column (AmershamBiosciences), cationexchanger (BioRad Econo-Pac S-cartridge), anionexchanger (BioRad Econo-Pac Q-cartridge), HiLoadTMSuperdex 200 size exclusion chromatography column (AmershamBiosciences). Then, the endonuclease containing pool was applied on preparative 8% native PAGE, 0.25-cm slices were cut, and the proteins recovered by diffusion. Two major proteins were detected in the fractions with the highest RNase activity. They were transferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and sequenced by Edman degradation in a pulsed-liquid sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., model 477A/120A). For amplification of the S. solfataricus asd-1 gene and its parts (short N-terminal part, amino acids 2–73; N-terminal half, amino acids 2–205; C-terminal half, amino acids 206–350), the following primers were used (restriction sites underlined): SsAsd-1seBam (5′-GGGGATCCGCTGATAAGATAAAAGTTTCG-3′) and SsAsd-1asHind (5′-CCCAAGCTTTTAGAAATAACCTAATTCTT-3′) for the full-length asd-1, SsAsd-1seSph (5′-ACATGCATGCGCTGATAAGATAAAAGTTTC-3′) and SsAsd-1/73asHind (5′-CCCAAGCTTGTACTCGGTGGAGACTAT-3′) for the short N-terminal part, SsAsd-1seSph and SsAsd-1/205asHind (5′-CCCAAGCTTTTCTTCCCCTTTAATCCA-3′) for the N-terminal half, and SsAsd-1/206-seSph (5′-ACATGCATGCGAGAAAATTCCTAAGGAA-3′) and SsoAsd-1asHind for the C-terminal half. The primers SsAcd-5seSph (5′-ACATGCATGCGTATTTCCTTTTAAGTCCT-3′) and SsAcd-5asHind (5′-CCCAAGCTTTCACACCTTATATCCAATGA-3′) were used for amplification of the S. solfataricus acd-5 gene (SphI and HindIII restriction sites are underlined). As templates we used genomic DNA from S. solfataricus P2 isolated by the method of Ausubel et al. (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). PCR was performed at an annealing temperature of 44 °C. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pQE30 hexahistidine tag (His6) vector, and propagated in E. coli M15 (REP4) cells. Overexpression at 37 °C and purification under native conditions was performed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer protocol (Qiagen). The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. In vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and purification of [α-32P]UTP-labeled transcripts on denaturing gels were performed as described (18Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 19Conrad C. Rauhut R. Klug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As template for the synthesis of the N26 RNA we used an oligonucleotide with annealed 18-mer promoter oligonucleotide (20Li H.L. Chelladurai B.S. Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transcripts comprising parts of 23 S rRNA of α-proteobacteria were generated directly from T7 promoter containing PCR products corresponding to rDNA positions from 109 to 205 (E. coli numbering) (21Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4719-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in a 10-μl reaction volume in TKG buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 130 mm KCl, 5% glycerol). The amount of used substrate and enzyme, the addition of MgCl2, nucleic acids, NADPH, NADH, ATP, or RNase A inhibitor rRNasin (Promega), the temperature conditions, and the used reaction time are indicated. Rabbit muscle GAPDH, bovine serum albumin (BSA), eukaryotic lactate dehydrogenase, and RNase A were purchased from Sigma. Highly purified E. coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus GAPDH were obtained from S. Boschi-Muller from the laboratory of G. Branlant. Reaction products were heated with formamide containing dye and analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide-urea gel. Bands were detected using a BioRad molecular imager and the Quantity one (BioRad) software. To determine the exact RNA cleavage sites used by GAPDH, Asd-1, Acd-5, and RNase A we performed primer extension analysis. After incubation of RNA with the appropriate protein, the cleavage products were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and treated as previously described (21Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4719-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Heck C. Rothfuchs R. Jager A. Rauhut R. Klug G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled sequencing reactions of the cloned DNA template were loaded on the same gel to map the position of the cleavage sites. After separation in SDS-PAGE, the gel was soaked in cold 2 m KCl. A high amount of polypeptide was visible as a white band, which was excised and electroeluted using BioTrap equipment (Schleicher and Schuell). The polypeptides dissolved in denaturing buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5; 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm dithiothreitol) were dialyzed overnight at 20 °C against renaturing buffer (the same buffer without guanidine hydrochloride). Thereafter, dialysis against TKG buffer at 4 °C was performed. We are interested in the identification of archaeal endoribonucleases that specifically cleave double-stranded RNA. To do this, we monitored protein fractions from the hyperthermophilic archaeon S. solfataricus for such activity, using the well characterized small RNase III substrate N26 derived from phage T7 R1.1 (20Li H.L. Chelladurai B.S. Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The N26 substrate is a double-stranded RNA consisting of 46 bases. The assays were performed at 10 mm MgCl2 and different temperatures. An RNase activity that cleaves the N26 transcript at two positions that differ from both RNase III processing sites was detected in S. solfataricus cell-free extracts. The resulting cleavage pattern was identical at low and high temperatures, and the reaction optimum was reached at 80 °C (not shown). This RNase activity was partially purified. In native state the RNase activity performs as a 90-kDa protein (not shown). The final protein fractions exhibiting the highest RNase activity contained two major protein bands (Fig.1 A, lanes 5-7). They were identified as dehydrogenases by N-terminal sequencing and data base search. The 50-kDa band yielded the sequence Ala-Asp-Lys-Ile-Lys-Val-Ser-Leu-Leu-Gly-Ser-Thr-Gly-Met-Val-Gly-Gln-Lys-Met-Val, which matches the hypothetical aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NCBI accession number AAK41162, coded by asd-1), a protein consisting of 349 amino acids and with aberrant migration in SDS-PAGE. It shows strong homology to archaeal proteins annotated as aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase as well as significant similarity at the amino acid level to the corresponding experimentally characterized eukaryotic dehydrogenases (52% similarity to the yeast enzyme and 41% to that of Arabidopsis thaliana) (23Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additionally, the S. solfataricus Asd-1 protein possesses the important residues involved in the dinucleotide binding site (Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly, where Xaa is any amino acid) and in the catalytic site (Cys-135, Gln-162, Arg-267, and His-274) of the E. colienzyme, which are conserved also in A. thaliana (24Paris S. Wessel P.M. Dumas R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,25Viola R.E. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The 44-kDa band showed the N-terminal sequence Val-Phe-Pro-Phe-Lys-Ser-Leu-Glu-Asp-Phe-Lys-Val-Glu-Ile-Thr-Gln-Asp, which identifies it as acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (NCBI accession number AAK42872, coded by acd-5), a protein of 397 amino acids. It shows homology to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases from all three life domains. It is known that different dehydrogenases and especially eukaryotic GAPDH can bind RNA (2Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Sioud M. Jespersen L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and that an RNA binding and cleaving enzyme from spinach shows homology to dehydrogenases (14Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This prompted us to clone the Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins from S. solfataricus to test their capability to degrade RNA. They were overexpressed and purified from E. coli as His6-tagged proteins (Fig. 1 B). No cleavage of the N26 transcript by either protein or by a combination of both proteins was observed in reaction mixtures, which always contained 10 mmMgCl2 and were incubated at various temperatures ranging from 37 °C to 80 °C (not shown). Interestingly, they showed identical cleavage pattern in absence of MgCl2. The generated cleavage pattern was different from those produced by the original S. solfataricus protein fractions at 10 mm MgCl2 or by E. coli RNase III (Fig. 1 C). The original S. solfataricus fractions were also able to cleave N26 in absence of MgCl2 generating a degradation pattern identical to that produced by the His6-tagged proteins under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 1 C). This result demonstrates that the RNase activities, which cleave N26 without addition of MgCl2, were present in the S. solfataricus protein fractions and are not artifacts due to the purification of the overexpressed proteins from E. coli. In the absence of MgCl2, the two His6-tagged proteins and the original S. solfataricus protein fractions degraded different transcripts derived from 23 S rRNA of α-proteobacteria, generating identical cleavage patterns with temperature optimum of 60 °C (Fig. 2,A and B). The 23 S rRNA-derived transcripts are highly structured, double-stranded RNAs (21Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4719-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the original protein fractions as well as the cloned proteins could not cleave these transcripts endonucleolytically at 10 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the N26 transcript was specifically cleaved at 10 mm MgCl2 by theS. solfataricus protein fractions (Fig. 1 C) with temperature optimum of 80 °C (not shown). These observations suggest that distinct RNase activities were copurified in the protein fractions from S. solfataricus. We further characterized the RNase properties of the cloned Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins. We decided to include in our studies rabbit muscle GAPDH (Sigma) as a control protein known to be a dehydrogenase capable of binding RNA (3Sioud M. Jespersen L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To our surprise, GAPDH degraded different transcripts derived from 23 S rRNA of α-proteobacteria, generating cleavage patterns very similar to those produced by the cloned Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins and by the original S. solfataricus fractions in absence of MgCl2 (Fig. 2). Incubation of these transcripts with BSA or lactate dehydrogenase led to negligible RNA degradation, whereas GAPDH and the Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins performed strong RNA cleavage (Fig. 2 A). The RNase activity of all three proteins was higher at 60 °C than at 37 °C (Fig. 2 A). Surprisingly, the Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins cleaved RNA more efficiently at 60 °C than at 80 °C. As expected, GAPDH did not cleave RNA at 80 °C (Fig. 2 B). All three proteins cleaved efficiently RNA at MgCl2 concentrations up to 5 mm (not shown). We also tested whether highly purified bacterial GAPDH isolated fromE. coli or B. stearothermophilus can cleave RNA. The bacterial enzymes processed a transcript derived from 23 S rRNA ofRhizobium leguminosarum and generated a cleavage pattern identical to the cleavage patterns produced by the Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins (Fig. 2 C). The assays shown in Fig. 2 were performed for 10 min with an excess of proteins. We also performed assays with decreasing enzyme concentrations. The cloned Asd-1 protein cleaved 90% of a transcript derived from 23 S rRNA of Bartonella henselae, which was present in a 20-fold higher concentration than the enzyme during 4 h of incubation at 60 °C (not shown). Thus, Asd-1 can slowly perform turnover of the RNA substrate. The same applies for the Acd-5 protein. In contrast, we did not observe turnover using GAPDH (not shown), suggesting that GAPDH is not released from the cleaved substrate. It has been demonstrated previously that the NAD-binding site of GAPDH (Rossmann fold) is part of the RNA-binding region. In accordance with this assumption, 50 μm ATP, 10 μmNAD+, and 10 μm NADH strongly interfere with RNA binding (2Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, ATP, NADH, and NADPH in concentrations up to 200 μm did not interfere with the RNA degradation promoted by GAPDH and the two archaeal proteins (not shown). Higher ATP concentrations (0.5-2 mm) inhibited RNA cleavage by all three proteins (for GAPDH see Fig.3 A), which may be due to subunit dissociation (26Malhotra O.P. Prabhakar P. Sen Gupta T. Kayastha A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is known that GAPDH can bind tRNA and ssDNA (1Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 259: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 11Morgenegg G. Winkler G.C. Hubscher U. Heizmann C.W. Mous J. Kuenzle C.C. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We tested whether tRNA and DNA interfere with the RNA degradation mediated by GAPDH and the two archaeal proteins. We obtained identical results for all three proteins. In Fig. 3, A and B we show the data for GAPDH. In the presence of tRNA and ssDNA, the cleavage of the transcripts was reduced (Fig. 3 A). All three proteins did not cleave the competitive ssDNA (not shown). Addition of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) did not interfere with RNA degradation (Fig.3 A), suggesting that GAPDH and the Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins bind ssDNA but not dsDNA. To analyze the possibility that the observed RNase activity is due to a minor contaminant protein in the commercially obtained GAPDH fraction, we used the RNase A specific inhibitor RNasin, which efficiently stopped the RNA degradation (Fig. 3 A). The RNase activity of both archaeal proteins was also blocked by RNasin (not shown). In addition, boiled and spontaneously renatured GAPDH fractions still exhibited strong RNase activity, a feature characteristic for RNase A (Fig. 3 A). We compared the RNA cleavage patterns produced by suitable dilutions of pure RNase A and by the dehydrogenases. Femtomolar concentrations of RNase A and nanomolar concentrations of GAPDH generated identical cleavage patterns that were slightly different from those produced by the Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins when the N26 substrate was used (Fig. 3 B). However, the activity of RNase A can be distinguished from the RNA degradation by dehydrogenases by addition of tRNA or ssDNA. Whereas the presence of tRNA or ssDNA inhibits the degradation of the N26 transcript by the dehydrogenases (Fig. 3 A, and lanes 3-17 of B), the RNA cleavage by RNase A was enhanced under these conditions (Fig. 3 B, lanes 18-32). To avoid the possibility that the excess of GAPDH changes the behavior of contaminant RNase A in the commercially obtained GAPDH fraction, we added pure RNase A in femtomolar concentration to GAPDH in nanomolar concentration and studied the influence of ssDNA addition on the RNA cleavage (Fig. 3 B,lanes 33-38). Under these conditions, RNase A still efficiently cleaved RNA, suggesting that the RNase activity of GAPDH is similar to but distinct from that of RNase A. An additional experiment was performed to confirm this assumption. The fractions containing the rabbit muscle GAPDH and Asd-1 proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE. The polypeptides were electroeluted, subjected to denaturation and refolding in solution, and incubated with the N26 transcript to test their RNase activity. Fig. 3 Cdemonstrates that the RNase activity is an intrinsic property of the GAPDH and Asd-1 polypeptides. In addition to the capability to degrade RNA, the two polypeptides retained their slightly different specificity, producing different cleavage patterns. RNase A is a single strand-specific RNase that preferentially cleaves 3′ to pyrimidine residues (27Moussaoui M. Guasch A. Boix E. Cuchillo C. Nogues M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4687-4692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine the cleavage specificity of rabbit muscle GAPDH and the Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins, primer extension analysis was performed (Fig.4). All three proteins were found to cleave between pyrimidine and adenine residues. The Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins cleaved between C and A, whereas GAPDH cleaved in addition between U and A. The most prominent cleavage sites were localized in loops and bulges of the predicted secondary structure (Fig. 4). In accordance with the above presented data, the cleavage positions determined for GAPDH were similar to those used by RNase A. Although the dehydrogenases studied here exhibit strong RNase activity, their primary amino acid sequences do not show significant similarities to any nuclease in the data bases. We performed deletion mutagenesis to localize the Asd-1 domain required for the RNase activity. We were able to overexpress and purify His6-tagged polypeptides consisting of the N-terminal 73 amino acids (comprising the putative first mononucleotide binding domain of the Rossmann fold), the N-terminal 205 amino acids (comprising the complete Rossmann fold), and the C-terminal 145 amino acids of Asd-1 (Fig. 5, A andB). The RNase activity is associated with the N-terminal 73 amino acids as shown by cleavage assays using the N26 substrate in Fig.5 C. We found that the well known metabolic enzyme GAPDH and the Asd-1 and Acd-5 proteins of S. solfataricus cleave RNA. This is the first report describing RNA degradation by dehydrogenases. Keeping in mind that the Asd-1 protein can perform turnover of the RNA substrate (this study), and that GAPDH specifically interacts with different RNAs in vivo (4De B.P. Gupta S. Zhao H. Drazba J.A. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24728-24735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Lin S.S. Chang S.C. Wang Y.H. Sun C.Y. Chang M.F. Virology. 2000; 271: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Yi M. Schultz D.E. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6459-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we think that RNA cleavage by GAPDH and dehydrogenase-like proteins should have physiological relevance. Since GAPDH was identified repeatedly as a major RNA-binding protein, it was proposed that this key metabolic enzyme may function in the tRNA transport (1Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 259: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) as RNA chaperone (3Sioud M. Jespersen L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or as regulatory protein binding to viral and cellular non-coding RNA regions (2Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 4De B.P. Gupta S. Zhao H. Drazba J.A. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol.

Virol. 2000; 74: 6459-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our finding that GAPDH cleaves RNA leads to different interpretation of some of the existing data. For example, it was demonstrated that GAPDH suppresses in vivo the translation of Hepatitis A virus proteins (9Yi M. Schultz D.E. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6459-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Additionally to the proposed suppression mechanism based on GAPDH binding to the internal ribosome entry site, GAPDH may work against viral propagation by RNA cleavage. Similarly, GAPDH may participate in eukaryotic mRNA turnover not only by binding to AU-rich elements of 3′-untranslated mRNA regions (2Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) but also by cleaving. We localized the RNase active center of the Asd-1 protein in the 73 N-terminal amino acids. The first 50 N-terminal amino acids harbor the putative first mononucleotide binding domain of the Rossmann fold. Nevertheless, the presence of 50–200 μm ATP had no influence on RNA cleavage by the Asd-1 protein. The NAD-binding fold was identified as a part of the RNA binding domain of GAPDH (2Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 13Nagy E. Henics T. Eckert M. Miseta A. Lightowlers R.N. Kellermayer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the presence of NADH, NADPH, and ATP at concentrations up to 200 μm did not have any influence on RNA cleavage by rabbit muscle GAPDH, whereas the presence of ssDNA inhibits the cleavage reaction. These results suggest that amino acids different from those involved in dinucleotide or mononucleotide binding are responsible for the RNase activity of GAPDH. Obviously, the RNase active center is blocked by ssDNA binding but not by mono- or dinucleotides. The RNA cleavage domain of rabbit muscle GAPDH seems to be more thermostable than its metabolic active site since GAPDH can cleave RNA at 60 °C, a temperature at which its metabolic catalytic site is already denatured (28Lin Y.Z. Liang S.J. Zhou J.M. Tsou C.L. Wu P.Q. Zhou Z.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is known that different protein domains may possess different thermal stabilities. Even domains of mesophilic enzymes can be active at temperatures up to 100 °C (29James C.L. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3720-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fact that dehydrogenases and dehydrogenase-like proteins from all three domains of life cleave RNA supports the hypothesis that dehydrogenases and RNases have a common evolutionary origin (14Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and suggests that the common protein ancestor was present in all three lineages. Multifunctional proteins may be the key to build the highly complex networks that maintain the functions and structures in the eukaryotic cells possessing relatively low number of protein-encoding genes (30Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10372) Google Scholar). It emerges that the networks of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acids interactions are much more complicated than it was assumed. Proteins that were originally characterized to have one defined metabolic function are shown now to participate in a number of other cellular processes. Examples for such eukaryotic multifunctional proteins are the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH and rabbit phosphoglucose isomerase (31Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 32Jeffery C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 8-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). There are also examples for prokaryotic multifunctional glycolytic enzymes: the bacterial enolase is a component of the E. coli RNA-degrading complex called degradosome (33Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Our finding that archaeal proteins, which are most probably dehydrogenases, cleave RNA supports the view that multifunctionality may be a common feature of proteins in all three domains of life. We are grateful to S. Boschi-Muller (Université Henri Poincare, Nancy, France) for sending us highly purified bacterial GAPDH. We thank R. Samorski, P. Walter (University of Giessen), and B.

https://openalex.org/W1994257198,"Different activation mechanisms of glycoprotein hormone receptors, which are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, have been proposed. For example, the large ectodomain of glycoprotein hormone receptors may function as an inverse agonist keeping the transmembrane domain in an inactive conformation. To provide support for this hypothesis, we have generated different lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHR) constructs lacking the ectodomain. Although some ectodomain-deficient LHR constructs were targeted to the cell surface, cAMP levels remained unchanged under basal conditions and agonist application but could be increased by a mutation within the transmembrane domain 6 (D578H). Taking advantage of a constitutive activating mutation (S277N) located in the extracellular domain, we showed that the intact leucine-rich repeat-containing ectodomain is essential for constitutive activation of the LHR by mutation of the hinge region. Our findings support an activation scenario in which agonist binding or mutational alterations expose a structure within the ectodomain, which then activates the transmembrane core.

Our findings support an activation scenario in which agonist binding or mutational alterations expose a structure within the ectodomain, which then activates the transmembrane core. The biological actions of lutropin/choriogonadotropin are mediated by their interaction with a specific cell membrane receptor that belongs to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 1The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeat; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; hCG, human choriogonadotropin; IP, inositol phosphate; LHR, lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor; TSHR, thyrotropin receptor; TMD, transmembrane domain; V2R, V2 vasopressin receptor; wt, wild-type; HA, hemagglutinin; M3R, M3 muscarinic receptor; TM, transmembrane; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein -containing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a group of at least seven structurally related mammalian receptors (1Hsu S.Y. Kudo M. Chen T. Nakabayashi K. Bhalla A. van der Spek P.J. van Duin M. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1257-1271Google Scholar). Upon agonist activation, the lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHR) activates the Gs/adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C pathways. The structure of glycoprotein hormone receptors is predicted to consist of a large extracellular hormone binding domain connected to a transmembrane core that shares a common molecular architecture with other GPCRs of family 1 (2Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Gudermann T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 143-227Google Scholar). The ectodomain of the LHR is composed of nine LRRs that are thought to form a horseshoe-like structure (3Bhowmick N. Huang J. Puett D. Isaacs N.W. Lapthorn A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1147-1159Google Scholar). The transmembrane core assembles from seven mostly α-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs1–7) that are connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops. In the LHR, a tightly packed hydrophobic cluster and a specific H-bonding network formed between the TMDs is thought to maintain the inactive receptor conformation (4Lin Z. Shenker A. Pearlstein R. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 501-510Google Scholar). To date, a large number of activating mutations within the TMDs of glycoprotein hormone receptors has been identified, and it has been proposed that receptor activation is associated with the disruption of key inter- and intrahelical side-chain interactions (5Schulz A. Bruns K. Henklein P. Krause G. Schubert M. Gudermann T. Wray V. Schultz G. Schöneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37860-37869Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of glycoprotein hormone receptor activation by their agonists is still unknown. Several mechanisms of glycoprotein hormone receptor activation have been proposed. First, the glycoprotein hormone binds to the extracellular domain, and distinct portions of the hormone act as agonist on the transmembrane receptor core. This mechanism is supported by studies showing that human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and peptides derived from the hCG α-chain can directly activate an LHR mutant that lacks the ectodomain (6Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13076-13079Google Scholar, 7Kundu G.C. Ji I. McCormick D.J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11063-11066Google Scholar). Second, the ectodomain of glycoprotein hormone receptors functions as an inverse agonist keeping the TMD region in an inactive conformation. This model is supported by recent findings indicating that deletion of the ectodomain of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) increases its constitutive activity (8Zhang M. Tong K.P. Fremont V. Chen J. Narayan P. Puett D. Weintraub B.D. Szkudlinski M.W. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3514-3517Google Scholar). Hormone binding and activating mutations within the ectodomain (9Grüters A. Schöneberg T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3451-3458Google Scholar) may induce the disruption of the ectodomain-TMD core interaction. The latter findings are consistent with the activation mechanism proposed by Szkudlinski and co-workers (8Zhang M. Tong K.P. Fremont V. Chen J. Narayan P. Puett D. Weintraub B.D. Szkudlinski M.W. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3514-3517Google Scholar) but also implicate a third scenario of receptor activation in which an agonistic structure within the ectodomain is exposed to the TMD core following hormone binding or mutational alteration. To provide support for one of these hypotheses, we experimentally addressed all three mechanisms by site-directed mutagenesis approaches. Although some LHR constructs lacking the ectodomain were targeted to the cell surface, cAMP levels remained unchanged under basal conditions and high concentrations of the agonist. Our data provide no support for an activation scenario in which the non-liganded ectodomain of the LHR stabilizes an inactive receptor conformation. The fact that a mutation within the ectodomain of the LHR (S277N) constitutively activates the receptor only in the presence of the N-terminally located nine LRRs implicates an activation model in which distinct determinants of the ectodomain participate directly at least in the mutationally induced receptor activation. Systematic deletion of all extracellular LRRs within the constitutive active receptor (S277N) was utilized to identify domains in the ectodomain participating in receptor activation. The study provides evidence for a cooperative model of the single LRR and other N-terminal portions in forming the global ectodomain structure that is required for proper cell surface targeting and probably for mutational receptor activation. LHR mutations (see Fig. 1 and Table I) were introduced into LHR-pcDps (12Schulz A. Schöneberg T. Paschke R. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 181-190Google Scholar), a mammalian expression vector containing the entire coding sequence of the human LHR, using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and restriction fragment replacement strategy (13Higuchi R. Ehrlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Google Scholar). For generation of S277N and LHR deletion mutants, PCR fragments containing the mutations were digested withBglII and Bsu36I and used to replace the corresponding fragments in LHR-pcDps. The D578H mutation was introduced into LHR-pcDps via BstBI and SpeI.Table IDescription of the LHR constructs used in this studyConstructDeleted amino acid residues in the LHRLHR amino acid residues in the constructV2R amino acid residues in the constructHA tagFlag tagOther modificationsLHR (wt)−1–699−++−S277N−1–699−++S277ND578H−1–699−++D578HM3LHR1–360361–6991–66aAmino acid residues 1–66 of the rat M3muscarinic receptor.++−V2LHR1–360361–6991–40++−V2LHRD578H1–360361–6991–40++D578HΔecto28–3581–27; 359–699−−−−Δecto D578H28–3581–27; 359–699−−−D578HHA-Δecto28–3581–27; 359–699−++−HA-Δecto D578H28–3581–27; 359–699−++D578HΔ0–10S277N29–2751–28; 276–699−++S277NΔ0–10S277N/D578H29–2751–28; 276–699−++S277N; D578HΔ0–9S277N29–2671–28; 268–699−++S277NΔ0–9S277N/D578H29–2671–28; 268–699−++S277N; D578HΔ0–7S277N29–2231–28; 224–699−++S277NΔ0–7S277N/D578H29–2231–28; 224–699−++S277N; D578HΔTMD1–2364–4391–363; 440–699−++−ΔTMD1–4364–5241–363; 525–699−++−S277NΔTMD1–2364–4391–363; 440–699−++S277NS277NΔTMD1–4364–5241–363; 525–699−++S277NΔTMD1–2D578H364–4391–363; 440–699−++D578HΔTMD1–4D578H364–5241–363; 525–699−++D578HV2ΔTMD1–21–439440–6991–40++−V2ΔTMD1–41–524525–6991–40++−V2ΔTMD1–2D578H1–439440–6991–40++D578HV2ΔTMD1–4D578H1–524525–6991–40++D578HTMD1-V2Cterm388–6991–387327–371+−−TMD1-LHRCterm388–6271–387; 628–699−++−S277N/TMD1-V2Cterm388–6991–387327–371+−S277NS277N/TMD1-LHRCterm388–6271–387; 628–699−++S277NΔ1S277N51–741–50; 75–699−++S277NΔ2S277N75–991–74; 100–699−++S277NΔ3S277N100–1251–99; 126–699−++S277NΔ4S277N126–1491–125; 150–699−++S277NΔ5S277N150–1751–149; 176–699−++S277NΔ6S277N176–1981–175; 199–699−++S277NΔ7S277N199–2231–198; 224–699−++S277NΔ8S277N224–2451–223; 246–699−++S277NΔ9S277N246–2671–245; 268–699−++S277NΔ10S277N268–2751–267; 276–699−++S277NVarious LHR mutants and V2R LHR chimeras were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The construct designation and the exact amino acid positions that were deleted or present in the receptor constructs are outlined (see also Fig. 1).

The HA-tagged V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) and M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R)/LHR chimeras were constructed using the V2R and M3R cDNAs as template (14Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1292Google Scholar), and a fragment replacement via BglII (for V2R) or HindIII (for M3R) and Bsu36I was performed with the LHR-pcDps vector. An overlapping PCR-strategy and the restriction sitesBsu36I and DraIII were utilized to generate ΔTM1–2 and ΔTM1–4. The N terminus of V2R was ligated into the latter constructs using BglII andBsu36I. To generate the TMD1-LHRCterm and TMD1-V2Cterm constructs, a silent mutation (codon position 386; ACA to ACT) that produces a new SpeI site was introduced into the wild-type (wt) LHR plasmid. Then, PCR-derived fragments were inserted using the new SpeI site and theSpeI site in the 3′ polylinker region. To allow for immunological detection, wt and mutant LHRs were tagged with an N-terminal nine-amino acid residue epitope (YPYDVPDYA) derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein (HA tag) after the signal peptide. In addition, constructs were tagged with a C-terminal eight-amino acid residue epitope (DYKDDDDK) (FLAG-tag) upstream of the termination codon. The identity of the various constructs and the correctness of all PCR-derived sequences were confirmed by restriction analysis and dideoxy sequencing with thermosequenase and dye-labeled terminator chemistry (Amersham Biosciences). As tested in ligand binding and cAMP studies (see below), HA and FLAG epitopes did not interfere significantly with LHR ligand binding or signal transduction.125I-hCG displacement studies showed no significant differences in the affinity (LHR IC50 = 0.66 nm; double-tagged LHR IC50 = 0.53 nm), but epitope tagging resulted in a slight increase (53 ± 1%) in receptor cell surface expression as measured by125I-hCG saturation binding studies. The EC50values were 0.4 and 0.3 nm for the LHR and the double-tagged version of the LHR, respectively. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. For functional assays, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). cAMP accumulation assays were performed in 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well), and cells were transfected with a total amount of 1 μg of plasmid DNA/well and 2.5 μl of LipofectAMINE/well. After 48 h cells were prelabeled with 2 μCi/ml of 3H-adenine (31.7 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated overnight. For cAMP assays, transfected cells were washed once in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), followed by incubation in the presence of the indicated concentrations of hCG (3000 IE/mg, Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. In addition to the hCG from Sigma, hCG fromCalbiochem (3850 IE/mg) and Schering (5300 IE/mg; Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) was used in initial cAMP assays with the V2LHR construct. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition of 1 ml of 5% trichloric acid. The cAMP content of cell extracts was determined after chromatography as described (15Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Google Scholar). To measure inositol phosphate (IP) formation, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml of myo-3H-inositol (18.6 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 18 h. Thereafter, cells were washed once with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl. Agonist-induced increases in intracellular IP levels were determined by anion-exchange chromatography as described (16Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Google Scholar). For radioligand binding studies, cells were harvested 72 h after transfection (10 μg of plasmid DNA/100-mm dish), and displacement and saturation binding assays were performed using membrane homogenates.125I-hCG saturation binding studies (125I-hCG 1800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were carried out for 2 h at 22 °C as described (12Schulz A. Schöneberg T. Paschke R. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 181-190Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 5 μm hCG. TheK d value for the human LHR transiently expressed in COS-7 cells was 2.4 nm. To estimate cell surface expression of receptors carrying an N-terminal HA tag, we used an indirect cellular ELISA (17Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Google Scholar), further referred to as surface ELISA. Briefly, COS-7 cells were seeded into 48-well plates, transfected (0.25 μg of DNA and 0.6 μl of LipofectAMINE/well), formaldehyde-fixed without disrupting the cell membrane, and incubated with a biotin-labeled anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Bound anti-HA antibody was then detected with the help of a peroxidase-labeled streptavidin conjugate (Sigma). After removal of excess unbound conjugate, H2O2 andO-phenylenediamine (2.5 mm each in 0.1m phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0) were added to serve as substrate and chromogen, respectively. After 15 min the enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mH2SO4 containing 0.05 mNa2SO3, and color development was measured bichromatically at 492 and 620 nm using an ELISA reader (Titertek Multiskan MCC/340; Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA). To further assess the amounts of full-length HA- and FLAG-tagged receptor constructs, a previously developed sandwich ELISA was used (17Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Google Scholar). In brief, transfected cells (5 μg of DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE/60-mm dish) were harvested, and membrane preparations were solubilized under continuous rotation in lysis buffer overnight. Microtiter plates were coated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml in borate buffer, pH 8.0; Sigma). After incubation with the membrane solubilisates, bound HA-tagged receptors were detected with the combination of a biotin-labeled anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a peroxidase-labeled streptavidin conjugate. Color reaction and measurements were performed as described for the surface ELISA. Immunofluorescence studies were carried out to examine the subcellular distribution of the wt and mutant LHRs. COS-7 cells were transferred into 6-well plates containing sterilized glass cover slips and transfected. Approximately 48 h later, cells were fixed and probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (10 μg 12CA5/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). To detect intracellularly retained receptors, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence images were obtained with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss). It is well established that the ectodomain of glycoprotein hormone receptors binds the hormone, and the TMD region mediates signal transduction. Recent studies suggest that the ectodomain of some glycoprotein hormone receptors acts as inverse agonist (8Zhang M. Tong K.P. Fremont V. Chen J. Narayan P. Puett D. Weintraub B.D. Szkudlinski M.W. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3514-3517Google Scholar, 18Nishi S. Nakabayashi K. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3958-3964Google Scholar). In initial studies, we expressed an LHR construct (Δecto) that completely lacks the ectodomain (see Fig.1 and TableI). Functional analysis of Δecto in transiently transfected COS-7 cells revealed no basal or agonist-induced activity even at 10 μm hCG (TableII). To test whether Δecto can be activated mutationally we introduced a missense mutation (D578H) into TMD6 (Δecto D578H), which is known to induce strong constitutive activity of the wt LHR (19Liu G. Duranteau L. Carel J.C. Monroe J. Doyle D.A. Shenker A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1731-1736Google Scholar). However, no increase in basal activity was observed (see Table II). We next asked whether Δecto is properly delivered to the cell surface. By introducing the N-terminal epitope tag we demonstrated in a cell surface ELISA that none of the constructs (Δecto, Δecto D578H) were efficiently transported to the plasma membrane (see Table II).Table IIFunctional characterization of ectodomain and TMD deletion mutantsTransfected constructcAMPIPA492 nmBasal cAMP-levelsIncrease in cAMP levelsBasal IP levelsIncrease in IP levelsSurface ELISASanswich ELISA-fold over wt basal-fold over wt basal% wtLHR (wt)123.8 ± 4.918.8 ± 1.8100100S277N3.2 ± 1.121.6 ± 8.81.0 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.2132 ± 1799 ± 9D578H13.7 ± 3.115.4 ± 2.76.2 ± 2.010.8 ± 3.5406 ± 6283 ± 23V2LHR0.9 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.2*0.9 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.167 ± 14149 ± 36V2LHRD578H10.7 ± 1.910.4 ± 1.71.8 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.3159 ± 24117 ± 27M3LHR0.8 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.2*90 ± 12118 ± 8Δecto0.7 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.2*Δecto D578H0.8 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1*HA-Δecto0.8 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.2*27 ± 4NDHA-Δecto D578H1.0 ± 0.31.0 ± 0.3*32 ± 6NDΔ0–10S277N0.6 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.177 ± 15NDΔ0–10S277N/D578H6.1 ± 1.76.3 ± 1.5200 ± 11NDΔ0–9S277N0.8 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.139 ± 16NDΔ0–9S277N/D578H3.1 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.279 ± 11NDΔ0–7S277N0.8 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.140 ± 10NDΔ0–7S277N/D578H1.8 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.187 ± 13NDΔTMD1–20.5 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.325 ± 1492 ± 7ΔTMD1–40.7 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.242 ± 21184 ± 43S277NΔTMD1–20.7 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.234 ± 24115 ± 4S277NΔTMD1–40.9 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.216 ± 1291 ± 13ΔTMD1–2D578H0.7 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.122 ± 14109 ± 12ΔTMD1–4D578H0.8 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.119 ± 17108 ± 19V2ΔTMD1–20.7 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.282 ± 37177 ± 16V2ΔTMD1–40.8 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.332 ± 15205 ± 42V2ΔTMD1–2D578H0.7 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.2201 ± 23199 ± 43V2ΔTMD1–4D578H0.8 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.291 ± 22215 ± 56COS-7 cells were transfected with various LHR mutants. Functional assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” cAMP and IP levels are expressed as -fold over basal cAMP levels of wt LHR (cAMP, 356 ± 134 cpm/well; IP, 490 ± 331 cpm/well). Increases in cAMP and IP were determined after stimulation with 100 nm hCG (* indicates 10 μm hCG). Expression of receptors were measured by ELISAs (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Data are presented as means ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate (cAMP and IP assays) or quadruplicate (ELISAs). ND, not determined. To circumvent the problem of poor plasma membrane expression, we replaced the LHR ectodomain with the N terminus of the V2R to assure cell surface targeting (see Fig. 1). For quantification of the receptor expression, all receptor constructs contained an artificial N-terminal HA epitope. Additionally, the C terminus of the LHR constructs was tagged with a FLAG epitope. COS-7 cells were transfected with the V2LHR chimera, and cell surface expression was compared with the HA-tagged version of the wt LHR (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in cell surface ELISA (see Table II) and in immunofluorescence studies (see Fig. 3), V2LHR was expressed at high levels at the plasma membrane and displayed an even higher total cellular expression than the wt LHR (see Table II). However, functional analysis of V2LHR revealed neither elevated basal nor agonist-stimulated cAMP levels (Fig. 2) even when different preparations of hCG (Calbiochem, Schering, Sigma) and concentrations up to 10 μm hCG were applied.Figure 2Structural requirements for LHR activation. COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type or different mutant LHRs were studied in cAMP assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Basal and agonist-induced cAMP formation are expressed as -fold over basal cAMP levels of the wt LHR (see TableII). Data are presented as means ± S.E. of three to four independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Introduction of D578H into the V2LHR chimera resulted in a pronounced constitutive activity in the cAMP (see Fig. 2) and the IP signal transduction pathways, indicating a properly folded transmembrane core (see Table II). Interestingly, the D578H mutation drastically increased cell surface expression levels of both the wt LHR and the V2LHR chimera (see Table II). To exclude the possibility that the V2R N terminus somehow interferes with hCG binding to the TMD core we replaced the LHR ectodomain with the N terminus of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor (M3LHR). Similar to the V2LHR chimera, M3LHR was transported to the cell surface but displayed no basal or agonist induced activity in the cAMP assay (see Table II). Taken together, these data suggest that the ectodomain of the LHR does not act as an inverse agonist on the TMD core. The functional folding and stabilization of the TMD core occurs independently from the extracellular domain. Further, we found no evidence for a direct agonistic action of the hormone at the TMD core. Studies with the CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokine receptors have challenged the established view that an intact TMD core containing all seven TMDs is essentially required for GPCR signaling (20Ling K. Wang P. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Cheng Z.J. Wu G.X. Hu W. Ma L. Pei G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7922-7927Google Scholar). We addressed this issue by fusing the LHR N terminus to the N termini of TMDs 3 and 5 (ΔTM1–2, ΔTM1–4). Additionally, two activating mutations, one in the ectodomain (S277N) and one in TMD6 (D578H), were introduced in either deletion mutant (S277NΔTM1–2, S277NΔTM1–4, ΔTM1–2D578H, ΔTM1–4D578H). Unfortunately, all six receptor constructs were poorly delivered to the cells surface, making the interpretation of the unchanged basal and agonist-induced cAMP levels difficult (see Table II). As shown above, the V2R N terminus was able to target the TMD core of the LHR to the plasma membrane efficiently without affecting its signal transduction abilities. Therefore, we used a similar approach to examine whether a TMD core containing less than seven TMDs is able to mediate mutation-induced signal transduction. Thus, the V2R N terminus was fused to N-terminally truncated LHRs with or without the D578H mutation (V2ΔTM1–2, V2ΔTM1–4, V2ΔTM1–2D578H, V2ΔTM1–4D578H). As shown in Table II, none of the chimeras displayed any increase in basal or hCG-induced cAMP levels despite high cell surface expression levels. Our data are indicative that the entire TMD core is required for LHR signal transduction via Gs. Missense and deletion mutations within the extracellular portion of glycoprotein hormone receptors can induce agonist-independent receptor activation by a currently unknown mechanism (9Grüters A. Schöneberg T. Biebermann H. Krude H. Krohn H.P. Dralle H. Gudermann T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1431-1436Google Scholar, 10Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol.

Understanding the structural changes induced by such mutations can help to clarify the molecular basis of LHR activation. To study whether the LRR-containing region of the LHR ectodomain is required for mutational induction of agonist-independent receptor activation, an S277N construct (Δ0–10S277N) was generated in which all LRRs were deleted. In Δ0–10S277N the signal peptide followed by the HA tag was linked directly to amino acid position 276. As measured with the cell surface ELISA, Δ0–10S277N was expressed at high levels (71% of wt LHR expression) at the plasma membrane of transiently transfected COS-7 cells (see Table II). Next, cAMP levels of Δ0–10S277N-transfected COS-7 cells were determined. No constitutive basal or agonist-induced receptor activation was observed (see Fig. 2and Table II). To verify the signal transduction abilities of Δ0–10S277N, an additional constitutively activating mutation (D578H) was introduced. Δ0–10S277N/D578H-transfected cells displayed a 6-fold elevation of basal cAMP levels (see Fig. 2 and Table II). These data indicate that the amino acid sequence between position 29 and 275 is required for receptor activation by S277N and that deletion of all LRRs does not interfere with proper trafficking and functional folding of the TMD core. Interestingly, further N-terminal extension of Δ0–10S277N as made in Δ0–9S277N and Δ0–7S277N reduces cell surface expression levels and, therefore, the mutational activation by D578H (see Table II). Next, we asked whether a covalent interaction between the ectodomain and the TMD receptor portion is necessary to transduce the conformational changes of an activating mutation located in the extracellular domain (S277N) to the TMD core for G-protein coupling. It has been demonstrated that the LHR ectodomain fused to a transmembrane anchor forms a functional complex with the TMD receptor portion when coexpressed (22Osuga Y. Hayashi M. Kudo M. Conti M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25006-25012Google Scholar).

Segment-1-bound and cross-linked actin oligomers containing either two or three actin subunits were purified and shown to nucleate actin assembly. Kinetic assembly data from mixtures of monomeric actin and the actin oligomers fit a nucleation model where cross-linked actin dimer or trimer reacts with an actin monomer to produce a competent nucleus for filament assembly. We report the three-dimensional structure of the segment-1-actin hexamer containing three actin subunits, each with a tightly bound ATP. Comparative analysis of this structure with twelve other actin structures provides an atomic level explanation for the preferential binding of ATP by the segment-1-complexed actin.

This distortion results from intercalation of segment-1 between actin protomers that increase the rise per subunit and rotate each of the actin subunits relative to their positions in F-actin.

N,N′-1,4-phenylenedismaleimide Arguably the most regulated cytoskeletal protein, filamentous actin (F-actin) is critical for cellular motility and mechanical strength, protein sorting and secretion, signal transduction, and cell division. An atomic resolution understanding of the structure of F-actin is a tantalizing goal. The tendency of monomeric actin to form polymers of varying lengths has prevented crystallization and atomic resolution structural analysis of F-actin. To date, all but one of the atomic resolution structures of actin are of the monomer bound to proteins that prevent polymerization, such as DNaseI (2Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F.

A key component to the dynamic assembly and disassembly of actin filaments is the intrinsic hydrolysis of bound ATP. This hydrolysis promotes the dissociation of actin subunits from filament ends.In vivo, actin assembly and disassembly are regulated tightly by binding proteins that likely respond to changes in F-actin structure accompanying ATP hydrolysis (14De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 293: 616-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Sablin E.P. Dawson J.F. VanLoock M.S. Spudich J.A. Egelman E.H. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We therefore linked successive actin protomers in F-actin. A specific covalent link is formed between Cys-376 and Lys-193 (in this paper, amino acid residue numbers correspond to chicken skeletal α-actin (16French B.A. Bergsma D.J. Schwartz R.J.

However, these actin oligomers form filaments under crystallization conditions and are therefore unsuitable for crystallographic analysis. To block assembly of the purified actin oligomers, we used recombinant segment-1 of gelsolin (GS-1) (21Way M. Gooch J. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G.

Because of its strong actin monomer binding activity (K d = 5 nm) (21Way M. Gooch J. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Way M. Pope B.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), GS-1 was expected to facilitate depolymerization by both sequestering monomeric G-actin and binding to the fast growing barbed end of newly formed F-actin fragments. Here, we show that mixtures of the cross-linked GS-1-bound actin oligomers can be fractionated readily according to their size and crystallized. We report the crystal structure of the GS-1-bound cross-linked actin trimer to 2.2-Å resolution. Although this structure is incompatible with the filament structure proposed by Schutt and co-workers (11Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. FEBS Letts. 1993; 325: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Schutt C.E. Rozycki M.D. Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 12s-18sPubMed Google Scholar), it is topologically similar to the helical model of F-actin of Holmeset al. (1Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). However, the GS-1-bound actin trimer has a distorted symmetry compared with that of the helical model (1Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Our data show that this distortion results from intercalation of GS-1 between actin protomers in the filament. An ability of GS-1 to intercalate between actin protomers and sever actin filaments was suggested by earlier work with chymotryptic segment-1 of gelsolin (25Kwiatkowski D.J. Janmey P.A. Mole J.E. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, subsequent work (26Yin H.L. Iida K. Janmey P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) indicated that the chymotryptic GS-1 samples might been contaminated with a small amount of a longer fragment, containing segments-1–3 of gelsolin, which was responsible for the observed severing activity. Therefore it is commonly believed that GS-1 alone has no severing activity (3McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 27Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the lack of F-actin severing activity of GS-1 has never been verified using homogeneous samples of recombinant GS-1. Combined structural and biochemical data presented and discussed in this work show that segment-1 of gelsolin does indeed sever actin filaments, although the severing activity of GS-1 is significantly lower than that of full-length gelsolin (28Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). GS-1 was purified by fromEscherichia coli by overnight growth and expression in the absence of inducing agents employing pGS1.36 (a generous gift of B. Pope and A. G. Weeds, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge). Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer A (4 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25% sucrose (w/v), 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by two passes through a French Press at 16,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 19,500 rpm in a JA-20 rotor (Beckman) for 20 min. The supernatant was passed through a 20-ml DEAE column equilibrated in Buffer 1 (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the flow-through was loaded immediately onto a 100-ml Affi-Gel Blue column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer 1. This was then developed with a linear gradient of NaCl to 0.5 m in Buffer 1. GS-1 eluted from this column was ∼95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. GS-1 eluted from Affi-Gel Blue was denatured in 6 m urea and dialyzed overnight into 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm CaCl2. The renatured protein was then separated by Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography in Buffer 1 containing 20 mm NaCl. This was stored at −80 °C in Buffer 1 with 20 mm NaCl without concentration for several months without any loss in activity. We typically obtained about 100 mg of purified GS-1 per liter of cell culture. Actin was prepared from chicken muscle as described previously (29Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pyrenyl-actin was prepared as outlined (30Zigmond S.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 237-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was polymerized and cross-linked with pPDM (Aldrich) at a molar ratio of 1.5 pPDM:actin according to published methods (18Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8228-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employing a 25 mm solution of pPDM in DMF. Cross-linked F-actin was then harvested by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 60 min in a Ti60 rotor (Beckman). Purified GS-1 in Buffer 1 with 20 mm NaCl was added to the cross-linked F-actin pellet at a 2:1 molar ratio and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Typically, we employed 100 mg of cross-linked F-actin and depolymerized it with 30 ml of 2.5 mg ml−1 GS-1. The reaction mixture was sedimented at 45,000 rpm for 60 min using a Ti60 rotor (Beckman), and the resulting 30-ml supernatant was applied to a Mono-Q 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). GS-1 bound oligomers of actin eluted from the Mono-Q according to size employing a gradient (0.175 to 0.375 m) of NaCl in Buffer 1. To increase the purity of each oligomer, the gradient was held when each oligomer began to elute. The gradient was held until baseline was achieved after the protein had eluted. Oligomers were characterized using SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (Voyager-DETM; PerSeptive Biosystems). For each oligomer, both an upper and lower cross-linked band is observed with SDS-PAGE, as reported previously (18Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8228-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gilbert H.R. Frieden C. B. B. R. C. 1983; 111: 404-408Google Scholar, 32Millonig R. Salvo H. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The nature of these two species is not clear; however, it is thought that the upper band corresponds to oligomers that are cross-linked between Lys-193 and Cys-376 whereas the lower band may represent cross-linking between Cys-376 of one actin molecule and Cys-376 of another. The GS-1-complexed actin oligomers were then concentrated to ∼12 mg ml−1 employing Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon). The GS-1-complexed actin trimer was used fresh for crystallization experiments. Protein concentrations were determined with Bio-Rad protein dye reagent employing G-actin as the standard. G-actin (15% pyrenyl-G-actin) was polymerized in 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm ATP in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, overnight. To measure the depolymerization of F-actin in the presence of GS-1, various concentrations of GS-1 were added to 2.5 μmF-actin (15% pyrenyl-F-actin), and the fluorescence was monitored in a Aminco Bowman Series 2 fluorimeter with an excitation wavelength of 347 nm and emission wavelength of 407 nm. To avoid photobleaching, a 0° polarizing filter was used for the excitation beam with a 1-nm slit width. All solutions and reagents were equilibrated to 25 °C before assays were performed. 5 mm CaCl2 was added by removing the cuvette from the fluorimeter, mixing, and reinserting the cuvette into the fluorimeter. To measure F-actin polymerization in the presence of GS-1-bound cross-linked actin oligomer, 5 μm G-actin (15% pyrenyl-G-actin) was polymerized in 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm ATP in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and the change in pyrene fluorescence was monitored as described above. All solutions and reagents were equilibrated at 25 °C before assays were performed. Varying concentrations of GS-1-bound cross-linked actin oligomer with polymerization salts were added to the G-actin at the beginning of the assay. This mixture was then placed in the fluorimeter. As a result, the start time of the reaction and the start time of data collection are offset slightly. This difference was taken in account when computer simulations were performed. The concentration of GS-1-complexed actin oligomers was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay employing the molecular mass of the whole complex (118 kDa for the dimer and 178 kDa for the trimer). The concentration of F-actin is reported as the concentration of total actin monomer rather than the concentration of F-actin ends. The experimentally measured pyrene fluorescence was converted to F-actin concentration (μm) using Equation 1. [(F(t)−Fmin)/(Fmax−Fmin)]×5μMEquation 1 In the equation, F max was the steady-state fluorescence obtained from control actin polymerization reactions employing F-actin as nuclei, F min was the minimum fluorescence measured in control reactions of spontaneous nucleation, and F(t) was the fluorescence at any time, t, of an experiment. As discussed in the text, the kinetic and structural data are consistent with actin assembly from the pointed ends of the cross-linked actin oligomers. Therefore, we employed the published polymerization rate constants for ATP-actin at the pointed end of 1 μm−1s−1 and 0.5 s−1 for the k + andk −, respectively (33Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J.C. Sheterline P. Protein Profile: Actin. 4th Ed. Academic Press, London1998: 13-22Google Scholar). The model involves the formation of a nucleus by the binding of an actin monomer to the pointed end of a GS-1-bound cross-linked actin oligomer. In this case, active nuclei, N*, are in equilibrium with cross-linked actin, N, and G-actin, A, with a forward rate constant, k 1, and a backwards rate constant, k 2. N+A↔N*Equation 2 G-actin then assembles from the nuclei, N*, with the knownk + and k − for the pointed end, to form the mass of F-actin, M.N*+A↔MEquation 3 We assume that spontaneous nucleation is insignificant when X-actin is added to the assembly reactions. Because the total concentration of filaments assembled is equal to the concentration of nuclei formed, assembly of filaments can be described as a function of the concentration of N* (34Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein. Academic Press, London1975: 47-51Google Scholar). We chose to include the contribution of the concentration of nuclei, N*, into the concentration of actin filaments, M, because the addition of actin monomer to X-actin may contribute to the increase in pyrene signal accompanying F-actin assembly. However, the contribution of N* to M is insignificant in the best-fit simulations, and almost identical curves are generated without including N* in M. We fit the following equations to the experimental data.d/dt(N*)=k1[N][A]−k2[N*]Equation 4 d/dt(N)=k2[N*]−k1[N][A]Equation 5 d/dt(A)=−k+[A][N*]+k−[N*]+k2[N*]−k1[N][A]Equation 6 d/dt(M)=k+[A][N*]−k−[N*]+k1[N][A]−k2[N*]Equation 7 Best-fit curves were generated using Berkeley Madonna software (www.berkeleymadonna.com) by varying the initial G-actin concentration, A, the rate constants k 1 andk 2 and by fitting the start time,t 0. The average best-fitk 1 values were 1.6 × 10−4μm−1s−1 ± 3.9% (S.E.;n = 7) and 2.7 × 10−4μm−1s−1 ± 3.6% (S.E.;n = 8) for the GS-1-bound cross-linked actin dimer and trimer, respectively. The average best-fit k 2values for the dimer and trimer were 0.026 s−1 ± 9.0% (S.E.; n = 7) and 0.024 s−1 ± 3.7% (S.E.; n = 8), respectively. The root mean square deviations ranged between 0.0116 and 0.0320 for the calculated curves fitting the GS-1-bound cross-linked actin dimer nucleated data set and 0.0126 and 0.0426 for the trimer curves. An additional round of simulation was performed employing the averagek 1 and k 2 values from the initial simulations and fitting the start time,t 0, and initial G-actin concentration to obtain the curves shown in Fig. 2. Initial G-actin concentration was fit to account for possible pipetting errors that can influence the steady-state pyrene fluorescence measured. The average best-fit starting G-actin concentration for the calculated dimer-nucleated assembly curves was 5.3 μm ± 1.09% (S.E.;n = 7) and 5.2 μm ± 1.47% (S.E.;n = 8) for the trimer curves. A solution at ∼12 mg ml−1 of the GS-1-complexed actin trimer was used for crystallization by the vapor diffusion method. For crystals of the complex that were grown in the presence of ATP, 2 μl of protein solution were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir buffer containing 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm ATP, 100 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2 and equilibrated against this buffer for 5–7 days at 4 °C. Crystals of the GS-1-complexed actin trimer in the presence of ADP were grown under the same conditions using 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm ADP, 100 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2 as reservoir buffer. Before data collection, both crystal forms were cryoprotected by adding glycerol to a final concentration of 15% and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. To confirm the presence of GS-1-bound actin trimers in crystals, crystals grown in the presence of either ATP or ADP were harvested, washed, and analyzed using SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (Voyager-DETM; PerSeptive Biosystems). Results of SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of GS-1 and actin trimer in both crystal forms. Neither actin dimers nor monomers were detected in the crystals. For both crystal forms, x-ray diffraction data were measured at −180 °C. The data in both cases were collected to 2.2 Å at Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) beamline 5.0.2 (λ = 1.1 Å). Both data sets were integrated using DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Both crystal forms were of the monoclinic space group P21 with two GS-1-complexed actin molecules in the asymmetric unit and cell dimensions of a = 67.2 Å,b = 75.9 Å, c = 96.8 Å, β = 91.9° and a = 66.7 Å, b = 75.9 Å,c = 97.9 Å, β = 90.1° for the crystals grown in the presence of ADP and ATP, respectively. Both structures were determined by the molecular replacement method (CNS; see Ref. 36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gross P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Electron density maps based on coefficients 2Fo - Fcwere calculated from the phases of the initial models. Subsequent rounds of model building and refinement were performed using programs QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) and CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gross P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), respectively. Electron density corresponding to the bound nucleotide was well defined in all maps calculated for both structures. In both cases, ATP was bound in the nucleotide pocket. Both structures were virtually identical. However, because both the quality of x-ray data and the current refinement statistics are better for the structure obtained from the crystals grown in the presence of ADP, the latter structure is described in this paper. The current structure is refined toR/R free values of 19.3/23.3 using all data in the resolution range of 25.0 to 2.2 Å (F > 0, a bulk solvent correction was applied; see Table I). Both GS-1-complexed actin protomers present in the crystal asymmetric unit include Ca2+-ATP and two additional Ca2+ ions. Residues 2–125 and 3–125 are built for two GS-1 segments, and residues 7–41, 50–375 and 7–44, 51–374 are built for two actin molecules, respectively. There are 471 water molecules in the asymmetric unit of the current model.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionUnit cell dimensions a (Å)67.2 b (Å)75.9 c (Å)96.8 β (°)91.9Space groupP21Molecules (GS-1-actin) per asymmetric unit2Resolution (Å)2.2Number of unique reflections45313Data redundancy4Completeness1-aNumber in parenthesis is for the last resolution shell (2.34–2.2 Å).(%)91.4 (81.4)R symm1-aNumber in parenthesis is for the last resolution shell (2.34–2.2 Å).1-bR symm = Σh‖Ih I‖/Σh I, where I is the mean intensity of reflection h.(%)6.0 (16.4)〈I/ς(I)〉17.0 (5.5)RefinementResolution range (Å)25.0–2.2ς-CutoffNoneR19.3R free1-cRfree is for 5% of total reflections.23.3Root mean square deviation from ideality Bond length (Å)0.012 Bond angle (°)1.6AverageB-factor (A2)35.8 All atoms35.4 Protein atoms44.3 Water molecules24.3Ca2+-ATPData is shown for the GS1-complexed actin trimer crystallized in the presence of ADP (see “Materials and Methods”).1-a Number in parenthesis is for the last resolution shell (2.34–2.2 Å).1-b R symm = Σh‖Ih I‖/Σh I, where I is the mean intensity of reflection h.1-c Rfree is for 5% of total reflections. Open table in a new tab Data is shown for the GS1-complexed actin trimer crystallized in the presence of ADP (see “Materials and Methods”). 5 μm F-actin (15% pyrenyl-actin) was incubated with 1.5 μm GS-1 in 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm ATP in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, in 100 μl total in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at 25 °C. 20 μl of stock 20 μm G-actin (15% pyrenyl-actin) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm ATP was then added to the reaction (final concentration 3.3 μm G-actin), and the change in fluorescence was monitored. The initial rate of elongation for each experiment was employed to determine the concentration of free pointed ends in the assay, assuming that GS-1 remains bound to the barbed ends of filaments, employing the known on-rate for ATP-actin at the pointed end of 1 μm−1s−1 and the relationship d(F)/dt =k Pon[ends][G-actin]. We polymerized F-actin purified from chicken and treated it with pPDM, which cross-links specifically between Cys-376 and Lys-193 of two adjacent actin protomers in a filament (17Knight P. Offer G. Biochem. J. 1975; 175: 1023-1032Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8228-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Elzinga M. Phelan J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6599-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This F-actin was then depolymerized in the presence of excess recombinant GS-1 to generate GS-1-bound cross-linked actin oligomers of varying lengths (see “Materials and Methods”). The heterogeneous mixture of GS-1-bound actin oligomers was resolved by a combination of gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography to yield purified GS-1-bound cross-linked actin oligomers of defined length (Fig. 1). The identification of purified cross-linked actin oligomers was confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Both GS-1-bound cross-linked actin dimers and trimers nucleated actin assembly (Fig. 2,B and C), whereas GS-1-bound actin monomer purified from the same cross-linking reaction inhibited even spontaneous nucleation (Fig. 2 A). No free GS-1 was detected in these polymerization reactions (data not shown), suggesting that GS-1 remains bound to each subunit of the purified actin oligomer during the assembly reaction. The average steady-state concentration of F-actin formed when GS-1-bound cross-linked actin oligomers were employed as nuclei was only 4.4 μm ± 0.77% (±S.E.; n = 11). Given that 5 μm G-actin was included in these actin assembly reactions, this F-actin steady-state concentration is consistent with pointed end growth, where the critical concentration is known to be about 0.6 μm (33Sheterline P.

https://openalex.org/W2010050784,"Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII are the two α(1, 3)-fucosyltransferases in myeloid cells responsible for the biosynthesis of sialyl Lewis X (sLex), the minimal ligand structure for the selectins. We have compared the ability of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII to generate sLex-like epitopes in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-Pro−5 cells expressing the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and the core-2 branching enzyme C2GnT. We found that mouse Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII can generate similar levels of cell surface sLex. Surprisingly however, Fuc-TIV-generated sLex was resistant to proteinase K and trypsin treatment and could be removed from cells by delipidation with chloroform/methanol, whereas 80–90% of Fuc-TVII-generated sLex was protease-sensitive, and most of it resistant to delipidation. Despite similar levels of sLex on the cell surface, Fuc-TVII transfectants adhered to immobilized E-selectin-IgG under static and flow conditions better than Fuc-TIV transfectants. Binding was mainly protease sensitive, indicating that glycoproteins were more efficient ligands than glycolipids. In summary, we conclude that the two fucosyltransferases differ in their in vivospecificity for acceptor substrates with Fuc-TVII generating sLex preferentially on glycoproteins, whereas most of the Fuc-TIV-generated sLex is found on glycolipids. Interestingly, the non-catalytic portion of Fuc-TIV in a Fuc-TIV/VII chimeric enzyme mediated the specificity for glycolipid substrates.

The three known selectins, l-, E-, and P-selectin are cell adhesion molecules that initiate interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells during leukocyte extravasation (1Vestweber D.

The minimal ligand structure for all three selectins is the tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewis X (sLex). 1The abbreviations used are: sLex, sialyl Lewis X (NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)-GlcNAc); Fuc-T, fucosyltransferase; mFuc-T, mouse Fuc-T; hFuc-T, human Fuc-T; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; ESL-1, E-selectin ligand-1; PSGL-1, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1; C2GnT, core-2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase; αMEM, α minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC4, CHO cells transfected with PSGL-1, core-2 branching enzyme, and Fuc-TIV (for PC4) or Fuc-TVII (for PC7); FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DTAF, dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcription; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CTS, cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem region 1The abbreviations used are: sLex, sialyl Lewis X (NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)-GlcNAc); Fuc-T, fucosyltransferase; mFuc-T, mouse Fuc-T; hFuc-T, human Fuc-T; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; ESL-1, E-selectin ligand-1; PSGL-1, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1; C2GnT, core-2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase; αMEM, α minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC4, CHO cells transfected with PSGL-1, core-2 branching enzyme, and Fuc-TIV (for PC4) or Fuc-TVII (for PC7); FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DTAF, dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcription; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CTS, cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem region The biosynthesis of sLex requires the sequential action of a number of glycosyltransferases of which the final reaction is mediated by α(1, 3)-fucosyltransferases (2Holmes E.H. Ostrander G.K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3737-3743Google Scholar, 3Hanisch F.G. Mitsakos A. Schroten H. Uhlenbruck G. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 178: 23-28Google Scholar). Of the six known human α(1, 3)-fucosyltransferases (Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TIV, Fuc-TV, Fuc-TVI, Fuc-TVII, and Fuc-TIX), Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII have been implicated in the generation of selectin ligands (4Lowe J.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1418-1426Google Scholar). Fuc-TVII-deficient mice exhibit severe defects in the transmigration of neutrophils into inflamed peritoneum, demonstrating the central importance of this enzyme for the generation of E- and P-selectin ligands on neutrophils (5Maly P. Thall A.D. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Google Scholar). In addition, the lack of Fuc-TVII severely reduced the expression ofl-selectin ligands on high endothelial venules in lymph nodes, leading to strong inhibition of lymphocyte homing (5Maly P. Thall A.D. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Google Scholar). The ability of Th1 cells to bind to E- and P-selectin is induced during the course of differentiation of these cells (6Borges E. Tietz W. Steegmaier M. Moll T. Hallmann R. Hamann A. Vestweber D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 573-578Google Scholar), and this correlates with the induction of Fuc-TVII (7Wagers A.J. Waters C.M. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2225-2231Google Scholar). Human Fuc-TIV, also termed ELFT for ELAM-1ligand fucosyltransferase, was reported to generate E-selectin binding carbohydrate modifications (8Goelz S.E. Hession C. Goff D. Griffiths B. Tizard R. Newman B. Chi Rosso G. Lobb R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1349-1356Google Scholar). However, this activity has been observed only when the enzyme is expressed at a certain level and in cells with a certain glycosylation phenotype (9Lowe J.B. Kukowska Latallo J.F. Nair R.P.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 1917-1929Google Scholar). Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells of the DHFR− strain with human Fuc-TIV led to the expression of CSLEX-1-reactive sLex ,although no sLexcould be generated by this enzyme in CHO-Pro−5 cells (10Kumar R. Potvin B. Muller W.A. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21777-21783Google Scholar). In BHK-21 cells, human Fuc-TIV generates Lex seven times more efficiently than sLex (14Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Google Scholar). In COS cells, human as well as mouse Fuc-TIV could not generate sLex-epitopes on the cell surface as defined by the mAb CSLEX-1 (15Gersten K.M. Natsuka S. Trinchera M. Petryniak B. Kelly R.J. Hiraiwa N. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25047-25056Google Scholar). In contrast, inin vitro enzyme assays mouse Fuc-TIV transfected in COS cells, but not human Fuc-TIV, could efficiently accept 3′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine to form sLex (15Gersten K.M. Natsuka S. Trinchera M. Petryniak B. Kelly R.J. Hiraiwa N. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25047-25056Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for the selective generation of sLex-like structures by Fuc-TIV is, at present, unexplained. Yet, Fuc-TIV does participate in the generation of physiologically relevant selectin ligands, although it clearly plays a minor role compared with Fuc-TVII. Although the fraction of rolling leukocytes in non-inflamed venules of the skin was normal in Fuc-TIV−/− animals, an increase of the rolling velocity was observed (16Weninger W. Ulfman L.H. Cheng G. Souchkova N. Quackenbush E.J. Lowe J.B. von Andrian U.H. Immunity. 2000; 12: 665-676Google Scholar). Furthermore, leukocytes rolling at velocities below 10 μm/sec were absent in Fuc-TIV−/− mice, and Fuc-TIV deficiency in the context of Fuc-TVII deletion extinguished residual selectin ligand activities observed in Fuc-TVII−/− mice (17Homeister J.W. Thall A.D. Petryniak B. Maly P. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Askari S.W. Cheng G. Smithson G. Marks R.M. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Immunity. 2001; 15: 115-126Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to further analyze the relative contribution of Fuc-TVII and Fuc-TIV to the generation of sLex-modified glycoconjugates that might serve as selectin ligands. We have recently analyzed the selective contribution of Fuc-TVII and Fuc-TIV to the generation of the glycoprotein ligands E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1) (18Levinovitz A. Mühlhoff J. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 449-459Google Scholar, 19Steegmaier M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Borges E. Lenter M. Kocher H.P. Kleuser B. Vestweber D. Nature. 1995; 373: 615-620Google Scholar) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (20Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Google Scholar, 21Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R.

Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Google Scholar). Each of these two ligands requires sLex for binding, with the difference that ESL-1 requires sLex on N-glycans (18Levinovitz A. Mühlhoff J. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 449-459Google Scholar), whereas PSGL-1 requires it on O-glycans that carry a core-2 branch (21Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Google Scholar, 24Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Google Scholar). In addition, PSGL-1 requires sulfation of the tyrosine residues within its N terminus for binding to P-selectin (25Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Google Scholar, 26Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Google Scholar, 27Wilkins P.P. Moore K.L. McEver R.P.

The physiological relevance of PSGL-1 in leukocyte extravasation is well established (23McEver R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Google Scholar). Antibodies against mouse PSGL-1 inhibit neutrophil recruitment into inflamed peritoneum (30Borges E. Eytner R. Moll T. Steegmaier M. Matthew A. Campbell P. Ley K. Mossmann H. Vestweber D. Blood. 1997; 90: 1934-1942Google Scholar), and the migration of Th1 cells into inflamed skin (6Borges E. Tietz W. Steegmaier M. Moll T. Hallmann R. Hamann A. Vestweber D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 573-578Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with mice deficient for the PSGL-1 gene (31Yang J. Hirata T. Croce K. Merrill-Skoloff G. Tchernychev B. Williams E. Flaumenhaft R. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1769-1782Google Scholar, 32Hirata T. Merrill-Skoloff G. Aab M. Yang J. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1669-1676Google Scholar). After analyzing mouse neutrophils from Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII deficient mice, we have shown recently that Fuc-TVII exclusively directs the expression of PSGL-1 glycoforms that bind with high affinity to P-selectin (33Huang M.C. Zollner O. Moll T. Maly P. Thall A.D. Lowe J.B. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31353-31360Google Scholar). In contrast, Fuc-TIV preferentially directs expression of ESL-1 glycoforms that exhibit high affinity for E-selectin. We could mimic this selectivity in transfected CHO-Pro−5 cells that expressed PSGL-1, ESL-1, and core-2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase (C2GnT) (33Huang M.C. Zollner O. Moll T. Maly P. Thall A.D. Lowe J.B. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31353-31360Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms in the Golgi that are the basis for this in vivo selectivity are unknown. In addition to glycoprotein counter-receptors, glycolipids have also been described as carriers of sLex and as selectin ligands (34Alon R. Feizi T. Yuen C.T. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5356-5366Google Scholar, 35Stroud M.R. Handa K. Salyan M.E.K. Ito K. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 758-769Google Scholar, 36Handa K. Stroud M.R. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12412-12420Google Scholar). However, selectin-mediated cell binding to glycolipid counter-receptors has always been tested with immobilized glycolipids. Hence, the relevance of glycolipids as selectin ligands in the physiological context of a cell surface is still unclear. Here, we have analyzed whether Fuc-TVII and Fuc-TIV would differ in their ability to generate sLex-carrying glycolipids or glycoproteins in transfected CHO-Pro−5 cells. Surprisingly, we found that Fuc-TIV preferentially generates sLex on glycolipids, whereas Fuc-TVII preferentially decorates sLex on glycoproteins. A comparison of the E-selectin binding efficiency of these transfectants suggests the possibility that this unexpected acceptor specificity could be a reason for the lower efficiency with which Fuc-TIV generates E-selectin ligands as compared with Fuc-TVII. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the Golgi environment of CHO-Pro−5 cells provides conditions under which each enzyme is able to generate sLex-epitopes. However, the enzymes preferentially synthesize these epitopes on different classes of carrier moieties in vivo. CHO-Pro−5 cells (11Goelz S. Kumar R. Potvin B. Sundaram S. Brickelmaier M. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1033-1040Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. A. Hasilik (University of Marburg) and grown in α-minimal essential medium (αMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/mll-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. Stable transfection was performed as described previously (37Zöllner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33002-33008Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 1 × 107 CHO-Pro−5 cells harvested in PBS (containing 5 mm EDTA) at 90% confluency were electroporated in 0.6 ml of PBS either with 10 μg of pcDNA3 vector containing mouse Fuc-TIV cDNA (38Borges E. Pendl G. Eytner R. Steegmaier M. Zöllner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28786-28792Google Scholar) or 20 μg of pcDNA1 vector containing human Fuc-TIV cDNA (37Zöllner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33002-33008Google Scholar) (both kindly provided by Dr. John Lowe, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) in a 0.4 cm cuvette at 950 μF and 0.25 kV. The human Fuc-TIV plasmid was co-transfected with 5 μg of pAH58 vector (39Riele H. Maandag E.R. Clarke A. Hooper M. Berns A. Nature. 1990; 348: 649-651Google Scholar) for hygromycin B resistance. Cells transfected with mouse Fuc-TIV were selected with 800 μg/ml G418; cells transfected with human Fuc-TIV were selected with 300 μg/ml hygromycin. Mock transfected cells were generated with the same vectors lacking the Fuc-T cDNA inserts. CHO-Pro−5 cells co-transfected with mouse PSGL-1 and human C2GnT were called PC and have been described (33Huang M.C. Zollner O. Moll T. Maly P. Thall A.D. Lowe J.B. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31353-31360Google Scholar). These cells, further transfected in a second round either with mouse Fuc-TIV in pcDNA3 or mouse Fuc-TVII in pcDNA3 and co-transfected with the pAH58 vector for hygromycin B resistance, were also described previously and are named PC4 and PC7, respectively (33Huang M.C. Zollner O. Moll T. Maly P. Thall A.D. Lowe J.B. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31353-31360Google Scholar). A hybrid cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic, transmembrane domain and stem region of mouse Fuc-TIV fused to the catalytic domain of mouse Fuc-TVII was constructed according to a strategy taken from Ref. 40Grabenhorst E. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36107-36116Google Scholar as follows. In a first PCR, a 303-bp fragment was generated using sense primer 5′-TGG AAT TCT GCA GAT CA-3′, antisense primer 5′-CCA GAT AAG GAT GGT GAG CAG GCG TTG CGG AGC TGG-3′, and the pcDNA3 vector containing mouse Fuc-TIV cDNA as a template (PCR conditions were 3 min at 94 °C, 25 cycles with 15s at 94 °C, 20s at 55 °C, 30s at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C). The purified PCR product was then used as a 5′-megaprimer in a second PCR together with antisense primer 5′-GTC AAG CCT GGA ACC AGC TT-3′ and the pcDNA3 vector containing mouse Fuc-TVII cDNA as a template (PCR conditions were 3 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles with 20s at 94 °C, 20s at 50 °C, 30s at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C). The PCR product was cloned into a pcDNA3 vector using the TOPO-TA system (Invitrogen). PC cells were transfected with this construct (plus co-transfection with pAH58 vector for hygromycin B resistance) and were referred to as PC 4/7 chimera cells. Following transfection, CHO cells were seeded into 90-mm culture dishes. After 6–10 days, individual clones were surrounded by glass rings, sealed with sterile grease, and released with trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen). All cell lines were subcloned twice in microtiter plates by seeding the cells at a statistical density of 0.5 cells/well followed by analysis for the expression of transfected cDNAs using PSGL-1- and sLex-specific antibodies in flow cytometry. The following antibodies were used. HECA-452 (anti-sLex, rat IgM) (41Duijvestijn A.M. Horst E. Pals S.T. Rouse B.N. Steere A.C. Picker L.J. Meijer C.J. Butcher E.C. Am. J.

Anti-CD65s (a variant of sLex; NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)-GlcNAc (clone VIM-2, mIgM)) (43Macher B.A. Buehler J. Scudder P. Knapp W. Feizi T. J. Biol.

Hasegawa A. Kannagi M. Kannagi R. Blood. 1993; 82: 2797-2805Google Scholar) and anti-CD15 (Lex) mAb clone HI98 (mIgM) were purchased from BD Pharmingen. FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG, FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG and IgM, FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM, DTAF-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG and IgM were all purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Polyclonal antibodies against ESL-1 (Affi-60) and polyclonal antibodies against mPSGL-1 (Affi-124) were generated as described previously (6Borges E. Tietz W. Steegmaier M. Moll T. Hallmann R. Hamann A. Vestweber D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 573-578Google Scholar, 19Steegmaier M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Borges E. Lenter M. Kocher H.P. Kleuser B. Vestweber D. Nature. 1995; 373: 615-620Google Scholar). Anti-mPSGL-1 mAb 4RA10 (rat IgG) was described previously (45Pendl G.G. Robert C. Steinert M. Thanos R. Eytner R. Borges E. Wild M.K. Lowe J.B. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Kupper T.S. Vestweber D. Grabbe S. Blood. 2002; 99: 946-956Google Scholar). The GM3-specific antibody GMR6 (mIgM) was purchased from Seikagaku (Tokyo, Japan). Isotype-matched negative control antibodies were R4–22 (rat IgM, BD Pharmingen), C48.6 (mIgM, BD Pharmingen), and anti-mP-selectin antibody RB40.34 (rat IgG (46Bosse R. Vestweber D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3019-3024Google Scholar)). E-selectin-IgG and vascular endothelial cadherin-IgG chimeras were produced as described previously (47Hahne M. Jäger U. Isenmann S. Hallmann R. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 655-664Google Scholar, 48Gotsch U. Borges E. Bosse R. Böggemeyer E. Simon M. Mossmann H. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 583-588Google Scholar). HECA-452 and CSLEX-1 were prepared from supernatants of hybridomas (obtained from the ATCC) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Flow cytometry was essentially performed as described (37Zöllner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33002-33008Google Scholar, 38Borges E. Pendl G. Eytner R. Steegmaier M. Zöllner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28786-28792Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105cells were incubated with 10–20 μg/ml mAb in flow cytometry buffer (Hanks' buffer, 3% FCS, 0.04% azide) at 4 °C or 37 °C for 20 min. For detection of selectin-IgG binding, 20 μg/ml E-selectin-IgG construct in flow cytometry buffer was used. Cells were washed twice with the same buffer and stained with FITC- or DTAF-conjugated secondary monoclonal antibodies at 1:100 dilutions. After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed twice, counter stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScalibur, BD Life Sciences). Data were collected by gating for propidium iodide-negative cells and analyzed using the CellQuest program. 2 × 108 cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, 160 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 units/ml α2-macroglobulin), and cell debris was pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Fucosyltransferase activity assays were carried out in a total volume of 40 μl containing 10 μg of protein extract, 25 mm cacodylate (pH 6.2), 0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mmGDP-fucose, 0.07 μCi of GDP-[3H]fucose, and 10 mm N-acetyllactosamine (NAL) as acceptor oligosaccharide (purchased from Dextra Laboratories). Blanks were prepared by omitting the acceptor in the reaction mixture. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, 1 ml of a Dowex 1-X8 slurry (1:4 (w/v) in water) was added to the reaction and vortexed. 500 μl of the supernatant was counted in 5 ml of scintillant (Ultima Gold XR, Packard). To obtain values solely due to the fucosylation of the acceptor substrate, total counts of the control (without acceptor substrate) were subtracted from total counts of samples with the acceptor. The specific activity of the fucosyltransferase was calculated as pmol/min/mg. Total cellular RNA was isolated from 107 cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μl of total RNA was used as template in a 20-μl reverse transcription reaction. To reflect the initial mRNA expression levels, PCR amplification of cDNA was carried out with cycle numbers that had been tested to be in the linear range and well below the plateau phase of amplification. The following number of cycles and primers were used. For β-actin: 20 cycles, sense-primer 5′-TGG GTC AGA AGG ACT CCT ATG-3′, antisense-primer 5′-CAG GCA GCT CAT AGC TCT TCT-3′, product of a 591-bp fragment.

PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 μl with 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) and 4 μl of single-stranded cDNA from the RT reaction as template. The PCR amplification was carried out using a Biometra thermal cycler with the following program: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 or 20 cycles of 94 °C for 50 s, 56 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 50 s followed by 72 °C for 7 min. To compare the mRNA expression levels in more detail, PCR was carried out as above using 2-fold serial dilutions of the input cDNA. PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and hybridized with 32P-labeled hFuc-TIV, mFuc-TIV, mFuc-TVII, or β-actin cDNA probe (106 cpm/ml). The blots were exposed to Hyperfilm (AmershamBiosciences). For each experiment, cells were harvested in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and washed once with αMEM. For proteinase K treatment, cells were resuspended in PBS at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. 1 × 106 cells (in 100 μl) were aliquoted to each well of 96-well v-bottom plates, and 1 μl of proteinase K stock solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm CaCl2) was added to each well. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of PBS containing 6% FCS and a protease inhibitor mixture containing EDTA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to inhibit proteinase K activity. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, cells were washed twice with Hanks' buffer containing 3% FCS and 0.04% azide. In all assays, proteinase K treatment resulted in less than 15% cell death. For trypsin treatment, cells were resuspended in αMEM and plated in V-bottom plates (Greiner) with 7.5 × 105 cells/well. Trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to give a final concentration of 1.7 mg/ml. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times in αMEM. Trypsin treatment resulted in less than 10% cell death. Cells were plated on chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tec) 1 day before the experiment, washed once with Hanks' buffer/0.04% azide, and fixed with 4% paraformeldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. To remove glycolipids, fixed cells were incubated with 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) at room temperature for 10 min. For staining controls, the extraction step was omitted. Cells were then washed twice with Hanks' buffer/0.04% azide and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of primary antibody in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 0.04% azide. After washing three times with Hanks' buffer/0.04% azide, FITC-, DTAF- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed five times with Hanks buffer/0.04% azide and mounted with one drop of Dako fluorescent mounting medium. Immunofluorescence images were captured and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Five different areas on the microscope slide were scanned individually by using ×20 objective and 5-milliwatt laser output. Using Leica software, the intensity of immunofluorescence on the image was quantified and divided by the number of cells counted to make quantifications comparable (mean fluorescence intensity). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1 × 107 cells/ml lysis buffer) containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 160 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 units/ml α2-macroglobulin, at 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The lysate was incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads loaded with polyclonal mAbs against ESL-1 (Affi-60) or PSGL-1 (Affi-124) at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). Membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20, 4% nonfat milk) at room temperature for 2 h and probed with the hybridoma supernatant of mAb HECA-452. After washing with blocking buffer, the blot was probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgM in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was washed with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 and then visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Adhesion assays were performed in 96-well flat bottom plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) coated with E-selectin-IgG, VE-cadherin-IgG, or human IgG1 diluted in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Hanks' buffer, Biochem, Berlin, Germany) or coated with 10% FCS ("
https://openalex.org/W2037666803,"DYRKs are a new family ofdual-specificity tyrosine-regulatedkinases with emerging roles in cell growth and development. Recently, we discovered that DYRK3 is expressed primarily in erythroid progenitor cells and modulates late erythropoiesis. We now describe 1) roles for the DYRK3 YTY signature motif in kinase activation, 2) the coupling of DYRK3 to cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), and 3) effects of DYRK3 on hematopoietic progenitor cell survival. Regarding the DYRK3 kinase domain, intactness of Tyr333 (but not Tyr331) within subdomain loop VII–VIII was critical for activation. Tyr331 plus Tyr333 acidification (Tyr mutated to Glu) was constitutively activating, but kinase activity was not affected substantially by unique N- or C-terminal domains. In transfected 293 and HeLa cells, DYRK3 was discovered to efficiently stimulate CRE-luciferase expression, to activate a CREB-Gal4 fusion protein, and to promote CREB phosphorylation at Ser133. Interestingly, this CREB/CRE response was also supported (50% of wild-type activity) by a kinase-inactive DYRK3 mutant as well as a DYRK3 C-terminal region and was blocked by protein kinase A inhibitors, suggesting functional interactions between protein kinase A and DYRK3. Finally, DYRK3 expression in cytokine-dependent hematopoietic FDCW2 cells was observed to inhibit programmed cell death. Thus, primary new insight into DYRK3 kinase signaling routes, subdomain activities, and possible biofunctions is provided.

Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Google Scholar) are recently described subfamilies of MAPK-related protein kinases that target Ser/Thr sites, yet also appear to be activated by tyrosine (auto)phosphorylation at a conserved YXY motif (or loop) between consensus kinase subdomains VII and VIII (hence, the nomenclature dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases, DYRKs) (1Becker W. Joost H.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 1-17Google Scholar, 4Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Google Scholar). At least seven DYRK isoforms have been described (5Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Google Scholar) that appear to derive from four unique genes (dyrk1–4). 2D. Y. Zhang, T. Pircher, and D. M. Wojchowski, manuscript in preparation.Within this family, DYRK1 has been best studied to date, is expressed at high levels in brain (6Guimera J. Casas C. Estivill X. Pritchard M. Genomics. 1999; 57: 407-418Google Scholar), maps to the critical region of the Down's syndrome locus (7Shindoh N. Kudoh J. Maeda H. Yamaki A. Minoshima S. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 92-99Google Scholar), and precipitates learning and memory defects when expressed in transgenic mice (8Altafaj X. Dierssen M. Baamonde C. Marti E. Visa J. Guimera J. Oset M. Gonzalez J.R. Florez J. Fillat C. Estivill X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1915-1923Google Scholar). Also, mutation of a dyrk1gene homolog in Drosophila (MNB, forminibrain kinase) disrupts neuroblast formation in the outer proliferation center and limits optic and central lobe development (9Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Google Scholar). By comparison, HIPKs contain a DYRK-type kinase domain, but, as a separable subfamily, differ in possessing N-terminal domains that interact with NK homeoproteins (3Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Google Scholar). HIPK2 has been best studied and recently has been discovered to play an important role in p53 regulation during radiation-induced apoptosis (10Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Google Scholar). Other DYRKs have not been well studied. Recently, our laboratory (11Geiger J.N. Knudsen G.T. Panek L. Pandit A.K. Yoder M.D. Lord K.A. Creasy C.L. Burns B.M. Gains P. Dillon S.B. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 901-910Google Scholar) and Lord et al. (12Lord K.A. Creasy C.L. King A.G. King C. Burns B.M. Lee J.C. Dillon S.B. Blood. 2000; 95: 2838-2846Google Scholar) discovered that DYRK3 is selectively expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells of erythroid lineage. Using an antisense oligonucleotide approach, it has also been demonstrated, in primary murine and human hematopoietic progenitor cells, that inhibition of DYRK3 expression significantly and specifically affects the production of colony-forming units-erythroid (the penultimate progenitors of erythroblasts). Based on apparently preferred arginine- and proline-directed substrate sequences (13Campbell L.E. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 31-36Google Scholar) and on the in vitro ability of DYRK1 to phosphorylate eukaryotic synthesis initiation factor-2Bε and tau microtubule-associated protein at priming sites (14Woods Y.L. Cohen P. Becker W. Jakes R. Goeder M. Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 609-615Google Scholar), DYRK1 has been suggested to act as a glycogen synthase kinase-priming kinase. Viain vitro kinase assays, DYRK1 has also been shown to be capable of phosphorylating forkhead transcription factor FKHR (forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma) (15Woods Y.L. Rena G. Morrice N. Barthel A. Becker W. Guo S. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 597-607Google Scholar), CREB (16Yang E.J. Ahn Y. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Google Scholar), and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) (17Matsuo R. Ochiai W. Nakashima K. Taga T. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 247: 141-151Google Scholar). However, factors that regulate DYRK3 and the nature of DYRK targets in general remain otherwise unclear. Homologs of mammalian DYRKs interestingly also occur inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Dictyostelium(Yak1p and YakA, respectively) (18Garrett S. Menold M.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4045-4052Google Scholar, 19Es S.V. Weening K.E. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30761-30765Google Scholar); and recently, each of these DYRK-like kinases has been linked to PKA signaling pathways (20Garrett S. Broach J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1336-1348Google Scholar, 21Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, YakA is required for cAMP (and PKA)-directed differentiation to sporulating stalks due to nutrient withdrawal (21Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302Google Scholar, 22Souza G.M. Silva A.M. Kuspa A. Development. 1999; 126: 3263-3274Google Scholar), whereas in S. cerevisiae, Yak1p may directly affect PKA function by phosphorylating Bcy1p, the single PKA regulatory subunit of budding yeast (23Griffioen G. Branduardi P. Ballarini A. Anghileri P. Norbeck J. Baroni M. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 511-523Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the prospect that DYRK3 might also somehow engage a PKA (and possibly CREB)-linked pathway was investigated. First, DYRK3 activity is shown to depend upon intactness of Tyr333within its predicted (auto)phosphorylation loop, and loop acidification is proved to be activating. This is unlike ERK2, for example, which possess an equivalently positioned TXY loop, but is not affected markedly by tyrosine acidification (24Canangrajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Google Scholar). Second, DYRK3 is shown to act via kinase domain- as well as unique C-terminal domain-dependent mechanisms to regulate CREB and CRE response pathways via PKA-dependent routes. Finally, DYRK3 expression in FDC hematopoietic progenitor cells is revealed to modulate apoptosis due to cytokine withdrawal. Overall, this work advances an understanding of DYRK3 activation, action mechanisms, and possible cellular functions. The full-length murine DYRK3 cDNA used in these studies was prepared by expressing a bacterial artificial chromosome-derived dyrk3 gene fragment in COS cells. cDNAs generated by this process were cloned into a λ ZAP vector, excised from a derived phagemid library, adapted at 5′ and 3′ termini with EcoRI and XhoI sites, and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEFNeo-Myc6. The DYRK3 point mutants Y331A, Y333A, Y331E/Y333E, and K202R were prepared from pEFNeo-Myc-wtDYRK3 using the Stratagene PCR-based XL site-directed mutagenesis kit and the following primers: 5′-CGA GTA TCA GAA GCT TGC CAC GTA TAT CCA GTC C-3′ plus 5′-GGA CTG GAT ATA CGT GGC AAG CTT CTG ATA CTC G-3′ (Y331A construct), 5′-GAA GCT TTA CAC GGC TAT CCA GTC CCG C-3′ plus 5′-GCG GGA CTG GAT AGC CGT GTA AAG CTT C-3′ (Y333A construct), 5′-GTA TCA GAA GCT TGA GAC GGA AAT CCA GTC CCG C-3′ plus 5′-GCG GGA CTG GAT TTC CGT CTC AAG CTT CTG ATA C-3′ (Y331E/Y333E construct), and 5′-CGG CAG TAC GTG GCC CTG AGA ATG GTG CGC AAT GAG AAA C-3′ plus 5′-GTT TCT CAT TGC GCA CCA TTC TCA GGG CCA CGTBACT GCC G-3′ (K202R construct). cDNAs encoding the unique N and C termini of DYRK3 were prepared from pEFNeo-Myc-wtDYRK3 by PCR using the following primer pairs: 5′-GGA TCT TGG TTC ATT CTC AAG CCT CAG-3′ plus 5′-AAC TCG AGC TAG CCG ATG ATT TTC AGC ACC TCA TAG CG-3′ (NT (N-terminal domain) construct, Met 1–Gly181), 5′-AAG AAT TCC CTC ACC CCG GCT CAA GCA-3′ plus 5′-AAC TCG AGT GGT CCA CTA GCT AAT CAG CTT TGG-3′ (CT (C-terminal domain) construct, Leu472–Ser451), 5′-GGA TCT TGG TTC ATT CTC AAG CCT CAG-3′ plus 5′-AAC TCG AGC TAA GGA TGT CTT AAT GCT TGA GCC GGG GT-3′ (NK (N-terminal plus kinase domains) construct Met 1–Pro484), and 5′-AAG AAT TCT CTG GCT TAC CGC TAT GAG GTG CT-3′ plus 5′-AAC TCG AGT GGT CCA CTA GCT AAT CAG CTT TG-3′ (KC (kinase plus C-terminal domains) construct, Leu59–Ser451). These cDNAs were cloned first into pCR-Script and then into a pEFNeo vector containing an in-frame 5′-Myc epitope tag (pEFNeo-Myc6-R1). 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus PSF (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B). DYRK3 constructs in pEFNeo vectors were transfected and expressed using 15 μg of plasmid DNA plus 30 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 100-mm dish of 293 cells at 50% confluency. Lysates were prepared at 48 h post-transfection. In assays of phospho-CREB, the 293 cell medium was changed to 0.5% FBS in Opti-MEM I 2 h prior to transfections. 293 cell lysates were prepared by collecting cells in phosphate-buffered saline (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) plus 5 mm Na2EDTA; washing cells with phosphate-buffered saline; and incubating each plate equivalent for 5 min initially in 1.5 ml of 10 mm NaCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm NaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus a protease inhibitor mixture (P-8340, Sigma). Cells were then collected (5 min at 2000 × g) and incubated for 15 min in this buffer supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100. Supernatants were recovered (5 min at 5000 × g), and pelleted nuclei were extracted by gentle rocking for 30 min in 150 μl of 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm Na2EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9. Triton X-100 and nuclear extracts were then combined. For direct Western blotting, aliquots were denatured in 1.6 mm SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm bromphenol blue, 5% glycerol, and 60 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8. Anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (1:2000; Invitrogen) and anti-phospho-CREB (1:1000), anti-CREB (1:1000), and anti-phospho-PKAαII (1:2000) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were used. In immunoprecipitations, lysates were precleared (30-min incubation) using 10 μl of protein G-agarose CL-4B (Sigma) prewashed with 25 mm NaCl and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6. Samples were then incubated stepwise at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-Myc antibody 9E10 for 90 min and with 30 μl of protein G-agarose for 30 min. Immune complexes were washed twice at 4 °C with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and twice at 23 °C with 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmNaVO4, and 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were included at all steps. Typically, one-third of the washed and aspirated immune complexes were denatured for Western blotting, and two-thirds were used in kinase assays. Electrophoresis and ECL Western blotting were performed as detailed previously (25Pircher T. Geiger J.N. Zhang D. Miller C.P. Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8995-9002Google Scholar). In kinase assays, washed immunoprecipitates were reacted at 30 °C with 40 μl of a solution containing 1.25 mm EGTA, 0.25 mmNaVO4, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 15 mm MgCl2, 125 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), and 6.25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, plus 5 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide (catalog no. 12-121, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 0.5 μm PKA inhibitor peptide (catalog no. 12-151), and 5 μm compound R24571 (catalog no. 20-116). This solution was prepared using the following reagents from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.: assay dilution buffer I (catalog no. 20-108), inhibitor mixture (catalog no. 20-116), kinase substrate mixture (catalog no. 20-115), and magnesium/unlabeled ATP mixture (catalog no. 20-113). At the indicated intervals, supernatants were recovered and denatured in SDS sample buffer. 32P-Labeled MBP products were assayed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (Storm Scanner, Amersham Biosciences). In experiments using 293 cells, 6 × 105 cells were plated (six-well plate format) and cultured overnight. Four hours prior to transfection, the medium was changed to 1% FBS in Opti-MEM I. Cells were then transfected (in triplicate) with pEFNeo-DYRK constructs (2 μg), pCRE-Luc reporter vector (1 μg; Stratagene), pSEAP (0.2 μg; Tropix Inc.), and 10 μl of FuGENE 6 per well. At 36 h post-transfection, supernatants were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity (Phospha-Light system, Tropix Inc.), and lysates were prepared (Promega reporter lysis buffer, catalog no. E3971). Lysates were then assayed for protein content (BCA system, Pierce) and luciferase activity (Promega substrate, catalog no. E1483). CCL-2 HeLa PathDetect cells (Stratagene) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 8% FBS, and PSF were transfected with 10 μg of pEFNeo-DYRK3 constructs, 3 μg of pEYFP-C1 (Clontech), and 30 μl of FuGENE 6 in 100-mm dishes at 50% confluency. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as transfected EYFP-positive cells versus EYFP-negative populations and cultured (six-well plate format) for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% FBS, and PSF. Cells in triplicate wells were assayed for luciferase activity. (R p)-cAMP-S and H-89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide·2HCl, BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.) were prepared in methanol and 50% ethanol, respectively, as 100-fold concentrated stocks and applied to 293 cells at 2 h prior to transfections. In pilot experiments, the activities of these compounds in this system (and potential toxicities) were tested over broad-range concentrations in transfections using pCRE-Luc plus pFC-PKA (Stratagene) and trypan blue cell viability assays. FDC cells were maintained in Opti-MEM I containing 7% FBS plus 3.5% WeHI3 cell-conditioned medium (as a source of IL-3). For stable expression of wtDYRK3 and Bcl-xL, FDCW2 cells were washed once with ice-cold Opti-MEM I medium and resuspended at 1 × 107cells/ml in Opti-MEM I. pEFNeo constructs encoding Myc-wtDYRK3 or Bcl-xL (60 μg) were transfected into FDCW2 cells (0.8 ml) using a Gene Zapper 450/2500 electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were then selected for 2 weeks in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. Derived lines were screened for DYRK3 expression by Western blotting. In assays of programmed cell death, nonviable cells were assayed by propidium iodide staining. Exponentially growing cells were adjusted to 3 × 105 cells/ml, expanded to 8 × 105 cells/ml, and washed twice with and cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in Opti-MEM I medium and 0.9% FBS in the absence of IL-3. For propidium iodide staining, cells (1 ml) were incubated with 5 μl of propidium iodide (0.25 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 15 min and analyzed by flow cytometry. Studies of DYRK3 are limited, and little is known regarding the nature of activation mechanisms and/or targets. Experiments first sought to assess ways in which Tyr331 and/or Tyr333within the DYRK3 unique predicted YTY activation loop might affect kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 1(lower panel), this YTY motif lies between kinase subdomains VII and VIII and is related to motifs within PRP4 and ERK1/2 kinases, but occurs in DYRK3 as a SSCFEYQKYTYQSRFYR sequence (bounded by kinase DFG and APE signature sequences). To test how DYRK3 kinase activity might be affected by this motif, cDNAs were prepared that encoded the Y331A, Y333A, or Y331E/Y333E mutation (Fig. 1, upper panel). As an additional control, Lys202 within the DYRK3 predicted ATP-binding site (kinase subdomain II) was mutated to generate kinase-inactive DYRK3 (K202R). Next, 293 cells were transfected with pEFNeo vectors encoding these DYRK3 forms, and DYRK3 kinase assays were performed using anti-Myc epitope immunoprecipitates plus [γ-32P]ATP and MBP. These experiments revealed that intactness of Tyr333(but not Tyr331) is important for DYRK3 kinase activity (Fig. 2, upper panels). Replicate quantitative analyses showed that DYRK3-Y333A retained little to no activity, whereas ∼75% of the wild-type activity was retained by DYRK3-Y331A (Fig. 2, lower panel). cDNAs were also prepared (and cloned into a pEFNeo vector) that encoded N-terminal plus kinase domains (NK construct) or kinase plus C-terminal domains (KC construct). These forms were also expressed and assayed forin vitro kinase activities. Each form proved to possess activity approximating that of wtDYRK3 (data not shown), suggesting that these domains may not substantially affect kinase domain activity.Figure 2Tyr333 (but not Tyr331) is required for DYRK3 kinase activity.cDNAs encoding Myc epitope-tagged wtDYRK3, DYRK3-K202R (kinase-inactive type II mutant), DYRK3-Y331A, and DYRK3-Y333A were cloned into pEFNeo and expressed transiently in transfected 293 cells. At 48 h post-transfection, lysates and monoclonal antibody 9E10 immunoprecipitates were prepared. DYRK3 kinase activity in immunoprecipitates was then assayed using MBP and [γ-32P]ATP. Shown in the upper panels are32P-labeled MBP products and Western blot controls for expression and immunoprecipitate equivalence. In the lower panel, the kinase activities of these DYRK3 constructs are compared quantitatively as normalized means ± S.D. of triplicates. Results are representative of three independent experiments. K, kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the above findings, efforts were also made to assay the predicted (auto)phosphorylation of Tyr333 (and possibly Tyr331). In experiments using several distinct anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, however, these events were not clearly detected (as compared with JAK2 (Januskinase-2) kinase as a parallel and positive control). In addition, DYRK3 expression levels in stably transfected 293 lines and in Sf9 lines (baculovirus system) were low, and this complicated direct analyses of phosphorylated sites. We therefore chose to test the possible effects of YTY loop acidification on DYRK3 activity. Interestingly, acidification of this loop to Y331E/Y333E yielded a DYRK3 form that possessed ∼75% of the wild-type activity (Fig. 3). This DYRK3-Y331E/Y333E mutant also phosphorylated MBP in a time course comparable with wtDYRK3 (Fig.4). These outcomes are consistent with a primary role for Tyr333 phosphorylation in DYRK3 activation. They also provide a novel DYRK3 gain-of-function mutant (Y331E/Y333E) that is active in the predicted absence of loop (auto)phosphorylation.Figure 4Murine DYRK3-Y331E/Y333E phosphorylates MBP in a time course comparable with wtDYRK3. The activities of DYRK3-Y331E/Y333E and wtDYRK3 (together with the negative control construct DYRK3-K202R) were tested in a time course format using immunoprecipitates from transfected 293 cells plus MBP and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression levels and immunoprecipitates for all forms of DYRK3 were essentially equivalent (data not shown). Analyses revealed similar activities for wtDYRK3 and DYRK3-Y331E/Y333E regarding rates and levels of 32P-labeled MBP product formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In S. cerevisiae and Dictyostelium, the DYRK kinase homologs Yak1p and YakA have recently been revealed to function within PKA-integrated signaling routes (20Garrett S. Broach J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1336-1348Google Scholar, 21Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302Google Scholar), and human DYRK1A has been suggested to phosphorylate CREB (16Yang E.J. Ahn Y. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Google Scholar). These reports prompted tests of the ability of DYRK3 to possibly modulate a CREB/CRE signaling pathway. This was investigated initially by cotransfecting 293 cells with a pEFNeo vector encoding wtDYRK3 (or empty pEFNeo as a control) plus a pCRE-Luc transcriptional reporter. pCRE-Luc was reproducibly stimulated 4–5-fold by wtDYRK3, and DYRK3-Y331E/Y333E likewise proved to efficiently activate pCRE-Luc (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, yet somewhat unexpectedly, pCRE-Luc was also stimulated significantly by the kinase-inactive construct DYRK3-K202R (Fig. 5 B). To examine these effects in an independent and CREB transactivation domain-specific system, the activities of DYRK3 constructs were also tested in CCL-2 HeLa cells. These cells stably express a CREB-Gal4 fusion protein that is activated upon phosphorylation of the CREB kinase-inducible activation domain and report activation via a single stably integrated Gal4-binding element-luciferase reporter cassette. To control for transfection efficiencies (and to analyze DYRK3 activities within transfected cell populations), CCL-2 HeLa cells were transfected with pEFNeo-DYRK3 vectors plus an EYFP expression vector (pEYFP-C1). At 60 h post-transfection, EYFP-positive cells were retrieved by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and luciferase activities due to DYRK3 expression were assayed (Fig. 6). These analyses revealed CREB kinase-inducible transcription domain activation by wtDYRK3 and DYRK-Y331E/Y333E and again demonstrated significant activation by kinase-inactive DYRK-K202R.Figure 6DYRK3 activation of CREB-Gal4 and a chromosomally integrated single-copy reporter. To more rigorously test the abilities of DYRK3, DYRK3-Y331E/Y333E, and DYRK3-K202R to engage a CREB-linked response pathway, DYRK3 effects were assayed in CCL-2 HeLa cells (i.e. cells that stably express a CREB-Gal4 fusion protein and that contain a stably integrated Gal4-luciferase reporter cassette). CCL-2 HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pEFNeo vectors encoding wtDYRK3, DYRK3-Y331E/Y333E, DYRK3-K202R, or empty pEFNeo plus an EYFP-encoding vector (pEYFP-C1) (upper panel). At 36 h post-transfection, transfected cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (lower panels), and luciferase activity levels were assayed. Shown are normalized mean luciferase activities ± S.D. Results are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, to investigate possible bases for the above apparent CREB/CRE targeting of kinase-inactive DYRK3-K202R, cDNAs encoding the unique N- and C-terminal subdomains of DYRK3 were prepared, cloned into pEFNeo vectors, and tested in 293 cells for possible activation of this response pathway. Luciferase assays revealed that the DYRK3 C-terminal domain (but not the N-terminal domain) possessed activity essentially equivalent to that of DYRK3-K202R (Fig.7, upper panels). Western blot analyses of cell lysates also showed that each Myc epitope-tagged form was expressed at a comparable level (Fig. 7, lower panel). Together, these findings indicate that DYRK3 can affect this signaling pathway via not only kinase domain-, but also C-terminal subdomain-mediated routes. As indicated above, evidence has recently been provided that the DYRK-related Yak1p kinase of S. cerevisiae may interact with PKA (especially via the PKA regulatory subunit Bcy1) (23Griffioen G. Branduardi P. Ballarini A. Anghileri P. Norbeck J. Baroni M. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 511-523Google Scholar). Mammalian PKAs are more complex and include at least four regulatory subunits and three catalytic subunits (and useful antibodies to specific PKA subunits also are limiting) (26Tasken K. Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K.A. Solberg R. Kuntsen H.K. Levy F.O. Sandberg M. Orstavik S. Larsen T. Johansen A.K. Vang T. Schrader H.P. Reinton N.T. Torgersen K.M. Hasson V. Jahnsen T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 191-204Google Scholar). Therefore, to test possible roles for PKA in our discovered DYRK3/CREB/CRE response pathway, we employed the specific PKA inhibitors (R p)-cAMP-S and H-89 (27Schaap P. van Ments-Cohen M. Scede R.D.

Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Google Scholar). In pilot experiments, concentrations/doses of each that efficiently inhibited PKA (but did not compromise 293 cell viability) were determined in cells transfected transiently with a PKA catalytic subunit expression vector (pFC-PKA). Based on reported K i values for intact cells (27Schaap P. van Ments-Cohen M. Scede R.D. Brandt R. Firtel R.A. Dostman W. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. van Haastert P.J. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 159-172Google Scholar), (R p)-cAMP-S was tested at 15–135 μm and H-89 at 6.25–25 μm, and concentrations of 100 μm(R p)-cAMP-S and 20 μm H-89 proved effective when administered at 2 h prior to transfection (data not shown). When administered at these doses to 293 cells transfected with pEFNeo-wtDYRK3 (and pCRE-Luc), H-89 and (R p)-cAMP-S each efficiently blocked the ability of DYRK3 to activate a CREB/CRE response (Fig.8). In addition, each inhibitor also efficiently blocked the activities of the DYRK3-Y331E/Y333E, DYRK3-K202R and DYRK3-CT constructs (Fig.9). These outcomes (plus the above-detailed experiments) support a model for DYRK3 action whereby DYRK3 can interact via not only its kinase domain, but also its unique C-terminal region, with PKA in a way that activates CREB/CRE responses.Figure 9PKA-specific inhibitors block CREB/CRE stimulation by kinase-deficient forms of DYRK3. To test whether CREB activation induced by DYRK3-K202R and DYRK3-CT might also be inhibited by PKA-specific inhibitor"

This remarkable variability between analogous cytochromes c6 supports the idea that different organisms utilize distinct mechanisms of photosynthetic intermolecular electron transfer. Electron transport between the membrane-bound complexes cytochromebf and photosystem I (PSI) 1The abbreviations used are: PSI, photosystem I; Pc, plastocyanin; cytc , cytochromec ; cytc6, cytochromec6; cytf , cytochrome f ; Ana , Anabaena; Syn , Synechococcus; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy. is maintained by mobile electron carriers. In plants, this task is fulfilled by plastocyanin (Pc), whereas cytochrome c6(cytc6) is the only carrier in certain cyanobacteria. There also exist eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria, which have the capacity to replace Pc with cytc6under copper-depleted conditions (1Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 9-19Google Scholar). Recently, a cytc6-like protein has been discovered in the thylakoid lumen of Arabidopsis (2Wastl J. Bendall D.S. Howe C.J. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 244-245Google Scholar, 3Gupta R. He Z.Y. Luan S. Nature. 2002; 417: 567-571Google Scholar). Despite being evolutionarily unrelated, Pc and cytc6 perform equivalent tasks with common reaction partners. This functional convergence suggests that similar interaction properties exist for both proteins. Not surprisingly, Pc and cytc6 have comparable redox potentials of around 350 mV. Furthermore, both proteins provide similar recognition information, demonstrated by the parallel variation of their isoelectric points, being acidic in green algae while ranging from acidic to basic in cyanobacteria (1Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 9-19Google Scholar, 4Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 11-22Google Scholar,5Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1998; 49: 397-425Google Scholar). To date there has been a considerable amount of kinetic and mutational analysis of the electron transfer reaction between both Pc and cytc6 and their partner PSI (6Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A.

Zak E. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17590-17595Google Scholar). A hierarchy of mechanisms for interprotein electron transport has emerged from this work. Reduction of PSI by Pc or cytc6, isolated from different organisms, can follow an oriented collision mechanism (type I), a two-step mechanism requiring complex formation (type II), or a complex formation with rearrangement of the interface before electron transfer occurs (type III). A remarkable homology between the arrangement of charged and hydrophobic recognition patches on the surfaces of Pc and cytc6 has also been revealed (12Frazão C. Soares C.M. Carrondo M.A. Pohl E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16187-16196Google Scholar). In particular, a conserved arginine found in cyanobacterial Pc and cytc6 was shown to be critical for bimolecular association with PSI (9Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 601-605Google Scholar). Two structures of the cytf-Pc complex from plant (14Ubbink M. Ejdeback M. Karlsson B.G. Bendall D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 323-335Google Scholar) and cyanobacterial (15Crowley P.B. Otting G. Schlarb-Ridley B.G. Canters G.W. Ubbink M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10444-10453Google Scholar) sources have been determined. A combination of charged and hydrophobic patches defines the complex interface between turnip cytf and spinach Pc. In contrast, the complex from Phormidium laminosum, a thermophilic cyanobacterium, was found to be predominantly hydrophobic. At present there are no kinetic or structural data for the interaction of cytc6 and cytf. Although mutagenesis studies have identified key residues for the reaction with PSI, there is no knowledge of the interaction site involved with cytf. To address the question of molecular recognition in cytc6, we have investigated complex formation with cytf using heteronuclear NMR. We have aimed to identify the surface features involved in complex formation and to draw comparisons with cytc6-PSI interactions. Two cyanobacterial variants of cytc6 (Fig. 1), the basic protein fromAnabaena sp. PCC 7119 (pI 9.0) and the acidic protein fromSynechococcus elongatus (pI 4.8), have been studied. In this way, the role of electrostatics in protein interactions could be investigated explicitly. Cytf from P. laminosum, with a net charge of −14, was used as the partner protein. It is important to note that P. laminosum cytf shares 74 and 72% sequence identity with Anabaena cytfand S. elongatus cytf, respectively. Furthermore, the net charge is intermediate of cytf fromAnabaena (−16) and S. elongatus (−12). This study reports the first structural characterization of the interactions of cytf and cytc6. The soluble fragment of cytfwas prepared according to previously published methods (15Crowley P.B. Otting G. Schlarb-Ridley B.G. Canters G.W. Ubbink M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10444-10453Google Scholar, 16Schlarb B.G. Wagner M.J. Vijgenboom E. Ubbink M. Bendall D.S. Howe C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 275-283Google Scholar). Unlabeled Ana-cytc6 was produced inEscherichia coli GM119 (17Marinus M.G. Morris N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 14: 1143-1150Google Scholar) transformed with both pEAC-WT (18Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1 mm FeCl3. Aerobic growth was maintained at 37 °C for 18 h before harvesting. A similar expression system in E. coli JM109 was used for the production of uniformly 15N-labeledAna-cytc6. The culture was grown in M9 minimal media additionally supplemented with 1 g/liter15NH4Cl and 1 mm thiamine. Aerobic growth was maintained at 37 °C for 72 h before harvesting. Isolation and purification ofAna-cytc6 were achieved as described previously (8Molina-Heredia F.P. Dı́az-Quintana A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33565-33570Google Scholar, 18Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Google Scholar). The preparation and purification of15N, 13C double-labeledSyn-cytc6 have been reported previously (21Sutter M. Sticht H. Schmid R. Hörth P. Rösch P. Haehnel W. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 563-566Google Scholar). Protein interactions were investigated for the diamagnetic species only, and reducing conditions were maintained in the presence of sodium ascorbate. Protein solutions were concentrated to the required volume using ultrafiltration methods (Amicon; YM3 membrane) and exchanged into 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 10% D2O, 1.0 mm sodium ascorbate. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an ε553 of 26.2 mm−1cm−1 for the ferrous form of both Ana-cytc6 (22Medina M. Louro R.O. Gagnon L. Peleato M.L. Mendes J. Gómez-Moreno C. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 225-234Google Scholar) andSyn-cytc6 and an ε556of 31.5 mm−1cm−1 for the ferrous form of cytf. For the assignment ofAna-cytc6, 0.7 mm15N-labeled and 1.0 mm unlabeled samples were prepared. To investigate complex formation betweenAna-cytc6 and cytf, microliter aliquots of a 1.9 mm cytf stock solution were titrated into an NMR sample containing 0.3 mm15N-Ana-cytc6. A reverse titration was also performed in which a sample containing 0.2 mm15N-Ana-cytc6 and 0.5 mm cytf was titrated with a 3.0 mmstock of unlabeled Ana-cytc6. To investigate complex formation betweenSyn-cytc6 and cytf, a 0.35 mm sample of 15N,13C-Syn-cytc6 was titrated with a 1.9 mm cytf solution. After each addition of protein, the pH of the samples was verified, and1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded. For sequence-specific assignment of the backbone resonances of Ana-cytc6, two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (100 ms mixing time), and three-dimensional 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC (80 ms mixing time) spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 NMR spectrometer. For assignment of the side-chain protons, two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY and TOCSY spectra were recorded. XWINNMR was used for spectral processing, and the assignment was performed in XEASY (23Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Google Scholar). Complete assignments of the 1H and15N resonances were determined for all backbone amides (see Supplementary material, Table S1). The non-exchangeable side-chain protons were also assigned. This assignment is consistent with those reported previously for Monoraphidium brauniicytc6 (24Banci L. Bertini I. De la Rosa M.A. Koulougliotis D. Navarro J.A. Walter O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4831-4843Google Scholar) andSyn-cytc6 (25Beiβinger M. Sticht H. Sutter M. Ejchart A. Haehnel W. Rösch P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 27-36Google Scholar). Measurements on samples containing cytf and either15N-Ana-cytc6 or15N,13C-Syn-cytc6 were performed on a Bruker DMX 600 NMR spectrometer operating at 300 K. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra (26Andersson P. Gsell B. Wipf B. Senn H. Otting G. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 279-288Google Scholar) were recorded with spectral widths of 30.0 ppm (15N) and 13.9 ppm (1H). Analysis of the chemical-shift perturbation (ΔδBind) with respect to the free protein was performed in XEASY. Titration curves were obtained by plotting ΔδBind against the molar ratio (R) of [cytf]:[Ana-cytc6]. For the reverse titration, ΔδBind was plottedversus[Ana-cytc6]:[cytf]. Non-linear least-squares fits to a one-site model (27Kannt A. Young S. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Bioenergetics. 1996; 1277: 115-126Google Scholar) were performed in Origin (Originlab, Northhampton, MA). This model explicitly treats the concentration of both proteins with R and ΔδBind as the independent and dependent variables, respectively (27Kannt A. Young S. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Bioenergetics. 1996; 1277: 115-126Google Scholar). The binding constant (Ka) and the maximum chemical-shift change (ΔδMax) were the fitted parameters. A global fit was performed in which the curves were fitted simultaneously to a single Ka value, whereas ΔδMax was allowed to vary for each resonance. Comparison of1H-15N HSQC spectra of freeAna-cytc6 andAna-cytc6 in the presence of cytf revealed distinct differences arising from complex formation (Fig. 2). When cytfwas titrated into Ana-cytc6, 33 of the backbone amides experienced chemical-shift perturbation, ΔδBind ≥ 0.03 ppm (1H) and/or ≥ 0.10 ppm (15N). A single averaged resonance was observed for each backbone amide, indicating that the free and bound forms of cytc6 were in fast exchange on the NMR time scale. In addition to chemical-shift perturbation, the presence of cytf caused a general broadening of about 20 Hz of the amide resonances (Fig. 3A), as expected for complex formation (28Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Google Scholar).Figure 3Line broadening effects. A, cross-sections along the F2 dimension through the 1HN resonance of Ser-16 inAna-cytc6. The resonance in the free protein (8.07 ppm) has a line width at half-height of 13 Hz. In the presence of two equivalents of cytf, the resonance shifts to 8.18 ppm, and the line width at half-height increases to 34 Hz.B, cross-sections along the F2dimension through the 1HN resonance of Gly-12 in Syn-cytc6. Despite the presence of two equivalents of cytf, the resonance is unperturbed (compare Ala-12 of Ana-cytc6, Fig. 4), and the line width at half-height increases by only 2 Hz.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Titration curves of ΔδBind versus the molar ratio of cytf:Ana-cytc6were plotted for the 15N nuclei of the four most strongly shifted resonances (Fig. 4A). The curves clearly illustrate that the chemical-shift perturbation increases as a function of the cytf concentration. Despite the addition of two equivalents of cytf, however, saturation of the chemical-shift changes was not observed. The binding curves were fitted to a 1:1 model with a binding constant of ∼1 × 104m−1. The quality of the fit is poor, particularly at the beginning of the curve, which is perhaps due to a small systematic error in the determination of the protein ratio. To investigate this further, a reverse titration was performed in which a sample of cytf was titrated withAna-cytc6. In this case, the binding curves were fitted satisfactorily with a binding constant of 8 (±2) × 103m−1 (Fig. 4B). It can be concluded that the binding affinity of cytf for Ana-cytc6 is ∼104m−1, which is about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the affinity for the physiological partner, P. laminosum Pc (15Crowley P.B.

ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 526-533Google Scholar). From the ratio of the observed ΔδBind to the fitted ΔδMax(Fig. 4B), it was calculated that 63% of theAna-cytc6 was bound in the first point of the reverse titration.

All of the known structures exhibit high structural homology. At present, the structure ofAna-cytc6 is unavailable, and therefore, a model was built in Swiss-MODEL (34Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar) using the NMR structure of Syn-cytc6 (25Beiβinger M. Sticht H. Sutter M. Ejchart A. Haehnel W. Rösch P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 27-36Google Scholar) as a template. The chemical-shift map in Fig. 5 illustrates the location of the affected residues in this model with each residue coloredaccording to its observed ΔδBind. The complex interface consists of a well defined patch, which surrounds the exposed methyl groups (methyl 3, thioether 4 methyl, and methyl 5) of the heme. This patch is composed mainly of three stretches of the primary structure, residues 9–19, 23–26, and 51–61. The first of these includes the heme-binding motif CXYCH, whereas the sixth ligand, Met-58, occurs in the third stretch. Val-25, which was shown to be important for the interaction between cytc6 and PSI (8Molina-Heredia F.P. Dı́az-Quintana A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33565-33570Google Scholar), is found in the second stretch. Cys-17, Met-58, and Ala-60 experience the largest shifts in the complex. Alanine and asparagine are the most abundant residues in the interface, accounting for one-third of all the affected residues. Although 60% of the interface can be classified as hydrophobic, only 4 residues are charged (Lys-55, Lys-66, Glu-68, and Lys-80). Notably the conserved arginine, Arg-64, which has been implicated in the reaction with PSI (9Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 601-605Google Scholar), was not shifted in the complex. Fragata (35Fragata M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1618Google Scholar) has produced a theoretical model of the complex formed between M. brauniicytc6 and turnip cytf (Protein Data Bank accession code 1jx8). There is good agreement between the binding site on cytc6 identified in this model and the experimentally observed interaction site onAna-cytc6. The complex of cytf andAna-cytc6 was also investigated at 50, 100, and 200 mm NaCl. The observed ΔδBind for the 33 affected amides is plotted as a function of the salt concentration in Fig. 6. As the salt concentration was increased, ΔδBind decreased. At 200 mmNaCl, the ΔδBind is zero for most residues. This suggests that the binding constant is considerably reduced, illustrating the importance of attractive electrostatic interactions in complex formation. The more strongly affected residues such as Cys-17 and Met-58 still experience appreciable shifts at 200 mmNaCl. Furthermore, although the line broadening decreased with increasing salt, there remains ∼5 Hz broadening at 200 mm NaCl. These observations are indicative of a significant interaction even at high ionic strength. In contrast to the case of Ana-cytc6, titration of cytf intoSyn-cytc6 produced only minor effects in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. Despite the presence of two equivalents of cytf, the amide resonances ofSyn-cytc6 did not experience chemical-shift perturbation. Line broadening effects on the order of 2 Hz were observed (Fig. 3B), consistent with a weak and highly dynamic interaction (36Worrall J.A.R. Liu Y. Crowley P.B. Nocek J.M. Hoffman B.M. Ubbink M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11721-11730Google Scholar). Increasing the ionic strength by the addition of 200 mm NaCl had no effect on the protein interactions. In contrast to the clearly defined complex between cytf and Ana-cytc6, there is no evidence for specific complex formation withSyn-cytc6. From our results, it is clear thatAna-cytc6 and cytf form a well defined complex and that the amount of complex formed is dependent on the ionic strength. It has been shown previously thatAna-cytc6 forms a complex withAnabaena PSI, the affinity of which decreases with increasing ionic strength (7Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2693-2698Google Scholar). AlthoughAna-cytc6 has a net charge close to zero, the presence of positive residues in the vicinity of the heme group promotes favorable electrostatic docking to cytf. The role of electrostatics in this complex is therefore analogous to the complex formed between plant cytf and Pc in vitro(14Ubbink M. Ejdeback M. Karlsson B.G. Bendall D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 323-335Google Scholar, 27Kannt A. Young S. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Bioenergetics. 1996; 1277: 115-126Google Scholar, 37Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Piskorowski R.A. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15120-15128Google Scholar, 38Bergkvist A. Ejdeback M. Ubbink M. Karlsson G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2623-2626Google Scholar, 39Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Tae G.-S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14590-14598Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 5, the interaction site ofAna-cytc6 is composed mainly of hydrophobic residues, which is necessary to achieve specific complex formation between the two proteins. Such a hydrophobic site is similar to that proposed previously for the interaction ofAna-cytc6 with PSI (8Molina-Heredia F.P. Dı́az-Quintana A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33565-33570Google Scholar). A type I mechanism has been reported for the reduction of PSI bySyn-cytc6 (21Sutter M. Sticht H. Schmid R. Hörth P. Rösch P. Haehnel W. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 563-566Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the electron transfer rate is proportional to the number of collisions in which the redox centers of both proteins are aligned. The NMR titration of cytf intoSyn-cytc6 provides no evidence for specific complex formation but suggests a highly dynamic interaction between these partners, in agreement with a type I mechanism. The optimal orientation for productive collisions is facilitated by the prominent acidic patch on the backside ofSyn-cytc6 (Fig. 1) since the front face will be the energetically more favorable approach with the acidic partners, cytf and PSI. Apparently, cytc6 from different organisms utilizes different mechanisms for the electron transfer reaction with its partners. A similar conclusion has been reached for the interactions of cytf and Pc from different organisms (15Crowley P.B. Otting G. Schlarb-Ridley B.G. Canters G.W. Ubbink M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10444-10453Google Scholar). The source of this different reactivity can be traced to the nature of the protein surfaces and ultimately to variations in the primary structures. The sequences of Ana-cytc6 andSyn-cytc6 share 67% identity. Of the 33 residues identified in theAna-cytc6 interaction site, 22 are conserved in the Syn-cytc6 sequence. Only 6 residues, located around the periphery of the complex interface, are significantly different inSyn-cytc6. Ala-19 and Gln-26 are replaced by methionines, which have been implicated as endogenous antioxidants (25Beiβinger M. Sticht H. Sutter M. Ejchart A. Haehnel W. Rösch P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 27-36Google Scholar, 40Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Google Scholar). Ala-49 is replaced by a tyrosine, whereas glutamine and histidine replace Thr-52 and Asn-53, respectively. This cluster of three variations inSyn-cytc6 results in a bulkier surface, which may hinder interactions with cytf. The replacement of Lys-66 by a threonine inSyn-cytc6 is representative of the most striking difference between the two sequences. Five additional lysines in Ana-cytc6 contribute to the significantly higher pI of this protein and enable attractive electrostatic interactions with the acidic cytf. The different roles of electrostatics and hydrophobics can be further illustrated by comparison with the recently characterized, non-physiological complex of yeast cytochrome c(cytc) and cytf (29Crowley P.B. Rabe K.S. Worrall J.A.R. Canters G.W. Ubbink M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 526-533Google Scholar). It was found that cytf binds two equivalents of cytc with binding constants of ∼2 × 104m−1and 4 × 103m−1. The higher binding affinity, as compared with the cytf-Ana-cytc6 complex, probably arises from the strong electrostatic attraction between cytf and cytc, which has a pI of 9.7 (41Park K.S. Frost B.F. Shin S. Park I.K. Kim S. Paik W.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 195-204Google Scholar). Fewer residues experienced chemical-shift perturbation in this complex, resulting in a less extensive interaction site (29Crowley P.B. Rabe K.S. Worrall J.A.R. Canters G.W. Ubbink M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 526-533Google Scholar) (Fig. 7, A and B). Furthermore, the chemical-shift perturbation was on average 50% smaller than that observed in the complex withAna-cytc6. The prevalence of electrostatic attractions may reduce the amount of time spent in a single orientation, as determined by hydrophobic contacts, and consequently, fewer and smaller chemical-shift changes are observed. Alternatively, the diminished interaction site observed for cytc may be explained in terms of “goodness of fit.” It can be assumed that the hydrophobic patch surrounding the heme is better adapted in Ana-cytc6 than in yeast cytc for binding to cytf. This complimentarity favors closer contact between the protein surfaces and thus a larger interaction site. Protein docking simulations, using an NMR filter implemented in BiGGER (42Palma P.N. Krippahl L. Wampler J.E. Moura J.J.G. Proteins. 2000; 39: 372-384Google Scholar), identified the cytc binding sites as the front (Site I) and back (Site II) faces of the heme region of cytf(29Crowley P.B. Rabe K.S. Worrall J.A.R. Canters G.W. Ubbink M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 526-533Google Scholar) (Fig. 7C). A similar docking simulation using theAna-cytc6 model gave slightly different results. Although the front face of the heme remains the favored site of interaction, there is a significant fraction of favorable docking orientations beneath the heme region in the large domain of cytf (Fig. 7D). Notably, there is significant overlap between the top-ranking docking configuration found for Ana-cytc6 in BiGGER and the docking orientation of M. brauniicytc6 in the model of Fragata (35Fragata M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1618Google Scholar). In this model, between the algal cytc6 and plant cytf, there are favorable electrostatics between complimentary charged patches, a ridge of lysines on the small domain of cytf and a cluster of acidic residues on the side of cytc6. This results in a slightly different orientation of cytc6 in comparison with the cyanobacterial complex, which does not possess such well defined complimentary charged patches. P. B.

Previous two-hybrid screens showed that Scd5p interacts with Glc7p, a yeast Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) that participates in a variety of cellular processes. PP1 substrate specificity in vivo is regulated by association with different regulatory or targeting subunits, many of which have a consensus PP1-binding site ((V/I)XF, with a basic residue at the −1 or −2 position). Scd5p contains two of these potential PP1-binding motifs: KVDF (amino acids 240–243) and KKVRF (amino acids 272–276). Deletion analysis mapped the PP1-binding domain to a region of Scd5p containing these motifs. Therefore, the consequence of mutating these two potential PP1-binding sites was examined. Although mutation of KVDF had no effect, alteration of KKVRF dramatically reduced Scd5p interaction with Glc7p and resulted in temperature-sensitive growth. Furthermore, this mutation caused defects in fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis and actin organization. Overexpression of GLC7suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth of the KKVRF mutant and partially rescued the actin organization phenotype. These results provide evidence that Scd5p is a PP1 targeting subunit for regulation of actin organization and endocytosis or that Scd5p is a PP1 substrate, which regulates the function of Scd5p in these processes.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Google Scholar). It is highly conserved and is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including glycogen and protein synthesis, cell cycle regulation, muscle contraction, and calcium transport (1Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Google Scholar, 2Stark M.J.R. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Google Scholar). Whereas the catalytic enzyme has broad substrate specificities in vitro, many lines of evidence have shown that regulatory or targeting subunits direct PP1 to physiological substrates or subcellular locations to perform specific dephosphorylation in vivo (2Stark M.J.R. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Google Scholar, 3Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the PP1 catalytic subunit is encoded by GLC7, and not surprisingly because of its diverse functions, GLC7 is an essential gene (4Feng Z.H. Wilson S.E. Peng Z.Y.

Many Glc7p-regulatory proteins have been identified in yeast. These include the following: Gac1p, a homologue of the mammalian G subunit involved in activation of glycogen synthase for glycogen accumulation (6Stuart J.S. Frederick D.L. Varner C.M. Tatchell K.

Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Google Scholar); and Glc8p, a homologue of the mammalian PP1 inhibitor-2 (16Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Google Scholar, 17Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Google Scholar). Several mammalian and yeast PP1-binding proteins contain a consensus PP1-binding motif ((V/I)XF) with a basic residue at the −1 or −2 position ((R/K)(V/I)XF or (R/K)X(V/I)XF) through which the regulatory subunits interact with the PP1 catalytic subunit (18Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Google Scholar, 19Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Google Scholar). This structural motif forms an extended conformation and binds to a hydrophobic groove (a regulatory subunit-binding site) on the PP1 protein surface, which is on the opposite side from the catalytic site (18Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Google Scholar). The presence of a consensus PP1-binding motif also implies that the interaction of many different regulatory subunits with PP1 is mutually exclusive and competitive. However, the (V/I)XF motif exists in more than 10% of all known proteins. Most of these are unlikely to interact with PP1, so the importance of this motif for PP1 binding and function has required confirmation by mutational analysis of the (V/I)XF sequence, as done for yeast Gac1p (20Wu X. Hart H. Cheng C. Roach P.J. Tatchell K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 622-635Google Scholar) and Reg1p (21Dombek K.M. Voronkova V. Raney A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell.

Moran M.F. Durocher D. Mann M. Hogue C.W. Figeys D. Tyers M. Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Google Scholar). Among these is Scd5p, an 872-amino acid protein, which we have shown recently (27Henry K.R. D'Hondt K. Chang J. Newpher T. Huang K. Hudson R.T. Riezman H. Lemmon S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2607-2625Google Scholar) plays a critical role in actin cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis. Interestingly, Scd5p contains two potential PP1-binding motifs: KVDF and KKVRF (amino acids 240–243 and 272–276, respectively). In this report we map the Glc7p/PP1-binding site to a region of Scd5p containing these motifs. Mutational analysis indicates that the second putative PP1-binding site (KKVRF) is crucial for Glc7p interaction. Furthermore, this PP1-binding site mutation causes temperature-sensitive growth and defects in actin cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis. These studies indicate that PP1 binding is necessary for the function of Scd5p and suggest that Scd5p may target PP1 to substrates that must be dephosphorylated for regulation of actin organization and endocytosis.

First a 0.68-kb BamHI-SalI fragment (containing the SCD5 start codon at the BamHI site) was moved from pKRH20 (pGBD-scd5-Δ645 (27Henry K.R. D'Hondt K. Chang J. Newpher T. Huang K. Hudson R.T.

Then the remainder of SCD5 or scd5-Δ338 was reconstituted by inserting a 5.4-kb XbaI-SphI fragment (contains codons 188 through the end of the open reading frame) into pJSC1 to generate pJSC2 and pJSC12, respectively. A 516-bpBamHI-PstI PCR fragment (codons 828–1000 fromBMS1) was amplified with primers 5′-CCAGGATCCGAAGACATCGTTGG-3′ and 5′-GAACTGCAGTATCACTCATTAGGATTTTATCC-3′. This was subcloned in-frame with GST coding sequences in pTB338 to generate pDG101 (pGAL::GST-bms1-(828–1000)). PP1-binding site mutant plasmids, pJSC8 (scd5-PP1Δ1), pJSC9 (scd5-PP1Δ2), and pJSC10 (scd5-PP1Δ1Δ2) were constructed by megaprimer mutagenesis (31Aiyar A. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-367Google Scholar). Primer 5′-ACTGGTGATCAAAAGGCCGCTGCTGACTCATTTGCTTCA-3′ was used for changing codons for KVDF (residues 240–243) to KAAA (Δ1). Codons for KKVRF (residues 272–276) were changed to AKAAA (Δ2) using the primer 5′-GTTATATGCTCTGAAGCGGCCGCCTTCGCACTCTTAAAATTC-3′. PCR fragments containing mutations were then gap-repaired into pCC545 (from Clarence Chan), which contains SCD5 in pRS315 (CEN,LEU2) (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

For two-hybrid analysis, pJSC18 (pGBD-scd5-Δ338-PP1Δ1), pJSC19 (pGBD-scd5-Δ338-PP1Δ2), and pJSC20 (pGBD-scd5-Δ338-PP1Δ1Δ2) were generated by gap-repair of the XbaI-SexAI cut pNT1 (pGBD-scd5-Δ338 (27Henry K.R.

All two-hybrid Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) clones were made in pGBDU (2-μ, URA3) (33James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A.

Transformants were grown in 5 ml of synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking uracil and leucine and containing 1.95% galactose and 0.05% glucose at 30 °C overnight and then diluted and grown in 50 ml of the same medium until cultures reached ∼1.0 × 107 cells/ml. Approximately 50 × 107cells were harvested, resuspended in 1.2 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus a protease inhibitor mixture (37Stepp J.D. Pellicena-Palle A. Hamilton S. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 41-58Google Scholar)), and lysed by glass beads in a Braun homogenizer for 3 min. Cell extracts were transferred to an ice-cold centrifuge tube and spun down at 20,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein determination kit. Extracts (420 μg) diluted to 5 ml with lysis buffer were incubated with 100 μl of a 75% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (AmershamBiosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and one time with 1 ml of lysis buffer without detergent. The final bead pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples (30 μg) of crude extract were also diluted to 100 μl with sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Crude extract and equal volumes of GST affinity-purified samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Western blots were probed with affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to GST (1:1500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-HA rat monoclonal antibodies 3F10 (1:750, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). These were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000, Sigma) or rabbit anti-rat IgG (1:10,000, Sigma), respectively, and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast cells were grown to log phase in 5 ml of synthetic selective medium at 25 °C. Approximately 2 × 107 cells were harvested, washed with distilled H2O, and resuspended in 0.1 ml of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus a protease inhibitor mixture (37Stepp J.D. Pellicena-Palle A. Hamilton S. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 41-58Google Scholar). After lysis with glass beads, extracts (22 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Equal loading of protein was confirmed by Amido Black staining of transfers. Blots were probed with rabbit anti-Scd5p antibodies (1:6,000, from Clarence Chan) and developed as described above for GST-pulldowns. Bait plasmids (URA3, pGBD fusions) were transformed into YPJ96-4A, and prey plasmids (LEU2, pGAD fusions) were transformed into SL3004. YPJ96-4A and SL3004 containing these plasmids were mated pairwise on a YEPD plate for 2 days, and the diploids containing both plasmids were selected on C-LEU-URA. Cells were grown in liquid C-LEU-URA medium to a concentration of 0.5 × 107 cells/ml, and equal numbers of cells were spotted on C-LEU-URA and C-LEU-URA-ADE to monitor expression of the GAL2-ADE2 reporter gene. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (38Kaiser C.

Cells were grown at 25 °C in YEPD to early log phase, and cultures were kept at 25 °C or pre-shifted to 37 °C for 15 min before addition of LY (Sigma). After incubation for 1 h at 25 or 37 °C, cells were washed and observed immediately with a Zeiss Axioplan-2 fluorescence microscope equipped with DIC optics as described previously (27Henry K.R.

Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Google Scholar), suggesting that Scd5p might be a regulatory subunit of yeast PP1. To test whether Scd5p interacts with Glc7p in vivo, we expressed GST fusions of Scd5p and Scd5p-Δ338 (a C-terminal truncation of 338 amino acids) in wild type yeast also expressing an HA-tagged version of Glc7p. Cells were grown on galactose to induce expression of the GST fusion proteins, which were then affinity-purified from protein extracts using glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 1). HA-tagged Glc7p corresponding to a band of 37 kDa co-purified with both GST-Scd5p and GST-Scd5p-Δ338 (Fig. 1B,lanes 2 and3) but not with a nonrelevant control GST fusion (Fig. 1B,lane 1). These data confirm the previous two-hybrid interaction of Glc7p with Scd5p, as well as a recent large scale proteomic complex analysis showing Scd5p co-purification with yeast PP1 (26Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutilier K. Yang L. Wolting C. Donaldson I. Schandorff S. Shewnarane J. Vo M. Taggart J. Goudreault M. Muskat B. Alfarano C.

In addition, our results show that the Glc7p interaction in vivo is dependent upon the first 534 amino acids of Scd5p. To define further the region of Scd5p mediating interaction with PP1, a series of truncation constructs comprising C-terminal deletions of Scd5p were fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4p (GBD) (see Fig. 2A) and tested by two-hybrid analysis for interaction with Glc7p fused to the Gal4p activation domain (GAD). Scd5p-Δ338 (residues 1–534) and Scd5p-Δ523 (residues 1–349) strongly interacted with Glc7p, whereas Scd5p-Δ645 (residues 1–227) could no longer bind yeast PP1 (Fig. 2B). A control prey, GAD-Gac1p, showed no detectable interaction with any of Scd5p truncation constructs. These two-hybrid results map the PP1-binding site to a region between amino acids 228 and 349 of Scd5p. A number of mammalian and yeast PP1-binding proteins contain a consensus PP1-binding motif ((R/K)(V/I)XF or (R/K)X(V/I)XF) through which they interact with the PP1 catalytic subunit, although the latter motif is most common in yeast (18Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Google Scholar, 19Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Google Scholar). Interestingly, Scd5p contains two potential PP1-binding sequences: KVDF (amino acids 240–243) and KKVRF (amino acids 272–276) that are located in the Glc7p-binding region defined by the two-hybrid Scd5p truncation analysis. To determine whether the putative PP1-binding motifs in Scd5p are important for binding Glc7p, we mutated these sites singly or in combination, changing KVDF (240–243) to KAAA (Δ1) and KKVRF (272–276) to AKAAA (Δ2). These mutations were introduced into the pGBD-scd5-Δ338 plasmid to test for two-hybrid interactions with GAD-Glc7p (Fig. 3). We found that Scd5p-Δ338-PP1Δ1 containing KVDF(240–243)KAAA showed wild type interaction, whereas interaction of Glc7p with Scd5p-Δ338-PP1Δ2 containing KKVRF(272–276)AKAAA was reduced ∼10-fold. Mutation of both sites (Δ1Δ2) completely disrupted Glc7p binding (Fig. 3,A and B). These results indicated that the second PP1-binding motif is most important for association of Scd5p with Glc7p, but the first site might contribute to the interaction. To determine whether these potential PP1-binding motifs are important for Scd5p function, mutations in each or both of the sites were introduced into the full-length SCD5 expressed from its own promoter on a CEN LEU2 plasmid and tested for complementation of the scd5 null allele. YCp plasmids carrying scd5-PP1-binding site mutations were transformed into SL4121, which carries ascd5-Δ::TRP1 disruption but is viable because of the presence of SCD5 on a URA3 2-μ plasmid. Following plasmid shuffling on 5-FOA to force loss of theURA3 plasmid, the YCp, LEU2 plasmids became the sole source of Scd5 protein. Whereas cells expressing onlyscd5-PP1Δ1 grew normally at 25 and 37 °C,scd5-PP1Δ2 cells were temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the double mutant (Δ1Δ2) failed to complement a scd5null mutation at any temperature (Fig. 4A). Immunoblot analysis showed that Scd5p-PP1Δ1 was expressed at levels identical to the wild type protein, and Scd5p-PP1Δ2 was even slightly more abundant that normal Scd5p (Fig. 4B). We were unable to examine expression of the double mutant protein directly, since the strain is inviable. However, preliminary studies from expression of the double mutant protein in the presence of a functional copy ofSCD5 suggest that the double mutation causes protein instability. 2J. Chang, unpublished observations. This would explain the lack of interaction in the two-hybrid analysis and the lack of complementation of the null mutation at all temperatures. Thus, we conclude that the second PP1-binding site is most important for interaction of Glc7p with Scd5p and for the function of Scd5p. Recently our laboratory has shown that Scd5p plays a critical role in endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton organization (27Henry K.R. D'Hondt K. Chang J. Newpher T. Huang K. Hudson R.T. Riezman H. Lemmon S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2607-2625Google Scholar). Scd5p also co-localizes with cortical actin patches and physically or genetically interacts with a number of cortical actin patch components, many of which are also important for actin organization and endocytosis (27Henry K.R. D'Hondt K. Chang J. Newpher T. Huang K. Hudson R.T. Riezman H. Lemmon S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2607-2625Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the Scd5p-PP1-binding site mutations affect these processes. We first assayed endocytosis of lucifer yellow (LY), a fluid phase marker that accumulates in the vacuole upon internalization. Bothscd5-PP1Δ1 and scd5-PP1Δ2 cells internalized the dye efficiently at 25 °C (Fig. 5A). When cells were shifted to 37 °C for 15 min, scd5-PP1Δ1 cells still showed normal uptake, but endocytosis of LY by scd5-PP1Δ2cells was completely blocked (Fig. 5A). Receptor-mediated endocytosis of radiolabeled α-factor by its receptor, Ste2p, was normal in cells with scd5-PP1Δ1 at 24 and 37 °C. In contrast, α-factor uptake was impaired in scd5-PP1Δ2cells at 24 and 37 °C, although the defect at 24 °C was less severe (Fig. 5B). Thus, the scd5-PP1Δ2 mutation causes defects in both fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis. We next examin"

The platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP)1 VI plays a crucial role in platelet activation and thrombus formation and decreased levels or defective GPVI may lead to excessive bleeding. In addition, elevated levels of collagen receptors may predispose individuals to coronary heart disease or strokes. GPVI expression is restricted to platelets and their precursor cell, the megakaryocyte. In this study we investigate the regulation of GPVI expression and show that thrombopoietin induces its expression in the megakaryocytic cell line UT-7/TPO. A 5′-region flanking the transcription start point of the GPVI gene was cloned (−694 to +29) and we report that this putative GPVIpromoter bestows megakaryocye-specific expression. Deletion analyses and site-directed mutagenesis identified Sp1227, GATA177, and Ets48 sites as essential forGPVI expression. We show that transcription factors GATA-1, Fli-1, and Sp1 can bind to and activate this promoter. Finally, GPVI mRNA was detected only in megakaryocytic cell lines expressing both Fli-1 and GATA-1, and we show that overexpression of Fli-1 in a stable cell line (which expresses endogenous GATA-1 and Sp1) results in expression of the endogenous GPVI gene.

The molecular mechanisms controlling MK development and platelet production are of considerable interest for a number of reasons. First, the identification of transcription factors controlling MK-specific gene expression aid our understanding of blood cell lineage commitment. Second, MKs possess unique features such as polyploid nuclei, secretory granules, and proplatelets, the study of which contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms controlling cell cycle and organelle formation. Finally, the genetic basis of disease states such as bleeding disorders and leukemias may be elucidated from the study of platelet function and normal blood cell development.Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the major humoral regulator of megakaryopoiesis, and TPO-responsive genes play a major role in regulating MK development and platelet production. The binding of TPO to its receptor c-Mpl on the cell surface activates a number of distinct intracellular signaling cascades (Ref. 1Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Google Scholar and references within), resulting in the proliferation of MK progenitors and the expression of a number of cell-specific genes associated with MK differentiation such as GPIIb and GPIX (2Doubeikovski A. Uzan G. Doubeikovski Z. Prandini M.H. Porteu F. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Fourt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24300-24307Google Scholar,3Eisbacher M. Khachigian L.M. Khin T.H. Holmes M.L. Chong B.H. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 435-445Google Scholar).One approach to understanding the molecular basis of megakaryopoiesis is to identify genes that increase in expression following TPO stimulation. Because of the rarity of MKs in bone marrow, their isolation and subsequent culturing in vitro is not trivial. However, a number of cell lines with MK features exist and these have provided useful insights into megakaryopoiesis and the regulation of platelet-specific genes in particular. We have used the cytokine-responsive MK cell line UT-7/TPO and the technique of representational difference analysis (RDA) to isolate TPO-induced genes. This technique has the advantage over cDNA arrays as novel genes can potentially be identified and it is possible that MK-specific genes are underrepresented in data bases of expressed sequences and also on commercial cDNA arrays because of the low numbers of MKs. In this way, we have identified the MK and platelet-specific collagen receptor GPVI as one of the genes up-regulated in UT-7/TPO cells in response to TPO. Although GPVI has been the focus of several recent reports, the transcriptional regulation of this clinically relevant gene has not been determined. Therefore, we set about cloning the GPVI promoter and have identified the key transcription factor binding sites necessary for MK-specific expression, which include GATA, Ets, and Sp1. We demonstrate using gel shift analysis that GATA-1, Fli-1, and Sp1 can bind to these sites within theGPVI promoter and that their overexpression in non-MK cells can activate a GPVI-luciferase reporter in transient transfection assays. Moreover, Northern analysis of a variety of erythro-megakaryocytic cell lines revealed GPVI expression only in those cell lines expressing both Fli-1 and GATA-1. Finally, we show that overexpression of Fli-1 in K562 cells, which express Sp1 and GATA-1 but normally lack GPVI and Fli-1, results in the expression of the endogenous GPVI gene.DISCUSSIONThrombopoietin supports hematopoietic stem cell survival, stimulates progenitors committed to various lineages, causes megakaryocyte progenitors to proliferate, and induces the expression of surface proteins necessary for platelet function. To identify TPO-responsive genes, we used the RDA technique and this resulted in the cloning of a number of different cDNAs. Several of these correspond to genes encoding proteins involved in signaling, such as the hematopoietic-specific G protein Gα16 (18Amatruda 3rd, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Google Scholar), Stat5b, the Stat5 target genes SOCS-3 and Pim-1 (19Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Google Scholar), and CalDAG-GEF-1 (Map4K). Genes encoding enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is involved in gluconeogenesis, and cystathionine β synthase were also identified. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (or AUF1) was also cloned and this gene encodes a protein that binds to short lived mRNAs and is involved in regulating expression of genes such as c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos (20Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar). Although preliminary experiments suggested that the expression of these genes did increase following TPO stimulation of UT-7/TPO cells (Fig. 1A), their regulation is beyond the scope of this investigation and they were not pursued further. However, the isolation of GPVI and Pim-1 by RDA attest to the success of this technique as both GPVI and Pim-1 are indeed regulated by TPO (this report and Ref.11Nagata Y. Nagahisa H. Aida Y. Okutomi K. Nagasawa T. Todokoro K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19673-19675Google Scholar).GPVI, a collagen receptor specifically expressed on the surface of MKs and platelets, plays an important role in limiting blood loss. It is noncovalently associated with the Fc receptor γ chain, the signaling subunit of the complex. Upon injury of the vessel wall, collagen fibers are exposed that are highly thrombogenic. Initially, the platelets adhere to the collagen via integrin α2β1, and this is followed by platelet activation involving GPVI. Defective collagen-induced responses in a patient lacking GPVI testify to the importance of GPVI in this process (21Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Google Scholar). In addition, the level of collagen receptors on platelets may predispose individuals to either excessive bleeding (low collagen receptor levels) or coronary heart disease and strokes (high levels), and genetic screening of patients with a family history of these diseases for GPVI polymorphisms could aid the planning of treatment strategies (22Furihata K. Nugent D.J. Kunicki T.J. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2002; 126: 305-309Google Scholar). It is also possible that GPVI will prove to be a therapeutic target as mice treated with an anti-GPVI antibody prior to collagen and adrenalin infusion were protected from lethal thrombus formation (23Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Gachet C. Zirngibl H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 459-469Google Scholar).Because of the clinical importance of GPVI and its restricted expression to MKs and platelets, we chose to examine the regulation of this gene. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the abundance of GPVI mRNA increased in UT-7/TPO cells stimulated with TPO. Two transcripts were detected, a major 2-kb mRNA and a less abundant message of ∼3.6 kb. These two transcripts may represent alternatively spliced mRNAs, the utilization of an alternative promoter, or differences in the 3′-untranslated region. Three GPVI isoforms and differences in the 3′-regions have been discussed in another study (14Ezumi Y. Uchiyama T. Takayama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 27-36Google Scholar). GPVI levels have previously been shown to be higher in mature MKs than in immature cells (24Lagrue-Lak-Hal A.H. Debili N. Kingbury G. Lecut C. Le Couedic J.P. Villeval J.L. Jandrot-Perrus M. Vainchenker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15316-15325Google Scholar) and to increase in megakaryoblastic cell lines HEL and CMK induced to differentiate with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (13Berlanga O. Bobe R. Becker M. Murphy G. Leduc M. Bon C. Barry F.A. Gibbins J.M. Garcia P. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 2740-2745Google Scholar). However, the factors controlling the regulation ofGPVI expression have not been investigated.Several groups reported the cloning of the GPVI gene from mice and humans and have shown that its expression is restricted to embryonic liver, megakaryocytes, and platelets (12Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Google Scholar, 14Ezumi Y. Uchiyama T. Takayama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 27-36Google Scholar, 25Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29019-29024Google Scholar). The major transcription start site has been mapped to an adenosine 29 nucleotides upstream of the coding region (14Ezumi Y. Uchiyama T. Takayama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 27-36Google Scholar). In the present study, we have cloned a 694-bp region 5′-flanking the GPVI gene and have demonstrated that it includes the regulatory regions necessary for MK-specific expression. Our promoter deletion analysis has resulted in the identification of three regions (−235 to −210, −210 to −159, and −118 to −27), which are important for the positive regulation ofGPVI expression in UT-7/TPO cells. The binding of proteins present in UT-7/TPO nuclear extracts to Sp1227, GATA177, and Ets48 sites within these three regions was determined by EMSA. As Sp1, GATA-1, and Fli-1 are expressed in MKs and platelets, we used an Sp1 antibody and recombinant GATA-1 and Fli-1 proteins to demonstrate that these proteins can bind to theGPVI Sp1227, GATA177, and Ets48 motifs, respectively. The functional importance of these three sites was demonstrated by transient transfection of UT-7/TPO cells with GPVI-reporter constructs; the targeted disruption of any one of the sites reduced GPVI promoter activity. Mutation of GATA177 decreased the GPVIpromoter activity in UT-7/TPO cells by ∼94%. The disruption of Sp1227 and Ets48 sites decreased theGPVI promoter activity by 40 and 80%, respectively. In addition, co-transfection of Sp1, GATA-1, and Fli-1 expression plasmids with the GPVI-reporter construct increased luciferase levels between 2- and 30-fold. We found that GPVI is expressed only in the cell lines that express all three of these factors. Furthermore, the overexpression of Fli-1 in K562 cells (which express endogenous GATA-1 and Sp1) results in the expression of the endogenousGPVI, whereas, GPVI mRNA was not detected in K562 cells in the absence of Fli-1. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Fli-1, GATA-1, and Sp1 play a role in regulating GPVIexpression. However, the role if any, of these three factors in the induction of GPVI expression by TPO is unclear as their mRNA levels are constant throughout the time course of TPO induction. It is possible that these factors are subject to post-translational modifications or that additional factors that are regulated by TPO may bind to Fli-1, GATA-1, and/or Sp1 and augment their activity. The precedent for this is that although the TPO-responsive element within another MK-specific promoter, GPIX, has been mapped to an Ets site, and Fli-1 had been shown to bind to this site, a difference in Fli-1-binding activity before and after TPO induction could not be demonstrated (3Eisbacher M. Khachigian L.M. Khin T.H. Holmes M.L. Chong B.H. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 435-445Google Scholar). Future work could include the mapping of TPO-responsive elements within the GPVIpromoter.The analysis of cis-acting regulatory sequences in megakaryocyte-specific promoters has advanced our understanding of the control of differentiation and maturation in this lineage. A common theme to emerge from these studies is the presence of functional GATA and Ets elements in most MK-expressed genes (26Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Google Scholar, 27Deveaux S. Filipe A. Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Romeo P.H. Mignotte V. Blood. 1996; 87: 4678-4685Google Scholar, 28Bastian L.S. Yagi M. Chan C. Roth G.J. J.

An excellent example of the importance of GATA sites comes from the study of a patient suffering from Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a congenital bleeding disorder caused by insufficient expression of the GPIb-IX-V complex on MK and platelets (30Ludlow L.B. Schick B.P. Budarf M.L. Driscoll D.A. Zackai E.H. Cohen A. Konkle B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22076-22080Google Scholar). The cause was a mutation mapped to a GATA site in the GPIbβ promoter, and the corresponding mutation in aGPIbβ-reporter construct was shown to reduce expression by 84%.GATA-1 is the founding member of a family of DNA-binding zinc finger proteins that play crucial roles in cell development (for a review, see Ref. 31Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107Google Scholar). Although initial studies focused on the importance of GATA-1 in the erythroid lineage, such as its involvement in the regulation of the globin genes (32Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Google Scholar), the selective knockout of GATA-1 in the megakaryocytes of mice revealed that GATA-1 also plays a key role in megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production (33Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Google Scholar). In addition, a number of GATA-1 mutations have now been identified in humans suffering from X-linked thrombocytopenia (34Nichols K.E. Crispino J.D. Poncz M. White J.G. Orkin S.H. Maris J.M. Weiss M.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 266-270Google Scholar, 35Mehaffey M.G. Newton A.L. Gandhi M.J. Crossley M. Drachman J.G. Blood. 2001; 98: 2681-2688Google Scholar). However, the control of gene expression in megakaryocytes is not achieved through GATA-1 alone. Both cell-restricted and ubiquitous factors act in combination to enable the flexibility necessary for cell- and temporal-specific gene expression. Some of these factors, such as Fli-1, bind to distinct sequences in the regulatory regions of MK genes (17Bastian L.S. Kwiatkowski B.A. Breininger J. Danner S. Roth G. Blood. 1999; 93: 2637-2644Google Scholar), whereas others such as FOG-1 do not appear to contact DNA directly but modulate gene expression through their interaction with other factors (36Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Google Scholar, 37Gaines P. Geiger J.N. Knudsen G. Seshasayee D. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34114-34121Google Scholar).Fli-1, a member of the Ets family of winged helix-turn-helix proteins, has been implicated in the normal development of megakaryocytes. Inactivation of the Fli-1 gene in mice results in embryonic lethality because of hemorrhaging caused by vascular development abnormalities, but these mice also were found to have small, undifferentiated MK progenitors (38Hart A. Melet F. Grossfeld P. Chien K. Jones C. Tunnacliffe A. Favier R. Bernstein A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 167-177Google Scholar, 39Spyropoulos D.D. Pharr P.N. Lavenburg K.R. Jackers P. Papas T.S. Ogawa M. Watson D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5643-5652Google Scholar). The cooperative action of GATA-1 and Fli-1 during megakaryopoiesis is supported by the observed similarities between the GATA-1-null and Fli-1-null megakaryocyte abnormalities, the presence of functional GATA and Ets sites in the majority of MK gene promoters, and the demonstration that these two factors can directly interact.2The GPVI promoter lacks a TATA box (14Ezumi Y. Uchiyama T. Takayama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 27-36Google Scholar). Sp1 has frequently been shown to be involved in enhancing transcription of TATA-less promoters (40Emami K.H. Burke T.W. Smale S.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 839-846Google Scholar) and these include the α2 integrin andGPIIb gene promoters expressed in MKs (16Shou Y. Baron S. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5716-5726Google Scholar, 41Zutter M.M. Ryan E.E. Painter A.D. Blood. 1997; 90: 678-689Google Scholar). The α2 integrin, together with the β1 subunit, form another MK collagen receptor. A reduction in α2β1 receptors on MKs and platelets is associated with two single-base polymorphisms, C−52T and C−92G, found in the general population (42Jacquelin B. Tarantino M.D. Kritzik M. Rozenshteyn D. Koziol J.A. Nurden A.T. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1721-1726Google Scholar). The T−52 and G−92 substitutions have been shown to decrease binding of Sp1 to two adjacent sites and to reduceα2 gene transcription (42Jacquelin B. Tarantino M.D. Kritzik M. Rozenshteyn D. Koziol J.A. Nurden A.T. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1721-1726Google Scholar, 43Jacquelin B. Rozenshteyn D. Kanaji S. Koziol J.A. Nurden A.T. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23518-23524Google Scholar). Interestingly, there appears to be a correlation between α2β1 and GPVI content (22Furihata K. Nugent D.J. Kunicki T.J. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2002; 126: 305-309Google Scholar) and the involvement of Sp1 in the expression of both α2 andGPVI genes was also suggestive that these two receptors may be coordinately regulated.Recently, we have found that Fli-1 can bind to GATA-1 and together these factors synergistically activate the expression of two other MK genes GPIX and GPIbα.2 Sp1 is known to physically interact with GATA-1 (44Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Sp1, GATA-1, and Fli-1 binding to the Sp1, GATA, and Ets sites within the GPVI promoter are able interact directly with each other, and these interactions may be important for the correct regulation of the GPVI promoter. For example, physical interaction between GATA-1 and Fli-1 may be important for the transcriptional synergy we observe between GATA-1 and Fli-1 on theGPVI promoter. MK-specific expression of GPVI may then be achieved through the presence of a distinct combination ofcis-acting sites, the overlapping expression profiles of Sp1, GATA-1, and Fli-1 factors, and the recruitment of multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional activation. A better understanding of the regulation of GPVI expression adds to our knowledge of the molecular basis of MK maturation and should aid investigations into bleeding disorders and the role of collagen receptor levels as a potential risk factor for strokes and coronary heart disease. In turn, this knowledge may be exploited in the development of treatment strategies for these diseases. Megakaryopoiesis is the process by which hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow differentiate into mature megakaryocytes (MKs), 1The abbreviations used are: MK, megakaryocyte; GP, glycoprotein; nt, nucleotide(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); TPO, thrombopoietin; EPO, erythropoietin; RDA, representational difference analysis; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MK, megakaryocyte; GP, glycoprotein; nt, nucleotide(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); TPO, thrombopoietin; EPO, erythropoietin; RDA, representational difference analysis; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.which in turn release platelets into the bloodstream. The molecular mechanisms controlling MK development and platelet production are of considerable interest for a number of reasons. First, the identification of transcription factors controlling MK-specific gene expression aid our understanding of blood cell lineage commitment. Second, MKs possess unique features such as polyploid nuclei, secretory granules, and proplatelets, the study of which contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms controlling cell cycle and organelle formation. Finally, the genetic basis of disease states such as bleeding disorders and leukemias may be elucidated from the study of platelet function and normal blood cell development. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the major humoral regulator of megakaryopoiesis, and TPO-responsive genes play a major role in regulating MK development and platelet production. The binding of TPO to its receptor c-Mpl on the cell surface activates a number of distinct intracellular signaling cascades (Ref. 1Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Google Scholar and references within), resulting in the proliferation of MK progenitors and the expression of a number of cell-specific genes associated with MK differentiation such as GPIIb and GPIX (2Doubeikovski A.

https://openalex.org/W2055601770,"Regulators of programmed cell death were previously identified using a technical knockout genetic screen. Among the elements that inhibited interferon-γ-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells was a 441-nucleotide fragment derived from the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of KIAA0425, a gene of unknown function. This fragment was termed cell death inhibiting RNA (CDIR). Deletion and mutation analyses of CDIR were employed to identify the features required for its anti-apoptotic activity. Single nucleotide alterations within either copy of the duplicated U-rich motif found in the CDIR sequence abolished the anti-apoptotic activity of CDIR and altered its in vitro association with a protein complex. Further analysis of the CDIR-binding complex indicated that it contained heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and the regulator of mRNA turnover AUF1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D). In addition, recombinant AUF1 bound directly to CDIR. Furthermore, expression of another AUF1-binding RNA element, derived from the 3′-UTR of c-myc, inhibited apoptosis. We also demonstrate that the level and the stability of p21waf1/Cip1/sdi1 mRNA, a target of AUF1 with anti-apoptotic activity, were increased in CDIR-transfected cells. The level of mRNA and protein ofBcl-2, another anti-apoptotic gene, containing an AUF1 binding site in its 3′-UTR was also increased in CDIR-transfected cells. Our data suggest that AUF1 regulates apoptosis by altering mRNA turnover. We propose that CDIR inhibits apoptosis by acting as a competitive inhibitor of AUF1, preventing AUF1 from binding to its targets.

We propose that CDIR inhibits apoptosis by acting as a competitive inhibitor of AUF1, preventing AUF1 from binding to its targets. Programmed cell death is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays an essential role in development, tissue homeostasis, oncogenesis, and stress response (1Kaufmann S.H. Hengartner M.O.

One of the uncharacterized elements was a 441-nucleotide (nt) long U-rich RNA fragment derived from the 3′-UTR of the KIAA0425 transcript that we termed cell death inhibiting RNA (CDIR).KIAA0425 (ZNF262) is a ubiquitously expressed gene that is predicted to encode a 682-amino acid protein containing five novel octacysteine (C8) zinc finger-related motifs known as MYM domains (6Smedley D.

The mechanism by which expressing only a portion of a 3′-UTR controls cell behavior could be distinct in each case and may mimic the role the 3′-UTR plays in the context of an entire mRNA. It was demonstrated that regulatory elements positioned incis in a 3′-UTR affect various aspects of mRNA fate including mRNA transport, localization, stability, and translation (15Decker C.J. Parker R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 386-392Google Scholar, 16Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar, 17Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that effects of a 3′-UTR intrans are mediated through the regulation of similar processes.Multiple cis-acting determinants controlling mRNA fate and the trans-acting proteins that recognize these determinants have been described to date. Among these determinants are U- and AU-rich elements (ARE) that regulate mRNA stability and are positioned in the 3′-UTR of many mRNAs including oncogenes and cytokine mRNAs (18Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar, 19Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Google Scholar). Several proteins that bind to U- or AU-rich regions have been identified including mammalian members of the ELAV family such as Hel-N1, HuC, HuD, and HuR as well as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins: A0 A1, C, and D (AUF1) (20Wilkinson M.F. Shyu A.B. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 775-787Google Scholar). HuR and AUF1 have been shown to directly alter mRNA stability of ARE containing mRNA in vivo (21Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Google Scholar, 22Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Google Scholar, 23Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6960-6971Google Scholar).AUF1 is expressed as four related isoforms of 37, 40, 42, and 45 kDa derived by alternative splicing (24Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar, 25Nakamaki T. Imamura J. Brewer G. Tsuruoka N. Koeffler H.P. J.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that binding of AUF1 to AREs often results in acceleration of mRNA decay (27Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Google Scholar, 28Sirenko O.I.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar). Association of recombinant AUF1 with AtU-rich RNA results in formation of oligomeric AUF1 complexes on the RNA (30Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Google Scholar). This suggests that multiple U-rich stretches that are common motifs in AREs could be bound in a cooperative manner by multiple AUF1 molecules. That may explain why multiple U-rich stretches in a 3′-UTR are often required for maximum effect on mRNA stability (18Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar).Another class of proteins associated with mRNA stability is the heat shock proteins. Hsp70 family members were shown to bind to U-rich motifs associated with regulation of mRNA stability (31Henics T. Nagy E. Oh H.J. Csermely P. von Gabain A. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17318-17324Google Scholar, 32Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Google Scholar). Hsp70 was also reported to be in the complex with AUF1 (33Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Google Scholar). Another heat shock protein, Hsp27, regulates the stability of cycloxygenase-2 mRNA through an AU-rich element. Interestingly, this same element forms a complex with AUF1 (29Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar).In this report we demonstrate that expression of CDIR renders cells resistant to IFN-γ-induced killing. Mutation and deletion analyses revealed that single nucleotide substitutions in U-rich motifs of CDIR abolished its anti-apoptotic activity and these substitutions also altered the specific binding of a protein complex(es) to CDIR as detected by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA). Analysis of this protein complex(es) by heparin chromatography followed by affinity purification demonstrated that it contained both AUF1 and Hsp27. We further examined whether the binding of AUF1 to CDIR mediates the anti-apoptotic activity of the RNA fragment. We demonstrate that expression of another AUF1-binding fragment derived from c-myc protected cells from apoptosis. Moreover, the stability of mRNA encoding the AUF1 target p21 (34Bhattacharya S. Giordano T. Brewer G. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1464-1472Google Scholar, 35Goswami P.C. Sheren J. Albee L.D. Parsian A. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Higashikubo R. Gius D. Hunt C.R. Spitz D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38384-38392Google Scholar), was increased in CDIR-transfected cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the anti-apoptotic role of CDIR is mediated by sequestering AUF1 from cellular targets.DISCUSSIONThis report demonstrates a link between the anti-apoptotic effect of CDIR and the binding of CDIR by a protein complex containing AUF1 and Hsp27. Expression of CDIR, a 441-nt fragment of the 3′-UTR ofKIAA0425, renders HeLa cells resistant to killing by IFN-γ. A number of studies demonstrate that expression of 3′-UTRs may effect cell behavior (10Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 903-917Google Scholar, 11Rastinejad F. Conboy M.J. Rando T.A. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1107-1117Google Scholar, 12Jupe E.R. Liu X.T. Kiehlbauch J.L. McClung J.K. Dell'Orco R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 128-135Google Scholar, 13Fan H. Villegas C. Huang A. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4366-4399Google Scholar, 14Powell A.J. Gates P.B. Wylie D. Velloso C.P. Brockes J.P. Jat P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 252-262Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the only defined mechanism is the suppression of tumor formation by the 3′-UTR of α-tropomyosin that is mediated through binding and activation of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR (11Rastinejad F. Conboy M.J. Rando T.A. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1107-1117Google Scholar, 44Davis S. Watson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 508-513Google Scholar). Regulation of PKR activity requires double stranded RNA structures rather than specific sequence (45Clemens M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 945-949Google Scholar). Structure and function analyses of CDIR revealed that its anti-apoptotic activity is independent of secondary structure but is sequence specific. In addition, we failed to detect PKR in the CDIR-binding complex (data not shown). Thus, CDIR is unlikely to be involved in regulation of PKR.We here demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic activity of CDIR is highly dependent on the sequence of U-rich elements. Substitution of nucleotides in positions 4493 (5′ CDIR) or 4728 (3′ CDIR) that affect both motifs AUUUUC and UUUCAUUUU abolish the ability of CDIR to protect cells from killing. We demonstrate that alterations at position 4510 that resides outside of any U-rich region had no noticeable effect on CDIR activity. The base substitutions that created 5′ CDIR and 3′ CDIR also affect the efficiency of complex formation between CDIR and a subset of proteins. Hence, we propose that the proteins that preferentially form complexes with CDIR but do not bind or bind with low affinity to the biologically inactive CDIR mutants, mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of CDIR.Fractionation of the CDIR-binding factors by heparin chromatography followed by affinity purification revealed two distinct sets of proteins of 40–45 and 25 kDa. Further characterization of the CDIR-binding complex by REMSA revealed the presence of both AUF1 and Hsp27. Whether Hsp27 contributes to the anti-apoptotic activity of CDIR is currently unknown. We speculate that Hsp27 might modulate AUF1 activity as it was reported to modulate RNase P (46Jiang T. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 920-925Google Scholar). Our results implicating Hsp27 as part of the same complex formed by AUF1 and CDIR coincides with the earlier observation that Hsp27 regulates the stability of Cox-2mRNA through an AUF1-binding element (29Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp27 can form multimeric complexes (47Arrigo A.P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Google Scholar). AUF1 has also been reported to form oligomers (30Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Google Scholar). It is possible that a complex between CDIR, AUF1, and Hsp27 is formed in a cooperative manner allowing the optimal recruitment of protein molecules into the complex.AUF1 is an RNA as well as a DNA-binding protein (24Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar, 48Eversole A. Maizels N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5425-5432Google Scholar). It is generally acknowledged that AUF1 is involved in the regulation of mRNA turnover through direct binding to the 3′-UTRs of the target mRNAs (16Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar, 24Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar, 29Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar, 49Buzby J.S. Brewer G. Nugent D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33973-33978Google Scholar). AUF1 binds specifically and with high affinity to c-myc, c-fos, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and other early response mRNAs (24Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar, 25Nakamaki T. Imamura J. Brewer G. Tsuruoka N. Koeffler H.P. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 165: 484-492Google Scholar,28Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. DeMaria C.T. Morris J.S. Brewer G. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3898-3906Google Scholar). To determine whether AUF1 binding to CDIR contributed to CDIR anti-apoptotic activity, we tested another noncoding RNA region that binds AUF1. We demonstrated that the AUF1 binding region of c-myc (c-myc ARE) inhibits IFN-γ-induced killing of HeLa cells as measured in short term assays. It should be noted that the expression of c-myc ARE could not protect HeLa cells from induction of apoptosis in the long term colony formation assay (data not shown). It is possible, that together with AUF1, there are other factors, so far unidentified, that are involved in the sustained protection of HeLa cells by CDIR. Therefore, binding of AUF1 protein to CDIR is one of the events required for the anti-apoptotic function of CDIR.Since no direct effects on AUF1 levels were observed in CDIR-transfected cells, it is possible that expression of AUF1 targets, such as CDIR and c-myc 3′-UTR, modulates AUF1 activity through the sequestration of this protein from other cellular targets. We propose that the anti-apoptotic effect of CDIR is mediated through AUF1 targets whose turnovers become critical upon induction of killing. To test this hypothesis, we examined mRNAs that are likely to be regulated by AUF1, cyclin kinase inhibitor p21, andBcl-2. p21 is reported to inhibit apoptosis in response to various stimuli including IFN-γ treatment. Anti-apoptotic activity of p21 is believed to be independent from its regulation of cell cycle arrest (reviewed in Ref. 50Roninson I.B. Cancer Lett. 2002; 179: 1-14Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that AUF1 binds and mediates the decay of p21 mRNA (34Bhattacharya S. Giordano T. Brewer G. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1464-1472Google Scholar, 35Goswami P.C. Sheren J. Albee L.D. Parsian A. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Higashikubo R. Gius D. Hunt C.R. Spitz D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38384-38392Google Scholar). We observed a stabilization of p21 transcript and an increase in p21 protein levels in CDIR-transfected cells. The abundance of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 mRNA and protein were also increased in CDIR-transfected cells.Deregulation of the turnover of AUF1 mRNA targets is linked to several pathologies possibly associated with a decrease in cell death (17Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Google Scholar). For example, truncation of an AUF1 destabilization element in the 3′-UTR of TNF-α mRNA leads to deregulated production of TNF-α resulting in chronic inflammatory arthritis (51Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Google Scholar). Increased stability of Bcl-2 mRNA because of alteration in the U-rich region in the 3′-UTR may contribute to the overproduction of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein that is responsible for transformation of follicular B-cell lymphoma (52Capaccioli S. Quattrone A. Schiavone N. Calastretti A. Copreni E. Bevilacqua A. Canti G. Gong L. Morelli S. Nicolin A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 105-115Google Scholar, 53Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Brewer G. Schiavone N. Capaccioli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16139-16146Google Scholar). Because Bcl-2 mRNA contains an AUF1 binding sequence in the 3′-UTR (53Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Brewer G. Schiavone N. Capaccioli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16139-16146Google Scholar) it is likely that expression of CDIR interferes with AUF1 binding, resulting in increased levels of Bcl-2mRNA.Here we show that mRNA decay is affected by overexpression of two different AUF1 targets, namely CDIR (a fragment of KIAA0425) and c-myc ARE. Thus, RNA molecules bound by AUF1 can significantly alter the response of cells to the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, a single base substitution in such RNA can completely abolish this activity by modulating protein complex formation. Thus, we propose that minor alterations in the UTR of a gene might lead to significant consequences in cell behavior that are independent of the coding capacity of the mRNA. Programmed cell death is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays an essential role in development, tissue homeostasis, oncogenesis, and stress response (1Kaufmann S.H. Hengartner M.O.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that binding of AUF1 to AREs often results in acceleration of mRNA decay (27Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Google Scholar, 28Sirenko O.I.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar). Association of recombinant AUF1 with AtU-rich RNA results in formation of oligomeric AUF1 complexes on the RNA (30Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Google Scholar). This suggests that multiple U-rich stretches that are common motifs in AREs could be bound in a cooperative manner by multiple AUF1 molecules. That may explain why multiple U-rich stretches in a 3′-UTR are often required for maximum effect on mRNA stability (18Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar). Another class of proteins associated with mRNA stability is the heat shock proteins. Hsp70 family members were shown to bind to U-rich motifs associated with regulation of mRNA stability (31Henics T. Nagy E. Oh H.J. Csermely P. von Gabain A. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17318-17324Google Scholar, 32Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Google Scholar). Hsp70 was also reported to be in the complex with AUF1 (33Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Google Scholar). Another heat shock protein, Hsp27, regulates the stability of cycloxygenase-2 mRNA through an AU-rich element. Interestingly, this same element forms a complex with AUF1 (29Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that expression of CDIR renders cells resistant to IFN-γ-induced killing. Mutation and deletion analyses revealed that single nucleotide substitutions in U-rich motifs of CDIR abolished its anti-apoptotic activity and these substitutions also altered the specific binding of a protein complex(es) to CDIR as detected by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA). Analysis of this protein complex(es) by heparin chromatography followed by affinity purification demonstrated that it contained both AUF1 and Hsp27. We further examined whether the binding of AUF1 to CDIR mediates the anti-apoptotic activity of the RNA fragment. We demonstrate that expression of another AUF1-binding fragment derived from c-myc protected cells from apoptosis. Moreover, the stability of mRNA encoding the AUF1 target p21 (34Bhattacharya S. Giordano T. Brewer G. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1464-1472Google Scholar, 35Goswami P.C. Sheren J. Albee L.D. Parsian A. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Higashikubo R. Gius D. Hunt C.R. Spitz D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38384-38392Google Scholar), was increased in CDIR-transfected cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the anti-apoptotic role of CDIR is mediated by sequestering AUF1 from cellular targets. DISCUSSIONThis report demonstrates a link between the anti-apoptotic effect of CDIR and the binding of CDIR by a protein complex containing AUF1 and Hsp27. Expression of CDIR, a 441-nt fragment of the 3′-UTR ofKIAA0425, renders HeLa cells resistant to killing by IFN-γ. A number of studies demonstrate that expression of 3′-UTRs may effect cell behavior (10Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 903-917Google Scholar, 11Rastinejad F. Conboy M.J. Rando T.A. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1107-1117Google Scholar, 12Jupe E.R. Liu X.T. Kiehlbauch J.L. McClung J.K. Dell'Orco R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 128-135Google Scholar, 13Fan H. Villegas C. Huang A. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4366-4399Google Scholar, 14Powell A.J. Gates P.B. Wylie D. Velloso C.P. Brockes J.P. Jat P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 252-262Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the only defined mechanism is the suppression of tumor formation by the 3′-UTR of α-tropomyosin that is mediated through binding and activation of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR (11Rastinejad F. Conboy M.J. Rando T.A. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1107-1117Google Scholar, 44Davis S. Watson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 508-513Google Scholar). Regulation of PKR activity requires double stranded RNA structures rather than specific sequence (45Clemens M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 945-949Google Scholar). Structure and function analyses of CDIR revealed that its anti-apoptotic activity is independent of secondary structure but is sequence specific. In addition, we failed to detect PKR in the CDIR-binding complex (data not shown). Thus, CDIR is unlikely to be involved in regulation of PKR.We here demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic activity of CDIR is highly dependent on the sequence of U-rich elements. Substitution of nucleotides in positions 4493 (5′ CDIR) or 4728 (3′ CDIR) that affect both motifs AUUUUC and UUUCAUUUU abolish the ability of CDIR to protect cells from killing. We demonstrate that alterations at position 4510 that resides outside of any U-rich region had no noticeable effect on CDIR activity. The base substitutions that created 5′ CDIR and 3′ CDIR also affect the efficiency of complex formation between CDIR and a subset of proteins. Hence, we propose that the proteins that preferentially form complexes with CDIR but do not bind or bind with low affinity to the biologically inactive CDIR mutants, mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of CDIR.Fractionation of the CDIR-binding factors by heparin chromatography followed by affinity purification revealed two distinct sets of proteins of 40–45 and 25 kDa. Further characterization of the CDIR-binding complex by REMSA revealed the presence of both AUF1 and Hsp27. Whether Hsp27 contributes to the anti-apoptotic activity of CDIR is currently unknown. We speculate that Hsp27 might modulate AUF1 activity as it was reported to modulate RNase P (46Jiang T. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 920-925Google Scholar). Our results implicating Hsp27 as part of the same complex formed by AUF1 and CDIR coincides with the earlier observation that Hsp27 regulates the stability of Cox-2mRNA through an AUF1-binding element (29Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp27 can form multimeric complexes (47Arrigo A.P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Google Scholar). AUF1 has also been reported to form oligomers (30Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Google Scholar). It is possible that a complex between CDIR, AUF1, and Hsp27 is formed in a cooperative manner allowing the optimal recruitment of protein molecules into the complex.AUF1 is an RNA as well as a DNA-binding protein (24Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar, 48Eversole A. Maizels N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5425-5432Google Scholar). It is generally acknowledged that AUF1 is involved in the regulation of mRNA turnover through direct binding to the 3′-UTRs of the target mRNAs (16Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar, 24Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33973-33978Google Scholar). AUF1 binds specifically and with high affinity to c-myc, c-fos, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and other early response mRNAs (24Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Google Scholar, 25Nakamaki T. Imamura J. Brewer G. Tsuruoka N. Koeffler H.P. J.

To determine whether AUF1 binding to CDIR contributed to CDIR anti-apoptotic activity, we tested another noncoding RNA region that binds AUF1. We demonstrated that the AUF1 binding region of c-myc (c-myc ARE) inhibits IFN-γ-induced killing of HeLa cells as measured in short term assays. It should be noted that the expression of c-myc ARE could not protect HeLa cells from induction of apoptosis in the long term colony formation assay (data not shown). It is possible, that together with AUF1, there are other factors, so far unidentified, that are involved in the sustained protection of HeLa cells by CDIR. Therefore, binding of AUF1 protein to CDIR is one of the events required for the anti-apoptotic function of CDIR.Since no direct effects on AUF1 levels were observed in CDIR-transfected cells, it is possible that expression of AUF1 targets, such as CDIR and c-myc 3′-UTR, modulates AUF1 activity through the sequestration of this protein from other cellular targets. We propose that the anti-apoptotic effect of CDIR is mediated through AUF1 targets whose turnovers become critical upon induction of killing. To test this hypothesis, we examined mRNAs that are likely to be regulated by AUF1, cyclin kinase inhibitor p21, andBcl-2. p21 is reported to inhibit apoptosis in response to various stimuli including IFN-γ treatment. Anti-apoptotic activity of p21 is believed to be independent from its regulation of cell cycle arrest (reviewed in Ref. 50Roninson I.B. Cancer Lett. 2002; 179: 1-14Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that AUF1 binds and mediates the decay of p21 mRNA (34Bhattacharya S. Giordano T. Brewer G. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1464-1472Google Scholar, 35Goswami P.C. Sheren J. Albee L.D. Parsian A. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Higashikubo R. Gius D. Hunt C.R. Spitz D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38384-38392Google Scholar). We observed a stabilization of p21 transcript and an increase in p21 protein levels in CDIR-transfected cells. The abundance of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 mRNA and protein were also increased in CDIR-transfected cells.Deregulation of the turnover of AUF1 mRNA targets is linked to several pathologies possibly associated with a decrease in cell death (17Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Google Scholar). For example, truncation of an AUF1 destabilization element in the 3′-UTR of TNF-α mRNA leads to deregulated production of TNF-α resulting in chronic inflammatory arthritis (51Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Google Scholar). Increased stability of Bcl-2 mRNA because of alteration in the U-rich region in the 3′-UTR may contribute to the overproduction of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein that is responsible for transformation of follicular B-cell lymphoma (52Capaccioli S. Quattrone A. Schiavone N. Calastretti A. Copreni E. Bevilacqua A. Canti G. Gong L. Morelli S. Nicolin A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 105-115Google Scholar, 53Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Brewer G. Schiavone N. Capaccioli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16139-16146Google Scholar). Because Bcl-2 mRNA contains an AUF1 binding sequence in the 3′-UTR (53Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Brewer G. Schiavone N. Capaccioli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16139-16146Google Scholar) it is likely that expression of CDIR interferes with AUF1 binding, resulting in increased levels of Bcl-2mRNA.Here we show that mRNA decay is affected by overexpression of two different AUF1 targets, namely CDIR (a fragment of KIAA0425) and c-myc ARE. Thus, RNA molecules bound by AUF1 can significantly alter the response of cells to the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, a single base substitution in such RNA can completely abolish this activity by modulating protein complex formation. Thus, we propose that minor alterations in the UTR of a gene might lead to significant consequences in cell behavior that are independent of the coding capacity of the mRNA. This report demonstrates a link between the anti-apoptotic effect of CDIR and the binding of CDIR by a protein complex containing AUF1 and Hsp27.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the neural and developmental specific expression of NR2A, an upstream ∼9-kb region of the gene harboring the promoter was isolated and characterized in transgenic mice and transfected cortical neurons. Transgenic mouse lines generated with luciferase reporter constructs driven by either 9 or 1 kb of upstream sequence selectively transcribe the transgene in brain, as compared with other non-neural tissues. Reporter luciferase levels in dissociated cultures made from these mice are over 100-fold greater in neuronal/glial co-cultures than in pure glial cultures. Analysis of NR2A 5′-nested deletions in transfected cultures of cortical neurons and glia indicate that while sequences residing upstream of −1079 bp augment NR2A neuronal expression, sequences between −486 and −447 bp are sufficient to maintain neuronal preference. An RE1/NRSE element is not necessary for NR2A neuron specificity. Furthermore, comparison of the 5′-deletion constructs in cortical neurons grown for 5, 8, 11, or 14 days in vitro indicate that sequences between −1253 and −1180 bp are necessary for maturational up-regulation of NR2A. Thus, differentcis-acting sequences control the regional and temporal expression of NR2A, implicating distinct regulatory pathways.

Furthermore, comparison of the 5′-deletion constructs in cortical neurons grown for 5, 8, 11, or 14 days in vitro indicate that sequences between −1253 and −1180 bp are necessary for maturational up-regulation of NR2A. Thus, differentcis-acting sequences control the regional and temporal expression of NR2A, implicating distinct regulatory pathways. The targeting of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors to their correct cellular location is crucial for the proper development and connectivity of the nervous system. The first level of the intricate spatio-temporal organization required to form the central nervous system is ensuring that genes are transcribed in the appropriate cell types. Although studies on a small number of central nervous system-specific genes have significantly contributed to the identification of cis- and trans-acting elements necessary for neuron-specific transcription (1Maue R.A. Kraner S.D. Goodman R.H. Mandel G. Neuron. 1990; 4: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Wuenschell C.W. Mori N. Anderson D.J.

Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), the expression profiles of different neuronal genes are very diverse. This diversity provides a unique opportunity to identify novel mechanisms that confine gene expression to selective cell populations during development. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and its signals are transduced by activation of either G-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors or ligand-gated ion channels, referred to as ionotropic receptors. Three families of ionotropic receptors are recognized based on their pharmacological agonist preference for N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), 1The abbreviations used for: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; DIV, daysin vitro ; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RT, reverse transcriptase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RLM-RACE, 5′-RNA ligase-mediated RACE; RPA, RNase protection assay; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MEM, minimal essential medium; HS, horse serum; UTR, untranslated region; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; RE1/NRSE, restrictive element 1/neuron-restrictive silencer element; REST/NRSF, RE1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), or kainate. NMDA receptors are especially interesting because of their high Ca2+ permeability (5MacDermott A.B. Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Smith S.J. Barker J.L. Nature. 1986; 321: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 6Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 1987; 28: 197-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) and unique gating properties. In addition to ligand binding, postsynaptic membrane depolarization is necessary to remove a Mg2+ ion residing in the channel that blocks ion flux at neuronal resting potentials (7Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Guthrie P.B. Nature. 1984; 309: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 8Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Herbet A. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1984; 307: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar). The requirement for concomitant ligand binding and postsynaptic membrane depolarization makes the NMDA receptor an ideal coincidence detector of synaptic function. Consistent with these properties, NMDA receptors have been implicated in the induction of long term potentiation (9Collingridge G.L. Kehl S.J. McLennan H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 334: 33-46Crossref Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) and in the refinement of synaptic connections during development (10Cline H.T. Debski E.A. Constantine-Paton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The overstimulation of NMDA receptors can result in excitotoxic neuronal death (reviewed in Ref. 14Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors are composed of multiple subunits, which are encoded by three families of genes: NR1 (Grin1), NR2 (Grin2), and NR3 (Grin3). The obligatory NR1 subunit is encoded by a single gene (15Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 16Yamazaki M. Mori H. Araki K. Mori K.J. Mishina M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) but is alternatively spliced to produce eight distinct isoforms (17Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). NR2 subunits are encoded by four separate genes (NR2A–NR2D) (Grin2a–Grin2d) (18Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar, 19Meguro H. Mori H. Araki K. Kushiya E.

Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Mishina M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These subunits, when hetero-oligomerized with NR1, largely determine the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the receptor such as single channel conductance, inactivation kinetics, Mg2+ sensitivity, and affinity for a variety of competitive and non-competitive antagonists (reviewed in Refs. 22Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar and 23Stephenson F.A. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The recently described NR3 subunits are encoded by two genes and have been termed modulatory subunits because they down-regulate receptor function when co-assembled into NR1/NR2 receptors (24Das S. Sasaki Y.F. Rothe T. Premkumar L.S. Takasu M. Crandall J.E. Dikkes P. Conner D.A. Rayudu P.V. Cheung W. Chen H.S. Lipton S.A. Nakanishi N.

In addition to the different physiological properties that NR2 subunits impart on NMDA receptors, their expression profiles differ during development. Whereas NR2B and NR2D mRNAs are already present during fetal development, NR2A and NR2C begin to be expressed postnatally (26Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 1138-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar,27Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2881) Google Scholar). In the telencephalon, where NR2C and NR2D are minimally expressed and NR2B is ubiquitously present from mid-gestation onward, the postnatal appearance and dramatic up-regulation of NR2A is a major determinant of receptor heterogeneity in maturing neurons. The timing of NR2A up-regulation and the faster inactivation kinetics this subunit imparts on the NMDA channel led to the idea that NR2A-containing receptors may define critical periods (28Carmignoto G. Vicini S. Science. 1992; 258: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 29Flint A.C. Maisch U.S. Weishaupt J.H. Kriegstein A.R. Monyer H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2469-2476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a recent report (30Lu H.C. Gonzalez E. Crair M.C. Neuron. 2001; 32: 619-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) found this view inconsistent with critical periods associated with the refinement of somatosensory maps, the appearance of NR2A-containing receptors may play a role in defining critical periods in visual cortex. In contrast to NR2B, NR2A selectively localizes at synapses (31Li J.H. Wang Y.H. Wolfe B.B. Krueger K.E. Corsi L. Stocca G. Vicini S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1704-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a unique role in synaptic transmission. In fact, NR2A knock-out mice have a marked reduction in long term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and manifest behavioral deficits in the Morris water maze (33Sakimura K. Kutsuwada T. Ito I. Manabe T. Takayama C. Kushiya E. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Inoue Y. Sugiyama H. Mishina M. Nature. 1995; 373: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 34Sprengel R. Suchanek B.

Cell. 1998; 92: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Given the importance of NR2A, it is of considerable interest to elucidate the pathways that modulate its expression. Multiple mechanisms are utilized to regulate the cellular and subcellular levels of NR2A-containing receptors. In addition to the developmental increase in NR2A steady-state mRNA and protein levels (18Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4376-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of NR2A-containing receptors may be translationally and post-translationally controlled. InXenopus oocytes, secondary mRNA structure directly upstream of the translation initiation site blocks NR2A translation (39Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M. VanDongen A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8115-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A recent report by Quinlan et al. (40Quinlan E.M. Philpot B.D. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) suggests that translation of dendritic NR2A mRNA may contribute to the rapid pharmacological changes in NMDA receptors observed when dark-reared rats are exposed to light. Similar to AMPA receptors, the surface expression of NMDA receptors can be modulated by insertional dynamics (40Quinlan E.M. Philpot B.D. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 41Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J.

Although all of these levels of regulation interact to determine the number of functional NR2A-containing receptors on the cell surface, the proper cellular and temporal transcription of the NR2A gene is a necessary prerequisite for further levels of regulation. With this in mind, we set out to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuronal specific expression and developmental up-regulation of NR2A transcription. To screen genomic sequences mapping to the 5′-end of the NR2A gene, an RT-PCR fragment was amplified from 8-week-old mouse forebrain RNA using primers located 233 bp upstream (5′-AACTATGTGGAGAGAGGCTGC-3′) and 25 bp downstream (5′-AGGTCCAGTAGCCCAG-3′) of the NR2A translation start site. This 258-bp 32P-labeled fragment was used to screen an SVJ mouse genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). Initially, three NR2A-positive BAC clones were isolated. Two of these proved to correspond to the NR2A gene when analyzed on Southern blots probed with the end-labeled upstream primer. Further restriction mapping analyses and Southern blotting using additional oligonucleotide probes demonstrated that both BAC clones encompass similar regions of the NR2A gene. Restriction fragments of ∼9 kb (ApaI) and 1 kb (MluI/ApaI), containing the NR2A 5′-UTR sequence, were excised from one of the BACs and subcloned into pBSK(+) (Stratagene). The shorter construct was used to determine the sequence (Applied Biosystems PRISM kit) of the putative core promoter region on an Applied Biosystems PRISM 310 DNA sequencer. To analyze NR2A transcription regulatory sequences, the 9- and 1-kb genomic fragments were subcloned into the promoter-less luciferase reporter vector pGL-3 Basic; a 33-bp intronic region at the 3′-ends of both fragments had to be removed prior to subcloning. An oligonucleotide primer that generates an artificial XhoI site at the 3′-exonic boundary and a 5′-primer that contains the nativeMluI site were used to generate anMluI/XhoI PCR fragment that was subcloned into pGL-3 Basic to generate −1253/−210 NR2A luciferase (Fig.3 A). The ∼9-kb ApaI fragment was also subcloned into pGL-3 Basic, cut with MluI and XhoI to remove ∼1 kb of 3′-sequence, and then ligated with theMluI/XhoI PCR fragment to generate the intron-less −9.2-kb/−210 NR2A luciferase construct. Subsequent nested 5′-deletions of the NR2A genomic sequence were generated by PCR, using primers that contained 5′ MluI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites. All PCR products were verified by sequencing and then directionally cloned into pGL3-Basic. A modified rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends (5′-RACE) protocol, which selects for 5′-capped mRNAs (Ambion, FirstChoiceTM RLM-RACE kit), was used to define the transcription initiation sites for NR2A using recommendations from the manufacturer. Briefly, 1–5 μg of total RNA from DIV 14–15 mixed murine cortical cultures was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase followed by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the cap structure. T4 RNA ligase was used to ligate the 45-bp RNA adapter, and the RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase and an NR2A-specific primer (+1/+25) (5′-AGGTCCAGTAGCCCAGTCTGCCCAT-3′). cDNAs were amplified with nested primers to the RNA adapter (5′-GCTGATGGCGATGAATGAACACTG-3′) and an antisense NR2A-specific primer bridging the exon 2/exon 3 boundary (−28/−9) (5′-CTTAGGGTCCCTGTAGCCGG-3′). The first PCR was re-amplified using a nested inner RNA adapter primer (Ambion, RLM-RACE kit) and one of three antisense NR2A-specific primers: the exon 2/exon 3 boundary primer (above), exon 1/exon 2 boundary primer (−220/−201) (5′- AGCAGGGCTCGCAGCCTCTC-3′), or a primer in the middle of exon 1 (−822/−802) (5′-TTGGAGCTCTGGTCCGCCTGC-3′). PCR was carried out using Advantage −GC Genomic polymerase mix (Clontech), using the following conditions: denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min, 25 cycles amplification 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products from the second amplification were resolved on 2% agarose gels, transferred to GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and analyzed on Southern blots probed with specific nested NR2A primers (−230/−208, 5′-CTCGCAGCCTCTCTCACATAGTT-3′, or −837/−818, 5′-CCTGCAGCCGCCCACCCCGG-3′). The NR2A transcription initiation sites were mapped by sequencing the PCR products that were cloned in pGEM-T Easy (Promega) with T7 and SP6 primers using the Applied Biosystems PRISM dRhodamine Terminator Cycle kit. The RNase protection assay (RPA) was performed using the Ambion RPAII kit. Antisense32P-radiolabeled probes were synthesized with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase from four subclones of NR2A extending ∼1 kb of upstream sequence generated by subcloning the following fragments into pBSK:MluI −1253 to SmaI −1011, SmaI −1011 to SacI −805, SacI −805 toBamHI −673, and BamHI −506 to SacI −289. A non-radiolabeled NR2A sense RNA (MluI toApaI, 1078 bp) was synthesized in parallel for use in control experiments. All transcripts were gel-purified on 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing gels to isolate full-length cRNA and sense probes. 20 μg of total adult mouse forebrain or liver RNA were hybridized with ∼2–6 × 105 cpm. of probe in 80% formamide, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.4, and 1 mm EDTA (12 h at 42 °C), treated with 0.5 units of RNase A and 20 units of RNase T1 for 30 min at 37 °C and resolved on 5% acrylamide, 8m urea denaturing gels. Gels were dried prior to autoradiography. Primary murine cortical cultures containing both neurons and glia were transfected on DIV 11 (as described below) with the luciferase reporter constructs −9.2-kb/−210 or −1253/−210 NR2A (described above and Fig. 3 A). On DIV 14 cultures were harvested and RNA-purified by ultracentrifugation on a CsCl cushion. 20 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane on a 1.2% agarose/MOPS/formaldehyde gel, transferred by electroblotting, and probed with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the ∼1-kb NcoI/AvaI fragment of luciferase, and washed at high stringency. Blots were subsequently exposed to Kodak x-ray film at −70 °C for 5–7 days. To isolate DNA fragments free of plasmid sequences for the generation of transgenic mice, the luciferase reporter vectors −9.2-kb/−210 and −1253/−210 NR2A (described above) were digested withApaI/SalI or MluI/SalI, respectively. Fragments were resolved on 0.8% agarose gels and purified by electroelution. Transgenic lines were generated and propagated in FVB/N mice using methods described previously (44Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Putative founders and their offspring were screened for transgene integration by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA using a luciferase-specific probe. For luciferase activity analysis, tissues from 6-week-old transgenic mice were collected and homogenized in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and the supernatants were collected for analysis. Luciferase activities were assayed on a Berthold Lumat LB9507 luminometer; activities were normalized to total protein concentration as determined by a Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Samples from wild-type mice were used to assess background values. Mixed cortical cultures, containing both neurons and glia, were prepared as described previously (45Rose K. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. Tyson C.A. Frazier J.M. In Vitro Biological Systems. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 46-60Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated neocortices from E15 mice were resuspended in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM, Earle's salts) supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 5% horse serum (HS), and plated onto a previously established glial monolayer at a density of 0.5 × 106cells per pit (in a 24-well plate). Medium was changed after 1 week to MEM supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 2 mmglutamine, and 10% HS, as well as cytosine arabinoside (final concentration 10 μm) to inhibit cell division. Subsequently, cultures were fed once more with 10% HS medium and moved into serum-free medium on DIV 12. Glial monolayers were prepared from dissociated neocortices of postnatal day 1–2 mice. Cells were plated in Earle's MEM supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% HS, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor at a density of 2 hemispheres per 24-well plate. Plates were coated with poly-d-lysine (100 ng/ml) and laminin (4 ng/ml) on the day prior to the dissection. In experiments where mixed cultures were compared with pure glial cultures, a single glial dissection was used to generate all plates. From the time of neuronal plating, glial and mixed cultures were fed in parallel and treated identically. Cells were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate technique based on that of Xia et al. (46Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA purity is a crucial factor in obtaining fine precipitates and good neuronal transfection efficiency, which was typically >2%. All constructs were purified using a spheroplast protocol to reduce lipopolysaccharide contamination (47Wicks I.P. Howell M.L. Hancock T. Kohsaka H. Olee T. Carson D.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), followed by alkaline lysis and two rounds of CsCl gradient purification. For most experiments cortical cultures plated in 24-well plates were transfected on DIV 11. Approximately 1 h prior to transfection, cultures were washed into high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, 11995-073) containing 4 mm kynurenic acid and returned to the incubator to re-equilibrate. Kynurenic acid was included in all transfections performed after DIV 7 to minimize neuronal damage cause by endogenous glutamate release. To form the precipitate, 13.3 μg of double CsCl gradient purified DNA was diluted into 180 μl of H2O and mixed with 20 μl of 2.5m CaCl2. Equimolar amounts of DNA were used in all conditions; for constructs smaller than −9.2-kb/−210 NR2A luciferase pBluescript was added for mass adjustment. This DNA solution was then added dropwise to an equal volume (200 μl) of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (HeBS), pH 7.12, and left at room temperature for 25 min to form a precipitate. 2× HeBS contains 275 mmNaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mmNa2HPO4, 15 mmd-glucose, and 42 mm HEPES, brought to pH using NaOH. 45 μl of the DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate was then added dropwise to each well, and cells were returned to the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 10 min. The DNA precipitate was gently centrifuged onto the cells by spinning plates for 1 min at 300 rpm (17 × g) in a Savant Cell Culture Centrifuge at room temperature. Plates were returned to the incubator for an additional hour. Transfection was terminated by washing three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove excess precipitate and returning the cells to growth media (MEM supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 3% HS) containing 4 mm kynurenic acid. Cultures were switched into serum-free media containing 4 mm kynurenic acid on DIV 12, and subsequently harvested on DIV 17 in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). For developmental analysis, cultures were transfected on DIV 3 without kynurenic acid (which was not necessary at this early date) and harvested either on DIV 5, 8, 11, or 14. Luciferase activities were measured using a Promega assay kit and a Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer. Mixed cortical cultures were transfected with the −9.2-kb/−210 NR2A luciferase construct on DIV 6 as described above and were processed for immunocytochemistry on DIV 14. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TSA blocking buffer (TSA Fluorescence Kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to block nonspecific binding. Cultures were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in anti-luciferase antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) and anti-MAP2 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) both diluted 1:500 in TSA blocking buffer. Afterward cells were washed thoroughly and incubated for 45 min at room temperature in CY3 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution, Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA) and Alexa 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (1:400 dilution, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to visualize staining. Nuclei were counterstained by a 10-min incubation in 1 ng/ml Hoechst 33258. Total RNA was isolated from mixed cortical cultures on DIV 5, 8, 11, or 14, and used as a template for cDNA synthesis (Ambion RETROscript kit, using random decamers). Real time PCR was performed on a LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using SYBR green to measure accumulation of double-stranded product. A 401-bp NR2A product was generated in 1 mm MgCl2 using a two-step protocol (40 cycles, 90 °C for 0 s, and 72 °C for 80 s) and the following specific primers: NR2A sense (5′-CGCGGATCCGCCTGAGAATGTGGACTTCC-3′) and antisense (5′-CCGGAATTCTGTTCTGTGACCAGTCCTGC-3′). Primer pairs specific for NR2B and L7 (48Krowczynska A.M. Coutts M. Makrides S. Brawerman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were used as controls. Because the NR2B and L7 primers had lower melting temperatures, amplification was carried out in 2 mm MgCl2 using a three-step protocol (40 cycles, 95 °C for 0 s, 58 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 30 s). The NR2B and L7 products were 624 and 352 bp, respectively, and PCR primers were as follows: NR2B sense (5′-GCATTTGCCACAATGAGAAGAA-3′), NR2B antisense (5′-CACAGTCATAGAGCCCATCAAT-3′), L7 sense (5′-AGATGTACCGCACTGAGATCC-3′), and L7 antisense (5′-ACTTACCAAGCGACCGAGCAA-3′). Raw fluorescence curves (Fig. 7, A and B) were analyzed using LightCycler software (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a second derivative maximum method. Melting curve analysis for NR2A and NR2B confirmed that products obtained with RNA from culture samples corresponded to those synthesized from plasmid template. In all cases PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels to confirm that a single band of the correct molecular weight was obtained. A 258-bp RT-PCR fragment, containing part of the 5′-UTR and extending 25 bp into the NR2A coding sequence, was used to screen an SVJ mouse BAC library for clones harboring genomic sequences mapping to the upstream region of the gene (see “Experimental Procedures”).

In this study we demonstrated direct phosphorylation of β3 integrins as a result of interaction with soluble monomeric ligand, and we characterized the differential kinetics of β3 phosphorylation as a consequence of α subunit pairing. We found that β3 phosphorylation is initiated by RGD peptide binding in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion with αIIbβ3 becoming phosphorylated and dephosphorylated more rapidly than αvβ3. Site mapping of phosphate incorporation reveals significant phosphorylation at Tyr-747 in both β3 integrin species with incorporation at Tyr-759 found at significant levels only in αIIbβ3. Mutation of cytoplasmic β3 tyrosine residues in a transfection model prevents cell adhesion via these integrins. These data demonstrate that recognition of ligand is sufficient to induce β3 tyrosine phosphorylation and suggests that this event is regulated by the α subunit pairing of β3.

These data demonstrate that recognition of ligand is sufficient to induce β3 tyrosine phosphorylation and suggests that this event is regulated by the α subunit pairing of β3. The β3 integrin subunit has been shown to become tyrosine-phosphorylated either as αvβ3 or as αIIbβ3 in monocytes, endothelial cells, platelets, and some cell lines (1Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Google Scholar, 2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Mutation of Tyr-747 of the β3 cytoplasmic tail in αvβ3-transfected hematopoietic cell models prevents their agonist-dependent adhesion, whereas the constitutive adhesion of nonhematopoietic cells that bear these mutant integrins proceeds unaffected (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). The apparent hematopoietic-specific requirement for integrity of the β3 cytoplasmic tyrosines is also reflected in a murine model that bears a genetic mutation of the β3 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in which the identifiable phenotype is a disorder in platelet clot strength, an αIIbβ3-dependent function (4Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Google Scholar). In an αvβ3-transfected hematopoietic cell model, mutation of Tyr-747 of β3 is sufficient to eliminate β3 phosphorylation and αvβ3-mediated adhesion to vitronectin substrate in a static adhesion model. Neither an individual Tyr-759 point mutation nor a combined double-point mutation suggests a role for Tyr-759 in αvβ3-dependent adhesion (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). Subsequently, a sensitive spinning-disc assay of adhesion force has suggested an additive role for both Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 in adhesion; however, the effects of Tyr-747 mutation were clearly dominant (5Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Google Scholar). Because both tyrosines reside in NXXY motifs, potential exists for the assembly of two similar signaling complexes. In the murine model, the effect of single-point mutations has not yet been assessed. Likewise, the individual requirement for either Tyr-747 or Tyr-759 has not yet been determined for β3 when coupled with αIIb. How β3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated is not yet understood. Our initial observation of this biochemical modification occurred in the presence of exogenous Mn2+Cl2(1Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Google Scholar). Because the presence of divalent cations has been shown to modify the conformation of β3 integrins, it was initially suspected that β3 tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in affinity regulation of integrins that is reflected in the conformational change. However, this theory has been disproved (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). Additionally, we have demonstrated that β3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated on αvβ3 attachment to a specific ligand such as vitronectin or anti-β3mAb 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). Observations in platelets have failed to demonstrate β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of platelet aggregation (6Jenkins A.L. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Silver D. Sellers J.R. Ginsberg M.H. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13878-13885Google Scholar). Although aggregation and adhesion both involve integrin receptor clustering, we know of no evidence to indicate that Mn2+Cl2should do so. We report that β3 integrin interaction with soluble monomeric hexapeptide that contains the adhesive tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of β3 at Tyr-747 in αvβ3 and at both Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 in αIIbβ3. Further, RGD-induced phosphorylation of β3 is dose-dependent and regulated by the α subunit partner of β3. Unlike αvβ3, mutation of either Tyr-747 or Tyr-759 of β3 in αIIbβ3 resulted in a partial reduction in cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Simultaneous mutation of both Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 as seen in αvβ3completely inhibited agonist-dependent adhesion via αIIbβ3. Incorporation of phosphate into β3 in transfected cell models was similar to that seen in both murine and human primary macrophages and occurred in approximately half of the recovered β3 in RGD-stimulated suspended cells. The effects of these β3 mutations on adhesions both in vitro and in vivo combined with significant phosphorylation stoichiometry suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 is a prominent event in hematopoietic cell adhesion via β3 integrins. K562 cells were stably transfected with cDNA that encoded human integrin subunits αv or αIIb with either β3wild-type or β3 in which tyrosine residues at position 747, 759, or both, were mutated to phenylalanine as described previously (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). Equivalently high β3-expressing cell populations were obtained by cell sorting with use of mAb AP3 against β3, and expression is reported as the mean channel fluorescence in Table I for β3 as well as for αv or αIIb subunits. Human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described previously (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar).Table IExpression of transfected integrins in K562 cellsAP3M148L230Non-Tx K5621.21.31.9Kαvβ3WT11.81.132.2Y747F11.50.919.7Y759F11.30.928.4Y747F, Y759F12.11.232.8KαIIbβ3WT10.922.02.2Y747F11.424.72.4Y759F11.219.32.1Y747F, Y759F11.919.42.6K562 cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding either αvβ3 or αIIbβ3 or these integrins with β3 bearing the indicated cytoplasmic mutations.

Open table in a new tab K562 cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding either αvβ3 or αIIbβ3 or these integrins with β3 bearing the indicated cytoplasmic mutations.

Shown is the mean channel fluorescence from a representative study. WT, wild type. For visual analysis of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, 1 × 107K562 cells that expressed β3 integrins were suspended in Iscove's modifed Dulbecco's medium that contained 75 μm NaVO4 and incubated with or without the indicated concentrations of Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP) peptide at room temperature for the indicated times. After incubation, cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Immunoprecipitation of β3 and Western blotting for phosphotyrosine was performed as previously described and visualized by using ECL chemistry. 10% of β3 immunoprecipitates were analyzed in parallel for β3 recovery by direct Western blotting using mAb 7G2 against β3. For GRGDSP peptide dose dependence studies, cells were stimulated with indicated doses of peptide for 15 min. For time course studies, cells were incubated with 2.0 mmGRGDSP for 180 min with gentle rocking. Aliquots were removed for immunoprecipitation at the indicated times and processed as described previously. For quantitation of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, Western blots were processed by using ECL-Plus chemistry, exposed to collection screens, analyzed with a Molecular Devices phosphorimaging device, normalized to total β3recovered, and reported as arbitrary fluorescent units. To determine the site and stoichiometry of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, β3 was immunoprecipitated from human monocyte-derived macrophages, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, and K562 cells that expressed either αvβ3 or αIIbβ3. After [32P]-orthophosphate loading of cells, GRGDSP peptide was added to 2.0 mm concentration and cells were suspended in Iscove's modifed Dulbecco's medium for 20 min at room temperature. The β3 subunit was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody directed against the β3 cytoplasmic tail (BIOSOURCE) covalently linked to Sepharose via dimethyl pimelimidate according to the manufacturer's instructions. β3 was released from Sepharose by using 0.1 m glycine, 0.01 mNaPO4, 0.45 m NaCl, pH 3.5, and subjected to limited proteolysis with γ-thermolysin M2 (gift of Hiroshi Takayana, Tokyo University) for 2.5 min. Digested protein was subjected to isoelectric focusing (pI 4.5–6.5) to remove IgG contaminants followed by a second dimension of 18% SDS-PAGE tube gel. Electroeluted peptides were monitored for 32P incorporation by β-scintillation, and the smallest radioactive peptides were analyzed by pico-tag analysis for amino acid concentration and both N-terminal Edman degradation and C-terminal sequencing to determine the peptide sequence and the site of 32P incorporation. For all samples, the sequenced peptide began at residue 741 of the β3cytoplasmic tail as predicted for γ-thermolysin M2. The presence of phosphotyrosine was determined by the shift to the anilinothiazoline derivative. Pico-tag amino acid quantitation combined with reference date-corrected 32P scintigraphy permitted calculation of a molecular phosphorylation stoichiometry from the moles of β3 residues 741–760 per mol of 32P, which indicates the percentage of β3 molecules phosphorylated. For adhesion to extracellular matrix ligand, 96-well plates (Immulon-II, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated overnight with either 1.0 μg/ml vitronectin or 10 μg/ml fibrinogen in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C followed by washing and blocking with 0.5% casein in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). 1 × 105 K562 cells that expressed wild-type or Tyr-Phe mutant β3 integrins were fluorescently labeled with calcein-AM as described and placed in each well in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium without serum and with or without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml). After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the fluorescence of each well was determined before and after three washes with phosphate-buffered saline to calculate the percentage of cells that adhered. Shown is the average ± S.D. of no fewer than five determinations performed in triplicate for each group. To determine the role of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 of the β3 cytoplasmic tail in β3 tyrosine phosphorylation and β3-mediated adhesion, a stable transfection model in K562 cells was constructed, in which equivalent expression levels between each population were attained (TableI). K562 lines that expressed the wild-type integrins αIIbβ3(KαIIbβ3) and αvβ3 (Kαvβ3) were prepared along with lines of each α subunit in combination with β3-bearing Phe substitutions of Tyr-747 (Kαvβ3 Y747F, KαIIbβ3Y747F), Tyr-759 (Kαvβ3 Y759F, KαIIbβ3Y759F) or both (Kαvβ3 Y747/759F, KαIIbβ3Y747/759F). Mutation of cDNAs was performed by PCR mutagenesis as described previously (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). Kαvβ3 was incubated with increasing concentrations of GRGDSP peptide, and samples were evaluated for β3 tyrosine phosphorylation as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). β3 phosphorylation was increased in a dose-dependent fashion by GRGDSP and reached maximum detected levels at 2.0 mm GRGDSP during a 15-min incubation. The addition of GRGESP peptides at concentrations as high as 5 mm failed to induce β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in Kαvβ3 (data not shown). Incubation of KαIIbβ3 with increasing concentrations of GRGDSP also demonstrated maximum β3tyrosine phosphorylation at 2.0 mm GRGDSP (data not shown). Because we had previously demonstrated conditions under which the β3 subunit of αvβ3 but not αIIbβ3 could become tyrosine-phosphorylated, we hypothesized that α subunit pairing elicited differential regulatory events (1Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Google Scholar). Because dose dependence of a common ligand failed to reveal differences in β3phosphorylation between the two β3 integrins, we evaluated the phosphorylation of these receptors after peptide ligand binding over an extensive time course as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). After the removal of a time zero sample, addition of 2.0 mmGRGDSP induced an increase in β3 phosphorylation in both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. However, GRGDSP-induced phosphorylation in β3 occurred more rapidly in αIIbβ3 than in αvβ3. Further, the phosphorylation of β3 in αIIbβ3 peaked at 15 min and began to decrease even in the continued presence of the ligand and reached baseline levels after 30 min. In contrast, the phosphorylation of β3 in αvβ3 was maintained as long as 1 h after the removal of the ligand. We have previously demonstrated that mutation of Tyr-747 of β3 in αvβ3 was sufficient to eliminate β3 phosphorylation induced either by Mn2+ or adhesion to specific ligand (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr-759 of β3 had no effect on β3phosphorylation; however, a sensitive adhesion force measure suggested that the integrity of this residue contributes to αvβ3-mediated adhesion (5Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Google Scholar). In αIIbβ3 it is unknown which tyrosine residues are required for β3 phosphorylation eitherin vivo or in vitro. In a murine genomic model, simultaneous mutation of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 elicited an αIIbβ3-dependent phenotype (4Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Google Scholar). To determine the relative contribution of these tyrosines to β3 phosphorylation in αIIbβ3, we assayed β3 phosphorylation induced by GRGDSP peptide in αIIbβ3 mutants bearing phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 both individually and concurrently. In contrast to αvβ3, mutation of β3 Tyr-747 of αIIbβ3resulted in an only partial reduction in β3phosphorylation. This suggests that phosphorylation occurred both at Tyr-747 and at other sites. Mutation of β3 Tyr-759 in αIIbβ3 did not appear to reduce GRGDSP-induced β3 phosphorylation and as seen in αvβ3, concurrent mutation of both Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 resulted in a complete loss of β3phosphorylation. These results further support the hypothesis that the α subunit pairing of β3 elicits differential regulatory mechanisms for β3 phosphorylation induced by ligand binding. To definitively identify the sites of phosphate incorporation in the β3 cytoplasmic tail, a protocol was developed whereby a small peptide domain that encompassed both Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 of the β3 tail could be purified after ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and immunorecovery. Radiostoichiometry, amino acid quantitation, and direct sequencing were used as described under “Experimental Procedures” to determine the molecular stoichiometry of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation (TableII). As suggested by Western blot experimentation, significant phosphate incorporation into the β3 subunit of αvβ3 occurred only at Tyr-747. Under the described experimental conditions, similar levels of phosphate incorporation at Tyr-747 were seen in αvβ3 recovered from our model cell line Kαvβ3, human monocyte-derived macrophages, and murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Unable to purify sufficient quantities of αIIbβ3 from platelets, we assessed phosphate incorporation into β3 in our model cell line KαIIbβ3. Interestingly, significant phosphorylation occurred at both Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 in β3 recovered from these cells. This result is in agreement with our Western blot analyses (Fig.3) in which mutation of either individual tyrosine failed to completely block β3 phosphorylation and suggests that although Tyr-747 is the primary site of phosphate incorporation into β3 in both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3, phosphorylation of Tyr-759 does occur in αIIbβ3.Table IIStoichiometry of phosphate incorporation in β3 integrinsTyr-747Tyr-759(n)Kαvβ367 ± 134 ± 6(3)hMDM54 ± 911 ± 4(2)mBMM48 ± 79 ± 8(2)KαIIbβ352 ± 931 ± 4(2)32P-Loaded K562 cells stably expressing either αIIbβ3 or αvβ3, human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM), and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMM) were treated to permit β3 tyrosine phosphorylation and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as the percent of tyrosines at positions 747 and 759 that incorporated phosphate. Shown is mean ± S.E. from the indicated number of determinations (n). Open table in a new tab 32P-Loaded K562 cells stably expressing either αIIbβ3 or αvβ3, human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM), and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMM) were treated to permit β3 tyrosine phosphorylation and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as the percent of tyrosines at positions 747 and 759 that incorporated phosphate. Shown is mean ± S.E. from the indicated number of determinations (n). Both phosphomapping studies and Western blot analysis of tyrosine mutant β3 suggested that both tyrosine residues of β3 contribute to αIIbβ3function. Because this is in contrast to our previous studies of αvβ3 behavior, we directly compared the adhesive capabilities of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 with their preferred ligands (fibrinogen and vitronectin, respectively) and the dependence of these adhesions on the β3 cytoplasmic tail tyrosine residues (Fig. 4). As with Kαvβ3 attachment to vitronectin, KαIIbβ3 adhesion to fibrinogen required phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced activation of protein kinase C and was completely inhibited by anti-β3 mAb 1A2 (data not shown). Similar to αvβ3,mutation of β3 Tyr-747 in αIIbβ3 reduced KαIIbβ3 adhesion to fibrinogen. However, in contrast to αvβ3, mutation of Tyr-759 also resulted in a significant yet incomplete reduction in adhesion. Finally, concurrent mutation of both β3cytoplasmic tyrosines in both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 completely inhibited adhesion to specific ligand. The results of these functional studies support the hypothesis that α subunit pairing elicits differential regulatory mechanisms for β3 phosphorylation and suggest that these two closely related integrins use this modification in slightly different ways to achieve firm adhesion. As evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo models, tyrosine phosphorylation of β3integrins is an important permissive step in the adhesive process of hematopoietic cell types (1Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Google Scholar, 2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Google Scholar). Genetic mutation of β3cytoplasmic tyrosines demonstrates a requirement for phosphorylation for firm adhesion both in vitro and in vivo (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar,4Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Google Scholar) The β3 cytoplasmic tail contains two tyrosine residues, both within NXXY sequences, a common motif for the assembly of signaling complexes (7Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. et al.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Google Scholar). For αvβ3 we have previously demonstrated that the membrane proximal tyrosine, Tyr-747, is solely required for β3 phosphorylation (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar). Further, mutation of Tyr-747 completely prevents adhesion in a hematopoietic cell model. In αIIbβ3 functional evidence for the role of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation comes from a genetically modified mouse in which both β3 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine, resulting in an animal with deficiencies in platelet clot strength (4Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Google Scholar). To focus future mechanistic studies of this signaling event, we have identified the minimum stimulus required for β3 phosphorylation and mapped the phosphorylation sites in β3 when partnered with either αv or αIIb. It has been known for some time that β3integrin binding of small peptide ligands is sufficient to induce a conformational change in the integrin (8Du X. Plow E.F. Frelinger A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Google Scholar). Previous reports have demonstrated β3 tyrosine phosphorylation resulting from adhesion to ligand or antibody, platelet aggregation, and addition of exogenous Mn2+ (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Google Scholar, 3Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Google Scholar). We now report that β3solution binding of monomeric RGD peptide, at concentrations equivalent to those which induce integrin conformational change, are sufficient to induce phosphorylation of β3 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues. RGD-induced phosphorylation in the absence of receptor aggregation, cell spreading, or cell adhesion suggests that this modification of β3 occurs very early during integrin-mediated events, and supports our hypothesis that phosphorylated β3 is the required substrate for signals that promote hematopoietic cell adhesion such as protein kinase C. Our initial observations failed to detect β3phosphorylation when partnered with αIIb in K562 cells. In subsequent reports we have demonstrated β3phosphorylation in platelets, presumably from αIIbβ3, and this finding has been confirmed in other laboratories (3Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Google Scholar). To determine whether our initial inability to visualize β3 phosphorylation in αIIbβ3 was caused by α subunit regulation, we directly compared both the time and dose responses of the two β3 integrins with peptide ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Although model cell systems may not completely reflect β3 phosphorylation in a primary cell type, the analysis of both integrins within a homologous system does serve to highlight differences attributable to α subunits. We find that at short time points, both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 respond equivalently to RGD peptide with maximal β3 phosphorylation occurring at 2.0 mm peptide. However, time course studies reveal significant α chain regulation of phosphorylation. A 1-h time point illustrates why phosphorylation in αIIbβ3 went undetected in earlier experiments. β3 phosphorylation in αIIbβ3 occurs rapidly and decays even in the presence of ligand, whereas phosphorylation in αvβ3 is maintained until the ligand has been removed. Although the physiologic relevance of this difference remains unknown, it may reflect the different fates of these two β3 integrins in active adhesive processes. αIIbβ3-Mediated platelet adhesion is largely irreversible, whereas αvβ3-mediated leukocyte adhesions turn over for efficient migration. Teleology notwithstanding, the α subunit clearly regulates β3phosphorylation, which merits further investigation. The degree of β3 phosphorylation that occurs at any one time in the adhesion process is unknown. Our stoichiometry experiments may overestimate β3 phosphorylation for αvβ3 because the cells are held in suspension with soluble ligand present for 20 min. In the absence of suitable immobilized substrate, cells are unable to form and strengthen cytoskeletal connections. Under these conditions, it is possible that β3 phosphorylation increases to supraphysiologic levels. However, it is also possible that phosphorylation of β3is a priming mechanism that occurs naturally in preparation for cell contact with substrate. In both primary cells and our K562 cell model system we found that approximately half of the β3 in the cells was phosphorylated under these conditions. Importantly, phosphate was incorporated primarily at Tyr-747 in αvβ3 and only significantly at Tyr-759 in αIIbβ3. Because this difference was observed within identical cell backgrounds, it also indicates α subunit regulation of this biochemical modification. Because the phosphorylation of β3 differs when partnered with αv or αIIb, we compared the requirement for Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 together and separately in adhesion mediated by αIIbβ3 or αvβ3. Unlike αvβ3, we found a clear role for Tyr-759 in αIIbβ3 adhesion in a static assay of firm adhesion. Mutation of either cytoplasmic β3 tyrosine reduced the ability of αIIbβ3 to mediate protein kinase C-stimulated adhesion to fibrinogen. As previously shown for αvβ3, simultaneous mutation of both tyrosines completely inhibited adhesion via αIIbβ3. A codependence on both tyrosines for successful adhesion has also been demonstrated for αvβ3 in a sensitive measure of adhesion force (5Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Google Scholar). Further, although phosphorylation dependence has not been determined, binding partners unique for each domain of β3that contain an NXXY motif have been identified (9Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J..Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2563-3571Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that despite the majority of phosphate incorporation that occurs at Tyr-747, both tyrosines are active in assembling signaling or structural protein assemblies for adhesion, perhaps with Tyr-747 serving as the primary functional site."
https://openalex.org/W2157914516,"The correlation between dynamics and stability of icosahedral viruses was studied by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence approaches. We compared the environment and dynamics of tryptophan side chains of empty capsids and ribonucleoprotein particles of two icosahedral viruses from the comovirus group: cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and bean pod mottle virus (BPMV). We found a great difference between tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of the ribonucleoprotein particles and the empty capsids of BPMV. For CPMV, time-resolved fluorescence revealed differences in the tryptophan environments of the capsid protein. The excited-state lifetimes of tryptophan residues were significantly modified by the presence of RNA in the capsid. More than half of the emission of the tryptophans in the ribonucleoprotein particles of CPMV originates from a single exponential decay that can be explained by a similar, nonpolar environment in the local structure of most of the tryptophans, even though they are physically located in different regions of the x-ray structure. CPMV particles without RNA lost this discrete component of emission. Anisotropy decay measurements demonstrated that tryptophans rotate faster in empty particles when compared with the ribonucleoprotein particles. The increased structural breathing facilitates the denaturation of the empty particles. Our studies bring new insights into the intricate interactions between protein and RNA where part of the missing structural information on the nucleic acid molecule is compensated for by the dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1979936903,"Multiple surveillance pathways maintain genomic integrity in yeast during mitosis. Although the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 is a well established regulator of mitotic progression, evidence for a direct role in mitotic surveillance has been lacking. We have now implicated a conserved sequence in the Cdc28 carboxyl terminus in maintaining chromosome stability through mitosis. Six temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated via random mutagenesis of 13 carboxyl-terminal residues. These mutants identify a Cdc28 domain necessary for proper mitotic arrest in the face of kinetochore defects or microtubule inhibitors. These chromosome stability-defective cdc28 CST mutants inappropriately continue mitosis when the mitotic spindle is disrupted at 23 °C, display high rates of spontaneous chromosome loss at 30 °C, and suffer catastrophic aneuploidy at 35 °C. A dosage suppression screen identified Cak1, a kinase known to phosphorylate and activate Cdc28, as a specific high copy suppressor ofcdc28 CST temperature sensitivity and chromosome instability. Suppression is independent of the kinase activity of Cak1, suggesting that Cak1 may bind to the carboxyl terminus to serve a non-catalytic role in assembly and/or stabilization of active Cdc28 complexes. Significantly, these studies implicate Cdc28 and Cak1 in an essential surveillance function required to maintain genetic stability through mitosis.

Significantly, these studies implicate Cdc28 and Cak1 in an essential surveillance function required to maintain genetic stability through mitosis. From the onset of S phase until return to G1, surveillance pathways collaborate to maintain chromosome stability, monitoring completion of DNA replication and repair and determining attachment and tension in the mitotic spindle while regulating sister chromatid cohesion and mediating chromosome condensation (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Google Scholar). The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers a powerful model system with which to dissect these multiple determinants and pathways. Several genetic screens have identified genes that are implicated in chromosome stability (2Ouspenski I.I. Elledge S.J. Brinkley B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3001-3008Google Scholar, 3Hartwell L.H. Smith D. Genetics. 1985; 110: 381-395Google Scholar) and/or kinetochore function (4Stoler S. Keith K.C. Curnick K.E. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 573-586Google Scholar, 5Pangilinan F. Spencer F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1195-1208Google Scholar, 6Spencer F. Gerring S.L. Connelly C. Hieter P. Genetics. 1990; 124: 237-249Google Scholar, 7Kouprina N. Tsouladze A. Koryabin M. Hieter P. Spencer F. Larionov V. Yeast. 1993; 9: 11-19Google Scholar). The yeast kinetochore is a centromere binding complex and attachment point for the plus-end of a single spindle microtubule, linking each sister chromatid to one spindle-pole body (SPB). 1The abbreviations used are: SPB, spindle-pole body; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: SPB, spindle-pole body; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin. Furthermore, the kinetochore is an assembly point for components of the spindle checkpoint, which mediates the dependence of mitotic progression on attachment and tension (8Skibbens R.V. Hieter P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 307-337Google Scholar). The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 (Cdk1 and Cdc2) is the master regulator of the yeast cell cycle (9Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Google Scholar, 10Mendenhall M.D. Hodge A.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1191-1243Google Scholar). It coordinates bud emergence, SPB duplication, and DNA replication at Start and directs spindle assembly and function in mitosis. Whereas the abundance of Cdc28 is constant, its activity is regulated by associations with cyclins, stoichiometric inhibitors, and accessory factors as well as by activating and inhibitory phosphorylations (9Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Google Scholar, 10Mendenhall M.D. Hodge A.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1191-1243Google Scholar). Even subtle changes in Cdc28 function affecting mitotic progression may impinge on chromosome stability. Indeed, mutations of several Cdc28 partners and substrates have been associated with genomic instability, whereas mutations of Cdc28 itself, such as cdc28-1N (11Yu Y. Jiang Y.W. Wellinger R.J. Carlson K. Roberts J.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5254-5263Google Scholar),cdc28-srm (12Devin A.B. Prosvirova T. Peshekhonov V.T. Chepurnaya O.V. Smirnova M.E. Koltovaya N.A. Troitskaya E.N. Arman I.P. Yeast. 1990; 6: 231-243Google Scholar), and cdc28-5M (13Li X. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2723-2734Google Scholar), are associated with relatively nonspecific defects in chromosome segregation and/or mitotic checkpoint control. Paradoxically, current models suggest that Cdc28 and its partners are only passive effectors of the mitotic surveillance pathways (14Gorbsky G.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R1001-R1004Google Scholar). To dissect the role of Cdc28 in maintaining chromosome stability, we screened for cdc28 mutants that synthetically interact with the kinetochore mutant ctf13-30and isolated multiple temperature-sensitive alleles that no longer tolerate a kinetochore lesion. Unlike previously characterizedcdc28 mutants, these alleles do not arrest at the non-permissive temperature but continue to divide, leading to mitotic catastrophe. This work identified a novel carboxyl-terminal domain of Cdc28 with an essential surveillance function that maintains genetic stability through mitosis and is critical for recognition by the Cak1 CDK-activating kinase. All experiments were performed in MATa orMATa/MATα cells in the W303 genetic background (15Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Google Scholar). We obtained plasmids harboring CAK1,cak1-K31R, and cak1-D179N from K. Chun; thectf13-30 strain from F. Spencer; thecak1::TRP1 strain andcak1-17/pRS316 and CAK1/pRS316 plasmids from E. Winter; the cak1-23 ptc2::URA3 ptc3::HIS3 strain and CAK1-YCp50 and CAK1-YEp24 plasmids from M. Solomon and P. Kaldis; and the SPC42-GFP strain from M. Winey. Strain constructions and transformations were performed using standard methods (16$$Google Scholar).CKS1-3HA and CLB2-13MYC were constructed by gene replacement, introducing the −3HA or −13MYC tag from pFA6a-3HA-kanMX6 or pFA6a-13MYC-kanMX6 (17Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar), immediately before the stop codon. Spot tests for viability assays were performed by placing 2.5-μl aliquots from 5-fold serial dilutions of cell suspensions onto the appropriate media, followed by incubation for 2–3 days at the indicated temperatures. Benomyl plates contained 12.5 μg/ml of the inhibitor (Sigma). UV irradiation was performed in a Stratagene cross-linker at a 100 μJ/cm2 dose. To assay responses to nocodazole (U. S. Biochemical Corp.),MATa cells were G1-synchronized with α mating factor (Research Genetics), washed, and released into rich media at 23 °C. After 1 h, nocodazole was added to 20 μg/ml, and aliquots were taken at the indicated times. After 3 h, nocodazole was added to a total final concentration of 30 μg/ml, in order to extend its inhibitory activity. To assay growth at 34 °C, exponentially growing cells at 23 °C were placed in a water bath under constant shaking, and the temperature was raised to 34 °C within 1 h. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times. To assay the effect of CAK1 overexpression on checkpoint response, ctf13-30 strains harboring empty vector or theCAK1 plasmid were grown overnight under selective conditions. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in fresh YPD media to anA600 of 0.25, and incubated at 23 °C; and after 2 h (“0-h time point”), the temperature was raised to 34 °C within 1 h. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times. Cell properties were scored according to standard criteria (e.g. Straight and Murray (18Straight A.F. Murray A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 425-440Google Scholar)). A 2 × 2 contingency χ2 test of independence was used to analyze the statistical significance of differences between wild-type and mutant strains in assays of cell morphology, nuclear morphology, or SPB number after different treatments. For each experiment analyzed, the contingency table compared a mutant and the wild-type control that were treated in parallel and scored sequentially. Each experiment was repeated at least twice with similar results. Data were not pooled, and the results of one are reported. Approximately 5 × 106 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C, washed once with 1 ml of water, and incubated for 2 h at 50 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 mg/ml of RNase A (Sigma). Cells were washed once with water, pelleted, resuspended in 0.2 ml of 5 mg/ml pepsin in 0.45% HCl, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of water, lightly sonicated, pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of 2.5 μm Sytox Green (Molecular Probes) in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, incubated for 1 h at 23 °C or overnight at 4 °C, and then analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For each sample, data from at least 30,000 events were collected for analysis. To create a library of strains carrying random mutations in codons 282 and 287–298 ofCDC28 linked to a selectable marker, cells were transformed with a mutagenic PCR product synthesized by fusing a “spiked” (70% wild-type base, 10% each other base) oligonucleotide primer to the His3MX6 marker of pFA6a-His3MX6 (17Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar). Detailed conditions including spiked oligonucleotide design and synthesis are described elsewhere (19Kitazono A.A. Tobe B.T. Kalton H. Diamant N. Kron S.J. Yeast. 2002; 19: 141-149Google Scholar). Briefly, a fusion-PCR product was used to transform aMATa ctf13-30 SPC42-GFP strain, selecting for histidine prototrophy at 23 °C. Transformants were replica-plated onto rich media and analyzed for growth at semi-permissive temperature for ctf13-30. Of 450 HIS+ colonies, 29 were markedly and 13 moderately temperature-sensitive at 32 °C. Linkage of the phenotype toCDC28 was demonstrated by amplifying the mutated segment, the His3MX6 marker, and flanking regions from genomic DNA and using this PCR product for re-transformation. Transformants were examined for phenotypes at 32 °C, crossed to a wild-type MATα, and subjected to meiotic analysis. All six cdc28 CSTmutants were temperature-sensitive at 32 °C and recessive to wild-type CDC28. These segregants were analyzed by dideoxy DNA sequencing of the complete CDC28 open reading frame. The tester strain YPH278 harbors a fragment derived from chromosome III, which includes theURA3 marker and SUP11, an ochre-suppressing tRNA. In the presence of SUP11 the ade2-101 ochre allele is expressed as a functional enzyme, and the colonies remain white (5Pangilinan F. Spencer F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1195-1208Google Scholar, 20Koshland D. Hieter P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 351-372Google Scholar). The ratio of pink, red, and sectored colonies qualitatively reflects the frequency of spontaneous chromosome loss. cdc28-cst2 ctf13-30, and cdc28-cst3 ctf13-30 strains were transformed with a high copy URA3-marked library of clones derived from partial Sau3AI digestion of genomic DNA (pRS202). 2C. Connelly and P. Hieter, unpublished data. From ∼70,000 transformants of each strain, a total of 240 were identified by colony formation at 32 and 35 °C. Plasmid rescue and retransformation resulted in the selection of 71 candidates. Among these, restriction mapping of 24 isolates identified at least 5 groups of overlapping inserts. Sequence analysis of the inserts identified candidate suppressor genes. The CAK1 gene from genomic clone pAK1994 was subcloned by SnaBI and SacI orApaI digestions. pAK1994 subclones lacking theCAK1 open reading frame were not able to confer suppression. A Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscopy was used to detect the SPC42-GFP signal and to determine SPB number and localization. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h at 23 °C, pelleted, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol. Cells were immobilized on concanavalin A-treated slides. Typically, 15 sections through the cells were taken at 0.4-μm separations and projected onto a single plane for analysis. Histone H1 kinase activities were assayed using Cks1–3HA or Clb2–13Myc immunoprecipitates (21Tennison C.M.V. Andrews B.J. Technical Tips On Line. 1998; (http://research.bmn.com/tto/search/record?uid=TTO.elstto00_01689525_34_p01174)Google Scholar). Cks1/Suc1 is an activating subunit of Cdc28 and has been widely used (“Suc1 beads”) to isolate Cdc28/Cdc2 complexes for in vitro kinase assays (22Surana U. Robitsch H. Price C. Schuster T. Fitch I. Futcher A.B. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 65: 145-161Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared by glass bead extraction and vortexing in lysis buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Routinely 2–3 mg of protein were incubated with 20 μg of 16B12 anti-HA antibody (Babco) or 3–5 μg of 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (Babco) for 1 h; 25 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose suspension (Amersham Biosciences) or protein G-agarose (Pierce) was added and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reaction mixtures were added (1 μg of histone H1, 1 μl (10 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm ATP in 5 μl of kinase buffer); bead suspensions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 2× SDS-sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by phosphorimaging (Amersham Biosciences). Parallel immunoprecipitations were run up to the washing step, and the beads were resuspended in 1× SDS-sample buffer and boiled. Samples were loaded into 12% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with anti-PSTAIRE antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200 dilution) to confirm the isolation of equal amounts of the Cdc28 complexes. Cks1–3HA expression levels were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (1:500 dilution). Horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2500 dilution, Amersham Biosciences), Super-Signal Substrate (Pierce), and Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection. We identified a novel conserved sequence at the carboxyl terminus of Cdc28 (Fig. 1A) and implicated this domain in regulation of genetic stability and checkpoint proficiency. To study this region further, we randomly mutagenized codons 282 and 287 through 298 of Cdc28 and searched for mutations that exacerbate the phenotypes of ctf13-30, a conditional mutation of an essential kinetochore subunit (5Pangilinan F. Spencer F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1195-1208Google Scholar). At 35 °C, ctf13-30 cells arrest in response to detached chromosomes, accumulating in mitosis as large-budded cells with a single, unseparated DNA mass and adjacent SPBs. Incubated at 32 °C, ctf13-30 grows slowly, delaying in mitosis. Both viability of ctf13-30 incubated transiently at 35 °C and growth of ctf13-30 at 32 °C depend on the spindle checkpoint pathway to prevent catastrophic mitotic progression. We mutagenized the chromosomal CDC28 allele in actf13-30 SPC42-GFP strain by replacing the carboxyl-terminal codons with a PCR product derived from a spiked mutagenic oligonucleotide, leaving the mutated allele adjacent to a selectable marker (19Kitazono A.A. Tobe B.T. Kalton H. Diamant N. Kron S.J. Yeast. 2002; 19: 141-149Google Scholar). Approximately 10% of the transformants enhanced thermosensitivity at 32 °C. By using confocal microscopy to simultaneously image cell shape and the GFP-labeled SPBs, we identified six isolates that no longer accumulate with large buds or short mitotic spindles at 32 °C. At 35 °C, each of thecdc28 CST (chromosomestability) mutations confers rapid loss of viability. Cells bypass arrest yielding unbudded cells, multiply budded cells, cells with three or more SPBs, and cells that appear anucleate (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the phenotype is dependent on the kinetochore mutation, we separated the cdc28 CSTmutations from ctf13-30. The singlecdc28 CST mutations confer instability to an indicator mini-chromosome as evidenced by an increase in sectored and pink colonies (Fig. 1C) (5Pangilinan F. Spencer F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1195-1208Google Scholar, 20Koshland D. Hieter P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 351-372Google Scholar). Sequencing of the cdc28 CST alleles revealed multiple mutations, ranging from 4 to 7 of the 13 randomized residues. The mutations cluster in a sub-domain, falling particularly in residues Ala-290, Ile-291, Pro-293, Tyr-294, and Gln-296 (Fig. 1D). The cdc28-cst3 and -cst7 mutations lead to truncations after Phe-295 and Pro-293, respectively. Only Pro-293 is mutated in all six cdc28 CST mutants but to no single side-chain class. Based on the human CDK2 atomic structures, the residues altered in the cdc28 CST mutants lie on the solvent-accessible surface of Cdc28 (Fig. 1E) but relatively distant from the binding sites of ATP, substrate peptide, cyclin, Cks1, or Kap1 (23Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Google Scholar, 24Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Google Scholar, 25Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Google Scholar), suggesting altered interactions with a novel regulator. Single cdc28 CSTmutants remain temperature-sensitive (Fig. 2A). In general, previously described cdc28 temperature-sensitive mutants arrest homogeneously at restrictive temperature and resume cell cycle progression when returned to permissive temperature. By contrast, thecdc28 CST mutants do not arrest at non-permissive temperature and even short incubations decrease viability. At 25 °C, the cdc28 CST mutant cells are slightly larger and more elongated than wild type, and at 34 °C they continue to divide but only form microcolonies (Fig. 2B). Within 3 h after a gradual shift from 23 to 34 °C, cdc28-cst2 andcdc28-cst8 accumulate misshapen, unbudded cells and cells with supernumerary SPBs (Fig. 2C). Between 3 and 5 h at 34 °C, flow cytometry revealed a growing fraction of apparently aneuploid cells with ≪1N or >2N DNA content (Fig. 2D). The increase in the ≪1N fraction corresponds to a similar increase in cells that apparently lack nuclei and/or chromosomal DNA by fluorescence microscopy. At 6 h, compared with wild-type cells, 8-fold more cdc28-cst2 (n = 156,p < 0.0005; Fig. 2E) and 6-fold morecdc28-cst8 (n = 214, p < 0.0005) display only background staining. Incubation at 34 °C also causes progressive loss of viability as measured by decreasing colony-forming units after plating at 23 °C (plating efficiency <1% after 10 h at 34 °C). To further characterize the phenotype, we examined other perturbations such as treatment with the microtubule inhibitors nocodazole and benomyl. Unlike wild-type cells treated with nocodazole, which maintain a 2N DNA content through 5 h,cdc28-cst2 cells bypass arrest to perform multiple rounds of DNA replication and incomplete chromosome segregation (Fig. 3A). Likewise, rather than performing a large-budded arrest on media containing 12.5 μg/ml benomyl, cdc28 CST cells continue to divide and show increased lethality. These results suggest that thecdc28 CST mutants cannot maintain arrest in the presence of microtubule inhibitors and instead prematurely resume cell cycle progression to suffer mitotic catastrophe. Nonetheless, DNA damage responses are intact because UV irradiation of wild-type or mutant cells leads to similar large-budded arrest and recovery and equivalent survival (Fig. 3B). In the same way, block and release with the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea leads to equivalent large-budded arrests followed by prompt return to S phase progression. These data are consistent with a specific defect for thecdc28 CST mutants in spindle surveillance rather than in either mitotic progression or mitotic arrest. The sensitivities of the cdc28 CST mutants to ctf13-30and microtubule inhibitors are consistent with a role for Cdc28 in responding to lack of kinetochore attachment, which normally results in spindle-assembly checkpoint arrest (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Google Scholar, 26Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 997-1000Google Scholar, 27Amon A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 69-75Google Scholar, 28Hoyt M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 909-912Google Scholar). As the cdc28 CST mutations alter the predicted molecular surface but are well separated from the active site, we hypothesized that the defect might derive from impaired interactions with a protein partner. Thus, we tested whether overexpression of a known Cdc28 activator, Cks1, might partly compensate for the cdc28 CST defect. Whereas overexpression of Cks1 markedly suppresses growth of the temperature-sensitive mutants cdc28-1N (Pro-250 → Leu) and cdc28-4 (His-128 → Tyr) at 35 °C, suppression of ctf13-30 cdc28-cst2 or ctf13-30 cdc28-cst8 is negligible (Fig. 4A) (24Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Google Scholar). To extend this paradigm, we performed a dosage suppression screen. Whereas such a strategy might reveal the partner to whichcdc28 CST mutants bind poorly, suppressors could include CDC28 itself, components of the relevant Cdc28 complex, upstream activators, phosphorylation targets, or parallel pathways. Thus, ctf13-30 cdc28-cst2 and ctf13-30 cdc28-cst3 strains were transformed with a high copy number genomic library and screened for enhanced thermoresistance. Isolated clones fell into several groups. As expected, wild-typeCDC28 was cloned multiple times. Whereas plasmids were isolated carrying the CTF13, CBF2/NDC10, orCEP3 components of the Cbf3 kinetochore complex (29Russell I.D. Grancell A.S. Sorger P.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 933-950Google Scholar), each suppresses ctf13-30 but has no effect oncdc28 CST mutants alone. Multiple clones isolated in both the cdc28-cst2 and cdc28-cst3 strains contained the CAK1 open reading frame and flanking regions of various lengths. CAK1 encodes theCDK-activating kinase that phosphorylates monomeric Cdc28 at Thr-169 and is essential for kinase activity throughout the cell cycle (30Kaldis P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Google Scholar). Subcloning and retransformation revealed that CAK1 specifically suppressescdc28-cst2 and cdc28-cst3 but notctf13-30. High copy CAK1 has little effect on wild-type cell growth but markedly suppresses all sixcdc28 CST mutants at temperatures up to 34 °C (e.g. Fig. 4B). A single additional copy ofCAK1 (CEN vector), like empty vector or a single copy of the mutant cak1-17, has no effect (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, high copy CAK1 does not suppress the thermosensitivity of ctf13-30 strains carryingcdc28-4 or cdc28-1N (Fig. 4D). To examine the effects ofCAK1 overexpression on the cdc28 CST ctf13-30 double mutants, cultures carrying empty vector or a high copy CAK1 plasmid were incubated at 34 °C (Fig. 5). By 2 h, ctf13-30 CDC28 strains, whether carrying vector or CAK1, begin to accumulate in mitosis. At 5 h, >65% remain arrested with 2N DNA content, delayed due to a checkpoint response to damaged kinetochores (6Spencer F. Gerring S.L. Connelly C. Hieter P. Genetics. 1990; 124: 237-249Google Scholar). By contrast, when ctf13-30 cdc28-cst2 orctf13-30 cdc28-cst8 mutants carrying vector were shifted to 34 °C, they arrested only transiently in mitosis and then resumed division. Aneuploid cells with <1N or >2N DNA content appeared within 3 h, and no more than 24% of ctf13-30 cdc28-cst2 and 27% of ctf13-30 cdc28-cst8 cells maintained 2N DNA content at 5 h. Overexpressing CAK1 in either mutant partly restored the mitotic arrest at 34 °C. Aneuploid cells accumulate more slowly, and ∼43% of ctf13-30 cdc28-cst2 cells and 36% of ctf13-30 cdc28-cst8 cells retained 2N DNA content at 5 h. If thecdc28 CST mutants are poorly activated by Cak1, they may be catalytically defective. To test this, whole cell extracts from wild-type and cdc28 CST mutant cells grown at 23 °C were assayed for Cdc28-associated kinase activity. Immunoprecipitates of Cks1–3HA from cdc28-cst2 andcdc28-cst8 did not contain diminished amounts of Cdc28 protein but displayed only 50 and 40% of wild-type histone H1 kinase activity, respectively (Fig. 6A). Comparable results were obtained with Clb2–13Myc-Cdc28 complexes. Overexpression ofCAK1 yielded a significant increase in the Cks1–3HA-associated activity immunoprecipitated fromcdc28-cst2 and cdc28-cst8 mutants, although not to wild-type levels. Nonetheless, a low histone H1 kinase activityper se may not be sufficient to confer chromosome instability insofar as mutants that retain considerably less than wild-type activity (e.g. cdc28-4 at 23–32 °C) have little or no defect in genetic stability (our data and see Ref.13Li X. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2723-2734Google Scholar). Chun and Goebl (31Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 365-375Google Scholar) have described and characterized several cak1 point mutants. Among these, a substitution of Lys-31 for Arg (cak1-K31R) was found to display greatly reduced catalytic activity. Lys-31 is a highly conserved residue with an essential role positioning ATP in related kinases but may be dispensable in Cak1, as cak1-K31R is able to fulfill all essential functions of the kinase. A second highly conserved residue, Asp-179, participates in coordinating a magnesium ion at the active site. Substitution of this residue with asparagine (cak1-D179N) renders Cak1 completely catalytically inactive. Cells carrying cak1-D179N alone are inviable (31Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 365-375Google Scholar). We tested the effect of expressing these alleles at high copy number in bothcak1 and cdc28 CST mutants (Fig. 6B). Consistent with the results of Chun and Goebl (31Chun K.T. Goebl M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 365-375Google Scholar), we found that overexpressed cak1-K31R but notcak1-D179N was able to restore growth of the temperature-sensitive mutant cak1-23 at 35 °C. Remarkably, both the catalytically weakened mutant cak1-K31R and the kinase-dead mutant cak1-D179N were able to suppress the temperature sensitivity of cdc28-cst2 andcdc28-cst8 mutants and to a similar degree to wild-typeCAK1. In this work, we have revealed a new function for the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 in genetic stability. We find that Cdc28 regulates the fidelity of chromosome segregation in vegetative growth and mediates cell cycle arrest in the face of spindle damage via a function associated with its carboxyl terminus. We used the temperature-sensitive checkpoint arrest of the kinetochore mutantctf13-30 to isolate further carboxyl-terminalcdc28 mutations that result in synthetic effects. Thecdc28 CST mutants identify a short, moderately conserved sequence including residues 290–293, Ala-Ile-His-Pro, as an essential determinant of chromosome stability. Indeed, each of thecdc28 CST alleles shares a change at Pro-293. Nonetheless, a Pro-293 → Phe mutant alone showed only subtle defects. Residues within or close to this domain previously have been found mutated in the G1-arresting temperature-sensitive mutantscdc28-8 (His-292 → Tyr) and cdc28-13 (Arg-283 → Gln) (32Lorincz A.T. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4099-4103Google Scholar). Similarly, the temperature-sensitive cdc2–48(Tyr-292 → His) CDK mutant in fission yeast has a substitution at a position equivalent to Tyr-294 and shows a mixed G1 and G2 arrest (33MacNeill S.A. Creanor J. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 109-118Google Scholar). Importantly, models of Cdc28 based on Cdk2 atomic structures place the residues altered in thecdc28 CST mutants on the solvent-accessible surface, at the base of Cdc28, and at a site distinct from binding sites for ATP, substrate, cyclin, Cks1, or Kap1 (Fig. 1E) (23Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Google Scholar, 24Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Google Scholar, 25Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Google Scholar), 3J. Fitz Gerald, A. Kitazono, and S. Kron, unpublished results. consistent with altered interactions with a novel regulator. Unlike conventional cdc28 temperature-sensitive mutants that arrest in a particular stage of the cell cycle, thecdc28 CST mutants continue to grow at non-permissive temperature on agar plates as large, elongated, multilobed cells that perform multiple aberrant mitoses. In liquid culture at 34 °C, cdc28 CST mutant cells do not arrest but continue cycling, accumulating with aberrant DNA content and abnormal number of SPBs. We interpret these results as a manifestation of continued cell cycle progression in the face of genetic instability at 34 °C, leading to mitotic catastrophe. Perhaps the cdc28 CST phenotype reflects uncoupling of Cdc28 functions required in mitotic progression per se from an essential mitotic surveillance function. Cdc28 may participate actively in regulating the order and completion of mitotic events such as bipolar kinetochore attachment, separation of sister chromatids, and/or spindle elongation. An alternative mechanism is a substrate-specific defect. For example, deregulation of the anaphase-promoting complex by loss of subunit phosphorylation might affect the dependence and kinetics of anaphase (34Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Google Scholar). Another striking phenotype of the cdc28 CSTmutants incubated at non-permissive temperature is the appearance of a large population of anucleate cells over time. Accumulation of anucleate and aneuploid cells was not prevented by activation of the spindle checkpoint due to the ctf13-30 temperature-sensitive mutation. We hypothesize that the mitotic catastrophe ofcdc28 CST mutants at non-permissive temperature reflects loss of an essential surveillance function of Cdc28 that monitors the order and completion of critical events required for successful mitosis such as SPB duplication, spindle assembly, kinetochore function, and/or attachment to the spindle. Our measurements of histone H1 kinase activity in thecdc28 CST mutants did reveal a significant decrease in their catalytic activity, and this defect may well contribute to their chromosome instability phenotype. Indeed, studies of checkpoint defects in the temperature-sensitive allelecdc28-5M (Leu-11 → His, Leu-83 → Ser, Ser-216 → Cys, Glu-217 → Lys, and Asn-232 → Asp) by Li and Cai (13Li X. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2723-2734Google Scholar) suggested that maintaining high Cdc28 kinase activity may be required for both DNA-damage and spindle checkpoint responses. The cdc28-5Mmutant exhibits impaired catalytic activity at non-permissive temperatures and arrests in telophase or G1 even when challenged with DNA or spindle damage. Compared withcdc28-5M, the cdc28 CST mutants exhibit much more specific defects. For example, their sensitivity and checkpoint responses to DNA damage are similar to wild type. Importantly, rather than perform a homogeneous and reversible terminal arrest at non-permissive temperature like cdc28-5M or other previously described temperature-sensitive CDC28 mutants, the cdc28 CST mutants continue to divide, become aneuploid, and lose viability, suggesting that the lethal defect is a loss of genetic stability rather than simply a defect in cell cycle progression. CAK1 was identified as a strong dosage suppressor of both the cdc28 CST temperature-sensitive phenotype and chromosome instability defects. In concert with binding of cyclin and the Cks1 subunit, CDK phosphorylation by Cak1 has a critical role in activating kinase function (30Kaldis P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Google Scholar). Suppression by Cak1 may argue for a defect in cdc28 CST catalytic activity per se as CAK1 overexpression in thecdc28 CST mutants restored total Cdc28 histone H1 kinase activity by up to 50%. Although histone H1 kinase activity does not necessarily correlate with in vivo function, this moderate increase in catalytic activity may be sufficient to relieve the defects and confer normal thermotolerance. Yet, suppression of thecdc28 CST mutants is specific, as CAK1overexpression does not suppress the nonspecific cdc28-4G1-arresting nor cdc28-1NG2-arresting mutants. In turn, overexpression of the CDK-activating subunit CKS1 suppresses the thermosensitivity of the cdc28-4 and cdc28-1N mutants but not thecdc28-cst2 and cdc28-cst8 mutants. Perhaps thecdc28 CST defects reflect decreased Cdc28 activation by Cak1 and potentially implicate the Cdc28 carboxyl terminus in Thr-169 phosphorylation. Indeed, we found that combining the cdc28 CST and cak1-23 mutations led to inviability (synthetic lethality) even at 23 °C, suggesting a requirement for full Cak1 activity. Nonetheless, deleting candidate Cak1 antagonists, the Thr-169 phosphatases Ptc2 and Ptc3 (35Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Google Scholar), singly or in combination does not suppress the temperature sensitivity of thecdc28 CST mutants (data not shown). Strikingly, suppression by Cak1 is not dependent on its catalytic activity. Overexpression of the “kinase-dead” allele cak1-D179N restores growth in the cdc28 CST mutants to levels similar to wild-type CAK1. Our favored interpretation is that the cdc28 CST mutants are specifically defective in recognition by Cak1 and that the activating effect resulting from the Cdc28-Cak1 interaction does not derive exclusively from phosphorylation at Thr-169. Prolonged binding of Cak1 to Cdc28 might result in the stabilization or assembly of the activated complex, protection against the antagonistic action of phosphatases, and/or induce changes in the substrate specificity of the complex. Why would a change in Cak1 interaction with Cdc28 specifically affect mitotic surveillance? Other than the work described here, Cak1 has yet to be implicated in a surveillance pathway or other signal transduction cascade. Nonetheless, Winter and colleagues (36Wagner M. Pierce M. Winter E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1305-1317Google Scholar) report defects in the fidelity of nuclear segregation in the cak1-17 mutant at permissive temperature. We have not confirmed other's results suggesting that interaction between Cak1 and wild-type Cdc28 is biochemically stable (37Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Google Scholar), as our attempts to confirm interaction between Cak1 and either wild-type or mutant Cdc28 by co-immunoprecipitation were unsuccessful. A two-hybrid test for protein-protein interaction indicates decreased interaction betweencdc28 CST mutants and Cak1, but we observed comparable defects in binding to other Cdc28 partners as well (data not shown). Potentially, the cdc28 CST defects are unrelated to Cak1 phosphorylation, and instead suppression is mediated only via indirect effects. Indeed, atomic models place the Cdc28 carboxyl terminus far from the Cak1 target residue Thr-169 on the activation loop (e.g. Fig. 1E), suggesting that Cak1 might need to stretch across to contact both sites on Cdc28. Our results may suggest a protein docking mechanism between Cak1 and Cdc28 like that found between an analogous pair of kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase. By studying these enzymes, Xuet al. (38Xu B. Stippec S. Robinson F.L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26509-26515Google Scholar) identified complementary sets of conserved residues that determine binding of Mek1 to its substrate, Erk2. Significantly, a determinant of Mek1 binding localizes to a sequence in Erk2 structurally equivalent to the domain mutated in thecdc28 CST alleles. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out a non-catalytic role for Cak1 in mitotic surveillance independent from its function as a Thr-169 kinase. Whereas a distinct checkpoint function for Cdc28 might be unanticipated, there is precedence for a single protein serving independent functions in both cell cycle progression and surveillance. In the yeast DNA polymerase ε subunit Pol2, an amino-terminal domain provides the catalytic activity, whereas the carboxyl terminus mediates a genetically separable DNA damage surveillance function (39Navas T.A. Sanchez Y. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2632-2643Google Scholar). Further analysis of the genetic interactions of thecdc28 CST mutants with known regulators of the mitotic spindle assembly and checkpoint pathways may reveal specific roles for Cdc28 and perhaps for Cak1 in kinetochore function and surveillance.

https://openalex.org/W2167109837,"The Wnt/β-catenin/Tcf pathway serves important functions in embryonic development and is constitutively activated in human colorectal cancer. The nuclear output of Wnt signaling is mediated by a complex between DNA-binding proteins of the TCF family and the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin. Groucho proteins act to repress transcriptional activation by β-catenin-Tcf complexes, probably by interacting directly with Tcf transcription factors. We have identified several splice forms of the mouse GrouchoGrg1 gene expressed in the developing intestine. Prominent among these is a novel and abundant isoform, Grg1-S, which we characterize in this report. Grg1-S has highest homology with the TLE family of large Groucho proteins but features only the amino-terminal Q and glycine- and proline-rich domains typical of the Groucho/AES subfamily. Grg1-S is expressed in development and in several adult mouse tissues. Expression in the adult small intestine is highest at the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Grg1-S acts to antagonize β-catenin activity in Xenopus axis duplication and luciferase reporter assays in mammalian cells.

Taken together, these findings suggest that Grg1-S may operate in conjunction with β-catenin and Tcf factors to regulate vertebrate gut epithelial cell differentiation. Wnt signaling regulates many developmental processes, including embryonic polarity and cell fate specification, by virtue of distinct signal transduction mechanisms (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Google Scholar, 2Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signals, the multifunctional protein β-catenin is continually phosphorylated and thereby targeted for degradation. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway retards β-catenin turnover and makes it available to interact with Tcf/LEF transcription factors and transactivate target genes. Two principal modes of regulation are recognized for Tcf-dependent genes as follows: the first controls β-catenin stability and, consequently, its intracellular concentration; the second modulates their expression at the level of DNA-protein complexes (3Hurlstone A. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2303-2311Google Scholar). Tcf/LEF proteins are bipartite factors that bind DNA and may act as either transcriptional repressors or activators depending on alternative protein associations (4Barker N. Morin P.J. Clevers H. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 1-24Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation is driven in part by β-catenin, whereas repression is mediated by corepressors that may interact either with β-catenin (5Bauer A. Chauvet S. Huber O. Usseglio F.

An important class of Tcf corepressors belongs to the Groucho protein family (12Cavallo R.A. Cox R.T. Moline M.M. Roose J. Polevoy G.A. Clevers H. Peifer M. Bejsovec A.

A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Google Scholar), which includes several highly conserved members. Groucho proteins were originally implicated in Drosophila neuronal and sex determination (15Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Google Scholar, 16Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 1-16Google Scholar) and are classified into two subgroups. The first group, designated Groucho/transducin-likeenhancer-of-split (TLE), 1The abbreviations used are: TLE, transducin-like enhancer-of-split; GP, glycine- and proline-rich; SP, serine- and proline-rich; Grg, Groucho-related gene; AES, amino-terminal enhancer-of-split; RT, reverse transcriptase; HA, hemagglutinin; UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; dpc, days post-coitum contains the five domains illustrated in Fig. 1 A. Two of these, the amino-terminal, glutamine-rich Q domain and a carboxyl-terminal string of tandem WD40 repeats, are highly conserved and are separated by a variable region including glycine- andproline-rich (GP), casein kinase II andcdc2 phosphorylation sites, nuclear localization sequence (CcN), and serine- andproline-rich (SP) domains. Several distinct mammalian genes are recognized and are named transducin-like enhancer (TLE) in man or Groucho-related gene (Grg) in the mouse. The second group, designatedamino-terminal enhancer-of-split (AES), contains the products of distinct gene loci and harbors only Q and GP domains. Besides a difference in protein size, the two Groucho subgroups share limited conservation within the GP domain and carboxyl-terminal portions of the Q domain. The mechanism by which Groucho proteins repress Tcf-dependent genes is poorly understood and may involve association with histone deacetylases (16Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 1-16Google Scholar,17Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Google Scholar). Besides the Tcf/LEF family, Groucho proteins also serve as corepressors for many other transcription factors (15Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Google Scholar). The role of Tcf/β-catenin gene regulation is well established in human colorectal cancer (18Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Google Scholar, 19Polakis P. Hart M. Rubinfeld B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 470: 23-32Google Scholar, 20Wong N.A. Pignatelli M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 389-401Google Scholar) and is increasingly appreciated in development and homeostasis of the vertebrate intestine. Sox 17, an early regulator of vertebrate endoderm differentiation, interacts physically with β-catenin to repress Wnt signaling (21Zorn A.M. Barish G.D. Williams B.O. Lavender P. Klymkowsky M.W. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 487-498Google Scholar), and Tcf4 knockout mice have severely reduced cell proliferation in prospective crypts in the small intestine mucosa (22Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Google Scholar). Although such observations contribute toward an emerging picture of Wnt signaling in normal and malignant gut epithelial differentiation, the place of Groucho proteins in this scheme has been explored in much less detail. Characterizing the spectrum of Groucho proteins expressed in the developing intestine is one prerequisite to this end. Additionally, accumulating evidence highlights the considerable extent to which Tcf/β-catenin gene regulation makes physiologic use of mRNA splicing variants. All Tcf genes encode a large coterie of complex variants (3Hurlstone A. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2303-2311Google Scholar) that may regulate pathway functions either subtly (23Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K.A. Knochel W. Wedlich D. Kuhl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Google Scholar) or profoundly. In intestinal crypts Tcf4 stimulates endogenous expression of a dominant negative form of Tcf1 that provides negative feedback for β-catenin gene regulation (24Roose J. Huls G. van Beest M. Moerer P. van der Horn K. Goldschmeding R. Logtenberg T. Clevers H. Science. 1999; 285: 1923-1926Google Scholar), whereas in colon tumors it preferentially activates a full-length LEF1 for apparent positive feedback (25Hovanes K. Li T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Google Scholar). To identify Groucho family members expressed in the fetal gut, we used degenerate PCR cloning, followed by screening a developing mouse gut cDNA library, and we isolated multiple independent isoforms encoded by the mouse Grg1 gene. The variety of spliced forms suggests the possibility of complex transcriptional regulation byGrg1. One novel Grg1 variant, which is expressed abundantly and designated Grg1-S, defines a third subgroup within the Groucho protein family. Grg1-S acts to repress β-catenin/Tcf-mediated gene activation in vitro and in vivo. It is expressed in the developing gut and in the adult small intestine, where it is most highly detected near the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. These findings define a new class of active Groucho proteins and suggest that Grg1-S may be a physiologic regulator of Tcf-dependent and other genetic pathways. A 442-bp fragment was first obtained by RT-PCR on reverse-transcribed mRNA from 14.5 dpc mouse small intestine, using degenerate primers corresponding to the conserved WD domain of Groucho proteins, 5′-CARATGCARCCNGTNCCNTTYCCN-3′ and 5′-TCCCANACNGCRATRTTNCCRTC-3′. A search against the Celera mouse genome data base pointed to errors in the mGrg1 sequence deposited in GenBankTM (GenBankTM accession number gi: 6755802) and indicated 100% match with the mGrg1 gene locus; the deduced peptide sequence is identical to that of human TLE1 (GenBankTM accession number gi: 13640384). A 193-bp subfragment (probe 193), amplified using the PCR primers 5′-TAAGGTGTGGGACATCAGCC-3′ and 5′-TGTCAGCTCTGCCTTTATGC-3′, was used to screen a 13.5-dpc mouse gut cDNA library (26Lee Y.J. Swencki B. Shoichet S. Shivdasani R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1566-1572Google Scholar) and to recover one clone containing part of the open reading frame and the 3′-UTR (Fig.1 A). We extended this clone in the 5′-direction by RT-PCR and then used a 250-bp fragment derived from its 5′ terminus to screen the same fetal gut cDNA library and isolate Grg1-LΔGPWD and the full-length Grg1-S clones (Fig. 1 A). Grg1-S and previously identified Grg1 transcripts are identical in the short portion of the 5′-UTR that is described for Grg1-L (GenBankTM accession number gi: 6755802). A primer specific to this UTR (5′-GGAGGATAGAGCTATCCCG) was then used in conjunction with one complementary to the 3′-UTR of Grg1-L (5′-GACAGGCAGCAGGTAGCTCC-3′) for RT-PCR on reverse-transcribed mRNA from the 14.5-dpc mouse gut. Several amplified fragments hybridized with probe 193 on Southern analysis (Fig. 3 C), and each of these RT-PCR products was subcloned into the PCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. This led us to identify the presumptive full-length Grg1-L transcript and three splice variants of differing relative abundance, which we designate Grg1-LΔWD, Grg1-LΔGP, and Grg1-LΔLZ2 according to the missing subdomains. The open reading frame (ORF) of Grg1-L was subcloned by PCR into the BamHI andSacII sites of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) in-frame with a carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope using primers 5′-TCGGGATCCATGTTCCCGCAGAGCCGC-3′ and 5′- GAACCGCGGGTAGATGACCTCATAAACGGTAG-3′. The Grg1-S ORF was cloned into pCDNA3 using the reverse primer 5′- GAACCGCGGATCTGGCTTGCCCGGCCTC-3′ and the same forward primer, and into the HindIII andNotI sites of the expression plasmid pMH (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in-frame with a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope using a similar PCR strategy. Total RNA was extracted from whole mouse embryos or from the colon, jejunum, ileum, duodenum, and stomach of adult and 14.5-dpc fetal mice using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 30 μg of RNA from each source was resolved on denaturing formaldehyde gels, transferred onto Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized in Church buffer (27Sambrook J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) at 65 °C with the following probes (Fig. 1 A): 3′Grg1-L (3′-UTR of Grg1-L generated by restriction digestion from a cDNA library-derived clone), 3′Grg1-S (3′-UTR specific to Grg1-S, generated by PCR with the primers GATAACAGGAGCTGTCTGTC and CATTGCACATTCCTAATACAGTG), and 5′Grg1, which is common to both Grg1-S and Grg1-L in the amino-terminal coding region. Adult mouse tissues were evaluated on a commercial blot (Clontech). Membranes were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C and exposed to autoradiography film. Forin situ hybridization, antisense RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin or, in independent experiments, with35S-UTP, and hybridizations were performed as described previously (26Lee Y.J. Swencki B. Shoichet S. Shivdasani R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1566-1572Google Scholar, 28Magi-Galluzzi C. Mishra R. Fiorentino M. Montironi R. Yao H. Capodieci P. Wishnow K. Kaplan I. Stork P.J. Loda M. Lab.

The next day cells were transfected over 5 h using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) and 2.12 μg of plasmid DNA as follows: 100 ng of the reporter OT (containing 3 Tcf consensus binding sites upstream of firefly luciferase cDNA) or OF (mutated in the Tcf-binding site), 800 ng of XTcf3 or hTcf4, 200 ng of β-catenin, 20 ng of pRl-TKRenilla as an internal transfection control, and 0.2–1 μg of Grg1-S and/or Grg1-L, always completed to 1 μg with the empty vector if necessary. Cells were harvested 36 h later in passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the luciferase activity was monitored using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). COS-7 cells were seeded at 105/ml on chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) and transfected with Myc epitope-tagged forms of either Grg1-S or Grg1-L using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for 5 h. 24 h later cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and treated with 50 mm NH4Cl. After a blocking step in PBS supplemented with 10% each of goat and fetal bovine sera, slides were incubated sequentially with 2 μg/ml purified anti-Myc antibody (Clone 9E10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted in PBS, 5% fetal calf serum, and with 0.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Transduction Laboratories) for 1 h each. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. COS-7 cells were seeded at 105/ml and transfected with either HA epitope-tagged Grg1-S and/or Myc epitope-tagged Grg1-L over 5 h using LipofectAMINE. 300 μl of cell lysates, prepared as described previously (14Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Google Scholar), were cleared by centrifugation and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of either anti-HA (clone 12AC5) or anti-Myc (clone 9E10) hybridoma supernatants, followed by 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h. Beads were washed 3 times in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting according to standard procedures (29.Sec 6.1.1 and 6.2.1.Google Scholar). Capped mRNAs were synthesized in vitro using linearized plasmid templates and the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopusembryos were collected, fertilized, cultured, and staged as described previously (30Shoichet S.A. Malik T.H. Rothman J.H. Shivdasani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4076-4081Google Scholar). Synthetic mRNAs (4.6 nl) were injected in the equatorial region of one blastomere on the prospective ventral side at the 4-cell stage. Embryos were incubated at 19 °C until untreated sibling tadpoles reached Nieuwkoop-Faber stage 39, fixed overnight in 0.1 M MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgSD4 7H2O, 3.7% formaldehyde (30Shoichet S.A. Malik T.H. Rothman J.H. Shivdasani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4076-4081Google Scholar), scored for axis duplication, and stored in ethanol. Uniform criteria were applied to distinguish between partial and complete axis duplications as described in the legend to Fig. 6. All cDNA sequences are deposited in GenBankTM, with accession numbers AY155195 to AY155200. Groucho proteins function as corepressors of several transcription factors, including those of the Tcf family (12Cavallo R.A. Cox R.T. Moline M.M. Roose J. Polevoy G.A. Clevers H. Peifer M. Bejsovec A. Nature. 1998; 395: 604-608Google Scholar, 13Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Google Scholar) and may hence regulate gut epithelial differentiation. To identify Groucho family genes expressed in the developing gut, we used a combination of cDNA library screening and RT-PCR on mRNA harvested from the 14.5 dpc mouse small intestine. Several distinct transcripts (Fig.1 A, for details see “Experimental Procedures”) share nearly identical sequences, implying that they are mRNA splicing variants of the same gene. Based on data base searches, we conclude that each of these transcripts is encoded by the mouse Grg1 gene, and we have named them accordingly (Fig. 1 A). Grg1-L (for “long”) encodes the longest protein containing all the typical Groucho/TLE domains, whereas four other transcripts correspond to alternative splice forms that are predicted to encode variant Groucho/TLE proteins. Because the latter species were isolated by RT-PCR and likely comigrate with the full-length Grg1-L mRNA on Northern analysis, their precise abundance and biological significance are presently unclear. In contrast, one transcript, isolated as a 2063-bp full-length clone from a mouse fetal gut cDNA library, encodes a short protein containing Q and GP domains that are identical to those of Grg1-L. This species, which we designate Grg1-S (for “short”), contains a long 5′-UTR including an in-frame stop codon and is characterized by a novel 3′-UTR that restricts the ORF to only the Q and GP domains. A search of the mouse genome data base (www.celera.com) with Grg1-S and Grg1-L sequences allowed us to infer the structure of the mouseGrg1 locus on chromosome 4 and the origins of each of the different splice forms (Fig. 1 B). The gene spans ∼100 kb and is composed of at least 20 exons, the first 7 of which produce Grg1-S. Reported Grg1-L clones are up to 2 kb shorter than the 4.3-kb length predicted by Northern analysis, indicating that a large portion of the 5′-UTR remains uncharacterized. Moreover, oligonucleotides from the 3′ end of Grg1-L and position 443 in the 5′-UTR of Grg1-S fail to amplify a product by RT-PCR, whereas in combination with other oligonucleotides, the reverse primer for this experiment readily amplified the complete Grg1-L open reading frame depicted in Fig.1 A. We hence suspect that Grg1-L results from use of an alternative, noncoding first exon. mGrg1-L shares highest homology with human TLE1, showing 87.5% nucleotide and 95.6% amino acid identity, which suggests that these genes may be orthologous. In comparing mGrg1-S with the human genome sequence, we identified two related loci, one of which corresponds to the TLE1 gene on chromosome 9 and reveals exon-intron organization similar to that described for mGrg1 (Fig.1 B). The second locus, which is on the X chromosome (PAC 323B6: emb Z83841), shows 87.4% nucleotide identity, lacks introns, and with an ORF disrupted by a stop codon, most likely represents a pseudogene. By using oligonucleotides complementary to the 3′-UTR of a presumptive human Grg1-S mRNA species, we obtained an RT-PCR product from the 293 human cell line, and DNA sequencing confirms that it corresponds to a human Grg1-S transcript. In Northern analysis of human cell lines, this product recognizes a single band (data not shown). Thus, the human TLE1 locus also enables transcription of Grg1-S. High conservation between mouse and man within the ORF and the entire 3′-UTR suggests an important role for this newly identified mRNA. Groucho proteins are divided broadly into two subgroups, which are the products of distinct genes. Groucho/TLE proteins such as Grg1-L feature five recognized domains, whereas Groucho/AES proteins contain only two domains related to Q and GP (Fig. 2). The AES group shares less homology with the TLE group in the second half of the Q domain and in the GP domain, and the implication that these subfamilies thus serve distinct cellular functions has received experimental support (13Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Google Scholar, 31Brantjes H. Roose J. van De Wetering M. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1410-1419Google Scholar). In contrast, Grg1-S is nearly identical to the entire NH2 terminus of Grg1-L, with the exception of the last 8 amino acids generated by alternative splicing within exon 7 (Figs. 1 B and 2). This agrees with its apparent origin as a splicing variant; however, Grg1-S is more closely related to the AES subfamily in size. These features distinguish Grg1-S from Groucho/TLE and AES forms described previously (16Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 1-16Google Scholar) and define it as a novel, naturally occurring Groucho protein subtype. To ascertain the level of Grg1-S mRNA expression, we performed Northern analysis. In adult mouse tissues the 5′Grg1 probe, common to most isoforms, identifies discrete 4.3- and 2.3-kb mRNA species of roughly equal abundance, with predominant expression in liver and lung and detectable expression in heart, brain, kidney, and testis (Fig.3 A,middle panel). In contrast, the specific 3′Grg1-S probe identifies only the 2.3-kb transcript, in much the same distribution (Fig. 3 A,left panel). Interestingly, this tissue expression pattern strongly resembles that previously identified for mTcf4 (26Lee Y.J. Swencki B. Shoichet S. Shivdasani R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1566-1572Google Scholar). A probe specific for the 3′-UTR of Grg1-L identifies only the 4.3-kb transcript (Fig. 3 A,right panel). The common 5′ probe is the only one to detect a weak 2.3-kb signal in skeletal muscle, which may reflect cross-hybridization with some other transcript. Northern analysis at different stages of mouse fetal development identifies the same two major mRNA species of 2.3 and 4.3 kb with nearly constant levels between 11.5 and 15.5 dpc (Fig. 3 B). However, in contrast to adult tissues, where the two transcripts are present in nearly equal proportion, the level of Grg1-L mRNA slightly exceeds that of Grg1-S (Fig. 3 B,middle panel). The 3′Grg1-S probe recognizes an additional 9-kb transcript of unclear significance (Fig. 3 B,left panel). Taken together, these observations indicate that Grg1-S is a major mRNA species encoded by the mouse Grg1 locus and expressed in several adult tissues. Grg1-S and Grg1-L mRNA levels do not appear to be developmentally regulated in the midgestation mouse embryo. mRNAs represented through hybridization with the 3′Grg1-L probe should be interpreted cautiously because all the Grg1-L mRNAs have an identical 3′-UTR and could be quite similar in size. To estimate the relative abundance of the splice variants detected by RT-PCR on the 14.5-dpc mouse gut, we analyzed the products of this RT-PCR by Southern analysis (Fig. 3 C) prior to their cloning. Grg1-LΔGP and full-length Grg1-L are the two predominant isoforms, whereas variants missing either the second leucine zipper and GP domain or a portion of the WD domain are relatively minor species. Grg1-S exhibits nearly similar expression along the rostro-caudal axis of the developing (14.5 dpc) and adult mouse gut (Fig.4, A and B), with possibly lower levels in the colon. However, the 9-kb transcript detected weakly in the whole embryo is more readily observed in the developing gut, raising the possibility that Grg1 encodes two major fetal intestinal mRNA species with common 3′-UTR sequences. To localize Grg1-S mRNA in the gut with greater precision, we performed in situ hybridization on sections of the adult small intestine using a specific 3′-UTR probe and observed strongest expression at the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn (Fig.4 C). Cells that reside here constitute the proliferative compartment of the intestinal mucosa, maintain a brisk cellular turnover throughout life, respond to epithelial injury, and are the target of defects in mice lacking Tcf4 gene function (22Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Google Scholar,32Potten C.S. Booth C. Pritchard D.M. Int. J. Exp.

Groucho/TLE proteins contain a nuclear localization signal within the CcN domain and are present in the cell nucleus (34Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 119-127Google Scholar), whereas Groucho/AES proteins may be found either in the cytosol or in the nucleus (13Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Google Scholar, 35Mallo M. Gendron-Maguire M. Harbison M.L. Gridley T. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 338-347Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular locations of Grg1-L and Grg1-S, we transfected COS cells with Myc epitope-tagged expression constructs and assessed protein expression by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig.5 A). Whereas Grg1-L is exclusively and predictably nuclear, Grg1-S is found in both the cytosol and nucleus despite the absence of a CcN domain. This bicompartmental distribution is observed at even the lowest levels of Grg1-S transfection. Grg1-S thus defines not only a novel subtype of Groucho proteins but also shows unexpected subcellular localization. Cotransfection of Grg1-L and Grg1-S did not visibly modify the location of either protein, nor did cotransfection of Grg1-S with different Tcf-family members result in movement of the cytosolic Grg1-S fraction to the nucleus (data not shown). Groucho proteins can form homo- and hetero-oligomers through interactions that require the Q domain and are necessary for transcriptional regulation (36Chen G. Nguyen P.H. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7259-7268Google Scholar, 37Ren B. Chee K.J. Kim T.H. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 125-137Google Scholar). To test the ability of Grg1-S to interact with itself or with Grg1-L, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments after overexpressing hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Grg1-S with Myc epitope-tagged forms of either Grg1-S or Grg1-L in COS cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Both Grg1-S and Grg1-L are present in Grg1-S immune complexes (Fig. 5, B,lane 3 and C, lane 1), and Grg1-S is identified in both Grg1-S and Grg1-L complexes (Fig. 5, B,lane 6, and C,lane 4). Thus, Grg1-S possesses the capacity for both nuclear localization and protein interactions to form Grg1-S homopolymers and Grg1-S-Grg1-L heteropolymeric complexes. Groucho proteins interact with Tcf factors as negative regulator of the β-catenin/Tcf transcriptional pathway (13Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Google Scholar). Based on the findings described above, we considered two possible functions: (i) that Grg1-S could repress β-catenin/Tcf-mediated gene activation, or (ii) that it may behave as a dominant antagonist of repression mediated by other Groucho proteins such as Grg1-L. We first performed axis duplication assays in Xenopus embryos, where β-catenin accumulates early on the prospective dorsal side and formation of the dorso-ventral axis requires activation of β-catenin/Tcf target genes (13Roose J.

(Lond.). 1999; 516: 855-868Google Scholar) that IP4 can activate Ca2+ influx channels in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, one of the first effects of IP4 to be reported highlighted an ability of this compound to synergize with IP3 to mobilize Ca2+ and regulate subsequent store-operated Ca2+ influx (11Morris A.P.

In recent years, we have taken the view that if IP4 does indeed constitute a novel second messenger, one criterion that must be fulfilled is the presence within cells of protein(s) that specifically bind IP4,i.e. an IP4 receptor. To this end, we have described the purification (17Cullen P.J. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 139-143Google Scholar, 18Cullen P.J. Chung S.-K. Chang Y.-T. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F.

Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Google Scholar) of a highly specific IP4-binding protein termed GAP1IP4BP. This protein, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein for members of the Ras-like family of small GTPases, at present constitutes the most promising candidate IP4 receptor. The Ras-like family includes H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4A and 4B, the R-Ras proteins, the Ral proteins, and the Rap proteins 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B (20Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Google Scholar). These are ubiquitously expressed, evolutionarily conserved proteins that couple extracellular signals to various cellular responses (20Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Google Scholar, 21Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Google Scholar, 22Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Google Scholar). All of these proteins have the inherent ability to undergo conformational changes in response to the alternate binding of GDP and GTP. The GDP-bound “off” state and the GTP-bound “on” state recognize distinct effector proteins, thereby allowing these proteins to function as two-state molecular “switches.” Importantly, cycling between the two forms does not occur spontaneously. Activation requires guanine nucleotide exchange factors to induce the dissociation of GDP to allow association of the more abundant GTP, and deactivation requires GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) to bind to the GTP-bound form to enhance the rate of intrinsic GTPase activity (20Campbell S.L.

Associated with the plasma membrane through a complex interaction between its PH/Btk domain and the inner plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) (31Lockyer P.J.

Bottomley J.R. Millard T.H. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Google Scholar), GAP1IP4BP functions as a dual Ras and Rap1 GAP (19Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Google Scholar, 33Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Google Scholar). Importantly, at least in vitro, the Ras GAP activity of GAP1IP4BP is regulated by IP4 (19Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Google Scholar). The data that have raised the key issue of whether the effects of IP4 on the regulation of [Ca2+]i are mediated by GAP1IP4BP. At present, the only direct evidence in favor of this finding has emerged from l-1210 cells (34Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 549-553Google Scholar,35Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Cullen P.J. Dreikhausen U.E. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 811-816Google Scholar). In these permeabilized cells, the addition of exogenous GAP1IP4BP enhances the well documented ability of IP4 to potentiate IP3-stimulated Ca2+ release (36Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Walker C.D. Bottomley J.R. Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 947-952Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear as to the role of GAP1IP4BP in vivo. In this study, we have addressed this issue by using various molecular approaches including overexpression of potential constitutive and dominant negative forms of GAP1IP4BP and siRNA to examine a potential in vivo role for GAP1IP4BP in the regulation of [Ca2+]i in HeLa cells. The pGEX plasmids containing the coding sequences for the GAP1IP4BP mutants, isolated using the Transformer kit from Clontech as previously described (31Lockyer P.J. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S.

Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Google Scholar), and ΔC2GAP1IP4BP were transformed individually into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) to express and purify as GST fusion proteins using the procedure described previously (33Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Google Scholar). A single colony of the transformed strain was inoculated into 5 ml of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 with fresh LB containing ampicillin and grown at 37 °C with shaking until the cell density reached anA600 of 0.5. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C after which cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold buffer A (PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by sonication (3 × 20-s pulses with 1 min at 4 °C between each sonication) and incubated at 4 °C with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h with gentle mixing prior to the removal of cell debris by centrifugation. 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) prewashed with buffer A was added to the resultant supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant shaking. The resin was washed with 3 × 10 ml of ice-cold buffer A prior to elution of bound GST fusion protein with 3 × 1 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl containing 10 mm glutathione, pH 8.0, by incubating with constant mixing for 10 min at room temperature. The eluates were pooled, and protein content was estimated by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to check the purity of the eluted protein. These were performed as described previously. An individual binding assay contained 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 30,000 dpm of [32P]IP4 (see Ref. 17Cullen P.J. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 139-143Google Scholar), 0.5–1 μg of GST fusion protein, and various concentrations of competing unlabeled inositol phosphates in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Equilibrium binding was reached by a 15-min incubation at 4 °C after which the receptor-ligand complex was precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of 5 mg/ml γ-globulin and 1 ml of 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol. The samples were spun for 10 min prior to the removal of the supernatant with the resultant pellet being briefly washed prior to counting. These were performed under first order kinetics as described previously (33Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Google Scholar). The particular GTP-binding protein was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci mmol−1, Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min at 25 °C. GTPase activity was assayed at 25 °C by the addition of the various GAPs to the loaded GTP-binding protein. At the required time points, activity was stopped by the addition of 5 mmsilicotungstate, 1 mm H2SO4 with the liberated [32P]Pi being extracted with isobutanol/toluene (1/1 v/v), 5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, and 2m H2SO4. The upper phase was removed for scintillation counting. GST-Ras-binding domain was purified as previously described previously (27Lockyer P.J. Wennstrom S. Kupzig S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Google Scholar, 30Lockyer P.J. Kupzig S. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 981-986Google Scholar). Dishes (100 mm) of cells (8 × 105 cells) were transiently transfected by lipofection (FuGENE 6, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 2.5 μg of H-Ras DNA. The cells were serum-starved for 2 h at 37 °C in KH buffer (5 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mmK2HPO4, 118 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) 24 h post-transfection prior to stimulation with 50 μm ATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysis, Ras-GTP pull-down assay, and the detection of immobilized Ras were carried out as described previously (27Lockyer P.J. Wennstrom S. Kupzig S. Venkateswarlu K. Downward J. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 265-268Google Scholar, 30Lockyer P.J. Kupzig S. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 981-986Google Scholar). Blots were analyzed by volume integration using ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). A monoclonal antibody (GP-3) was raised against a GST fusion of a GAP1IP4BP mutant lacking the N-terminal tandem C2 domains as follows. 250 μg of the isolated GST-ΔC2GAP1IP4BP was emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant prior to intramuscular injection into four male mice. At 22 days, an additional 250 μg emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant was injected subcutaneously. Ten days later, a tail vein bleed showed a high antibody titer (as detected by immunoblotting of ΔC2GAP1IP4BP) and thus 1 day later, the pre-kill boost (250 μg in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmK2PO4, pH 7.4) was administered intravenously. Three days later, test serum and the spleen were removed. Fusion was undertaken by mixing spleen cells with myeloma cells in a ratio of 5:1. Mixed cells were plated in 4 × 96-well plates containing MRC-5 feeder cells and 100 μl of 20% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. These cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Subsequent culture of hybridomas and cloning by limited dilution were followed as standard. Antibodies were used in experiments in the form of untreated culture supernatants from cells grown to stationary phase. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using antibodies immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences). Protein G beads were washed in PBS and incubated with the GP-3 hybridoma supernatant for 4 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. The beads were washed in PBS and then twice in 0.2m sodium borate. Dimethyl primelimidate was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the slurry was mixed at room temperature for 30 min. After one wash in 0.2 methanolamine, the beads were incubated in 0.2 methanolamine for an additional 2 h to complete the covalent coupling of the antibody to the beads. The beads were washed thoroughly in PBS and then stored at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.01% azide. For immunoprecipitations, cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% azide), and then cell debris was pelleted by high speed centrifugation. The GP-3-coupled Sepharose beads were washed thoroughly in lysis buffer, and then the lysates were added to the beads and incubated, mixing end-over-end at 4 °C for between 2 and 4 h. Beads were washed several times with lysis buffer, and the final wash aspirated tight to the beads. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE prior to visualization. pTet-Off-transfected HeLa cells (Clontech) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal-calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml G418, and 2 μg/ml doxycycline. Cells were co-transfected with GAP1IP4BP pTRE and pTK-Hyg (Clontech) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Note that pTRE does not contain a mammalian-selectable marker, but pTK-Hyg confers hygromycin resistance. Stable cell lines were selected using 500 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and maintained in 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. When the expression of GAP1IP4BP was desired, the medium was replaced with doxycycline-free medium 24–48 h prior to using the cells. GAP1IP4BP(o/e3) cells were seeded into the wells of a six-well plate, and 24 h later at a confluency of 30%, they were transiently transfected using OligoFECTAMINE (Invitrogen) with 200 pmol of GAP1IP4BP-specific siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (siRNA sequence 5′-AAGUCACUCUGCCCGUUUUAC-3′). Cells were cultured in the presence of doxycycline for the required period prior to Ca2+ imaging and the analysis of GAP1IP4BPlevel by immunoblotting using the GP-3 monoclonal antibody. Cells were grown on 22-mm coverslips and then washed with 2 ml of extracellular medium (121 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.6 mmMgCl2, 6 mm NaHCO3, 9 mm glucose, 25 mm Hepes, 1.8 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated in 1 ml of extracellular medium containing 2 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with 2 ml of extracellular medium. Ca2+ imaging was performed using the Merlin ratiometric Ca2+-imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), an UltraPix FKL300 digital camera, and an Olympus IX50 inverted microscope fitted with a ×40 oil-immersion objective lens. The data were processed using Merlin software. All imaging was performed at 37 °C with constant perfusion. [Ca2+] calibrations were calculated with Merlin software using 340/380 ratio maxima and minima obtained by the treatment of cells with 2 μm ionomycin followed by 20 mm EGTA. Our initial approach to examining the role of GAP1IP4BP in the regulation of [Ca2+]i was to design a series of site-directed mutants with the aim of isolating constitutively active and dominant negative forms that could potentially be used to interfere with the function of endogenous GAP1IP4BP. As shown in Fig. 1, the conversion of arginine into cysteine at position 601 within the PH/Btk domain of GAP1IP4BP resulted in a mutant protein that, although displaying a greatly reduced IP4 binding activity, ∼10% of that seen with wild-type protein (33Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) nevertheless retained full Ras GAP activity when assayed in vitro (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the conversion of leucine into alanine at position 484, a residue located within the predicted Ras-binding site present in the Ras GAP-related domain (37Corbett K.D. Alber T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 710-716Google Scholar), resulted in a GAP1IP4BP mutant that, although displaying no detectable in vitro Ras GAP activity (Fig. 1B), retained the ability to bind IP4 with an affinity and isomeric specificity identical to that of wild type (Fig. 1Aand data not shown). To assay the Ras GAP activity of these mutants in vivo, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with H-Ras and the relevant GAP1IP4BP and assayed the level of Ras-GTP using a GST fusion of the Ras-GTP-binding domain from Raf. In serum-starved cells, a substantial quantity of overexpressed H-Ras was in the GTP-bound state (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, wild-type GAP1IP4BP caused a significant decrease in the amount of Ras-GTP that was recovered compared with controls. This basal Ras GAP activity was dependent on the Ras GAP-related domain because the expression of GAP1IP4BP(L484A) had no effect on Ras-GTP levels, even when this mutant was expressed at significantly higher levels than wild-type GAP1IP4BP (Fig. 2). The expression of the cytosolic GAP1IP4BP(R601C) resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of recoverable Ras-GTP when compared with the expression of the same level of wild-type GAP1IP4BP (Fig. 2). Similar data were also obtained using green fluorescent protein-tagged versions of wild type and the various GAP1IP4BP mutants (data not shown). To examine the effect of overexpressing wild-type GAP1IP4BP and the various GAP1IP4BP mutants on intracellular Ca2+homeostasis, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with the GAP1IP4BP constructs tagged at their N termini with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). This spectral variant of green fluorescent protein allowed visualization of those cells expressing GAP1IP4BP and, when coupled with Fura-2 imaging, allowed the analysis of Ca2+ transients in single cells following stimulation with histamine (Fig. 3). We performed experiments in the absence of extracellular Ca2+to allow discrimination between the Ca2+ released from internal stores and that from Ca2+ entry. In these assays, the initial increase in [Ca2+]i that arose from IP3-stimulated release of Ca2+ from internal stores (38Bootman M.D. Young K.W. Young J.M. Moreton R.B. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 347-354Google Scholar) was not significantly altered in those cells expressing YFP-GAP1IP4BP(R601C), YFP-GAP1IP4BP(L484A), or YFP-GAP1IP4BP (Fig. 3). Such data suggest that the overexpression of wild-type GAP1IP4BP or the various GAP1IP4BP mutants has no detectable effect on IP3-stimulated Ca2+release when assayed under these conditions. In addition, after allowing the [Ca2+]i to return to the basal state, we analyzed store-operated Ca2+ entry by adding extracellular Ca2+. This induced an elevation of [Ca2+]i that was not significantly altered by the expression of various GAP1IP4BP constructs (Fig. 3). As a positive control, we also analyzed the histamine-stimulated Ca2+ transient that was present in cells overexpressing the store-operated Ca2+ influx channel Trp3. Here we observed a clear enhancement of Ca2+ influx, consistent with that reported previously (39Vazquez G. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Google Scholar). Thus, under these particular assay conditions, GAP1IP4BP has no detectable effect on store-operated Ca2+ influx. Although the data presented in Fig. 3suggest that when assayed under these particular conditions GAP1IP4BP appears to have no detectable effect on [Ca2+]i following histamine stimulation of HeLa cells, we extended our experimental approach by examining the effect of manipulating the level of endogenous GAP1IP4BP. To undertake this approach, we first generated a monoclonal antibody against GAP1IP4BP that was capable of detecting endogenous protein (our previously characterized GAP1IP4BP polyclonal antibody, H113 (19Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Google Scholar), was unable to detect endogenous levels of GAP1IP4BP in HeLa cells (data not shown)). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a mouse monoclonal antibody (GP-3) was raised against a GST fusion of a GAP1IP4BP mutant lacking the N-terminal tandem C2 domains (33Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Google Scholar). In HeLa cells overexpressing each of the mammalian GAP1 family members, GP-3 was only capable of detecting a protein in those cells transiently transfected with an expression vector for GAP1IP4BP (Fig. 4A). In non-transfected HeLa cells, GP-3 detected an endogenous protein of ∼96 kDa on Western blots (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, GP-3 was capable of immunoprecipitating a 96-kDa protein that was detected by the GAP1IP4BP-specific polyclonal antibody H113 (Fig. 4C). The GP-3 immunoprecipitate also displayed Ras GAP activity and specific IP4 binding activity (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the 96-kDa protein detected by GP-3 in HeLa cell lysates is endogenous GAP1IP4BP. Therefore, this antibody was employed in the subsequent assays designed to silence the expression of endogenous GAP1IP4BP. To deplete endogenous GAP1IP4BP, we used RNA interference. RNA interference is the process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals and plants initiated by double-stranded RNA that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene (40Fire A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 358-363Google Scholar). Recently, 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes have been shown to specifically suppress the expression of endogenous genes in mammalian cell lines (41Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar, 42Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Beckert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Google Scholar, 43Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1443-1448Google Scholar). Therefore, we designed and used a specific siRNA to suppress the expression of endogenous GAP1IP4BP. To achieve an experimental system amenable to manipulation, we initially isolated a stably transfected HeLa cells line expressing full-length human GAP1IP4BP under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). To examine the leakiness and inducibility of GAP1IP4BP, the expression in this cell line named GAP1IP4BP (o/e3), we compared whole cell lysates derived from the parental pTet-Off HeLa cell line with those from GAP1IP4BP(o/e3) following 48-h culture in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline (a tetracycline analogue). When cultured in the presence of doxycycline, the endogenous level of GAP1IP4BP in GAP1IP4BP(o/e3) and the parental cell line were almost identical (Fig. 5A). However, in the absence of doxycycline, immunoblotting with GP-3 revealed a high level of inducible overexpression of GAP1IP4BP (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the degree of overexpression could be tightly regulated by titration of the doxycycline concentration within the culture medium (Fig. 5B). To deplete endogenous GAP1IP4BP, we transiently transfected GAP1IP4BP(o/e3) cells with siRNA designed against GAP1IP4BP. After 24–48-h culture in the continued presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline, immunoblotting with GP-3 revealed that the level of endogenous GAP1IP4BP was reduced by 91.3 ± 6.1% (Fig. 5C). This depletion was specific for the GAP1IP4BP siRNA because no detectable loss of endogenous GAP1IP4BP was observed in cells treated with a control siRNA (Fig. 5C). Thus, for the GAP1IP4BP(o/e3) cell line, we could manipulate the level of GAP1IP4BP in a number of ways. First, culturing in the continued presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline resulted in a level of GAP1IP4BP that was similar to the endogenous level present in the parental cell line. Second, culturing in the absence of doxycycline generated cells in which GAP1IP4BP was significantly overexpressed. Third, culturing in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline following transient transfection with the GAP1IP4BP-specific siRNA resulted in cells in which the endogenous GAP1IP4BP was dramatically depleted. Finally, culturing cells following transient transfection with the GAP1IP4BP-specific siRNA in the presence of a carefully determined concentration of doxycycline allowed the regulation of promoter activity such that the overall level of GAP1IP4BP returned to near endogenous levels (data not shown). This latter condition was of particular importance because in the event that suppression of endogenous GAP1IP4BP resulted in a detectable change in [Ca2+]i, revertion of the change by the manipulation of GAP1IP4BP back to the endogenous levels would strongly suggest that the phenotype was the result of depletion of GAP1IP4BP and not a nonspecific effect of the siRNA. In the initial experiments, we analyzed the level of Ras-GTP present within GAP1IP4BP(o/e3) cells cultured under the various conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, under conditions in which GAP1IP4BP was significantly overexpressed, the level of Ras-GTP was significantly reduced compared with cells expressing endogenous levels of GAP1IP4BP. This finding contrasted with conditions in which endogenous GAP1IP4BP had been depleted. Here, Ras-GTP levels were similar to control cells. Thus, manipulating GAP1IP4BPlevels within this cell line results in the alteration of the levels of Ras-GTP. To analyze the intracellular free Ca2+ homeostasis within GAP1IP4BP(o/e3) cells cultured under these conditions, we performed Ca2+-imaging experiments in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. However, using Fura-2-loaded cells, we failed to observe any effect of overexpressing GAP1IP4BP or depleting endogenous GAP1IP4BP on the initial increase in [Ca2+]i following histamine stimulation (Fig. 7). In addition, after allowing the [Ca2+]i to return to the basal state, we analyzed store-operated Ca2+ entry by adding extracellular Ca2+. This induced an elevation of [Ca2+]i that was again not significantly altered by the overexpression of GAP1IP4BP or the depletion of endogenous GAP1IP4BP (Fig. 7). In this report, we have described results from a series of experiments aimed at addressing whether the putative IP4 receptor GAP1IP4BP may function to allow IP4 to regulate [Ca2+]i. Our initial approach was to design a series of site-directed mutants with the aim of isolating constitutively active and interfering forms of GAP1IP4BP that could be used to potentially block the function of endogenous GAP1IP4BP. First, the conversion of arginine into cysteine at position 601 within the PH/Btk domain of GAP1IP4BP resulted in a mutant protein that, although displaying a greatly reduced IP4 binding activity (33Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 143-149Google Scholar), retained full Ras GAP activity when assayed in vitro. Importantly, when assayed in vivo, this mutant, GAP1IP4BP(R601C), displayed a significantly elevated level of basal Ras GAP activity when compared with wild-type GAP1IP4BP. In other words, GAP1IP4BP(R601C) may function as a constitutively active mutant. Such a conclusion is consistent with the in vitro evidence that when associated with plasma membrane-like liposomes through PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding to its PH/Btk domain, GAP1IP4BP has a suppressed Ras GAP activity, a suppression that can be alleviated following the binding of IP4 to the PH/Btk domain (19Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Google Scholar). In the case of the GAP1IP4BP(R601C) mutant, the inability of the PH/Btk domain to bind IP4 is mirrored by a loss in binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 (32Cozier G.E. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T.H. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Google Scholar). This results in GAP1IP4BP(R601C) residing in the cytosol rather than at the plasma membrane (31Lockyer P.J. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. McNulty T.J. Venkateswarlu K. Potter B.V.L. Dempsey C.E. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1007-1010Google Scholar). Importantly, the induced activity of the GAP1IP4BP(R601C) mutant does not appear to simply result from a loss in plasma membrane association. Targeting this mutant back to the plasma membrane by the addition of a CAAXmotif does not result in a suppression of the Ras GAP activity (data not shown). This finding suggests that the constitutive activity of the GAP1IP4BP(R601C) mutant may result from the removal of the negative influence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding to the PH/Btk on the Ras GAP activity. Such a scenario may help explain how IP4 can activate the Ras GAP activity of this protein in vitro (19Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Google Scholar). IP4 may remove the negative control exerted by PtdIns(4,5)P2 by competing for binding to the PH/Btk domain. In contrast, the conversion of leucine into alanine at position 484 resulted in a GAP1IP4BP mutant that, although displaying no detectable in vitro or in vivo Ras GAP activity, retained the ability to bind IP4 with an affinity and isomeric specificity identical to wild-type GAP1IP4BP. This mutant also retained the ability to associate with the plasma membrane (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that upon overexpression, this particular mutant, GAP1IP4BP(L484A), may interfere with the function of endogenous GAP1IP4BP by binding to IP4, but because of the loss of GAP activity, this mutant will not induce the subsequent regulation of Ras function. Indeed, the overexpression of a comparable mutant of the GAP1IP4BP-related protein CAPRI appears to interfere with endogenous CAPRI function (30Lockyer P.J. Kupzig S. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 981-986Google Scholar). Having generated and characterized the various GAP1IP4BPmutants, we analyzed their effect on the changes in [Ca2+]i that occur following histamine stimulation of HeLa cells. Through single cell analysis of HeLa cells overexpressing each of these mutants, we failed to observe any alteration in the release of internally stored Ca2+ or store-operated Ca2+ entry following histamine stimulation. Thus, using these particular mutants, we were unable to detect any apparent role for GAP1IP4BP in the regulation of [Ca2+]i observed following histamine stimulation of HeLa cells. To complement these studies and negate potential problems especially with interpreting the ability of the GAP1IP4BP(L484A) mutant to function as a dominant negative, we observed the affect of depleting endogenous GAP1IP4BP on [Ca2+]i. Using siRNA technology, we were able to significantly suppress the expression of endogenous GAP1IP4BP in a HeLa cell line stably expressing GAP1IP4BP under a tetracycline-regulated promoter. However, under conditions in which we manipulated the level of endogenous GAP1IP4BP either by overexpression or siRNA suppression, we again failed to observe any affect on the release of internally store-operated Ca2+ or store-operated Ca2+ influx following stimulation with histamine. As far as we are aware, this is the first study in which agonist-dependent changes in [Ca2+]ihave been analyzed in cells in which the endogenous level of GAP1IP4BP has been so dramatically varied within the same cell line. The only other study that has reported the effect of reducing the expression of GAP1IP4BP on [Ca2+]i within mammalian cells is that of Luet al. (44Lu X. Fein A. Feinstein M. O'Rourke F.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 81-95Google Scholar). In this study (44Lu X. Fein A. Feinstein M. O'Rourke F.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 81-95Google Scholar), the authors examined the role of GAP1IP4BP in store-operated Ca2+ entry by comparing two clonally selected human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell lines, one expressing a constitutively active GAP1IP4BPantisense construct (AS-HEL cells) and the other a vector lacking the antisense construct (V-HEL cells) (44Lu X. Fein A. Feinstein M. O'Rourke F.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 81-95Google Scholar). In the AS-HEL cells in which endogenous GAP1IP4BP was reduced by between 85 and 96%, a substantial increase in Ca2+ entry was observed following thrombin addition (44Lu X. Fein A. Feinstein M. O'Rourke F.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 81-95Google Scholar). This enhanced entry was shown to result from the activation of intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels that induced membrane hyperpolarization, thereby stimulating Ca2+ entry (44Lu X. Fein A. Feinstein M. O'Rourke F.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 81-95Google Scholar). However, partly because the expression of the GAP1IP4BP antisense was not inducible, the authors (44Lu X. Fein A. Feinstein M. O'Rourke F.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 81-95Google Scholar) were unable to firmly establish that the difference in [Ca2+]i observed between the two cell lines was not simply down to clonal variation. Furthermore, no attempt was made to revert the observed Ca2+ phenotype by expression of exogenous GAP1IP4BP in the AS-HEL cells. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the observed affect of depleting endogenous GAP1IP4BP on intracellular Ca2+homeostasis within HEL cells stems from the direct loss of GAP1IP4BP. Currently, the only direct evidence for a role of GAP1IP4BPin Ca2+ homeostasis has emerged from l-1210 cells (34Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 549-553Google Scholar, 35Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Cullen P.J. Dreikhausen U.E. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 811-816Google Scholar). In these permeabilized cells, the addition of exogenous GAP1IP4BP enhances the well documented ability of IP4 to potentiate IP3-stimulated Ca2+ release (36Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Walker C.D. Bottomley J.R. Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 947-952Google Scholar). This is a reproducible observation that clearly suggests that in these cells under these particular conditions the binding of IP4 to GAP1IP4BP does appear to play a role in the regulation of IP3-stimulated Ca2+ release (36Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Walker C.D. Bottomley J.R. Cullen P.J. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 947-952Google Scholar). However, our approach of manipulating endogenous GAP1IP4BP within intact HeLa cells suggests that a global role for GAP1IP4BP in the regulation of [Ca2+]i may not be a detectable phenomenon.

In this study, we tested whether pretreatment with NO regulates NO production in response to cytokines in cultured rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were recovered in fresh medium for 24 h following pretreatment with the NO donorS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) and stimulated to express the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) with interleukin-1β and interferon-γ or transfected with the human iNOS gene. NO pretreatment resulted in a significant increase in NO production without changing iNOS expression for both conditions. This effect, which did not occur in macrophages and smooth muscle cells, was inhibited when NO was scavenged using red blood cells. Pretreatment with oxidized SNAP, 8-Br-cGMP, NO2−, or NO3− did not increase the cytokine-induced NO production. SNAP pretreatment increased cytosolic iNOS activity measured only in the absence of exogenous tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). SNAP pretreatment suppressed the level of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCHI) feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) and increased GTPCHI activity without changing GTPCHI protein level. SNAP pretreatment also increased total cellular levels of biopterin and active iNOS dimer. These results suggest that SNAP pretreatment increased NO production from iNOS by elevating cellular BH4 levels and promoting iNOS subunit dimerization through the suppression of GFRP levels and subsequent activation of GTPCHI.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar). It is synthesized froml-arginine by the enzyme nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), which requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) for maximal activity. NOS catalyzes the oxidation of the terminal guanidonitrogen atom of l-arginine to form l-citrulline and NO. Three isoforms of NOS have been identified and categorized into constitutive and inducible isotypes. Two distinct constitutive NOS (cNOS) isoforms have been cloned from neuronal (2Reif D.W. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 566-568Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (3Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Google Scholar), which produce nanomolar amounts of NO. A third isoform, inducible NOS (iNOS) is expressed in response to inflammatory cytokines in many cell types including hepatocytes (4Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Google Scholar), and produces micromolar levels of NO. All of these isotypes are active as homodimers and require NADPH, FAD, FMN, calmodulin, and BH4 (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Google Scholar). The first four cofactors are usually present in the cells at concentrations that are not limiting for the enzyme activity. The precise role of BH4 in the iNOS-catalyzed reaction is still equivocal, but it may function as an allosteric cofactor that promotes assembly of iNOS into its active dimeric form (6Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 7Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Google Scholar). BH4 is produced de novo from GTP by the three consecutive enzymatic reactions: GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCHI), 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase, and sepiapterin reductase (reviewed in Ref. 8Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar). BH4 can also be produced either by a salvage pathway producing dihydrobiopterin via dihydrofolate reductase, or by a recycling pathway that generates 4α-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin via 4α-carbinolamine dehydratase and dihydropteridine reductase (8Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar, 9Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Google Scholar). However, cellular levels of BH4 are largely regulated by the activity of GTPCHI, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in de novo BH4synthesis (8Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar, 10Burg A.W. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2349-2358Google Scholar). GTPCHI mRNA expression and subsequent BH4 synthesis can be induced in fibroblasts (11Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Google Scholar), macrophages (12Sakai N. Kaufman S. Milstein S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 6-10Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells (13Scott-Burden T. Elizondo E. Ge T. Boulanger C.M. Vanhoutte P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1261-1266Google Scholar), and hepatocytes (14Di Silvio M. Geller D.A. Gross S.S. Nussler A. Freeswick P. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 305-308Google Scholar) by the same proinflammatory stimuli that induce iNOS mRNA expression. The catalytic activity of GTPCHI is negatively regulated by the GTPCHI feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) in the presence of BH4 and GTP (15Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Google Scholar). In fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells exposed to immune stimuli, NO production is suppressed by inhibition ofde novo BH4 synthesis and increased by adding sepiapterin or BH4 (11Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Google Scholar, 16Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytokine treatment of endothelial cells enhances NO production by increasingGTPCHI expression and BH4 levels without changing endothelial NOS (eNOS) expression (17Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the intracellular level of BH4 is a rate-limiting factor for NOS activity. It has been shown that cotreatment with NO donors and cytokines in hepatocytes inhibits NO production by the suppression of NF-κB-dependent iNOS expression (18Taylor B.S. Kim Y.M. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Arch. Surg. 1997; 132: 1177-1183Google Scholar). However, the effect of NO pretreatment on cytokine stimulation of NO production has not been studied. We investigated the effect of pretreatment with the NO-donorS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) on the factors influencing NO production following stimulation of hepatocytes with cytokines, IL-1β and IFNγ. We found that SNAP pretreatment increased iNOS subunit dimerization and iNOS activity, without changes in expression of iNOS, by augmenting intracellular BH4 levels through the suppression of GFRP levels and subsequent activation of GTPCHI. William's medium E, penicillin, streptomycin,l-glutamate, and Hepes were purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Insulin was obtained from Lilly Inc. (Indianapolis, IN) and calf serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Monoclonal iNOS antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). SNAP and oxidized SNAP were prepared as described previously (19Field L. Dilts R.V. Ravichandran R. Lenhert P.G. Carnahan G.E. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; : 249-250Google Scholar, 20Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Google Scholar). Red blood cells were prepared by collecting blood from rats as previously described (21Kim Y.M. Hong S.J. Billiar T.R. Simmons R.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3074-3080Google Scholar). Antibodies for GTPCHI and GFRP were generated by Dr. Kazuyuki Hatakeyama. All other chemicals and proteins were purchased from Sigma, unless indicated otherwise. Rat hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g, Harlan Sprague-Dawley) by a collagen perfusion method (20Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Google Scholar). Highly purified hepatocytes (>98%) were obtained by repeated centrifugation at 400 × gfollowed by further purification over 30% Percoll. Hepatocytes with >95% viability by trypan blue exclusion were suspended in William's medium E supplemented with 1 μm insulin, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% low endotoxin calf serum. Cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes (5 ml/dish) and 12-well plates (1 ml/well) at a concentration of 1 × 106 and 2 × 105 cells/ml, respectively, and precultured in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) at 37 °C for 16 h. Cells were pretreated with SNAP for 8 h, washed three times with fresh medium, and cultured with complete William's medium E containing 5% calf serum for 24 h. Cells were then stimulated with cytokines consisting of 100 units/ml IL-1β (Cistron) and 100 units/ml IFNγ (Amgen). Hepatocytes were also transfected with AdiNOS or AdLacZ (10 multiplicity of infections) in serum-free medium for 3 h, washed with fresh medium, and incubated in fresh medium containing 5% serum. Northern and Western blot analyses were performed after stimulation for 10 and 14 h, respectively. NO production was measured after 24 h stimulation. The macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC), isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (22Shears 2nd, L.L. Kibbe M.R. Murdock A.D. Billiar T.R. Lizonova A. Kovesdi I. Watkins S.C. Tzeng E. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1998; 187: 295-306Google Scholar), were plated in 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and treated the same way as described above for hepatocytes, except that RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS and 100 units/ml IFNγ. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin). Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze and thaw, and cytosolic fractions were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Proteins (40 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with PBS-Tween (0.01%) (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were hybridized with antibodies for iNOS, GTPCHI, and GFRP in PBS-T containing 1% nonfat milk for 1 h. Membranes were washed three times with PBS-T and hybridized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. The membranes were then washed three times with PBS-T, incubated for 2 min with enhanced chemiluminescent solution (Pierce), and exposed to x-ray film (20Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from hepatocytes by the RNAzol method (20Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Google Scholar). The RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 1% formaldehyde, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and prehybridized with whale sperm DNA at 43 °C overnight. The probes for iNOS, GTPCHI, and 18 S ribosomal RNA were prepared as described previously (23Geller D.A. Di Silvio M. Billiar T.R. Hatakeyama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 633-641Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled probes (∼2 × 106 cpm/ml) of murine macrophage iNOS or rat GTPCHI, washed three times, and exposed to autoradiography film. To control for mRNA loading, the membranes were rehybridized with32P-labeled 18 S ribosomal RNA probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml) using the protocol described above. Nitrite plus nitrate in the culture medium was determined by an automated HPLC method with the use of a cadmium column after deproteinization (24Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Google Scholar). Nitrite alone was assayed by the addition of 100 μl of Griess reagent to 100 μl of culture supernatant in a 96-well plate. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a 96-well plate reader, and nitrite concentration was calculated from a standard curve of sodium nitrite. Total biopterin (biopterin + BH2 + BH4) was measured in hepatocyte lysates after acidic oxidation of reduced forms of biopterin with iodine reagents as previously described (25Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Google Scholar). In brief, hepatocytes were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed by three cycles of freeze and thaw. Following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were treated with the iodine solution (1% I2 containing 2% KI in 1 n HCl) for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were treated with 0.1 mascorbate to remove excess I2. Extracts were neutralized with 1 n NaOH followed by 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Biopterin was quantitated by C18 reverse high performance liquid chromatography using an online fluorescence detector. Cytosols (100 μl, 1 mg protein) were injected onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C and eluted with 40 mm BisTris (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 1 mm l-arginine, 4 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions (400 μl) were collected and 30-μl aliquots were assayed for iNOS activity. The fractions were dialyzed and concentrated to ∼50 μl in a vacuum centrifuge. iNOS protein was detected by Western blot and the protein band intensity was measured by densitometry. Hepatocytes were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS, and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.35 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were used for enzyme assays. GTPCHI activity was measured by the modified method of Duch et al. (26Duch D.S. Bowers S.W. Woolf J.H. Nichol C.A. Life Sci. 1984; 35: 1895-1901Google Scholar) and Geller et al. (23Geller D.A. Di Silvio M. Billiar T.R. Hatakeyama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 633-641Google Scholar) as follows. The enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme solution to the reaction mixture (500 μl), containing 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.3 m KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm GTP. The reaction mixture was incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h and then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of the iodine solution. After 1 h at room temperature, excess iodine was removed by the addition of 50 μl of 2% ascorbate. The mixture was supplemented with 50 μl of 1 n NaOH and then incubated with 3 units (100 μl) of alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 nacetic acid. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was applied to a Whatman Partisil 10 ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm) connected to a Cosmosil 10 C18 column (4.6 × 50 mm). Neopterin was eluted with a solvent of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 5% methanol at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The elute was monitored with a fluorimeter (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 440 nm). iNOS activity was determined as previously described (27Kim Y.M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 255-259Google Scholar). In brief, cytosols or column fractions (30 μl) were preincubated with 100 μm BH4 for 40 min at 37 °C prior to assay of NO synthesis activity in the presence of 1 mm NADPH, 20 μm FAD, 20 μm FMN, 4 mm l-arginine, and 5 mm glutathione, in a final volume of 200 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 7.7). The reaction was terminated at various times by addition of 400 μl of 0.5 mm NaOH and 400 μl of 10% ZnSO4. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, nitrite plus nitrate were measured in the supernatant. The data are presented as mean ± S.D. from more than three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using the Student's t test. To determine whether NO pretreatment regulates IL-1β and IFNγ-induced NO production in rat primary cultured hepatocytes, cells were treated with or without the NO donor SNAP (800 μm) for 8 h, recovered in fresh medium for 24 h, and stimulated with cytokines for 24 h. Hepatocyte viability remained >95% throughout the experiment. Hepatocytes treated with 800 μm SNAP for 8 h generated 25 ± 4 μm NOx/h in the culture medium (data not shown), which is similar to the levels of NO produced by cytokine-stimulated hepatocytes (24Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Google Scholar) and LPS-injected rats (28Geller D.A. de Vera M.E. Russell D.A. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4890-4898Google Scholar). Cytokine treatment induced a large rise in NO production in hepatocytes, and the NO production was further increased by SNAP pretreatment (Fig.1 A). Control or SNAP-pretreated cells without cytokine stimulation did not accumulate NOx in the culture medium. We also examined the effects of individual cytokines (IL-1β, IFNγ, or tumor necrosis factor-α), known to regulate iNOS expression (4Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Google Scholar), on NO production in hepatocytes with or without SNAP pretreatment (Fig. 1 B). When hepatocytes were stimulated with a single cytokine, NO production was detected in hepatocytes stimulated with IL-1β only, but not with any other single cytokine. As we have previously shown (28Geller D.A. de Vera M.E. Russell D.A. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4890-4898Google Scholar), mixtures containing both IL-1β and IFNγ were most effective in NO production. However, NO production was significantly higher in SNAP-pretreated hepatocytes than in control cells, for all of the cytokine treatment conditions (Fig.1 B). To investigate the effect of SNAP concentration on cytokine-induced NO production, hepatocytes were pretreated with various SNAP concentrations for 8 h prior to a 24-h recovery and stimulated with IL-1β and IFNγ. NO production was significantly increased in a manner that correlated with the concentration of SNAP and appeared to be maximally produced at 800 μm SNAP (Fig.2 A). We have reported previously that cytokines produce NO from human and rat hepatocytes through the transcriptional expression of the iNOS gene (4Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Google Scholar,20Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Google Scholar, 27Kim Y.M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 255-259Google Scholar). Whereas cytokine exposure revealed iNOS protein expression, SNAP pretreatment caused no further increase in iNOS protein levels measured by Western blot (Fig. 2 B). In addition, Northern blot analysis revealed that SNAP pretreatment did not affect the levels of iNOS mRNA expression above that seen with cytokines alone (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, hepatocytes transfected withiNOS using an adenoviral vector (AdiNOS) significantly increased NO production and this NO production was also increased by SNAP pretreatment (Fig. 2 D). SNAP pretreatment did not increase iNOS protein levels compared with those of AdiNOS alone (Fig.2 E). These results indicate that increases in NO production following SNAP pretreatment are not likely because of an increase in iNOS expression at the protein or mRNA levels. NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP from GTP, resulting in a variety of biological phenomena such as cellular signaling and protection against apoptosis (1Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar, 24Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Google Scholar). NO also interacts with oxygen molecules and various metal-containing biomolecules, which results in production of the stable end products nitrite and nitrate (29Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar). To investigate whether pretreatment with NO donors, oxidized NO products, or cGMP would increase cytokine-induced NO production, hepatocytes were pretreated with these molecules, recovered for 24 h, and stimulated with IL-1β and IFNγ. Twenty-four hours later, NOx production was measured in the culture medium (Fig.3). Pretreatment with SNAP (a general NO donor) and V-PyrroNO (a hepatocyte-specific NO donor that mimics endogenous NO sources) (30Saavedra J.E. Billiar T.R. Williams D.L. Kim Y.M. Watkins S.C. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1947-1954Google Scholar) significantly increased cytokine-induced NO production compared with that of control cells, whereas the control oxidized SNAP (not liberating NO) did not affect NO production. SNAP pretreatment in the presence of red blood cells, the scavenger of NO, inhibited the effect of SNAP on cytokine-induced NO production. The membrane-permeable cGMP analog 8-Br-cGMP, NO2− or NO3− did not increase cytokine-induced hepatocyte NO production compared with control cells. To examine whether SNAP pretreatment increases NO production in other cells known to expressiNOS, the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and RASMC were pretreated with SNAP, recovered in fresh medium for 24 h, and stimulated with LPS + IFNγ and IL-1β + IFNγ, respectively (Fig.4). In contrast to SNAP-pretreated hepatocytes, cytokine-induced NO production did not increase in either RAW264.7 macrophages or RASMC. To determine whether SNAP pretreatment increases iNOS activity within cells stimulated with cytokines, hepatocytes were stimulated with IL-1β and IFNγ for 12 h after a 24-h recovery period following SNAP pretreatment. Cells were washed and cultured in fresh medium containing 5% serum for 4 h. NO production was then measured in the culture medium (Fig.5 A). SNAP-pretreated hepatocytes significantly increased cytokine-induced NO production compared with control cells, whereas unstimulated hepatocytes following SNAP pretreatment did not produce NO (Fig. 5 A). To examine whether the effect of SNAP pretreatment on cytokine-induced NO production was because of increased iNOS activity, cytosolic fractions were prepared from hepatocytes of the same time point and the enzyme activity was measured in vitro. It has been shown that BH4 functions as an allosteric cofactor for in vitro and in vivo assembly of iNOS proteins into its active dimeric form (6Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 7Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Google Scholar). When measured in the absence of exogenous BH4, iNOS activity of the cytosol from SNAP-pretreated hepatocytes was significantly increased compared with that from cells without SNAP pretreatment (Fig. 5 B). When the cytosols were preincubated with 100 μm BH4 for 30 min, cytosolic iNOS activities were not different between control and SNAP-pretreated hepatocytes (Fig. 5 C). The same results were observed in iNOS gene-transfected hepatocytes (data not shown). The suppression of iNOS activity without preincubation of the cytosols with BH4 suggests that GTPCHI activity may be elevated by NO pretreatment because BH4 is known to act as an allosteric inhibitor of further BH4 production (31Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Google Scholar). To determine whether SNAP pretreatment increases intracellular BH4 levels, total cellular biopterin levels (BH4 and more oxidized states) were measured in the cytosolic fractions from hepatocytes pretreated with or without SNAP. SNAP pretreatment increased the total cellular biopterin level from a basal concentration of 18 to 28 nmol/mg of protein. These levels were further increased to 29 and 40 nmol/mg of protein following stimulation with IL-1β and IFNγ (Fig.6 A). Because GTPCHI is known to be a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo synthesis pathway of BH4 (8Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar, 10Burg A.W. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2349-2358Google Scholar), the effect of SNAP pretreatment on GTPCHI activity was measured. SNAP pretreatment increased GTPCHI activity from the control level of 17 to 33 nmol/mg of protein/h (Fig.6 B). These enzyme activities were further increased to 37 and 56 nmol/mg of protein/h by stimulation with cytokines. These results indicate that elevation of the intracellular BH4level in SNAP-pretreated hepatocytes is because of an increase in GTPCHI activity. To determine whether SNAP pretreatment increasesGTPCHI expression, GTPCHI mRNA and protein were detected by Northern and Western blot analyses. GTPCHI mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed and the levels were increased by cytokines. Neither the basal nor stimulated levels were altered by SNAP pretreatment (Fig. 7, A andB). Thus, the level of GTPCHI expression did not correlate with the cellular biopterin level and GTPCHI activity (Fig.6). GTPCHI activity can be post-translationally inhibited by BH4 in the presence of GFRP, and this inhibition is reversed by phenylalanine (31Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Google Scholar). We next measured the effect of exogenous BH4 and phenylalanine on GTPCHI activity in the cytosols from control and SNAP-pretreated hepatocytes. As shown in Fig.7 C, GTPCHI activity was significantly higher in SNAP-pretreated hepatocyte cytosols than control cytosols. When BH4 (100 μm) was added to the enzyme assay mixture, GTPCHI activity was markedly inhibited in the control cytosols, and this inhibition was much less in the SNAP-pretreated hepatocyte cytosols. The inhibitory effect of BH4 was reversed only in the controls by the addition of phenylalanine, but not tyrosine and tryptophan. These effects of BH4 and phenylalanine suggest that NO may suppress GFRP level in hepatocytes. To better characterize the nature of increased GTPCHI activity in the hepatocytes following SNAP pretreatment, cellular GFRP levels were assessed by Western blot. GFRP was constitutively expressed in control hepatocytes, and this level was suppressed by SNAP pretreatment (Fig.7 D). Cytokine stimulation did not alter the GFRP levels in hepatocytes with or without SNAP pretreatment. These results suggest that SNAP pretreatment increases GTPCHI activity through the suppression of GFRP level. It has been shown that subunit dimerization is required for iNOS to synthesize NO in vitro and in vivo (6Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 7Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Google Scholar). We next examined whether SNAP pretreatment increased dimerization in hepatocytes. Cytosols were prepared from hepatocytes stimulated with IL-1β and IFNγ following SNAP pretreatment, equal amounts of protein (1 mg) were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography, and the iNOS protein level and activity of each fraction were determined. Western blot analysis showed that there was more iNOS protein in the dimeric form after SNAP pretreatment compared with controls (Fig.8 A). Analyses of the protein intensity revealed an estimated dimeric iNOS to monomeric ratio of 2:1 in the control cytosols but the ratio was 3.5:1 in the cytosols from SNAP-pretreated cells (Fig. 8 B). SNAP pretreatment increased NO synthesis activity in the pooled fractions containing dimeric iNOS (fraction numbers 10–13), but not in the pooled iNOS monomeric fractions 15–17 (Fig. 8 C). These results suggest that SNAP pretreatment increases iNOS activity in hepatocytes by promoting subunit dimerization. It has been reported that cotreatment with the NO donor SNAP and cytokines (including LPS) suppresses iNOS expression and NO production in hepatocytes (18Taylor B.S. Kim Y.M. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Arch. Surg. 1997; 132: 1177-1183Google Scholar), macrophages (32Sheffler L.A. Wink D.A. Melillo G. Cox G.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 886-894Google Scholar, 33Kim Y.M. Son K. Hong S.J. Green A. Chen J.J. Tzeng E. Hierholzer C. Billiar T.R. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 179-190Google Scholar), and epithelial cells (34Cavicchi M. Gibbs L. Whittle B.J. Gut. 2000; 47: 771-778Google Scholar). However, in this study we have shown that SNAP pretreatment had the opposite effect in hepatocytes through a novel mechanism including BH4 synthesis. When hepatocytes were treated with SNAP and then stimulated with the cytokines IL-1β and IFNγ, or transfected with AdiNOS, NO production was significantly increased by enhancing iNOS activity without changing the levels of iNOS mRNA and protein. Only NO, but not cGMP, nitrite, or nitrate, pretreatment enhanced cytokine-induced NO production. This response appeared to be cell type-specific to hepatocytes and was not observed in smooth muscle cells or macrophages. Finally, the mechanism appeared to occur through the enhancement of BH4 levels by suppressing GFRP expression levels. These results demonstrate a novel regulatory effect of NO on GFRP expression and a potentially important mechanism for NO to amplify subsequent iNOS activity. It has been shown that NO production in both human and murine hepatocytes depends on the expression of iNOS in response to LPS and/or inflammatory cytokines (20Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Google Scholar, 27Kim Y.M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 255-259Google Scholar, 33Kim Y.M. Son K. Hong S.J. Green A. Chen J.J. Tzeng E. Hierholzer C. Billiar T.R. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 179-190Google Scholar). The expression ofiNOS can be regulated at the level of transcription, and NF-κB activation is essential for its expression (35Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar). In this study, NO production was higher in SNAP-pretreated cells, even though the levels of iNOS mRNA and protein (Fig. 2) as well as NF-κB activation (data not shown) were similar to those of non-pretreated control cells. The observation that SNAP pretreatment increased NO production in hepatocytes transfected with AdiNOS indicates that typical transcription pathways for iNOS expression are not the sites of action. The biologically active form of iNOS is a homodimer and requires NADPH, FAD, FMN, and BH4 as cofactors for maximal enzyme activityin vitro (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Google Scholar). BH4 functions as an allosteric cofactor for promoting assembly of the iNOS monomer into its active dimeric form in vitro and in cells (6Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 7Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Google Scholar). Inhibitors ofde novo synthesis of BH4 have been shown to inhibit LPS and IFNγ-induced NO production (11Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Google Scholar, 16Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Google Scholar), probably through the inhibition of iNOS subunit dimerization (7Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Google Scholar, 36Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Google Scholar). It has been also demonstrated that NIH3T3 cells, deficient in de novoBH4 biosynthesis, express mostly monomeric forms of iNOS and generate a minimal amount of NO following transfection with the human iNOS gene (7Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Google Scholar). However, NIH3T3 cells grown with supplemental BH4 generated NO by increasing the percentage of dimeric iNOS. LPS and cytokines stimulate the de novosynthesis of BH4 by increasing GTPCHI expression in various types of cells (11Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Google Scholar, 23Geller D.A. Di Silvio M. Billiar T.R. Hatakeyama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 633-641Google Scholar), and the increased BH4production supplies an essential cofactor to increase synthesis of NO by iNOS (17Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytokine treatment of endothelial cells enhances NO production by increasing cellular BH4 levels without changing eNOS expression (17Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular level of BH4 appears to be a rate-limiting factor for NOS activity. We showed that SNAP pretreatment increased total cellular biopterin concentrations (BH4 and more oxidized states) and promoted iNOS subunit dimerization. We also found that BH4 supplementation elevated NO synthesis activity in cytosols from hepatocytes stimulated with cytokine alone and that SNAP pretreatment reduced the cellular level of nonfunctional iNOS monomers by 50% (30 versus 14%). These results indicate that SNAP pretreatment increases cytokine-induced hepatocyte NO production by elevating the intracellular total biopterin levels and promoting iNOS subunit assembly into an active dimer. Intracellular BH4 levels are regulated by GTPCHI, which is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in de novo synthesis of BH4. We determined the levels of GTPCHI mRNA and protein in SNAP-pretreated hepatocytes by Northern and Western blotting analyses. SNAP pretreatment did not change the expression levels of GTPCHI. However, we found that SNAP increased GTPCHI activity. To explore further the mechanism by which SNAP pretreatment increases GTPCHI activity, we tested the possibility that SNAP pretreatment may regulate cellular GFRP level. It has been shown that GTPCHI interacts with GFRP in the presence of BH4 and GTP, resulting in the formation of an inhibitory protein complex, which suppresses de novo synthesis of BH4 (15Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Google Scholar, 31Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Google Scholar). This inhibition is reversed by phenylalanine (31Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Google Scholar). We examined the effects of exogenous BH4 and phenylalanine on GTPCHI activity in hepatocyte cytosols. Exogenous BH4 inhibited markedly GTPCHI activity in control cytosols, but only partially in SNAP-pretreated hepatocyte cytosols. We also found that phenylalanine overcame feedback inhibition of GTPCHI activity by BH4 in controls, but not by SNAP-pretreated hepatocyte cytosols. These results suggest that NO may suppress the cellular level or biological activity of GFRP. Indeed, Western blot analysis showed that SNAP pretreatment suppressed the GFRP level. This suppression may increase GTPCHI activity and subsequently intracellular total biopterin content, resulting in increased iNOS subunit assembly and NO synthesis activity. How NO regulates GFRP expression is unclear, but it is known that NO suppressed gene expression and protein synthesis in hepatocytes (37Billiar T.R. Curran R.D. Stuehr D.J. West M.A. Bentz B.G. Simmons R.L. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1467-1472Google Scholar) and other cell types (33Kim Y.M. Son K. Hong S.J. Green A. Chen J.J. Tzeng E. Hierholzer C. Billiar T.R. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 179-190Google Scholar). Further studies are required to define the molecular mechanism. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with the hepatocyte-specific NO donor V-PyrroNO also increased cytokine-induced NO production following a 24-h recovery. SNAP and V-PyrroNO produce NO in the culture media and within hepatocytes, respectively (24Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Google Scholar, 30Saavedra J.E. Billiar T.R. Williams D.L. Kim Y.M. Watkins S.C. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1947-1954Google Scholar). This indicates that NO-generating sites whether autocrine or paracrine can increase cytokine-induced NO production. Although NO is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate and activates guanylyl cyclase in hepatocytes to generate cGMP (38Billiar T.R. Curran R.D. Harbrecht B.G. Stadler J. Williams D.L. Ochoa J.B. Di Silvio M. Simmons R.L. Murray S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1077-C1082Google Scholar) (a key mediator of NO-dependent cellular signaling) pretreatment with 8-Br-cGMP, nitrite or nitrate did not increase cytokine-induced NO production. NO, but not NO2−, NO3−, or cGMP, induces nitrosative stress by interacting with cellular thiols and iron complexes (39Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10954-10961Google Scholar), which then can regulate enzyme activity (28Geller D.A. de Vera M.E. Russell D.A. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4890-4898Google Scholar, 40Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Google Scholar) and transcriptional gene expression (29Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar). The nitrosative stress occurs effectively in hepatocytes but not in macrophages and smooth muscle cells because of the relatively high iron content of hepatocytes (39Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10954-10961Google Scholar). This stress is probably associated with NO-mediated suppression of GFRPexpression, which leads to increases in cellular BH4level and subsequent elevation of NO production. Although under certain conditions, NO can induce hepatotoxicity, in general, NO is a protective molecule in cultured hepatocytes and liverin vivo (20Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Google Scholar, 24Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Google Scholar, 30Saavedra J.E. Billiar T.R. Williams D.L. Kim Y.M.

Seol D.W. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31437-31441Google Scholar). We have previously shown that NO production protects hepatocytes from tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptotic cell death by nitrosativeS-nitrosylation of caspase family proteases, which involve the apoptotic signaling cascade (24Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that SNAP pretreatment increased iNOS subunit dimerization and NO production in cultured hepatocytes by augmenting the cellular BH4 level through the suppression of GFRP levels and activation of GTPCHI. This suggests that the suppression of GFRP expression by NO is a mechanism to amplify NO production and protect hepatocytes from injury during acute inflammatory states."

RNA polymerase, a multi-subunit enzyme that is made up of five polypeptide chains (α2ββ′ω), is solely responsible for the synthesis of messenger, transfer, and ribosomal RNA in the bacterial cell. This enzyme has two distinct functional forms: core enzyme and holoenzyme. Although core enzyme is catalytically active and capable of transcription elongation, it is unable to initiate transcription at specific promoter sequences. Promoter recognition is accomplished by binding of the specificity factor ς, which positions holoenzyme on the promoter sequence (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K.

Through the use of seven ς factors, Escherichia coli is able to direct transcription from multiple sets of promoter sequences, which confers the ability to regulate gene expression (3Gross C.A.

The currently accepted pathway for open complex formation based on this promoter is shown below (15Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochem. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). R+P→RPc→RPi→RPoEquation EPathway_1 R is RNA polymerase holoenzyme, and P is the lacUV5 promoter. RPc is the closed complex where contacts with double-stranded promoter DNA are established. RPi is a kinetically significant intermediate on the pathway to the open complex (RPo), where melting of the promoter DNA and formation of the transcription bubble occurs. Although conformational changes are thought to accompany many if not all of these steps, the nature and importance of these changes at each sequential step have not been characterized. Identification of conformational changes accompanying formation of protein-DNA complexes necessitates alternative means of analysis, primarily because traditional methods such as NMR are not suitable for larger multi-subunit protein complexes such as RNA polymerase. Both circular dichroism and NMR require high protein concentrations (micromolar to millimolar) at which RNA polymerase has been shown to aggregate (17Harris S.J. Williams Jr., R.C. Lee J.C. Biochem. 1995; 34: 8752-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 18Shaner S.L. Piatt D.M. Wensley C.G. Yu H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T.

Methods previously utilized to address conformational changes in RNA polymerase holoenzyme, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and thermodynamic measurements (9Callaci S. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Mol Cell. 1999; 3: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), allowed the observation of gross conformational changes but were not able to examine specific regions of the proteins or changes during the sequential steps of transcription. Information from the recently available crystal structures of Thermus aquaticus RNA polymerase (19Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A.

Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) provided static snapshots of different conformational states of the enzyme; however, transcription is likely to be a continuous and dynamic process. Additionally, the flexibility of accessible mobile regions of a large multi-subunit enzyme may be extremely sensitive to crystal packing interactions or the solution environment, preventing small conformational changes from being seen. To address these issues, we have utilized a freely available disulfide bond recognition algorithm “Disulfide by Design” (22Dombkowski A.A. Crippen G.M. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to strategically place disulfide bonds within a protein, restricting the conformational flexibility of that region. If no functional consequence arises at a particular mechanistic step as a result of the inserted disulfide bond, one can argue that no conformational change is required in that region of the protein at that time. However, if function of the protein is inhibited, then it strongly argues that some conformational flexibility is essential during that step. Although the introduction of non-native disulfide bonds has been used in the past to examine conformational change and protein stability (23Storch E.M. Daggett V. Atkins W.M. Biochem. 1999; 38: 5054-5064Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Tiebel B. Aung-Hilbrich L.M. Schnappinger D. Hillen W.

Biochem. 1986; 25: 5992-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), success rates were often low because of the lack of an algorithm to accurately predict the location at which a disulfide bond was most likely to form. The Disulfide by Design algorithm correctly predicted the location of amino acid residues that form disulfide bonds with over 80% accuracy when tested against proteins of known structure (22Dombkowski A.A. Crippen G.M. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This algorithm was successfully used to engineer a disulfide bond within the coiled-coil domain of the β′ subunit of RNA polymerase to examine whether conformational change was required for ς70binding and binding of a nontemplate strand oligonucleotide by ς70 (27Anthony L.C. Dombkowski A.A. Burgess R.R. J Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2634-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To further our knowledge of the gross conformational changes in ς70 previously analyzed by luminescence resonance energy transfer and thermodynamic studies, we investigated whether the α-helices in region 2 of E. coli ς70 undergo conformational changes during transcription initiation. Using the Disulfide by Design algorithm, we have engineered two disulfide bonds within the essential region 2 of ς70 and assayed for the functional consequences of restricting conformational change during transcription initiation. Both mutant holoenzymes exhibit defects in open complex formation and in the stability of the open complex, suggesting that some conformational flexibility is necessary to facilitate transcription initiation. All of the reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Spectrophotometric grade glycerol was purchased from Fisher. Ni-NTA-agarose 1The abbreviations used for: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin. was purchased from Qiagen. E. coli LB culture medium contained 1.0% Bacto Tryptone, 0.5% Bacto Yeast Extract, and 0.5% NaCl. Ni-NTA buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% glycerol. TE buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 0.5 mmEDTA. Storage buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol. The amino acid sequence ofE. coli ς70 region 2 (amino acids 360–440) was analyzed using a disulfide recognition algorithm (22Dombkowski A.A. Crippen G.M. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) designed to recognize cysteine pairs that are properly oriented to favor disulfide bond formation. This algorithm is part of a Windows-based program called Disulfide by Design that is freely available by e-mailing the author of the program at [email protected]. This analysis revealed two potential amino acid pairs in region 2, Val387/Gly408 and Ala415/Trp434, that when substituted with cysteines have a strong potential for forming a disulfide bond (χ3 torsion angles of 91.6 and 96.7°, respectively). Plasmid characteristics are described in Table I. A cysteine-less variant of ς70 was made by the addition of C442S through site-directed mutagenesis using plasmid p[S442C]ς70 as template (28Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochem. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The region containing the substituted serines was subcloned by transferring the PstI-HindIII fragment into pHMK-His6-ς70 (29Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol.

Cysteine and serine substitutions at positions Val387, Gly408, Ala415, and Trp434 of ς70 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pLA55 using standard QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene).

The cells were grown to anA 600 nm of 0.4–0.6 in 2-liter flasks at 30 °C in LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was used for induction at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were harvested 3 h after induction by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min and frozen at −80 °C until use. All of the RNA polymerase holoenzymes were purified by the protocol below. The cell pellets were lysed in Ni-NTA buffer, sonicated for two 1-min intervals, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellets contained mostly ς70 inclusion bodies, which were discarded. The supernatants were diluted to 35 ml with Ni-NTA buffer and incubated with 3 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatant-agarose suspensions were poured into 15-ml Econo-pak columns (Bio-Rad) and washed extensively with 20 column volumes of Ni-NTA buffer. Low salt conditions (50 mm NaCl) were used to avoid possible dissociation of the holoenzyme subunits. RNA polymerase holoenzymes were eluted with ten 1-ml fractions of Ni-NTA buffer with 300 mm imidazole. Because the holoenzyme preparations were still heavily contaminated with cell protein, immunoaffinity chromatography was used to further purify the preparation. The pooled Ni-NTA fractions were diluted 3-fold with TE buffer and loaded onto 0.5-ml immunoaffinity columns containing the polyol-responsive anti-β′ monoclonal antibody NT73 (30Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The columns were washed with 10 column volumes of TE buffer with 0.15m NaCl, and eluted with 5 ml of TE buffer containing 0.75m NaCl with 30% propylene glycol. Fractions containing holoenzyme were pooled, concentrated in 4 ml of 100-kDa cut-off Ultrafree-4 concentrations (Millipore), and dialyzed into storage buffer. Final holoenzyme concentrations in storage buffer were in the range of 100–200 μg/ml and assume 100% active protein. Stoichiometry of the purified holoenzymes was determined by densitometry comparing the ratios of ς and α subunits using the software package Un-Scan-It Gel (Silk Scientific). Each holoenzyme contained a ratio of 1 ς subunit to 2 α subunits (< 10% deviation), indicating that all purified holoenzymes are in proper stoichiometry. To verify disulfide bond formation within the ς subunit of the purified holoenzymes, each holoenzyme was labeled with the fluorescent dye IC5-PE-malemide (Dojindo). Each holoenzyme (0.7 μg) was added to buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5.0 m urea, and 10 pmol of IC5-malemide. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and subjected to electrophoresis along with unlabeled control samples on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel with MES buffer. The gel was then visualized on a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon system (Cy5 filter) and later stained with Gel-Code Blue reagent (Pierce). DNA concentrations in all of the experiments were determined by absorbance at 260 nm where 1A 260 nm = 50 μg/ml of double-stranded DNA. Supercoiled pRLG593 template (31Ross W. Aiyar S.E. Salomon J. Gourse R.L. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5375-5383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the multiple-round transcription experiments was purified by Midi-prep (Promega), followed by two phenol/chloroform extractions, and finally an ethanol precipitation. Linear templates (from lacUV5 −60 to +39) used for the closed complex gel shifts, DNase I footprinting, and filter binding experiments were prepared by digestion of pRLG593 DNA withHindIII, labeling of the nontemplate strand with Sequenase (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), followed by digestion with AatII. The fragments were isolated on 5% native polyacrylamide gels and purified with Elutip-D columns (Schleicher & Schuell). Multiple-round transcription was started by the addition of 12 nm of each holoenzyme to 30 nm supercoiled pRLG593 template. Transcription assays were performed at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 65 μg/ml BSA, 170 μm CTP, 170 μm ATP, 170 μm GTP, 17 μm UTP, and 3 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transcription was stopped by the addition of formamide loading buffer 20 min after reactions were initiated, and the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. The dried gels were visualized and quantified on a Typhoon imaging system (Molecular Dynamics). To test for defects in closed complex formation, 12.5 nm of each holoenzyme was added to 2 nm32P end-labeled linearlacUV5 template (−60 to +39) in buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 μg/μl BSA. All of the reactions were prechilled and assembled on ice. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the samples were loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel (prechilled to 0–2 °C) for electrophoresis at 250 V for 1.5 h at 2 °C. The gels were then dried and visualized by phosphorus imaging. Holoenzyme (1–25 nm) was added to 1 nm32P end-labeled linearlacUV5 template (−60 to +39) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 65 μg/ml of BSA. The samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and treated with heparin (10 μg/ml) for 30 s, followed by digestion with DNase I at 8 μg/ml for 30 s. The samples were electrophoresed on 9% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels, dried, and visualized by phosphorus imaging. The fraction of RNA polymerase molecules able to form open complexes was measured by filter binding assays. The various holoenzymes (20 nm) were incubated with 2 nm32P end-labeled linear lacUV5 template (−60 to +39) for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 μg/μl BSA. The samples were removed after challenge with 50 μg/ml heparin for 30 s, vacuum filtered onto nitrocellulose filters (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell), and washed with 1 ml of buffer. The 32P-labeled DNA retained on the filters was measured by Cerenkov counting and corrected for background DNA retained in the absence of holoenzyme (<3% of input). The results were normalized to the cysteine-less ς70holoenzyme, which is represented as having 100% activity. To examine the stability of open complexes on a supercoiled template, 8 nm of the various holoenzymes were incubated with 3 nm supercoiled pRLG593 in buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mmMgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 0.1 μg/μl BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Heparin (final concentration, 50 μg/ml) was added at time 0, and the aliquots (10 μl) were removed at various time points after heparin addition and placed into tubes containing 2.5 μl of NTP mix (final concentrations: 250 μm ATP, 100 μm CTP, 100 μm GTP, 10 μmUTP, 13 μCi of [α-32P]UTP). The transcription reactions were stopped with formamide loading buffer after 10 min and analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. Open complex stability assays on linearized templates were performed as described above except for the use of 3 nm PCR-generated pRLG593 linear template (−60 to +39) instead of supercoiled DNA. Quantitation with background correction was performed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Fractions of open complexes remaining at the different time points after heparin addition were plotted using Origin 5.0 software (MicroCal). RNA polymerase core enzyme and ς70 are known to undergo several conformational changes throughout the process of transcription initiation (3Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombrowski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J.

Biol. 1998; 283: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); however, the large size of these multisubunit protein-DNA complexes precludes traditional ways of probing for conformational changes, such as NMR analysis. In this work, we used a previously successful disulfide recognition algorithm (22Dombkowski A.A. Crippen G.M. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,27Anthony L.C. Dombkowski A.A. Burgess R.R. J Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2634-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to probe for possible conformational changes in ς70region 2 during the steps of transcription initiation. This algorithm threads a given amino acid sequence onto the Cαβ backbone of a known crystal structure and ranks each pair of amino acid residues for the likelihood of disulfide bond formation. Two pairs of residues within ς70 region 2, Val387/Gly408 (2.1C-2.2C) and Ala415/Trp434 (2.2C-2.3C), were shown to have strong potential for disulfide bond formation when substituted with cysteines (estimated χ3 angles of 91.6 and 96.7°, respectively, where 90° is optimal). The positions of these residues within the x-ray crystal structure of the protease-resistant domain ofE. coli ς70 (32Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) are presented in Fig.1. An example of modeling the Cys387–Cys408 disulfide bond within ς70 region 2 shows the orientation of the cysteine side chains and the 92° χ3 torsion angle (Fig.1 B). Secondary structure predictions (PHD, Swiss model) indicated that substitution of all four residues with cysteine was unlikely to perturb the α-helical structure of this region. All of the cysteine substitutions were introduced via site-directed mutagenesis into pLA55, a pET-derived vector containing a His6-tagged cysteine-less variant of ς70. Overexpression of both disulfide-containing ς70 variants yielded both large inclusion bodies, which were unable to be refolded into active monomeric protein and a small amount of soluble ς70 in the cell supernatants. The majority of the soluble ς70 was present as RNA polymerase holoenzyme (data not shown). Because of the difficulty in refolding these ς factors, holoenzyme instead was isolated using two chromatographic steps. First, holoenzyme in the cell supernatants was purified by native Ni-NTA chromatography, which resulted in eluates containing free disulfide-containing ς70 and disulfide-containing ς70 holoenzyme (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 3). It is important to note that any wild type ς70 present in the cell was removed during this step, because wild type ς70 did not have a His6-tag. The lack of wild type ς70 in the isolated holoenzyme preparations was also confirmed by fluorescent labeling, as discussed below. The Ni-NTA eluates had a significant amount of protein contamination, primarily because the column was run at relatively low salt to ensure that the mutant holoenzymes did not dissociate into core enzyme and ς70. To further purify holoenzyme, the Ni-NTA eluates were passed over an immunoaffinity column containing a monoclonal antibody to the C terminus of the β′ subunit of RNA polymerase (30Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because this step is highly specific, the eluates contained pure disulfide-containing ς70 RNA polymerase holoenzyme free of contaminants, with the disulfide-containing ς70 in proper stoichiometry with the core subunits (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4) as determined by densitometry. Once purified holoenzyme was obtained, a method was needed to verify that disulfide bond formation occurred within the mutant ς70 subunit of the holoenzymes. NMR and mass spectrometry, although extremely useful, were not practical because of the large size of the multisubunit holoenzyme complex. Instead, labeling with the fluorescent dye IC5-PE-maleimide was utilized to visualize free cysteines present in the denatured holoenzyme preparations. This method is advantageous because the IC5-maleimide dye is highly fluorescent, so labeled complexes can be subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized with the use of a Typhoon imaging instrument. Wild type ς70 holoenzyme that contains three cysteines in ς70 was used as a positive control for labeling. To verify that the engineered cysteines were accessible to the IC5-maleimide dye, a single-cysteine ς70 holoenzyme (2.1S-2.2C) was also used as a control. Note that in all holoenzyme preparations, the β′, β, and α subunits of RNA polymerase contain multiple cysteines that label with IC5-maleimide (Fig.3 A). In wild type holoenzyme, the three naturally occurring cysteines in ς70 were labeled with the fluorescent dye (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). The single cysteine in the ς70 (2.1S-2.2C) subunit of holoenzyme is readily detectable (Fig. 3 A,lane 5), demonstrating both the sensitivity of this assay and that the engineered cysteine residues are dye-accessible. In addition, no fluorescence was observed from the negative control, a ς70 subunit of holoenzyme where the naturally occurring cysteines are replaced with serine (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). This confirmed that the labeling procedure was specific for free cysteines and did not nonspecifically label other amino acid residues. No detectable fluorescence was observed for the ς70 (2.1C-2.2C) or ς70 (2.2C-2.3C) subunits of holoenzyme, which contain cysteine substitutions in optimal positions for disulfide bond formation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). Because these cysteines were not labeled with IC5-maleimide, this strongly suggests that these cysteines are not accessible and form a disulfide bond with near 100% efficiency. This also indicates that the mutant holoenzyme preparations are not contaminated with wild type ς70, because no free cystei"

By substitution of Ala-241 in the 240s loop of the catalytic chain with cysteine, a disulfide bond was formed between two catalytic chains of different subunits.

The enzyme demonstrates homotropic cooperativity for the substratel-aspartate and is heterotropically regulated by effectors ATP, CTP (1Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Google Scholar), and UTP in the presence of CTP (2Wild J.R. Loughrey-Chen S.J. Corder T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 46-50Google Scholar). Aspartate transcarbamoylase from E. coli is a dodecamer composed of six catalytic chains organized as two trimeric subunits and six regulatory chains organized as three dimeric subunits. Because aspartate transcarbamoylase is so well characterized and serves as a model for allosteric enzymes it is of particular interest to thoroughly understand the molecular mechanism of allostery of this enzyme. Two different structural and functional states of aspartate transcarbamoylase have been characterized (3Gerhart J.C. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 538-552Google Scholar, 4Howlett G.J. Blackburn M.N. Compton J.G. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5091-5099Google Scholar, 5Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Science. 1988; 241: 669-674Google Scholar, 6Schachman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18583-18586Google Scholar). The low activity, low affinity conformation of the enzyme is called the T state, and the high activity, high affinity conformation of the enzyme is called the R state. The conversion from the T to the R state occurs upon aspartate binding to the holoenzyme in the presence of carbamoyl phosphate, which is the source of the observed homotropic cooperativity. The most common method used to characterize the two functional states of aspartate transcarbamoylase has been kinetic studies. The use of site-directed mutagenesis has allowed the indirect kinetic characterization of the functional states. The substitution of key amino acids involved in hydrogen bonds stabilizing either the T or R state (7Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Google Scholar, 8Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Google Scholar, 9Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1444-1451Google Scholar, 10Tauc P. Keiser R.T. Kantrowitz E.R. Vachette P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1998-2004Google Scholar) has created T or R state destabilized enzymes. However, the only studies undertaken to characterize each quaternary structural state by locking the enzyme in a particular state used a bifunctional reagent that was reactive toward amines, resulting in nonspecific cross-linking (11Enns C.A. Chan W.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2511-2513Google Scholar, 12Enns C.A. Chan W.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6180-6186Google Scholar, 13Chan W.W. Enns C.A. Can. J. Biochem. 1981; 59: 461-468Google Scholar). Here we introduce a cysteine into the catalytic chain of aspartate transcarbamoylase at a site that in the R allosteric state can form a disulfide bond between two 240s loops in the final closed position and lock the enzyme in this state (see Fig. 1). The 240s loop has previously been shown to require saturation by substrate in order to complete its movement into the final closed position (14Fetler L. Vachette P. Hervé G. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15654-15660Google Scholar). Under oxidizing conditions the enzyme would be locked into the R state allowing us to study a mutant version of the enzyme that was otherwise completely wild type in composition. Under reducing conditions the enzyme would no longer be locked in the R state and would function much the same as the wild-type enzyme. Hence, this study gives insight into the relative importance that the switch between quaternary structural states and hindrance of movement of the 240s loop has on the homotropic and heterotropic regulation of this enzyme.

PALA was obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Sodium dodecyl sulfate and the protein assay dye were purchased from Bio-Rad. Carbamoyl phosphate dilithium salt obtained from Sigma was purified before use by precipitation from 50% (v/v) ethanol and was stored desiccated at −20 °C (1Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Google Scholar). The Qiagen gel extraction kit was used for isolation of DNA from agarose gels, and the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) miniplasmid prep kit was used for purification of plasmid DNA. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). The C47A and A241C mutants of E. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase were constructed by introducing specific base changes in the pyrB gene using the Kunkel method (16Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). The uracil-containing single-stranded DNA required was obtained by infection of E. coli strain CJ236, containing the phagemid pEK54 (17Xu W. Pitts M.A. Middleton S.A. Kelleher S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5507-5515Google Scholar) for the C47A mutation and the phagemid pEK152 (18Baker D.P. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10150-10158Google Scholar) for the A241C mutation, with the helper phage M13K07 (19Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Google Scholar). Selection of the mutations was performed by sequencing with single-stranded DNA isolated from phagemid candidates after coinfection with the helper phage M13K07 (19Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Google Scholar). After the mutations were verified the resulting plasmids with the C47A and A241C mutations, pEK184 and pEK612, respectively, were digested with the restriction enzymes BstEII andEcoRI. The large fragment of the pEK184 plasmid and small fragment of the pEK612 plasmid were removed from an agarose gel, combined, and treated with DNA ligase for 1 h at 16 °C. The resulting plasmid, pEK613, was sequenced directly by double-strand dideoxy sequencing to verify the mutations. The C47A/A241C 2Within the E. coli holoenzyme, the catalytic chains of the top catalytic trimer are numbered C1, C2, and C3, whereas the catalytic chains of the bottom catalytic trimer are numbered C4, C5, and C6, with C4 under C1. The regulatory dimers contain chains R1–R6, R2–R5, and R3–R4. A regulatory chain is in direct contact with the same numbered catalytic chain.catalytic subunit was constructed by first digesting pEK184 with the restriction enzymes BstEII and BamH1 and digesting pEK612 with the restriction enzymes BstEII andBglII. The large fragment of the pEK184 plasmid and small fragment of the pEK612 plasmid were removed from an agarose gel, combined, and treated with DNA ligase for 1 h at 16 °C. The resulting plasmid, pEK614 was sequenced directly by double-strand dideoxy sequencing to verify the mutations. The mutant holoenzyme and catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity as described previously (15Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Google Scholar). After concentration, the purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), non-reducing SDS-PAGE (in which mercaptoethanol is omitted from the sample buffer), and nondenaturing PAGE (21Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 680-685Google Scholar, 22Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Google Scholar). The concentrations of the wild-type holoenzyme and catalytic subunit were determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 0.59 and 0.72 cm2 mg−1, respectively (23Gerhart J.C. Holoubek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2886-2892Google Scholar). The concentrations of the mutants' enzymes were determined by the Bio-Rad version of the Bradford dye binding assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was measured at 25 °C by the colorimetric method (25Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Google Scholar) or by the radioactive method for assays containing DTT at a concentration of 10 mm, as DTT at this concentration interferes with the development of color in the colorimetric method (26Perbal B. Herve G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 70: 511-529Google Scholar). Aspartate saturation curves were performed in duplicate. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, or in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 10 mm DTT (for reducing conditions) and in the presence of saturating carbamoyl phosphate (4.8 mm). Data analysis of the steady-state kinetics was carried out as described previously (27Silver R.S. Daigneault J.P. Teague P.D. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 729-745Google Scholar). Fitting of the experimental data to theoretical equations was accomplished by non-linear regression. The data were analyzed using an extension of the Hill equation that included a term for substrate inhibition. If the fit to the Hill equation gave a Hill coefficient of 1 or less, the experimental data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation with an additional term for substrate inhibition (28Pastra-Landis S.C. Evans D.R. Lipscomb W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4624-4630Google Scholar). The nucleotide saturation curves were fit to a hyperbolic binding isotherm by non-linear regression. The small-angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed at beam line 4–2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (3.0 GeV, 50–100 mA). The experimental setup and procedures were performed as described by Sakashet al. (29Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of the T and R states of aspartate transcarbamoylase (Protein Data Bank codes 6AT1 and 1D09, respectively) (30Stevens R.C. Gouaux J.E. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7691-7701Google Scholar, 31Jin L. Stec B. Lipscomb W.N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 37: 729-742Google Scholar) was performed with QUANTA. This modeling revealed that the distance between identical residues in the 240s loop in the C1 and C4 chains is much closer in the R state than in the T state. Therefore, the 240s loop was chosen as the location to insert a cysteine for putative disulfide bond formation in the R state. Of the residues available for mutation, Asp-236 and Glu-239 were eliminated because previously studies (32Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2309-2313Google Scholar, 33Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 995: 54-58Google Scholar) showed that these positions were important for the normal (wild-type) function of the enzyme. Based upon the location, the similar sizes of alanine and cysteine, and the lack of any known function, Ala-241 was chosen as the best candidate for substitution with cysteine. Molecular modeling in QUANTA of the R state showed that the distance between sulfur atoms in the two Cys-241 residues of C1 and C4 is less than 3 Å (represented with a disulfide bond in Fig. 1). To ensure specific disulfide bond formation, the one naturally occurring Cys in the catalytic chain, Cys-47, was replaced by Ala in the final construct (C47A/A241C). The C47A/A241C holoenzyme and C47A/A241C catalytic subunit were evaluated by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig.2). Lane 2 of Fig. 2,A and B, shows two bands corresponding to the catalytic and regulatory chains of wild-type aspartate transcarbamoylase migrating at 34 and 17 kDa, respectively. However,lane 4 (C47A/A241C holoenzyme) of the non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A) has a band at 17 kDa, a faint band at 34 kDa, and a band migrating at ∼65–70 kDa. In contrast, in lane 4(C47A/A241C holoenzyme) of the reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) there are two bands at 34 and 17 kDa and no band visible in the 65–70 kDa range. Lane 3 (C47A/A241C catalytic trimer) in Fig. 2, A and B, shows just a single band corresponding to the catalytic chain of aspartate transcarbamoylase migrating at 34 kDa. Based upon the difference in the migration of the catalytic chain for the C47A/A241C holoenzyme under non-reducing and reducing conditions, we believed that a disulfide bond was forming between two catalytic chains. The identical migration of the catalytic chain for the C47A/A241C catalytic subunit under non-reducing and reducing conditions demonstrated that the disulfide bond formation was between catalytic chains on opposing catalytic subunits and not between catalytic chains on the same catalytic subunit. The kinetic parameters calculated from the aspartate saturation curves (Fig. 3) are shown in Table I. Most significantly, under non-reducing conditions the C47A/A241C holoenzyme displayed a hyperbolic aspartate saturation curve. No activation of this enzyme by PALA at low concentrations of aspartate verified that the C47A/A241C holoenzyme, under non-reducing conditions, was not cooperative toward aspartate (data not shown). Under these non-reducing conditions the C47A/A241C holoenzyme has a maximal observed specific activity of 25.6 mmol·h−1·mg−1 and a K mof 2.3 mm compared with the wild-type holoenzyme parameters of 17.5 mmol·h−1·mg−1, an [Asp]0.5 of 13.0 mm, and Hill coefficient of 2.4.Table IKinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant forms of aspartate transcarbamoylaseEnzymeV max[Asp]0.5n Hmmol·h−1·mg−1mmWild-type17.5 ± 0.513.0 ± 0.92.4 ± 0.2C47A17.0 ± 0.513.5 ± 1.11.3 ± 0.1A241C23.5 ± 1.13.1 ± 0.11aExperimental data exhibited no cooperativity.

The values reported are the average deviation of three determinations. The kinetic parameters of the C47A/A241C catalytic subunit were very similar to those of the wild-type catalytic subunit. The C47A/A241C catalytic subunit has a specific activity of 28.1 mmol·h−1·mg−1 and a K mof 6.6 mm compared with the wild-type catalytic subunit parameters of 27.0 mmol·h−1·mg−1 and 7.5 mm. Under reducing conditions the kinetic parameters of the C47A/A241C holoenzyme changed dramatically. Under these reducing conditions the C47A/A241C holoenzyme has a sigmoidal aspartate saturation curve with a Hill coefficient of 1.3, specific activity of 25.4 mmol·h−1·mg−1, and an [Asp]0.5 of 10.8 mm. Additional evidence that cooperativity was restored is demonstrated by the PALA saturation curves, which show activation by PALA although the activation is only approximately one-half as much as that observed for the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). Nucleotide saturation curves with CTP and ATP were determined for the wild-type and C47A/A241C holoenzymes at one-half the [Asp]0.5. The kinetic parameters calculated from the nucleotide saturation curves (Fig. 4) are shown in TableII. This concentration of aspartate was selected because the nucleotides exert a larger influence on the activity of the enzyme as the aspartate concentration is reduced (34Tauc P. Leconte C. Kerbiriou D. Thiry L. Hervé G. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 155-168Google Scholar). Under non-reducing conditions neither nucleotide caused any significant alteration in activity of the C47A/A241C holoenzyme.Table IIATP activation and CTP inhibition of the wild-type and modified forms of aspartate transcarbamoylaseATCaseATPaPercent activation is defined as 100 × (A ATP), whereA ATP is the activity in the presence of ATP andA is the activity in the absence of ATP.KATPbK is the nucleotide concentration required to activate or inhibit the enzyme by 50% of the maximal effect.CTPcPercent residual activity is defined as 100 × (A CTP) whereA CTP is the activity in the presence of CTP andA is the activity in the absence of CTP.KCTPbK is the nucleotide concentration required to activate or inhibit the enzyme by 50% of the maximal effect.%%Wild-type4600.68230.068C47A/A241C105—dCould not be determined because of small amount of inhibition or activation.92—dCould not be determined because of small amount of inhibition or activation.C47A/A241C (reducing conditions)2200.60650.069These data were determined from ATP and CTP saturation curves (Fig. 4).

ATP and CTP saturation curves were determined at saturating levels of carbamoyl phosphate (4.8 mm) and aspartate concentrations at one-half the [Asp]0.5 of the respective holoenzyme at pH 8.3. The values reported are the average deviation of three determinations. Nucleotide saturation curves of the C47A/A241C holoenzyme were also performed under reducing conditions by the addition of 10 mm DTT. Under reducing conditions for the C47A/A241C holoenzyme the normal effect of the nucleotides on the activity of the enzyme was restored. The C47A/A241C holoenzyme under reducing conditions is activated by ATP approximately one-half as much as the wild-type holoenzyme and inhibited by CTP approximately one-half as much as the wild-type holoenzyme. Small-angle x-ray scattering was used to evaluate the quaternary structures of the wild-type and C47A/A241C holoenzymes in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of PALA (Fig.5). The data for the wild-type holoenzyme shown in Fig. 5 A display the characteristic change in the scattering pattern upon addition of PALA as noted by the change in the peak position and increase in relative intensity (35Moody M.F. Vachette P. Foote A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 133: 517-532Google Scholar). The scattering pattern in Fig. 5 B of the unliganded C47A/A241C holoenzyme displays a peak position and relative intensity that is nearly identical to the PALA-liganded wild-type holoenzyme scattering pattern. Addition of PALA to the C47A/A241C holoenzyme, also shown in Fig.5 B, caused little change to the scattering pattern. Addition of 10 mm DTT to the unliganded C47A/A241C holoenzyme, shown in Fig. 5 C, caused a large change in the scattering pattern so that the peak position and relative intensity was very similar to the unliganded wild-type holoenzyme. Addition of PALA to the C47A/A241C holoenzyme containing 10 mm DTT caused a nearly identical change to the scattering pattern that was observed in the addition of PALA to the wild-type holoenzyme. We believe that the 65–70-kDa band observed only on the non-reducing SDS-PAGE was a C2 catalytic chain dimer formed from two catalytic chains of aspartate transcarbamoylase linked together by a disulfide bond between Cys-241 of C1 and Cys-241 of C4. The disulfide bond between Cys-241 and Cys-241 links opposing catalytic chains at the C1:C4 interface and locks the enzyme in an R structural state. This is supported by our modeling of the T and R states of the C47A/A241C holoenzyme, where the distance between sulfur atoms in the two Cys-241 residues of C1 and C4 is less than 3 Å in the R state and more than 20 Å in the T state (30Stevens R.C. Gouaux J.E. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7691-7701Google Scholar, 36Krause K.L. Voltz K.W. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 527-553Google Scholar). In addition the small-angle x-ray scattering pattern under non-reducing conditions and with no ligands present was indicative of an R structural state."

An initial report provided data supporting the idea that PN1 target protease specificity is under the influence of collagen type IV (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). Although collagen type IV demonstrated no effect on the association rate between PN1 and thrombin, the study reported that the association rate between PN1 and urokinase was allosterically reduced 10-fold. This has led to the generally accepted idea that the primary role of PN1 in the brain is to act as a rapid thrombin inhibition and clearance mechanism during trauma and loss of vascular integrity. In studies to identify the structural determinants of PN1 that mediate the allosteric interaction with collagen type IV, we found that protease specificity was only affected after transient exposure of PN1 to acidic conditions that mimic the elution protocol from a monoclonal antibody column. Because PN1 used in previous studies was purified over a monoclonal antibody column, we propose that the allosteric regulation of PN1 target protease specificity by collagen type IV is a result of the purification protocol. We provide both biochemical and kinetic data to support this conclusion. This finding is significant because it implies that PN1 may play a much larger role in the modeling and remodeling of brain tissues during development and is not simply an extravasated thrombin clearance mechanism as previously suggested.

Although most SERPINs are found in the plasma, PN1 is found primarily in tissues and has been shown to be associated with the extracellular matrix (10Farrell D.H. Wagner S.L. Yuan R.H. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell Phys. 1988; 134: 179-188Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that thrombin is able to induce apoptosis in astrocytes (11Verdière-Sahuquè M. Akkaboune M. Lachkar S. Festoff B.W. Jandrot-Perrus M. Garcia L. Barlovatz-Meimon G. Hantai D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 70-76Google Scholar, 12Donovan F.M. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12746-12752Google Scholar, 13Cunningham D.D. Donovan F.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 67-75Google Scholar), and thus the localization of PN1 in the tissues surrounding the vasculature of the brain has led to a hypothesis that one of the primary physiological functions of PN1 is to act as a protective mechanism against thrombin that has escaped the vascular compartment during cerebrovascular trauma. This hypothesis has been supported by reports demonstrating that PN1 bound to collagen type IV is refractory to urokinase inhibition, thus leaving PN1 free to react with thrombin in the tissues. In the present report we show that this is due to the exposure of PN1 to acid during the purification protocol and that the protease inhibitory specificity of native PN1 is not altered by collagen type IV binding. Like many other SERPINs, the rate of PN1 inhibition is under the influence of allosteric effectors. Cell surface proteoglycans are allosteric effectors for many SERPINs, including heparin cofactor II, antithrombin III, and PN1 (2Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Google Scholar, 14Rosenberg R.D. Semin. Hematol. 1977; 14: 427-439Google Scholar, 15Tollefsen D.M. Majerus P.W. Blank M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2162-2169Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the presence of heparin, PN1 increases its inhibitory activity toward thrombin by a factor of 1000, making PN1 a more efficient inhibitor of thrombin than even antithrombin III (2Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Google Scholar). Along with the proteoglycan-mediated acceleration there is also evidence of protein-protein interactions modifying the rate of SERPIN inhibitory action. A well characterized example of this is plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, a SERPIN with inhibitory activity toward plasminogen activators. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 becomes an effective inhibitor of thrombin only in the presence of the plasma borne cell adhesion protein vitronectin, increasing its rate of thrombin inhibition by a factor of 200 (16Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Google Scholar). Collagen type IV helps form the core of basement membranes, the sheet-like extracellular structure that surrounds tissues and organs (17Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Google Scholar), and has been reported to be an allosteric effector of PN1 (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar, 19Wagner S.L. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 611-615Google Scholar). Whereas other forms of collagen are formed through interactions of their noncollagenous ends that result in long fibers with high tensile strength, collagen type IV forms a meshed, nonfibrillar network with interactions not only at the ends but also within the long collagenous triple helical region (17Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Google Scholar, 18Kuhn K. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 439-445Google Scholar). PN1 has been shown to colocalize with a component of the basement membrane, fibronectin (10Farrell D.H. Wagner S.L. Yuan R.H. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell Phys. 1988; 134: 179-188Google Scholar). Further, PN1 secreted from cultured fibroblasts has been shown to copurify with a 120-kDa band that has been identified as collagen type IV (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). Studies on PN1 binding to fibroblast-secreted extracellular matrix led to the discovery that PN1 has altered inhibitory activity toward target proteases when bound to the extracellular matrix (19Wagner S.L. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 611-615Google Scholar). It was later determined that collagen type IV was the component of the extracellular matrix that was causing this target protease specificity change in PN1. In the absence of collagen type IV, PN1 was able to form inhibitory complexes with thrombin, urokinase, and plasmin; however, when collagen type IV was added at a concentration of 1 μm, PN1 was no longer able to form complexes at the same rate with urokinase and plasmin (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar, 19Wagner S.L. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 611-615Google Scholar). The original purpose of this study was to identify the specific structural determinants in PN1 that mediate the alteration of its target protease specificity when in complex with collagen type IV. However, we had no success reproducing the alteration of PN1 target protease specificity through interaction with collagen type IV. What we found was that the collagen type IV allosteric regulation of PN1 target protease specificity was the result of exposing the SERPIN to acidic conditions that were required for the purification of PN1 from a monoclonal antibody column. Because all of the studies to date on the regulation of PN1 target protease specificity with collagen type IV have used PN1 that was purified on a monoclonal antibody column, we propose that the observed allosteric effect is the result of acid exposure of PN1 during the monoclonal antibody column purification protocol and thus may not be physiologically relevant. In all of our previous studies we have used a heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography protocol to purify PN1. We show here that there is no regulation of PN1 target protease specificity by collagen type IV and provide strong evidence that the allosteric effect of collagen type IV is the result of exposure to nonphysiological conditions required for the elution of PN1 from a monoclonal antibody column. Thus, PN1 is still a potent urokinase inhibitor in the basement membrane when bound to collagen type IV. These data are very important because they re-open the possibility that PN1 may play a key regulatory role in the urokinase receptor-mediated activation of signaling pathways that control cell migration during tissue repair/remodeling. The cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Irvine Scientific and JRH Scientific. The cell culture plastics were from Corning. Thrombin (3,000 NIH units/mg) high molecular mass urokinase (80,000 IU/mg), and plasmin (27 units/mg protein) were purchased from Calbiochem. Collagen type IV was purchased from Calbiochem and from Sigma (the Calbiochem samples were used in all of the experiments shown here). High trap heparin-Sepharose columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Enzymes used for molecular biology were from Fisher/Promega or Invitrogen. All of the other common laboratory supplies were purchased from either Irvine Scientific or Sigma. Human foreskin fibroblasts were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (20Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Google Scholar, 21Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Google Scholar, 22Knauer M.F. Crisp R.J. Kridel S.J. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 275-281Google Scholar). The experimental cultures were seeded at 1.0 × 105 cells/well into 24-well plates and grown to confluency in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Before use, the cells were transferred to serum-free medium for 48 h. For fixation of the cells and extracellular matrix, the cells were washed with PBS four times before incubation for 30 min in the presence of 0.25 m NH4OH at room temperature. The extracellular matrix was then rinsed five times with phosphate-buffered saline before use. 125I-Thrombin and125I-urokinase were prepared as described previously using the Iodogen method (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar, 23Knauer D.J. Thompson J.A. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 385-396Google Scholar). Specific activities for125I-thrombin ranged from 8,000 to 15,000 cpm/ng of protein. Specific activities for 125I-urokinase ranged from 5,000 to 10,000 cpm/ng of protein. The purification protocol for PN1 is described in detail elsewhere (24Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Cunningham D.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2176-2181Google Scholar). Briefly, 72 h serum-free conditioned medium was obtained from cultures of human foreskin fibroblast cells grown on microcarrier beads. After the addition of protease inhibitors, the medium was concentrated from 2 liters to 200 ml and recirculated overnight at 4 °C over a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose affinity column. Following a 50-ml wash with PBS, the column was eluted with a 100-ml 0.2–1.0 m linear gradient of NaCl. Fractions containing PN1, as determined by a complex formation assay with thrombin, were pooled and dialyzed exhaustively against PBS to equilibrate the final NaCl concentration at 0.15 m. Samples of the purified and dialyzed PN1 were titrated with active thrombin to determine the percentage of activity. 30 ng of thrombin were added to various amounts of PN1, which were then diluted to a final total volume of 80 μl in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. At the end of a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were chilled on ice for 15 min, followed by the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of Chromozym-Th. The reactions were returned to room temperature for 30 min to allow for color development as a measure of residual thrombin activity. The absorbance measurements were taken at 405 nm to quantify activity colorimetrically. The kinetic measurements were done using a protocol previously described (2Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Google Scholar). Briefly, approximately a 25-fold molar excess PN1 (8 nm) was preincubated with urokinase (0.3 nm) in a final volume of 100 μl of Tyrode's buffer. At the indicated times, the reaction was diluted with Tyrode's buffer to a final volume of 2 ml containing 100 μm Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC, a quenched fluorogenic substrate of urokinase. Urokinase that was not inactivated by PN1 during the preincubation is free to cleave the fluorogenic substrate, providing a quantitative measurement of the amount of active urokinase remaining. The change in relative fluorescence was monitored over a 480-s period with a sampling frequency of 20 s. The samples were excited at 350 nm, and emission was monitored at 450 nm. Thek assoc rates were calculated using the following equation (3Baker J.B. Low D.A. Shimmer R.L. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1980; 21: 37-45Google Scholar).kassoc=−ln[P]t/[P]0[I]·tEquation 1 PN1 elution from a monoclonal antibody column transiently exposes it to a strong acid at pH 3.0 (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). To mimic these conditions, we exposed samples of PN1 purified on a heparin-Sepharose column to 100 mmglycine HCl, pH 3.0, for 1 min, followed by neutralization by the addition of 200 mm NaPO3, pH 7.4. Longer exposure of PN1 to these conditions (15–30 min) resulted in an 80% loss of PN1 inhibitory activity (data not shown). PN1 exposed to acid for 1 min was dialyzed into PBS and then evaluated using the linkage assay described above The protocol for this assay is described in detail elsewhere (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar) and is summarized here. Iodinated protease at 20 nm was incubated with 5 nm PN1 with no collagen type IV or in the presence of increasing concentrations of collagen type IV for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE protein sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were exposed to a Bio-Rad phosphorus imaging screen for 30 min, and the digitized image was prepared using a Bio-Rad GS-250 molecular imager. The methods used to prepare and express recombinant forms of PN1 in a baculovirus-driven protein expression system have been described in detail elsewhere and are briefly summarized here (25Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Google Scholar). The gene for PN1 was subcloned using the following forward and reverse primers to engineer overhanging restriction enzyme sites, SmaI and EcoR1: forward, 5′-GAC CCC GGG ATG AAC TGG CAT CTC CCC-3′, and reverse 5′-GAC GAA TTC TCA TCA GGG TTT GTT TAT CTG CCC C-3′. The PCR product was digested usingEcoRI and SmaI, ligated into the pVL1393 baculovirus shuttle vector, and cotransfected into Sf9 insect cells along with BaculoGold baculovirus. Recombinant viruses were purified by a single round of plaque purification. For protein expression, Sf9 cells grown in T175 flasks were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1. Five to seven days later the medium was harvested, centrifuged to remove dead cells, and concentrated using an Amicon concentrator with a molecular mass cut-off of ∼10 kDa. The PN1 sample was then dialyzed against PBS using dialysis tubing with a cut-off of 12 kDa and further concentrated within the dialysis tubing using Calbiochem Aquacide. The PN1 was finally brought to a concentration similar to the human foreskin fibroblast cell-purified sample, and its activity was assayed as described above. Previous work indicates that in the presence of 1 μm collagen type IV, PN1 was able to form inhibitory complexes with thrombin but became refractory to formation of inhibitory complexes with either plasmin or urokinase (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). To verify this assay, PN1 (5 nm) was incubated with either125I-thrombin (20 nm) or125I-urokinase (20 nm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of collagen type IV, and the amount of complex formation was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At all concentrations of collagen type IV, PN1 was able to form inhibitory complexes with thrombin, a result that is consistent with previous work (Fig. 1 A). However, our results with urokinase disagreed with previous results (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). We show that using PN1 purified according to the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures,” PN1 was able to form inhibitory complexes with urokinase with the same efficiency independent of the presence or absence of the collagen type IV (Fig.1 B). These results conflict with the data presented in the previous study, which demonstrate reduced ability of PN1 to form inhibitory complexes with urokinase in the presence of 1 μm collagen type IV. The experiment was repeated using concentrations up to 100 μm collagen type IV, but PN1 continued to form complexes with urokinase at the same levels as the control that had no collagen type IV (data not shown). To determine whether the commercially available collagen type IV might be inactive and thus account for the disparity in results, we turned to a different protocol using fixed extracellular matrix preparations as a source of collagen type IV. Previous studies by the same group demonstrated that in the presence of collagen type IV-rich extracellular matrix derived from ascorbate-induced fibroblasts, PN1 was also refractory to urokinase and plasmin inhibition (19Wagner S.L. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 611-615Google Scholar). Repeating these protocols exactly gave the same result we obtained with commercially available collagen type IV; no augmentation of PN1 protease target specificity (data not shown). We next pursued a third line of experimentation to resolve the discrepancy in data. Previous work established that the rate of urokinase inhibition by PN1 in the absence of collagen type IV was 1.50 × 10−5m−1s−1 (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). In that study, the presence of 1.0 μm collagen type IV caused a 10-fold decrease in the pseudo-second order rate constant (k assoc) to ∼1.50 × 10−4m−1s−1. To examine the effect of collagen type IV on the rate of inhibitory complex formation, PN1 (5 nm) was incubated with 125I-urokinase (20 nm) in the presence and absence of 1 μm collagen type IV and assayed for complex formation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2, we were unable to detect any difference in the formation of inhibitory complexes between PN1 and urokinase in the presence and absence of 1 μm collagen type IV. At all time points, there are equal amounts of complexes between PN1 and 125I-urokinase independent of the presence or absence of collagen type IV. In an effort to understand the disparity between our data and those previously published, we turned to any potential biochemical differences between the PN1 preparations used in our present studies and those of the published studies (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar, 19Wagner S.L. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 611-615Google Scholar). It came to our attention that the PN1 used in the previous studies on target protease regulation by collagen type IV was purified using a monoclonal antibody column, whereas a heparin affinity column was used to purify PN1 for the present studies. During the elution of PN1 from the monoclonal antibody column, it was transiently exposed to a strong acid at pH 3.0. To test whether this acid exposure resulted in the altered protease specificity of PN1 in the presence of collagen type IV, we exposed a sample of PN1 purified on a heparin-Sepharose column to 100 mm glycine HCl, pH 3.0, for 1 min, followed by neutralization by the addition of 200 mm NaPO3, pH 7.4. Longer exposure of PN1 to these conditions (15–30 min) resulted in an 80% loss of PN1 inhibitory activity (data not shown). PN1 exposed to acid for 1 min was then evaluated using the linkage assay described above. We first conducted a control experiment to assess the ability of the acid-exposed PN1 to form complexes with 125I-thrombin in the presence and absence of collagen type IV. As expected, the data in Fig. 3 A demonstrate no significant difference in the quantity of 125I -thrombin-PN1 complexes formed regardless of the concentration of collagen type IV present. This important control shows, however, that the mere exposure of PN1 to acid does not affect its ability to act as a SERPIN. The acid-exposed PN1 was also able to form complexes with125I-urokinase in the absence of collagen type IV but, importantly, became refractory to complex formation in the presence of increasing concentrations of collagen type IV (Fig. 3 B). A comparison of the data in Figs. 3 B and 1 B clearly shows that the acid exposure of PN1 confers allosteric regulation by collagen IV at the level of protease-inhibitor complex formation. Because we could now reproduce the allosteric regulation of PN1 by collagen type IV after transient acid exposure using a complex formation assay, we proceeded to a more quantitative assessment of the kinetics of the inhibitory reaction between PN1 and urokinase using a fluorometric substrate approach (26Knauer D.J. Majumdar D. Fong P.-C. Knauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37340-37346Google Scholar). We took this approach for two reasons. First, in the previous studies that demonstrated the allosteric regulation of PN1 by collagen type IV, a similar substrate cleavage assay was employed. Secondly, the suicide-substrate mechanism can be broken down into discrete steps as shown below (32Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1992; 6: 1393-1408Google Scholar).MECHANISM1The inhibition of the protease occurs as an early step in the reaction and corresponds to the measured k assoc. The completion of the reaction and thus the formation of the covalently linked complex, IP*cpx, which is measured in the linkage assay, occurs more slowly. Transient exposure of PN1 to acid allowed us to reproduce the results of the linkage assay from the previous report, but this could result from two different steps in the reaction mechanism: either at the step of association between the inhibitor and the protease or at the step of procession to the acyl-linked end product (2Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Google Scholar). At submicromolar concentrations of reactants, a simple equation (Equation 1) provides a good measure of the association rate between PN1 and its target proteases (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). Urokinase (0.3 nm) was incubated with PN1 (8.1 nm) for the indicated times at 37 °C in the presence and absence of collagen type IV, and residual urokinase activity was assayed by using a quenched fluorogenic urokinase substrate, Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Substrate cleavage progression curves for urokinase preincubated with PN1 from 2 to 20 min were measured using the quenched fluorogenic urokinase substrate as described above. Thek assoc rates for PN1 and urokinase were nearly identical in the absence and presence of collagen type IV, 2.13 × 105m−1 s−1 ± 0.12 and 2.04 × 105m−1s−1 ± 0.16, respectively (progression curve data not shown; the k assoc values are in TableI). These results are in close agreement with previously published values (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar, 3Baker J.B. Low D.A. Shimmer R.L. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1980; 21: 37-45Google Scholar). The same experiment was done after PN1 was transiently exposed to acidic conditions. Thek assoc rate in the absence of collagen type IV was not changed significantly, 2.16 × 105m−1 s−1 ± 0.22. In contrast, the inclusion of collagen type IV in the reaction containing acid-exposed PN1 markedly slowed the k assoc rate by a factor of nearly 10, 2.83 × 104m−1s−1 ± 0.21 (progression curve data not shown; thek assoc values are in Table I). This magnitude of decrease is very close to the previously published report demonstrating the allosteric regulation of PN1 by collagen type IV (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar).Table IRate of association (kassoc) between PN1 and urokinasek assoc(M−1s−1)Fibroblast-secreted PN1, purified using monoclonal antibodyNo collagen type IV1.5 × 105 (Ref. 1Donovan F.M.

Open table in a new tab Summary of kinetic data between PN1 and urokinase using a quenched fluorogenic substrate of urokinase, Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC. The rate of association (k assoc) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reported is thek assoc between PN1 and urokinase in the absence and presence of 1 μM collagen type IV. Samples of PN1 that were transiently exposed to acidic conditions are indicated. The potential biological significance of this data is best appreciated by the V/V 0 plot shown in Fig.4. This is a plot of the data used to obtain the k assoc values and shows the fraction of active urokinase remaining at times after the addition of PN1. The fraction of active urokinase is reduced by 50% in the presence of native PN1 and acid-exposed PN1 in as little as 7 min. In contrast, urokinase activity was still above 80% after 30 min of incubation with acid-exposed PN1 in the presence of collagen Type IV. Finally, these kinetic data also demonstrate that the effect of collagen type IV on the acid-exposed PN1 is manifest early in the mechanism of the inhibitory reaction, at the level of k assoc. Because the native PN1 used in the present study was purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, we wanted to rule out the possibility that the absence of allosteric regulation by collagen type IV might be the explained by a heparin-induced “conformational lock” of the PN1 during purification. The approach we used was expression of PN1 in Sf9 insect cells to high levels, followed by concentration of the medium that contained the secreted PN1 as previously described (25Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Google Scholar). The rationale behind this approach was that the PN1 would not be exposed to either a heparin purification step or an acid exposure under these conditions. It should also be noted that the insect cell culture medium does not contain heparin or collagen type IV. Sf9 cells were induced to generate recombinant PN1 through baculovirus infection, and medium was collected and concentrated to use in the collagen type IV assays. Control experiments indicated that there was no significant biochemical or kinetic difference between the baculovirus-expressed PN1 samples and the fibroblast-secreted PN1 that was purified using the heparin-Sepharose column protocol (data not shown). We first examined the effect of transient acidification on the baculovirus-expressed PN1 using the linkage assay.125I-Thrombin and 125I-urokinase were incubated with transiently acidified baculovirus-expressed PN1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of collagen type IV (Fig.5). As expected, PN1 was able to form inhibitory complexes with thrombin at the same quantitative level independent of the presence of collagen type IV (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, the acid-exposed PN1 became refractory to formation of inhibitory complexes with urokinase in the presence of increasing concentrations of collagen type IV (Fig. 5 B). The magnitude of the collagen-induced decrease in linkage formation was nearly identical to that seen in Fig. 3 B using PN1 purified on heparin-Sepharose. These data clearly rule out the possibility that purification on heparin-Sepharose accounts for the lack of allosteric regulation of PN1 by collagen type IV and strongly support our contention that the observed regulation is conferred by transient acid exposure. A quantitative evaluation of the kinetics of inhibition was next done using the fluorogenic substrate assay described earlier. As expected by the results of the linkage assay, the allosteric regulation of the acidified PN1 by collagen type IV occurs at the level of the protease inhibitor association rate. The calculatedk assoc rate of 2.2 × 105m−1 s−1 ± 0.14 for baculovirus PN1 transiently exposed to acid (Fig.6 A) is in good agreement with the k assoc rate obtained for native PN1 affinity purified using heparin (Table I). Similarly, the reduction of thek assoc rate for the transiently acidified PN1 in the presence of collagen type IV (Fig. 6 B), 2.75 × 104m−1 s−1 ± 0.49, is in close agreement the k assoc rate obtained for heparin purified PN1 in the presence of collagen type IV after transient acid exposure (Table I). Also included in Table I are thek assoc rates for urokinase and untreated baculovirus-expressed PN1 for comparison. The progression curves used to obtain the values are not shown. The physiological role of PN1 in biological processes that are driven by proteases depends on three primary factors: protease specificity, protease affinity, and the site of localization. Protease specificity and affinity are closely related and have the additional complication that they may be augmented by other biological molecules depending on the location. A clear example of this is the inhibition of thrombin by PN1, which is accelerated to a diffusion-limited rate in the presence of heparin found in high concentrations in the extracellular matrix (2Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Google Scholar). What remains unclear, however, is what percentage of PN1 in a tissue is bound to heparin versusthat which is free in solution. It is also not clear whether heparin is the only extracellular matrix molecule that may sequester PN1 and augment its activity. It was originally reported that the specificity of PN1 was allosterically regulated by binding to components in the extracellular matrix of human fibroblasts (19Wagner S.L. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 611-615Google Scholar). In those studies it was shown that matrix-bound PN1 was a potent thrombin inhibitor but became refractory as an inhibitor of urokinase and plasmin (19Wagner S.L. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 611-615Google Scholar). Subsequent studies identified collagen type IV in the matrix as the molecule responsible for the allosteric regulation of PN1 (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). As previously reported, this apparent regulation is manifest in a lowering of thek assoc between PN1 and urokinase from 1.5 × 105m−1 s−1 to 1.5 × 104m−1s−1 (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). This is a very important concept as to how the biological functions of PN1 are perceived. This apparent loss of inhibitory activity toward urokinase and plasmin in the extracellular matrix would suggest a less important role for PN1 in the regulation of cell migration, in matrix turnover, and in the overall process of tissue development and remodeling where urokinase and plasmin are involved. The results of the present studies demonstrate that in fact the inhibitory activity of PN1 toward urokinase is not altered by binding to collagen type IV under normal physiological conditions and reaffirm the potentially important role for PN1 in processes where the proteolytic activity of urokinase is involved. The original goal of the present study was to identify the domain in PN1 that mediates binding to collagen type IV and to understand the mechanism underlying the allosteric regulation. Our inability to reproduce the original results demonstrating the allosteric regulation of PN1 by collagen type IV led to a re-examination of every component of the experimental system including protein sources and purification procedures. The PN1 used in the previous studies on PN1-collagen interactions was affinity purified using a monoclonal antibody column and eluted with transient exposure to low pH (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar, 19Wagner S.L. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 611-615Google Scholar). The PN1 used in the present studies, however, was purified by heparin-Sepharose chromatography and eluted with 0.6 m NaCl (24Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Cunningham D.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2176-2181Google Scholar). Three independent lines of evidence obtained in the present studies demonstrate that the transient exposure of PN1 to acid pH is required for allosteric regulation by collagen type IV. First, a 1-min acid exposure of PN1 purified on heparin-Sepharose, which was unaffected by the addition of collagen type IV prior to acid exposure, conferred the ability of the PN1 to be allosterically regulated by collagen type IV. This was determined using the same linkage assay previously described, and the collagen dose-response curves were nearly identical to those previously published (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). Second, in kinetic assays using a quenched fluorogenic peptide substrate, we determined quantitatively that the effect of the collagen type IV on the inhibition of urokinase by PN1 was due to a decrease in the association rate. This was also shown in the previous studies, and the rate constants we determined were nearly identical to theirs (1Donovan F.M. Vaughan P.J. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Google Scholar). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we show that purification of PN1 using heparin-Sepharose does not play a role in the PN1-collagen type IV interactions. To remove the possibility that exposure to immobilized heparin during our purification protocol imposes a “conformational lock” on PN1 that is removed by acid exposure, we obtained the same data in experiments using recombinantly expressed PN1 that had never been subjected to purification. These three lines of evidence provide compelling support for the idea that indeed it is the acid exposure of PN1 that confers susceptibility to collagen type IV allosteric regulation. This study does not rule out the possibility that the allosteric regulation of PN1 by collagen type IV might occur under specific sets of circumstance in vivo. PN1 is abundantly produced by kidney tubule epithelial cells, where it is exposed to the acid content of urine (27Wagner S.N. Atkinson M.J. Wagner C. Hofler H. Schmitt M. Wilhelm O. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 105: 53-60Google Scholar). In addition, little is known about extracellular changes in pH during ischemia in neuronal tissue where PN1 is also very abundant (3Baker J.B. Low D.A. Shimmer R.L. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1980; 21: 37-45Google Scholar, 4Rosenblatt D.E. Cotman C.W. Nieto-Sampedro M. Rowe J.W. Knauer D.J. Brain Res. 1987; 415: 40-48Google Scholar). It may also be that the exposure of PN1 to acidic conditions mediates a conformational change in PN1 normally mediated by another component of the extracellular matrix, although no such components have been described. The present studies do suggest that under most physiological circumstances PN1 is a potent inhibitor of urokinase and plasmin and not subject to allosteric regulation by collagen type IV. Because PN1 is known to be concentrated at the cell surface by binding to heparin sulfate proteoglycans and the action of urokinase bound to the urokinase receptor is directly tied to cell migration in certain cell types (28Okada S.S. Tomaszewski J.E. Barnathan E.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 180-187Google Scholar, 29Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Google Scholar, 30Pepper M.S. Sappino A.P. Stocklin R. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 673-684Google Scholar, 31Gyetko M.R. Toddi R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1380-1387Google Scholar), the role of PN1 in the regulation of this process could be crucial. PN1 should once again be considered as a potentially important factor in cellular processes in which the proteolytic activity of urokinase and plasmin play a role.

https://openalex.org/W2073926702,"In several filarial genera the first stage larvae (microfilariae) are enclosed by an eggshell-derived sheath that provides a major interface between the parasite and the host immune system. Analysis of the polypeptide constituents of the microfilarial sheath from the cotton rat filaria <i>Litomosoides sigmodontis</i>identified two abundant surface glycoproteins: Shp3a and Shp3. The corresponding genes and the orthologues of the human parasite<i>Brugia malayi</i> and the rodent filaria <i>Brugia pahangi</i> were cloned and sequenced. They encode secreted, mucin-like proteins with N-terminal Ser/Thr-rich repeats and a C-terminal anchor domain rich in aromatic amino acids. About 75% of the protein molecular masses result from post-translational modifications. The Ser/Thr-rich motifs are supposed to serve as targets for dimethylaminoethanol-phosphate substitutions. These modifications were detected only on the sheaths of the late developmental stage of stretched microfilariae, corresponding with the expression of the proteins in the epithelium of the distal part of the uterus and the specific transcription of <i>shp3</i> and<i>shp3a</i> in the anterior female worm segment. Genomic analysis of all three species demonstrated a conserved linkage of the two genes. Their transcripts undergo <i>cis</i>- and<i>trans</i>-splicing. The transcription start sites of the primary transcripts were determined for the <i>L. sigmodontis</i>genes. The core promoter regions are remarkably conserved between the paralogue genes <i>Ls</i>-<i>shp3a</i> and<i>Ls</i>-<i>shp3</i> and their orthologues in<i>Brugia</i>, implicating conserved regulatory elements."

Interleukin (IL)-1 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; sIL1R-II, soluble type II IL-1 receptor; IL1R-I, type I IL-1 receptor; IL-1ra, IL-1 receptor antagonist; AcP, accessory protein; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; Cα RMSD, root mean square deviation of the α carbon positions is a multi-functional proinflammatory cytokine that mediates innate and adaptive immune responses in multiple cell types. It is believed to play a role in numerous diseases including arthritis, asthma/allergy, osteoporosis, and stroke (see Ref. 1Dinarello C.A. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 457-499Google Scholar for review). The IL-1 family actually consists of two proteins with similar biological activity, IL-1α and IL-1β, as well as a nonsignaling ligand termed the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) (see Ref. 2Auron P.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 3–4: 221-237Google Scholar for review). All three proteins exhibit a similar tertiary structure comprised of 12 β strands that make up a barrel-shaped β-trefoil with pseudo-3-fold symmetry (3Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 531-543Google Scholar). IL-1β is thought to be the primary circulating cytokine that mediates the systemic effects of IL-1. IL-1 exerts its biological action by binding and activating the membrane-associated IL1R-I (4Sims J.E. Gayle M.A. Slack J.L. Alderson M.R. Bird T.A. Giri J.G. Colotta F. Re F. Mantovani A. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K.H. Dower S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6155-6159Google Scholar). A second receptor, termed the IL-1R accessory protein (AcP), is not involved in direct ligand binding but is required for IL-1 signal transduction by complexing with IL-1 and the IL1R-I (5Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A. Ju G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13757-13765Google Scholar). IL1R-I and AcP both contain extracellular portions with three Ig-like domains and cytoplasmic portions containing conserved signaling motifs (6Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 508-514Google Scholar). A third IL-1 receptor exists termed the type II IL-1R (IL1R-II) that has a extracellular structure similar to that of IL1R-I and AcP but that contains a truncated cytoplasmic tail incapable of signaling. This receptor acts as a decoy by binding IL-1 with high affinity and neutralizing its activity (7Colotta F. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Mantovani A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 562-566Google Scholar). IL1R-II can also be proteolytically cleaved, which releases the extracellular domain from the cell surface. This creates a soluble form of the receptor (sIL1R-II) that possesses high affinity for IL-1β, but only low affinity for IL-1α, and virtually no affinity for IL-1ra. For this reason, sIL1R-II is considered an ideal antagonist of the IL-1 system (8Mantovani A. Locati M. Vecchi A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 328-336Google Scholar). Animal models and ex vivo studies with human cells have demonstrated that sIL1R-II may be useful as a therapeutic agent (9Bessis N. Guery L. Mantovani A. Vecchi A. Sims J.E. Fradelizi D. Boissier M.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 867-875Google Scholar,10Attur M.G. Dave M.N. Leung M.Y. Cipolletta C. Meseck M. Woo S.L. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2001-2010Google Scholar), and recombinant human sIL1R-II is being developed as a therapeutic for inflammatory disease. Preclinical studies have been undertaken to evaluate the toxicologic and pharmacokinetic effects of this receptor in nonhuman primates. Among these have been the examination of the interaction between cynomolgus and rhesus monkey IL-1 and human sIL1R-II. Surprisingly, we found that monkey IL-1β lacks the sIL1R-II binding ability of human IL-1β. A structural and mutational analysis revealed this to be due to a single amino acid difference between the two cytokines. IL-1α and IL-1β genes were cloned from cynomolgus monkey by reverse transcription-PCR using sequences previously deposited into GenBankTM (accession numbers AB000553 and D63353, respectively). Primers were designed to amplify a cDNA corresponding to the predicted (based on analogy to the human sequence) mature form of each IL-1. The products were amplified from cDNA from cynomolgus primary cells isolated from whole blood (kindly provided by Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Everett, Washington). Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood by density centrifugation. T cells were removed by rosetting with 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide (AET)-treated sheep erythrocytes and further density centrifugation. The cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum and were incubated for 3.5 h in lipopolysaccharide and human CD40L (both at 1 μg/ml), and total RNA was extracted and used for cDNA synthesis. The sequence of rhesus monkey IL-1β was also present in GenBankTM (accession number MMU19845). The predicted mature protein sequences for cynomolgus and rhesus IL-1β are identical except for the presence of an additional serine at the C terminus of rhesus IL-1β. The IL1R-II gene was amplified by PCR from either activated cynomolgus PBMC cDNA (described above) or cDNA made from total RNA extracted from a rhesus monkey tonsil biopsy (tissue kindly provided by Tom McVittie of the University of Maryland). PCR primers were derived from the publicly available IL1R-II sequence from the African green monkey (accession number U64092). For all cDNAs, multiple PCR products or subclones were sequenced from each species to obtain consensus sequences free of PCR-introduced errors. Cynomolgus and rhesus IL-1β proteins were expressed from cDNAs corresponding to the predicted mature portion of the cytokines (amino acids 117–268 and 117–269, respectively). A construct for expression of cynomolgus IL-1α was also made using the predicted mature portion of this cytokine (amino acids 113–271). All of the IL-1 constructs were cloned in a mammalian expression vector (pDC409) (11Giri J.G. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Friend D.J. Loomis A. Shanebeck K. DuBose R. Cosman D. Park L.S. Anderson D.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3654-3663Google Scholar) and were engineered with a heterologous initiating methionine to drive translation of the open reading frame. Cynomolgus and rhesus IL1R-II sequences were found to be identical at the amino acid level. Soluble rhesus IL1R-II was expressed from a cDNA encoding amino acids 1–346 (C terminus indicated in Fig. 1). The sequence was cloned in the 2a5ib plasmid (12Morris A.E. Lee C.C. Hodges K. Aldrich T.L. Krantz Smidt P.S. Thomas J.N. Animal Cell Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1997: 529-534Google Scholar) for stable expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Monkey IL-1s were expressed in COS1 cells (ATCC identification number CRL-1650) for 1 week (grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum) following transfection with DEAE-dextran. The IL-1s were purified from culture medium using human sIL1R-I covalently attached to Affi-Gel-10 resin (Bio-Rad). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and pure fractions were pooled and dialyzed into PBS, and concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Rhesus sIL1R-II was affinity-purified using human IL-1β covalently attached to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad). Pure elution fractions were pooled and dialyzed into PBS, and concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. For expression in E. coli, cynomolgus or human mature IL-1β was cloned in pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) with an N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase fusion. A Factor Xa cleavage recognition sequence was integrated upstream of the first amino acid of IL-1β. Glutathione S-transferase proteins from E. colilysates (strain DH10B) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) and cleaved on-column with Factor Xa (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cleaved IL-1β was eluted with PBS, and the Factor Xa was removed with affinity agarose (Novagen). Purified IL-1 proteins were dialyzed against PBS and quantitated by the BCA method (Pierce). Human sIL1R-II (at 50 ng/ml) was bound to immobilized M25 antibody (a non-neutralizing anti-IL1R-II Ab) on Maxisorp 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Similarly, rhesus sIL1R-II protein (at 100 ng/ml) was captured on plates with immobilized M3 antibody (a non-neutralizing antibody that binds rhesus IL1R-II). Human IL-1β (R & D Systems) that had been biotin-conjugated was added to the plate at 10 ng/ml in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor IL-1 from different sources. Bound IL-1 was detected and quantitated using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 667 ng/ml followed by the addition of a peroxidase substrate/chromogen solution (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, MD). Color development was arrested with phosphoric acid (1 m), and the optical density values were determined using a spectrophotometer plate reader. Human type II IL-1R protein was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified as described for rhesus IL1R-II. M3 and M25 anti-human IL1R-II antibodies were produced at Immunex. All of the samples were diluted in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. 1 × 106 COS1 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmid for human or cynomolgus mature IL-1β using DEAE-dextran. After 48 h the cells were placed in Cys- and Met-free medium for 45 min and then metabolically labeled for 6 h at 37 °C using 1 ml of medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences). The media containing the labeled cytokines were collected and spun for 10 min at 12,000 rpm to pellet cells and debris. The labeled media were precleared with protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 750 μl was used in a binding reaction with 2 μg of soluble recombinant receptor protein (either human IL1R-1-Fc or untagged human or monkey sIL1R-II), 4 μg of M3 anti-human IL1R-II antibody for the sIL1R-II-containing reactions, and 100 μl of a 1:1 suspension of protein G-agarose:PBS. Human type I IL-1R-Fc fusion was expressed in COS1 cells and purified by protein A affinity chromatography. The no-receptor control reactions were precleared but incubated in the absence of any receptor, antibody, or protein G-agarose. The samples were incubated overnight with rotation at 4 °C and then washed three times with RIPA buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). The agarose beads were resuspended in 50 μl of protein sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, vortexed, and boiled for 5 min. For SDS-PAGE analysis of the binding reactions, 20 μl was loaded onto 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, treated with Amplify (AmershamBiosciences), and exposed to autoradiograph film. E. coli-produced human and cynomolgus IL-1β proteins were used for all assays. A375 human melanoma cells were obtained from ATCC (identification number CRL-1872) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). The cells were added to 96-well tissue culture plates at 1 × 104 cells/well in the presence or absence of IL-1. The cells were grown for 72 h and then washed with PBS and stained for 4–6 h with Alamar Blue (a fluorescent metabolic indicator from BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). Fluorescence units were measured using a SPECTRAFluor fluorescent plate reader (560 nm excitation, 595 nm emission) (Tecan, Research Triangle, NC). For the experiments designed to measure sIL1R-II inhibition of IL-1 bioactivity, human affinity-purified sIL1R-II was added to the cells immediately prior to IL-1 addition, and the culture was grown and analyzed as described. The human type II IL-1 receptor model was built using Modeler (13Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Google Scholar) based on Protein Data Bank (14Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) entries1itb chain B (15Vigers G.P. Anderson L.J. Caffes P. Brandhuber B.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 190-200Google Scholar) and 1ira chain Y (16Schreuder H. Tardif C. Trump-Kallmeyer S. Soffientini A. Sarubbi E. Akeson A. Bowlin T. Yanofsky S. Barrett R.W. Nature. 1997; 386: 194-200Google Scholar). Multiple structures were calculated to cover conformational space. After removing outliers, six structures remained and were shown to represent conformational space. They formed a structural ensemble with a Cα RMSD of 6.87 Å. From this ensemble a representative structure was chosen with a 1.68 Å Cα RMSD from mean ensemble structure. The monkey IL-1β structure was modeled based on Protein Data Bank entries 1hib (17Camacho N.P. Smith D.R. Goldman A. Schneider B. Green D. Young P.R. Berman H.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8749-8757Google Scholar), 1iob (18Shaanan B. Gronenborn A.M. Cohen G.H. Gilliland G.L. Veerapandian B. Davies D.R. Clore G.M. Science. 1992; 257: 961-964Google Scholar), 21bi, 31bi, and 41bi (19Veerapandian B. Gilliland G.L. Raag R. Svensson A.L. Masui Y. Hirai Y. Poulos T.L. Proteins. 1992; 12: 10-23Google Scholar). Ten initial structures were built and evaluated for errors; all were found suitable for inclusion in the structure ensemble, with Cα RMSD of 0.25 Å. The representative structure chosen was 0.11 Å Cα RMSD from the mean structure. Human IL-1β was taken from the crystal structure 1itb chain A, which has a resolution of 2.5 Å. Because no IL1R-II·IL-1β complex crystal structure existed, the human and monkey IL-1β structures were docked onto human IL1R-II using Protein Data Bank identification number 1itb as a template (1itbis a complex of type I IL-1 receptor with IL-1β). First, IL1R-II was aligned and superimposed with IL1R-I, after which the IL1R-I chain was deleted. This produced a model of human IL-1β complexed with human IL1R-II. Next, monkey IL-1β was aligned and superimposed to human IL-1β, after which the human IL-1β chain was deleted. This produced a model of monkey IL-1β complexed with human IL1R-II. Surface electrostatic differences were then calculated between human and monkey IL-1β using the Molecular Operating Environment from the Chemical Computing Group (Montreal, Canada). The surface electrostatics were calculated on IL-1β only in the presence of IL1R-II using an interior dielectric of 5, an exterior dielectric of 80, and 0 salt concentration. Site-directed mutagenesis of human and monkey IL-1β was performed using the QuikChange XL system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Human and cynomolgus wild type IL-1β glutathione S-transferase fusions were used as parental constructs into which all changes were introduced. A naturalHindIII site adjacent to amino acids 13 and 15 provided a means for readily screening the correct recombinants. Mutant IL-1β proteins were subsequently expressed and purified from E. coli as described above. The affinities were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C with a research grade CM5 sensor chip (Biacore). A capture system was employed with ∼8800 response units of goat anti-human IgG, Fc γ chain-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) immobilized using standard amine-coupling chemistry. Immobilized capture antibody alone was used as a reference surface. Ig fusions of human and rhesus soluble IL-1 receptors were expressed by transient transfection of COS cells and purified by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose. IL1R-I-Fc at 1 μg/ml or IL1R-II-Fc at 2 μg/ml in HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4; Biacore) with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was injected over the immobilized antibody surface at 10 μl/min for 2 min to obtain a density of ∼200 response units. Recombinant IL-1β (Amgen) in HBS-EP with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was injected over both the receptor and reference surfaces at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 times the K D down to 0.1 times theK D at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Duplicate injections of each sample and triplicate injections of a buffer blank were injected in random order. Most IL-1β·IL-1R complexes were allowed to associate for 2–3 min, and IL-1β completely dissociated within 5 min. Complexes with slow off-rates associated for 5 min and dissociated for 30 min before regeneration with a single 30-s injection of 10 mm glycine HCl, pH 1.5, at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The saturation maximum response (R max) was ∼30 response units for all combinations. The data were fit globally to a simple 1:1 interaction model with local R max or with a steady state model using BIAEvaluation 3.1 Software. To determine sIL1R-II binding by monkey IL-1 in in vitro assays, the cDNAs for cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), IL-1β and IL1R-II were cloned and expressed. Sequences for both of these Old World monkey IL-1β cDNAs were previously published (20Totsuka K. Takakura H. Hashimoto O. Tatsumi M. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1998; 116: 40-48Google Scholar,21Villinger F. Brar S.S. Mayne A. Chikkala N. Ansari A.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3946-3954Google Scholar) and were available from GenBankTM (accession numbersD63353 and MMU19845). The cynomolgus IL-1β cDNA was obtained from activated PBMCs and was found to have two nucleotide substitutions relative to the publicly available cynomolgus sequence (accession number D63353). One is a silent change at nucleotide position 240 (the A of ATG = 1), and the other, at position 389, results in a Ser to Asn change at amino acid 130 (indicated on Fig.1). Cynomolgus IL-1β is 96% identical to human IL-1β. The rhesus IL-1β protein sequence (accession number MMU19845) is identical to that of cynomolgus except that it is one amino acid longer at the C terminus. IL-1α was also cloned from cynomolgus monkey, and the cDNA corresponding to the mature portion of the protein (amino acids 113–271) matched the previously published monkey sequence (accession number AB000553) exactly. Monkey IL-1s were expressed in COS cells and used in the form of conditioned medium. Despite the lack of either a signal peptide or prodomain, the IL-1 proteins were exported into the COS1 culture medium (see Fig. 3). Alternatively, the IL-1 proteins were expressed in E. colias cleavable glutathione S-transferase fusions, and the cleaved forms were purified. Unlike the case with IL-1β, there was no sequence publicly available for rhesus or cynomolgus type II IL-1R. Nonetheless, the use of PCR primers based on the African green monkey type II IL-1 receptor allowed us to clone the monkey cDNAs. The sequences of the proteins were found to be 95.6% identical to the human (Fig. 1) and completely identical between the two primates. Therefore, a single “monkey” IL1R-II was utilized for binding and functional assays. Soluble monkey IL1R-II was expressed and purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells as an untagged protein. Although not utilized in these studies, we also cloned the IL1R-II gene from African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) and found that there were numerous differences between the DNA sequence we obtained and the previously published sequence (22Liu C. Hart R.P. Liu X.-J. Clevenger W. Maki R.A. De Souza E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20965-20972Google Scholar) (accession number U64092). These discrepancies corresponded to eight amino acid changes. The African green monkey amino acid sequence that we obtained is identical to cynomolgus, rhesus, and human IL1R-II at each of the eight sites. To compare the ability of human and monkey IL-1 to bind soluble IL1R-II, a plate binding assay was developed. As shown in Fig. 2, all three sources of recombinant human IL-1β tested were able to bind in a comparable manner to either human or monkey sIL1R-II. Surprisingly, cynomolgus IL-1β bound poorly to both human and monkey sIL1R-II. This was true when using purified protein (from E. coli) as well as unpurified protein in the form of COS supernatants. The same result was obtained with the rhesus IL-1β that differs from cynomolgus by only a single amino acid. These experiments were performed across a wide range of immobilized receptor and ligand concentrations with similar results (not shown). Additionally, cynomolgus IL-1α was tested in the form of COS supernatants at several dilutions and also found to be unable to bind monkey or human sIL1R-II (not shown). To address the possibility that receptor immobilization could be affecting the results, we performed a solution binding experiment. Radiolabeled IL-1s were incubated with recombinant soluble receptor proteins. Receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The presence of a correctly sized IL-1β band in lanes representing precipitated receptor indicated a productive receptor-ligand interaction. For these experiments cynomolgus IL-1β was used because the single amino acid difference between the cynomolgus and rhesus proteins did not appear to affect receptor binding in the plate binding assay. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3 and are consistent with the plate binding results. No band is observed when the control supernatants are incubated with human sIL1R-II; however, human IL-1β but not cynomolgus IL-1β is detected in the immunoprecipitated human sIL1R-II reaction. Similarly, when using monkey sIL1R-II, it is only the human IL-1β that exhibits detectable binding to the precipitated receptor. Both human and monkey IL-1 appear to bind human IL1R-1. These results are independent of receptor immobilization or IL-1 purification and support the initial observation that monkey IL-1β does not bind well to sIL1R-II. It does appear, however, that monkey IL-1β is capable of binding human IL1R-I. The results from the soluble receptor binding experiment indicated that cynomolgus IL-1β is capable of binding human IL1R-I. Human and cynomolgus IL-1β were used in an anti-proliferation cell assay to determine the biological activity of cynomolgus IL-1β as well as to establish a cell-based system for better understanding the interaction, or lack thereof, between sIL1R-II and monkey IL-1β. A375 human melanoma cell proliferation is inhibited in this assay by IL-1 through an IL-1R-dependent mechanism (23Itoh S. Hattori T. Hayashi H. Mizutani Y. Todo M. Takii T. Yang D. Lee J.C. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Chiba T. Onozaki K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7434-7440Google Scholar). The number of viable cells following culture in the presence of IL-1 correlates inversely with increasing amounts of IL-1 bioactivity. Purified recombinant human and cynomolgus IL-1β were titrated in the assay to determine their relative level of bioactivity. As seen in Fig.4, introduction of both human and monkey IL-1β at 2.5 and 5 ng/ml, respectively, resulted in a significant inhibition of A375 proliferation, indicating that both cytokines were active. Further dilution of the IL-1s resulted in a corresponding reduction in this activity that was nearly identical between the two cytokines. The calculated IC50 values (defined as the concentration of IL-1 at which approximately a 50% reduction in the number of viable cells occurs) are 0.068 and 0.063 ng/ml for the human and cynomolgus cytokines, respectively. This result indicates that the recombinant human and monkey IL-1βs are active and have nearly equivalent levels of activity through the human type I IL-1R. The results presented so far suggest that because human but not monkey IL-1β is capable of binding human and monkey type II IL-1R, the difference must be accounted for by sequence differences in the IL-1β molecules. To understand this better, we generated a three-dimensional model (Fig. 5) of the interaction between IL-1β and IL1R-II based upon the published crystal structure of the IL-1β/IL1R-I interaction (15Vigers G.P. Anderson L.J. Caffes P. Brandhuber B.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 190-200Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The six amino acid differences between the human and monkey IL-1β proteins (highlighted on the alignment in Fig. 1) were identified in the model and analyzed for potential receptor contacts. Four of the amino acids, which differ between the species (Asn7, Ser13, Gln15, and Met36; the reference was the human sequence), showed solvent accessibility differences and were predicted to make contact with the receptor. The Met/Leu change at position 36 is a conservative change because both amino acids are hydrophobic and differ little in size. The Asn to His change at position 7 does not appear to affect the surface electrostatics significantly. In contrast, the Ser to Ala change at position 13 and the Gln to Leu change at position 15 are both polar to nonpolar changes with partial charge differences that induce surface electrostatic differences. Serine 13 lies on the edge of the receptor-interacting region and was calculated to be within a distance of 4.5 Å or less of only one IL1R-II residue. Glutamine 15 lies in close proximity to the receptor and is within 4.5 Å of seven receptor residues. This analysis led to the hypothesis that these two sites are the most likely to influence IL-1β binding to the IL1R-II and, of the two, the Gln15 site may play the more significant role because it is in contact with more receptor residues. To test the hypothesis derived from the structural modeling, we used site-directed mutagenesis to exchange amino acids 13 and 15 between human and monkey IL-1β. We wanted to determine whether human IL-1β could lose affinity for sIL1R-II when the monkey amino acids are introduced and, conversely, whether monkey IL-1β will acquire sIL1R-II-binding ability when the human amino acids are introduced. Both single and double amino acid changes were made in each IL-1β. The mutant IL-1s were first examined in the A375 biological assay to test for inhibition by sIL-1R-II. Initially, titrations of each IL-1 were carried out in the absence of sIL1R-II to determine whether or not they still retained activity and to identify active doses still below saturating concentrations (not shown). Interestingly the Ser to Ala change at position 13 diminished the potency of human IL-1β by ∼70% relative to the wild type. Similarly, the Ala to Ser change at the same site in monkey IL-1β caused a 15% reduction in activity. The Gln to Leu changes at position 15 and the 13/15 double mutants behaved differently with respect to IL-1 activity. The monkey IL-1β with Gln15 and the monkey double mutant were both ∼50% more active. The human IL-1β was 80% less active when the glutamine was changed to leucine. Despite these effects on bioactivity, all of the IL-1β mutants were still active and therefore capable of binding and signaling through the type I IL-1R. The A375 biological assay was repeated using doses of each IL-1β identified as being submaximal, to which increasing amounts of soluble human IL1R-II was added. Forms of IL-1β able to become neutralized by the type II receptor were apparent as a reduction in bioactivity in the presence of soluble receptor. The results are shown in Fig.6. Whereas the wild type and Ser to Ala mutant of human IL-1β were both still inhibitable by soluble type II receptor, the single Gln to Leu mutation and the double mutation both abolished this inhibition, even at the highest dose of soluble receptor. Conversely, wild type monkey IL-1β or the Ala to Ser mutant were both still recalcitrant to sIL-1R-II inhibition. However, the single Leu to Gln change or the double mutant containing this change both bestowed the ability to become inhibited by sIL1R-II. The results clearly demonstrate that the glutamine at position 15 in mature human IL-1β is essential for neutralization by sIL1R-II. To demonstrate that the effects of the position 15 IL-1β mutations on sIL1R-II inhibition were related to binding affinity, we performed Biacore-ba"
